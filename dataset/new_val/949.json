' brian mcguinness of starwood 's specialty select brands said in a press release tuesday . the 3-foot tall robot , made by the firm savioke , features a smart vinyl collar and even a name tag . while running everything from razors to mail to aloft guests , a.l.o. moves at a fast clip of up to 4mph . meanwhile , savioke says it manuevers through elevators and communicates easily with guests and staff . ` all of us at savioke have seen the look of delight on those guests who receive a room delivery from a robot , ' said steve cousins , ceo of savioke . starwood and savioke hope to use the robot as a way to funnel existing human staff toward more sensitive tasks rather than a death knell for bellhops . with the delivery complete , the robot then asks for a review . if the guest inputs a positive remark on the built-in screen , the robot does a happy dance . zippy : the botlr debuted tuesday at aloft 's cupertino location , where it will zip up and down elevators to deliver amenities to any of the 150 guestrooms in three minutes or less . the accomplished drone then zips back to the elevator , sends a message instead of hitting the down button and returns to the lobby where it plugs itself in and awaits a new task . so how exactly will guests experience a.l.o. ? according to the new york times , the robot will arrive to guests ' doors soon after they put in a request and will automatically place a call to the room instead of knocking . when the robot 's sensors indicate the door has opened , it lifts its storage bin lid to reveal the requested item . a.l.o. 's official start date is august 20 . the company hopes to roll out more botlrs soon thereafter . stiff competition : starwood says its new robot has the work ethic of wall-e and the likeability of r2d2 .", "summary": " the botlr -- short for robot butler -- debuted at the cupertino , california aloft hotel on tuesday .   named a.l.o , the robot comes dressed in a vinyl collar and wears a nametag as it ferried amenities to guest rooms .   a.l.o. is the hotel industry 's first automated bellhop .
