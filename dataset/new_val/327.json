{"text": "back in september , mr dromey also favourited a link to a tweet on a similar theme . labour frontbencher jack dromey was left red-faced after it emerged he added a twitter link to a gay porn website to his list of ` favourites ' . the shadow policing minister - who is married to labour deputy leader , harriet harman - linked to a tweet about well-endowed black men . the link showed a picture of two men engaged in a sex act . this was the second occasion on which mr dromey 's finger had strayed on twitter . back in september , mr dromey also favourited a link to a tweet on a similar theme . at the time , the then shadow housing minister dismissed it as a mistake as he and mrs harman had been exploring romantic breaks in paris . according to the guido fawkes political gossip website , mr dromey said he had accidentally stumbled on the gay porn website - which featured a character called ` paris ' . inside housing covered the story in a diary item , saying : ` shadow housing minister jack dromey is the latest victim of this murky world after favouriting a tweet that featured a very different type of outstanding member to that normally found in the parliament . ' it is surprisingly easy for twitter users to publicise embarrassing searches to all their followers by typing key words into the ` tweet ' box rather than the search engine . the shadow policing minister - who is married to labour deputy leader , harriet harman - linked to a tweet about well-endowed black men . but the revelation could cause tension with his staunchly feminist wife , mrs harman , who has called for the sun newspaper to stop its ` sexist ' pictures of topless women on page three . the story was retweeted numerous times after being posted by guido fawkes yesterday . a labour source said : ` this is a technological mix-up and we 're sure jack will be taking twitter lessons to work out the difference between block and favourite as soon as possible . ' the mail understands that no one else has access to mr dromey 's account so the tweet can not be blamed on a junior staff member . ` it 's all very embarrassing . he is aware of it . it 's more mix up than conspiracy , ' one insider said . mr dromey , a 65 year-old former trade union boss , was elected as the mp for birmingham erdington in 2010 . his selection was controversial as the usual all-woman shortlist championed by his wife , was bypassed . meanwhile it also emerged that david cameron 's official twitter account followed an escort agency . the @number10gov account was following the @carltonslondon , which described itself as an ` elite london escort agency ' . downing street blamed the gaffe on the ` auto-follow ' facility which has been on the account since gordon brown was prime minister . a spokesman said : ` we have stopped following this particular account . prior to 2010 , an auto-follow process was used , meaning that @number10gov automatically followed anyone who followed the account . ` this was common practice at the time for many corporate accounts , but was discontinued in 2009 . ` as a result of this legacy , the @number10gov account follows almost 370,000 accounts and we have taken steps to un-follow as many as possible that are inactive , spam or inappropriate . ` this work is ongoing . ' originally , twitter users had pointed out that perhaps mr cameron had mistaken the escort agency for the carlton club , an exclusive private members ' club in london . official records showed that more than 300,000 attempts were made to access pornographic website in the houses of parliament last year . about 5,000 people work on the parliamentary estate .", "summary": " labour mp jack dromey linked to a tweet about well-endowed black men .   harriet harman 's husband made a ` technological mix up ' , spokesman said .
