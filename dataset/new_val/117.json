' 2 . always greet your partner ` if you want your relationship to survive and to thrive , you will have to train yourself to focus most of your attention on the person you love . when your sweetheart comes into the room , whether it 's just from taking care of some chores in the garage or from a long day at work , your job is to put down whatever you 're doing , look him in the eye , and verbally express your delight at seeing him again . it 's really so little to ask , and delivers so much - to both of you . ' 3 . keep the romance alive , even when you have children ` it 's true that when your babies are small , there is n't much time left over for romantic gestures . but the wonderful thing about romance is that it is the quality , never the quantity , that matters . so when the baby is napping , throw a blanket on the living room floor , slice some peaches or plums or whatever you have in the house , pour a glass of something bubbly , and enjoy a mini picnic . write love notes to each other and slip them in between the clean diapers . be creative , and if you want your love to flourish , it certainly will do so .
