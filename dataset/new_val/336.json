' it also says that the word ` chemical ' has unfairly negative connotations . study author and chemistry professor gordon gribble , said : ` most people do n't know they are routinely exposed to a host of compounds in non-toxic concentrations in what they eat and drink each day . ` even the air they breathe -- whether in big cities or the countryside -- is full of naturally occurring and synthetic chemicals , including wine ` aroma , ' flower ` bouquet , ' perfume ` fragrance , ' bakery ` smell ' and the ` stench ' of rubbish bins . ' however , he said the chemicals are not inhaled in a large enough quantities to affect humans ' health . many of the same compounds found in . pesticides are made naturally by plants , animals and humans ` for their . own defensive purposes , ' according to professor gribble . the report , by dartmouth college in the u.s. argues low doses of chemicals in modern meals are ` typically harmless and highly beneficial . ' it also says the word ` chemical ' has unfairly negative connotations . professor gribble cited the example of halogen . compounds , which many people - even many scientists - assume are all . uniquely man-made poisons found in dioxins , polychlorinated biphenyls . -lrb- pcbs -rrb- and the pesticide ddt . but he said thousands of halogen compounds . are part of our natural environment made by plants , . animals and even humans for their own defensive purposes . some species . even use organohalogens , which contain carbon along with chlorine , . bromine , iodine or fluorine , to mount chemical offensives against . encroaching competitors . while the report says that some beneficial chemicals are found in modern food , it does not suggest swapping fresh vegetables for microwave meals but instead eating a varied diet to avoid exposure to harmful concentrations of chemicals . he said : ` food regulators should focus not on pesticides , antibiotics and dioxins but on pathogens , bacteria and fungi , which each year cause millions of cases of food-borne infections in the united states that result in hospitalisation or death . ' professor gribble recommends that people eat ' a diverse diet to minimise their exposure to harmful concentrations of chemicals . ' he said food is peppered with natural compounds such as organohalogens , dioxins , aflatoxins and many others . ` food is chemistry beyond our immediate control , including those synthetic chemicals that are deemed to be artificial and should not be found in ` safe ' food . ` the word ` chemical ' became a dirty word despite the fact that everything we see , smell and touch is chemical . '", "summary": " u.s. scientists said some people suffer from an irrational fear of chemicals when low doses used in meals pose no risk to human health .   researchers from dartmouth college warned people to be more mindful of natural bacteria , fungi and pathogens than avoiding pesticides and dioxins .   they recommend eating a varied diet , including modern food , to minimise exposure to harmful concentrations of natural and man-made chemicals .
