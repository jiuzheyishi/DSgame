{"text": "with its ban on alcohol and rules ordering women to cover up , it is not the most obvious summer holiday destination . but that has not stopped iran from experiencing a surge in tourism from the uk , with bookings at travel agencies up by as much as 400 per cent . for years , the hardline regime of anti-western former president mahmoud ahmadinejad put off all but the most adventurous travellers . but the arrival of football-loving hassan rouhani as his successor last year appears to have made the middle eastern country seem friendlier . imam mosque in imam square in esfahan iran - which is now becoming a tourist hotspot , according to travel agents . jonny bealby , managing director of wild frontiers , which has been organising trips to iran for ten years , hopes to send up to 150 customers this year , compared with a few dozen in 2013 . mr bealby said : ` with the new man in charge and the easing of relations , a lot more people feel safe to go there . ' in the ahmadinejad years , mr beal12 people at a time , and arrange ` a handful ' of trips for individuals . or couples . ` things have . changed completely this year , ' he said . ` in 2012 , it was hard to sell . iran at all and in 2013 we had just two group tours running . this year . we are running nine . ` we are also providing tailor-made trips for dozens more people . in total , we are approaching 150 bookings so far in 2014 . ' wild frontiers ' group tours cost . # 2,795 per person for a fortnight or # 1,995 for 10 days , taking in . ancient fortresses , mosques , bazaars , royal gardens and iran 's national . museum in tehran , which displays its crown jewels and peacock throne . there are no direct flights from the uk to iran so travellers have to change in either istanbul or dubai . mr . bealby said : ` travel to iran has never been a problem in the years . we 've been running tours . as long as people going there are sensible , we . have partners in iran who know what they are doing and our customers . are well looked-after . ' the arrival of football-loving hassan rouhani last year appears to have made the middle eastern country seem friendlier . ` the . issue has always been the way iran has been perceived . under . ahmadinejad this was a particular problem , especially with the attack on . the british embassy in tehran in 2011 but with the new man in charge . and the easing of relations , a lot more people feel safe to go there . ' sarah bareham , marketing executive at brighton-based responsible travel , which also organises tours of the country , said : ` since january we have had the same number of bookings that we had in the whole of 2013 . ' michael pullman , marketing manager at wild frontiers , based in barnes , south london , has just returned from one of the company 's tours to iran and describes the country as ` amazing ' . he said : ` it was a really interesting place , full of history , amazing architecture and mosques . ` probably the biggest surprise was how friendly and welcoming the people were - everywhere we went we were surrounded by people wanting to ask us questions about topics ranging from politics to the premier league . ` the officials were very low-key and although they probably knew where we were , there was n't any visible presence monitoring our movements . ' among the hotels mr pullman stayed in was the 300-year-old abbassi hotel , esfahan , a one-time favourite of the shah prior to the 1979 islamic revolution . he said : ` the hotels were all clean and comfortable but there was an atmosphere faded grandeur , which is a symptom of the economic sanctions and iran having been off the tourist map for so long . ` there were very few brits but we met a few french and germans . ' but despite the friendly welcome , mr pullman said alcohol remains banned , women have to disguise their body shape and wear scarves and , while men are permitted western clothing , shorts are not allowed . other down-sides include western credit or debit cards not working in iran , so tourists need to bring cash to exchange . wild frontiers ' brochure describes ` fascinating ' iran as ` one of the most misunderstood countries on earth ' . other specialist travel agencies have also reported rising bookings for iran in the last 12 months . but government advice on trips to the middle eastern country remains cautious . a foreign and commonwealth office spokesman said : ` we would advise people to keep up to date with our relevant travel advice on iran . ` we advise against all but essential travel to the country as a whole and against all travel to regions close to the iraq and afghanistan borders . ` there are risks for british nationals in iran and especially those going off the beaten track - but it 's a matter of choice for individuals .
