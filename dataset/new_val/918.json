{"text": "he wants his just desserts : alex snelson is suing because his diet dows not allow him to eat processed foods he is being forced to eat , but does allow ice cream . a satanic inmate has filed a federal lawsuit accusing his nevada jailers of violating his constitutional rights by denying him meals adhering to his strict pagan diet . alex c. snelson , 33 , argues in the lawsuit that denying him meals without byproducts and processing additives force him to either starve or go against his religion . he lists ice cream as being one of those foods . snelson made the accusations in a hand-written complaint filed to the u.s. district court in reno , and insisted ice cream is one of the ` whole foods ' his religion permits him to eat . he claims deputies retaliated against him by refusing him ice cream because they said it would violate his religion . ` each day that i am effectively forced to eat outside my religious dietary guidelines is a day that i must endure feeling totally and utterly violated , tortured and religiously defiled , ' snelson wrote . the devil horn tattooed criminal was homeless and unemployed when he was arrested in 2013 . he is serving two to six years in state . prison for possession of a stolen car after spending time in the washoe . county jail in reno for possession of methamphetamine and brass . knuckles . he said the violation of his first amendment rights caused him to suffer at the county jail . he 's seeking ` hedonic ' and ` vindictive ' damages as well as monetary and punitive damages . county prosecutors said friday they had n't seen the new filing and had no comment . county spokesman bob harmon said it is the policy of the jail operated by the sheriff 's office to ` accommodate the religious practices of all inmates . ' mr. snelson 's allegations are just that -- allegations , and we are confident that the facts will show that the washoe county sheriff 's office acted in accordance with constitutional requirements , # harmon said friday . the filing : the lawsuit was filed with a handwritten compliant explaining how snelson feels his rights have been violated . washoe county deputy district attorney mary kandaras said in court filings in march that the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals has held previously that such claims must be ` rooted in religious belief ' not in ` purely secular ' philosophical concerns . ` determining if a prisoner 's claim is ` rooted in religious belief ' requires analyzing whether the prisoner 's claim is related to his sincerely held religion 's belief , ' she said in a motion requesting that snelson be required to explain his beliefs . kandaras said snelson 's original lawsuit filed in august did n't identify any specific religion , the content of his diet , whether his diet was recognized by the tenets of his religion or if he simply made it up . snelson , who is acting as his own attorney , said in the amended suit he is a full , active and participating member of the pagan religion satanism . ' i use my diet to purify and cleanse my internal organs , ' he said , adding that the ` religious dietary restrictions that have been imposed on me by my church and by my religion and by my faith . ' where it happened : the nevada state prison , outside reno , is where snelson is being held . snelson said he is a member of the church of light in chino hills , california . there is no readily available record of such a church existing . a leader of a leading international satanic organization also questioned snelson 's claims . the church of satan , founded in san francisco in 1966 by anton szandor lavey , allows its members ` to choose whatever diet is pleasing to them , ' said magus peter h. gilmore , a high priest at the church . the church website says it is the ` original church of satan ' dedicated to the ` acceptance of man 's nature as an animal living in a cosmos that is indifferent to his existence . ' it adds that satanism is ` not devil worship . there is no belief in god , satan , the soul , the supernatural or in any form of afterlife . ' devotees are permitted to enjoy ice cream .", "summary": " alex snelson claims he can eat only ` whole foods ' without byproducts or processing additives .   he listed ice cream as one of those foods on a handwritten legal complaint .
