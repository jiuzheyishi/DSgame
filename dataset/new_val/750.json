{"text": "i wonder if rio ferdinand was true to his word at 10.30 on saturday night ? in the trailer announcing the arrival of the fiftieth anniversary season of match of the day , qpr 's new centre half says that as soon as he hears the show 's iconic theme tune , he drops everything and heads for the telly . or perhaps this weekend , after his debut for his new team that siren song actually sounded more like the theme from jaws ? and saw peckham 's finest getting out of earshot , and sharpish ! because prior to the inaugural weekend of the new premier league season , we had been promised by the bbc that their old dog would show us a few new tricks . and that the pundits would be encouraged to let fly with their opinions . video scroll down for hansen 's infamous remark : ` you ca n't win anything with kids ' copped it : rio ferdinand -lrb- pictured -rrb- was heavily criticised by alan shearer on match of the day . at fault : shearer blamed ferdinand -lrb- second right -rrb- for failing to mark james chester -lrb- far right -rrb- for his goal . so was saturday night the dawn of a new shearer ? well , for instance , they certainly took no prisoners when the boys discussed their old pal from the world cup studio in brazil . having lost his man for hull 's winner at loftus road , as well as ending up kneeing a chance to cancel it out , ferdinand 's fellow pundit in rio , alan shearer , took almost too much pleasure in pointing out where he 'd gone wrong . he reminded us that rio had said out there that he was not a fan of zonal marking , then gleefully added he clearly was n't ` a fan of marking either ' . while of his miss , the old no 9 shook his head forlornly and said ` all the practise we put in on copacabana beach ' . all this though , as you 'd expect , with a twinkle in the eye . but those samba days of summer clearly worked as a benchmark for the new approach to this match of the day season . to underline that point , it was ruud gullit who was tasked with filling the chair vacated by alan hansen . there will be many who feel that simply removing hansen 's overbearing personality would be enough to give match of the day its ` new look ' . but you ca n't just have an empty chair . tv pals : shearer -lrb- far left -rrb- and ferdinand -lrb- second left -rrb- were part of the bbc 's world cup punditry team . conflicting ideas : ruud gullit -lrb- left -rrb- and shearer -lrb- right -rrb- did n't always see eye-to-eye on decisions . gullit clearly did n't find it a big seat to fill . he became part of the team in south america , and it showed on saturday night . first of all , he dovetailed nicely with his geordie counterpart . and finally , finally , was doing so at least in part because now both pundits shared their opinions on all the games . that abstract system of letting one man talk as the other sat mute is now hopefully a thing of the past . but it was n't all a box of chocolates between them . when discussing the kyle naughton penalty and subsequent red card at upton park , it got a bit tasty . gullit stood his ground by stating ` it 's the rules ' , but shearer chipped away stating the ref ` should show common sense ' . they smiled benignly at each other on set , but i bet they carried on that little tete a tete after the lights had dimmed . it was certainly what the dj 's amongst us might call the right vibe . seeing red : gullit and shearer disagreed over the dismissal of tottenham 's kyle naughton -lrb- second right -rrb- . correct decision ? naughton -lrb- centre -rrb- was sent off for deliberate handball at west ham on saturday . and what of the guv 'n or ? i 've often pointed out that gary lineker is one of the best sports anchors we 've got . and the fact he was a top notch pro in his previous career is most certainly the icing on the cake . on saturday night , though , he reminded us he is none too shabby in the role of journalist , either . although , granted , crystal palace 's co-chairman steve parish is a bit of a gaping net as he seems an affable , open man . nevertheless - in the innovation introduced last season of gary capturing an interview post match with a figure in the headlines - the host pushed the envelope just a little further than i seem to remember him doing before . one of the best : gary lineker is regarded as one of britain 's best sporting presenters . nice touch : lineker demonstrated his journalistic skills in his interview with steve parish -lrb- centre -rrb- . questions about tony pulis such as ` perhaps he thought there was a better job out there ? ' , ` do you feel let down ? ' and then saying ` worth an ask ' before enquiring who would be his replacement , may seem obvious . but in the more comfortable , perhaps sterile atmosphere of match of the day in , say , its thirties and forties , i do n't think they would have been asked . and luckily for us all , so honestly and interestingly answered . which in part may just be because people do n't want to let gary down ? they want to tell him the truth . a good trick in our game if you can pull that off ! and so we 're off and running again and match of the day is looking more than match fit at the grand old age of fifty . and perhaps this is just the right season for it to suck in its gut , trim the nose hairs and not buy its shirts from the supermarket . al reckoned on saturday night that ` it 's thirteen teams that could go down ' . while ruud described the premier league as now being ` not weaker -lrb- but -rrb- interesting . ' well here 's to match of the day echoing those words throughout its half century .", "summary": " match of the day kicked off show 's 50th anniversary on saturday .   broadcast was first without tv pundit alan hansen , since his retirement .   alan shearer let rip into qpr 's rio ferdinand defending .   shearer and fellow pundit ruud gullit disagreed over tottenham 's kyle naughton dismissal against west ham .   gary lineker showcased why he is one of britain 's best sport presenters .
