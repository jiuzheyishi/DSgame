{"text": "arsene wenger is unlikely to have popped out the ` pop-out wenger ' souvenir from the match-day programme to place on his mantelpiece . he will not want any reminder of the occasion , his first reunion with monaco . rather like his 1,000 th arsenal game , a 6-0 defeat at chelsea , this turned out to be a long sentimental preamble followed by 90 disastrous minutes . arsenal manager arsene wenger -lrb- right -rrb- greets his opposite number , leonardo jardim of monaco . the 3-1 defeat at home to monaco has left arsenal on the verge of champions league elimination . geoffrey kondogbia 's -lrb- left -rrb- strike from range deflected in off per mertesacker -lrb- centre -rrb- on 38 minutes . dimitar berbatov -lrb- second right -rrb- scored monaco 's second with a composed finish under pressure . kondogbia -lrb- centre -rrb- celebrates with his monaco team-mates after putting his side ahead at the emirates . berbatov celebrates scoring monaco 's second in front of a stunned emirates crowd . he seemed utterly dejected as he tried to analyse the performance . all the recent glimmers of encouragement were washed away and what seemed a genuine chance to reach the last eight of the champions league for the first time in five years turned into one of the worst european performances of the wenger era . even after 15 years of elite european football , arsenal still gallop headlong into these two-legged ties with astonishing naivety . with priorities all wrong , too loose at the back , without urgency on the ball , unable to prevent an away goal , over-committed to attack and unable to recognise the signs and adjust when things are going so badly it 's time cut losses . perhaps after routinely drawing powerhouses like bayern munch , barcelona and ac milan at this stage , they thought it was too easy . it had been received as a good draw when the teams were paired , back in december ; one arsenal had dared to hope for , and then this ... boom , to quote the firecracker launched from the away end as the travelling fans celebrated dimitar berbatov scoring monaco 's second of the night . berbatov , a former tottenham striker , had been jeered when he first touched the ball , but the home crowd seemed to have lost interest in such tactics of intimidation by the time he lashed the ball past david ospina , early in the second half . do n't expect to see any jubilant ` selfies ' from the home dressing room to go viral after this one . for wenger and his players , thoughts quarter-finals suddenly seem a long way off against leonardo jardim 's team who rarely leak goals even last night when they were without their entire first-choice back-four . jardim 's team were well-drilled and composed in their defensive duties . the revitalised team from the millionaire 's paradise on the med parked the bentley . then they suckered arsenal on the break as they admired the wheels . alex oxlade-chamberlain pulled a goal back for arsenal in stoppage team with strike from the edge of the area . danijel subasic , the monaco goalkeeper , leaps to his left but is unable to keep out oxlade-chamberlain 's shot . but with one of the final kicks of the game , yannick ferreira-carrasco made the score 3-1 to monaco . monaco have never lost to english opposition in the knock-out rounds of this competition and it will take a heroic effort from wenger 's team in the second leg to buck that trend . chelsea have fought back from 3-1 down to win at this stage of the champions league , twice in the last three years , but that was with the second leg at home . and , that was chelsea , a mature team with strength and character . after watching this game , it is hard to imagine arsenal keeping a clean sheet in the stade louis ii as they pour forward in search of goals . the win at manchester city offered encouragement but last night the defensive problems were back in full force , while in possession they lacked any urgency until theo walcott came on and the strikers misfired badly . wenger 's decision to replace olivier giroud was celebrated by home fans who hailed him a two goal-hero in the fa cup against middlesbrough on his last outing at the emirates stadium . it is a painfully delicate balance inside the arsenal family . on came alex oxlade-chamberlain to join santi cazorla in one of the holding midfield partnerships you thought you would never see . it was a night to forget for arsenal 's players , as they slumped to a champions league defeat against monaco . olivier giroud was unable to inspire arsenal in an underwhelming performance from wenger 's side . danny welbeck -lrb- centre -rrb- lifted a good chance over the bar in the early exchanges of arsenal against monaco . wenger was frantically gambling long before his team set foot in monte carlo . no sooner had oxlade-chamberlain pulled one back to offer a lifeline , than arsenal fell to pieces again and gifted monaco the third . after months of planning since the draw in december , this was such a hastily scrambled mess . the original midfield pairing of cazorla and francis coquelin , so impressive and well balanced since it came together , was missing as monaco took the lead . a ripple of discontent washed around the emirates , an oh-no-not-again ripple . this place has yet to witness any of those truly great european nights which highbury enjoyed . perhaps until it does , it will always seem strangely cold and corporate . there were times last night when the away fans made more noise , with their colour-coordinated plastic ponchos , which had the pleasing effect of producing a large monaco flag . for wenger this was champions league match number 161 . his status as one of the iconic modern coaches was underlined by the build-up to a game which was all about him . monaco 's supporters wore colour-coordinated ponchos that displayed the monaco flag . arsenal defender and captain mertesacker was not his usual authoritative self for his team on wednesday . hector bellerin -lrb- left -rrb- of arsenal tries to deliver a cross as monaco 's anthony martial -lrb- right -rrb- tries to close down . giroud was substituted after an hour after a hapless display from the striker as arsenal lost to monaco . but the nearest he has ever been to lifting this trophy came in paris , nine years ago , when a team reduced to ten men , could not cling on to a lead and were beaten by barcelona . this morning , after such a sobering night , those giddy heights seem unlikely to be scaled again . will he ever win it ? the dream is fading .", "summary": " geoffrey kondogbia 's deflected strike in the 38th minute put monaco ahead .   dimitar berbatov doubled the lead , clinically finishing a counter attack .   alex oxlade-chamberlain pulled a goal back in stoppage time .   but yannick ferreira-carrasco made it 3-1 in the final seconds of the game .
