{"text": "click here to read why stuart lancaster is running out of time to find his best team . i hugely admire rugby league as a sport and the players who take the field . at its best the balance between athletic prowess , skill-set and sheer bloody toughness makes league one of the great sports . i can not wait to see sam burgess play for bath , i 'm sure he has everything to succeed in union and all england rugby fans should be grateful to bath for bringing him into the sport . that said , we need to be realistic -- for burgess 's sake as much as anything . to suggest burgess is the answer to england 's poor showing in the backline so far this autumn would be dangerous -- he has n't played a game of union yet ! sam needs to get on with his game , a challenge he 'll throw himself into . sam burgess is expected to make his debut for bath on saturday . burgess speaks with bath and possible future england team-mate george ford -lrb- left -rrb- during training . burgess poses with a young baby after attracting crowds to a bath training session . but equally the england setup and their fans ca n't sit back and think ` it 's ok , we 'll have sam burgess in a couple of months . ' the focus should remain on our current options until he is ready . making the transition to union and performing at test match level is going to take time . if you put him on the field at twickenham on saturday he 'd get horribly exposed . i 'd love to see him in the world cup squad but the time-frame is very tight . the biggest challenge for burgess will be understanding the technicalities and subtleties of playing at inside centre in both attack and defence . as has become apparent this autumn , the no 12 holds the keys to the backline . he is not a jason robinson or israel folau , who can devastate teams with raw speed and athleticism . those types of players have tended to be more successful at crossing over codes . burgess 's game is based more on explosive power and smashing through tackles . at the highest level of rugby union that simply wo n't be enough . he needs to learn a kicking game , gain an understanding of the patterns run in union and work on his distribution . the biggest challenge for him will be at the breakdown . unlike in league , it is after the hit that so much happens . i suspect he wo n't enjoy hitting rucks but in many ways you do n't want him smashing into rucks because that would n't be the best use of his many qualities . burgess faces a tough challenge after crossing over from rugby league to union . the 25-year-old is congratulated by sydney rabbitohs ' owner russell crowe after winning the grand final . burgess has starred for england at the 2013 rugby league world cup . we know how hard he can tackle but how quickly can he get over the ball and how effectively he can hold up his man in a choke tackle ? he has the ability to be world class in this area and the speed at which he learns these skills will be crucial in determining how quickly he progresses into a white england shirt . it is asking a lot for him to be ready in time for the world cup . the more i think about it , i think he will end up playing in the back row . if that happens he will not be such a significant addition to england 's squad . there is already great depth in the back row . it is in the midfield that they need new ideas . it 's a quandary . one thing burgess will undoubtedly bring is sheer outright toughness . i was offered a contract to sign for warrington in 1980 but turned it down because i did n't think i was tough enough to cut in it in rugby league . a couple of years later i played union for manly in sydney , where the two codes are pretty close . i watched a lot of league and it left me with a massive respect for the sport . the preparation and detail those players put into every training session and every match was light-years ahead of union at that time . burgess speaks to bath head coach mike ford -lrb- left -rrb- ahead of his expected aviva premiership debut . england coach stuart lancaster -lrb- centre -rrb- is still deliberating over his best central line-up . billy twelvetrees will replace owen farrell at no 12 for england 's final autumn test against australia . even today the speed and quality of pass and the ability to simply but so effectively time their running lines from deep always stands out to me . they are still ahead of union . i would still get burgess into the england camp at the earliest opportunity even if his first start comes later . he will raise the standards and will prompt a far greater response than 10 visits from michael johnson and gary neville . i 'm not saying burgess can not make it as a union player . i am sure he will . but i would urge caution about the time-frame . kyle eastmond said recently it took him the best part of a year to really feel like a union player . burgess does not have that time on his side . when i became england head coach i 'd followed league all my life and knew exactly the type of player jason robinson was when i brought him across . like folau , robinson was a sensational athlete whose quick feet set him apart . but i never considered playing him in a key decision-making position such as 12 , one of the most challenging positions . jason robinson made a successful crossover from league to union under sir clive woodward . all eyes will be on burgess if he makes his rugby union debut against harlequins on saturday . it 's exciting for rugby as a whole that burgess could be starting for bath against harlequins . he 's in the perfect place at bath , where mike ford -- a former rugby league player himself -- is head coach . i really do envy the opportunity to coach him . the way you look after someone like burgess is by not trying to change them . educate them , but allow them to interpret the game themselves . if you do that , you might end up with a unique union player . i 'm excited about burgess and england rugby fans should be , too . but the clock is ticking ahead of the world cup .", "summary": " sam burgess has crossed codes from rugby league to rugby union .   the former bradford bulls star is set to make his bath debut on saturday .   it is too early to herald burgess as england 's saviour at the world cup .
