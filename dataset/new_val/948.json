' ironically , with a cheap and educated labour force , mr neumeier adds that detroit is in need of a modernisation and advancement - making it the ideal place to start a robotics company . he added : ` there is a cheap and educated labor force . some kind of high-tech would be good for them ... i would say with the industrial and mechanical legacy there , somebody should start a robotics company .
