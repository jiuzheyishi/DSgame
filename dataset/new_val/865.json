' durrani said younus ' case should be a reminder that the pakistani government needs to do much more to prevent acid attacks and other forms of violence against women , and also help the victims . ' i think this whole country should be extremely embarrassed that a foreign country took responsibility for a pakistani citizen for 13 years because we could give her nothing , not justice , not security , ' said durrani .", "summary": " fakhra younus said ` my face is a prison ' after attack which melted her nose .   she had undergone 39 separate surgeries to repair damage .   leapt to her death from sixth floor rome building earlier this month .   her ex-husband was charged with attempted murder in 2002 but has since been acquitted .
