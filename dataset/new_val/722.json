{"text": "viagra could cause blindness in men with eye problems , and even those with seemingly normal vision , a new study has found . australian researchers say an ingredient in anti-impotence drugs may permanently affect the vision of men with an inherited eye condition . it could also affect those with normal sight who carry one gene which is linked with developing eye problems . scroll down for video . viagra could cause blindness in men with inherited eye condition retinitis pigmentosa - or those with normal sight who carry the gene for the condition , australian researchers have found . one theory is that erectile dysfunction drugs may obstruct an enzyme which is important for transmitting light signals from the retina to the brain . it is already known that sildenafil , the active ingredient in the erectile dysfunction medication , can cause temporary vision problems in some healthy people . doctors have now warned it could also cause permanent damage to the eyes of people retinitis pigmentosa . people with normal sight that carry the gene for the condition may also be at risk , experts warn . retinitis pigmentosa is a rare hereditary condition that causes the cells in the retina - the area of the back of the eye which detects light - to degenerate and die . this can lead to difficulty seeing in dim light , loss of peripheral vision , and sometimes blindness . about one in 50 people are likely to be carriers of genes which lead to the degeneration of cells in the retina . loss of hearing . in 2011 , viagra and similar impotence drugs were linked to hundreds of cases of sudden hearing loss around the world . research published in the journal the laryngoscope said it was not clear how long the problems lasted , but this type of hearing loss - more commonly due to infections and exposure to loud noise - usually causes permanent damage in up to a third of cases . skin cancer . earlier this year , american researchers found that men who used viagra were 84 per cent more likely to get melanoma , the most deadly form of skin cancer . it is thought the impotence drug may affect the same genetic mechanism that enables skin cancer to become more invasive . in the new study , researchers from the university of new south wales , australia , tested sildenafil on healthy mice and mice with one copy of this mutant gene . they found the healthy mice experienced problems with their eyes for about two days . however the drug affected the vision of mice who carried the mutant gene for two weeks . the researchers also found early signs that the cells in the mice 's eyes were dying , suggesting sildenafil may cause loss of vision in people who carry the gene for the disease but have normal vision . dr lisa nivison-smith , of the unsw school of optometry and vision science , said : ` if cells actually die in the retina that would lead to blindness . ' people who have normal vision , but who carry a single copy of the mutant gene for retinitis pigmentosa , could be more susceptible to changes caused by sildenafil , she added . the study was published in the journal experimental eye research.the news comes after reports that britain is braced for a ` viagra boom ' after the drug 's patent ran out last year . the cost plummeted by 93 per cent as cheaper generic versions of the drug became available . previous studies have linked viagra and other anti-impotence drugs to side effects such as deafness . american researchers also found that men who used viagra increased their risk of developing skin cancer . retinitis pigmentosa is a rare hereditary condition that causes the cells in the retina - the area of the back of the eye which detects light - to degenerate and die .", "summary": " viagra may cause loss of vision in men with retinitis pigmentosa .   retinitis pigmentosa is a rare inherited eye condition causing sight loss .   some people have normal vision but carry one gene for the condition .   ingredient in viagra linked to degenration and death of cells in the retina .   people with retinitis pigmentosa and those who carry the gene at risk .
