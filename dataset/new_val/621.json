' the two key ingredients in the toothpaste are calcium silicate and sodium phosphate . calcium silicate is most commonly derived from limestone and is used heavily in the production of building materials such as cement . it is also found in table salt and used as an antacid to treat heartburn . sodium phosphate is a term for a variety of salts used in processed food to control acid levels and help soften bread . they feature in medicines such as treatments for constipation . the technology is the result of work at the unilever research and development laboratory at port sunlight , on merseyside , as well as teams in milan and shanghai . it was developed in collaboration with dental experts from international oral health research centres and the underlying science is due to be published in the journal of dentistry . the company claims that test tube experiments have proved it can restore 82per cent of tooth enamel after three days . as a result , teeth are said to be three times stronger . however , the company faces an uphill struggle to convince a sceptical public that regenerate is any better than cheaper , rival products which claim to have a similar effect . for example , sensodyne toothpaste , which costs # 4.49 , promotes itself on the basis it is possible to treat the pain of sensitive teeth by repairing vulnerable areas of tooth enamel with a formula that includes calcium and phosphate . earlier this week , a leading british social scientist said the state of a person 's teeth , rather than their education , is becomingly increasingly important in terms of determining their job prospects and social status . malcolm gladwell argued that bad teeth . and being overweight are becoming the new benchmarks of inequality . he . suggested those with bad teeth are given a lower chance of success . because they are denied certain entry-level jobs . he said : ` that 's kind of the way we 're . moving as the gap between the fit and the unfit grows . the teeth thing . and the obesity problems are the same : they are symptoms of the same set . of inferences that are being drawn . malcolm gladwell suggested those with bad teeth have a lower chance of success because they are denied certain jobs . nowadays many , particularly celebrities like victoria beckham , get work done on their teeth . ` i think those kinds of physical characteristics - that 's completely the next wave of discrimination .
