{"text": "the only surviving example of the world 's first aircraft carrier which measures just 58ft long has been restored . a far cry from the royal navy 's new 920ft aircraft carrier queen elizabeth , the tiny boat could carry just one plane which was launched by towing it behind another boat into the wind . the simple vessels were used to launch first world war biplanes from the middle of the sea so they could attack german airships before they reached britain . fleet air arm musuem curator dave morris with the world 's first aircraft carrier , which was found rusting on the banks of the thames . the craft , loaded with a biplane , being towed behind another boat ahead of a launch . a sopwith camel plane would be strapped to the deck of the boat and taken out to sea before being towed into the wind at over 20 knots . crew had to hold the plane back while the pilot got the engine up to speed then release the chocks at the right moment . the pilot had just 58 feet of ` runway ' to get the plane airborne or it would plummet into the sea with disastrous consequences . and even if the plane made it into the air , the only way the pilot could land again was by crashing into the sea in the hope of being rescued . the craft were the brainchild of the british admiralty , who built them in a bid to end the destruction caused by bombs dropped on britain by german zeppelins . the plane would be launched by the towing vessel steering into the wind and speeding up until there was enough lift to get the plane airbourne . the pilot had just 58 feet of ` runway ' to get the plane off the deck or it would plummet into the sea . by launching planes out to sea the zeppelins could be intercepted and shot down before they could unleash their deadly payloads . the only existing example of the . craft , called a seaplane lighter , was discovered rusting on the banks of . the river thames by a passing naval historian in 1996 . it was salvaged by experts at the fleet air arm museum who have spent 12 years restoring it to its former glory . they now plan to give it pride of place in a new entrance hall at the museum in yeovil , somerset , with a restored sopwith camel mounted on it . dave morris , curator of aircraft at the fleet air arm museum , said : ` the boat came to us after it was spotted on the banks of the thames . length - 57.97 feet width - 16 feet . depth - 6.89 feet . weight - approximately 30 tons . propulsion - none , towed on a line by another boat . number of crew - 11 . top speed - around 20 knots when towed . first built - 1918 . aircraft capacity - one biplane . number of decks - one , open air . cost to build - unknown . length - 918 feet width - 239 feet . depth - 128 feet -lrb- waterline -rrb- 230 feet -lrb- total -rrb- . weight - approximately 70,000 tons . propulsion - two 48,000 hp engines , four 12,000 hp engines and two 20mw motors . number of crew - 679 . top speed - upwards of 25 knots . first built - sea trials to begin in 2017 . aircraft capacity - 40 fighter jets . decks - 10 including flight-deck . cost to build - # 3.1 billion . ` it was actually in remarkable . condition . we have stripped back the thames barge paint that covered it . and returned it to its original first world war condition . ` it 's incredible to compare it to aircraft carriers of today , but believe it or not this is where it all started . ' the deadly effect of the basic craft was displayed on august 10 , 1918 when lieutenant stuart culley took off from one for the first time . after completing the daring launch , lt culley climbed to 19,000 ft before opening fire on zeppelin l53 , sending the giant airship down in a ball of flame into the north sea . the mission was so successful the germans , petrified of the brits ' new aerial capabilities , stopped all zeppelin attacks on britain . lt culley was awarded the distinguished service order in recognition of his bravery during the attack . the vessel 's take-off ramp being constructed during the first world war . mr morris said : ` it 's incredible to compare it to aircraft carriers of today , but believe it or not this is where it all started ' the seaplane lighters would be dwarfed by the navy 's new state of the art queen elizabeth class aircraft carriers , which are 920ft long and can carry 40 fighter jets . dave morris , said : ` it is one of the great world war one pieces still in existence and among just a few original large objects remaining . ` during the war the admiralty decided they needed to to be able to launch planes from the sea , and came up with the idea of a small craft that could be towed behind a destroyer or frigate . the aircraft carrier would launch sopwith camel biplanes , like that pictured above -lrb- top -rrb- with a german fokker tri-plane -lrb- below -rrb- . ` planes had been put on the back of ships before but this was the first ever boat purpose built for launching aircraft from . fifty were ordered and 35 ended up being built . ` the concept was that the seaplane lighter would be towed out into the middle of the sea with a plane loaded on it . ` it would then be towed at speeds of . up to 20 knots into a headwind of the same strength thereby creating . enough lift for the plane to take off . ` initially the planes used were . flying boats that could land on water but then on july 21 1918 . lieutenant stuart culley proved it possible to take off using a sopwith . camel biplane . ` it was an incredibly dangerous task because the plane had to be airborne by the time it got to the end of the 58ft deck . ` if it was n't it would fall off the front and then be hit by the lighter , resulting in instant death for the pilot . ` even if the plane got airborne the pilot had to carry out a daring mission at 17,000 ft , all the time exposed to the elements . ` the . big snag was that unless the mission was taking place in sight of land , . the only option was for the pilot to crash land the plane in the sea . close to the flagship and hope he was rescued . ` three weeks after lt culley 's test flight he took off on a mission in the north sea and shot down zepellin l53 . ` it . was hugely risky but it gave the british troops a massive advantage . over the germans and all but ended the threat from zepellins overnight . '", "summary": " first of its kind first world war aircraft carrier was towed by another boat .   unlike its huge modern descendants , the ship had just 58 feet of runway .   it was built to launch biplanes to stop german airship raids on britain .   the plane was towed into the wind before crew pulled away plane 's chocks .   the 70-year-old vessel was found on the banks of the thames by a historian .   it is now going on display at the fleet air arm museum in somerset .
