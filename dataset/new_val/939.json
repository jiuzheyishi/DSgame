{"text": "in my job as a comedienne/impressionist i was lucky enough to land a job on a leg of p&o cruises ' aurora world cruise - and brought the family along . the segment of the cruise we enjoyed was the five-day leg from singapore to sri lanka . i am glad to say that my on-board guest entertainment act seemed to go down well - though quite what the non-british passengers made of my takes on the likes of stacey solomon , davina mccall and anne robinson i 'm not too sure . but i , at least , really enjoyed it . and here 's me during a quick day off : debra and their children hit the beach on malaysia 's langkawi shoreline . the job presented me with the opportunity to bring my husband and our two children , aged 11 and seven , along on a voyage in a very beautiful part of the world . my children were also able to see my act - so that they could finally understand what i do for a living . we liked the fact that the cruise was very british : the voyage 's itinerary begins and ends in southampton , so the majority of passengers were from the uk - and on-board activities were run largely to satisfy british tastes . my initial pleasure at being on a cruise ship was the realisation that i was to be relieved of my usual domestic chores : it was very nice , for example , to take a break from vacuuming ! islands of inspiration : malaysia 's langkawi archipelago has some of the far east 's loveliest beaches . we stopped twice on our short trip , firstly in port klang , which serves malaysia 's capital kuala lumpur . the following day we got to see a little bit of the beautiful archipelago of langkawi . the day we stopped there was my husband 's birthday , so we decided to enjoy it on the beach . what i love about cruising is the fact that you get a taster of these different places . ever wondered what malaysia is like ? on a cruise you can find out in a few hours . another surprise for first-time cruisers is that the ship is a selfcontained world of its own , with everything you could possibly want to enjoy the perfect holiday . the food on board , for instance , is a key attraction . dining in the restaurant was a pleasure , not just because of the cuisine but also because of the staff : the waiters were just lovely . our kids loved one of them so much they actually said : ` can we keep in touch with him ? ' one of the things you often hear is that people put on half a stone during a cruise . not me : i actually lost 6lb in a week . i know that sounds ridiculous and it sounds as if i did n't like the dishes served , but i really did . i found that there was so much choice and i naturally gravitated towards the healthier options . where , at home , i can be a bit lazy and just grab a calorific sandwich , on board the aurora i was able to enjoy healthy salads and fruits . a big boat for a brilliant family holiday : debra sailed on the p&o cruises liner aurora . the kids also ate well because , again , there was a lot of choice for them , and because it was all so beautifully presented they were willing to try things they had never eaten before . it helped that they spent most of their days in the pool and were very hungry when meal times came around . we had a few days in sri lanka at the end of the tour and joined some great excursions . we really enjoyed our visit to pinnawala elephant orphanage , for example . i would love to go back to singapore , our ` taster ' visit really made us want to return . there was an excursion to the zoo which we did n't get to do , and we would have loved to visit the street markets too . cruising is like the best showbusiness act - it leaves you wanting more ! like my act , hopefully ... p&o cruises -lrb- www.pocruises.com ; 0843 374 0111 -rrb- offers fly-cruises in south east asia and the middle east . prices start at # 2,039 , with # 40 per person on-board spend , for an 11-night adult-only cruise on arcadia departing march 25 with full board and entertainment . return flights and transfers cost from # 890 per person .", "summary": " debra stephenson was an impressionist on a recent p&o cruises voyage .   the posting meant a chance to take her children to a few exotic locations .   sunshine hotspots including malaysia and sri lanka were ports of call .
