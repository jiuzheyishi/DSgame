{"text": "photographed using a specialized microscope whose viewing stage is chilled to -170 c , scientists in maryland are showing a whole new side to what 's caught on the tip of our tongues . using a low-temperature scanning electron microscope , researchers at the beltsville agricultural research center have captured an astonishing new view on naturally-occurring snowflakes . shipping in the samples collected from snow banks or during fresh snow fall from around the country , the researchers study their composition for their effects on our ecosystem . scroll down for video . full-frontal : these unique images captured with a low-temperature scanning electronic microscope capture show a side to snowflakes rarely seen before . colouring : this image , shown with a tint of red , is what is called a psedo-coloured snowflake whose colour is computer generated and used commonly to highlight different parts of the flake . frosty touch : magnifying this hexagon flake 450 times its size shows a detailed , frosty surface . use : the magnifications , while stunning , are used to help scientists better assess the nation 's water supply and how to protect from flooding . e.t. : with such unique detail some flakes appear extraterrestrial-like . in comparison to man made or artificial snow - they also show in samples magnified on their website -- the naturally occurring snow is dramatically more rigid and varied in structure , with the man made appearing more round and gob-like . more importantly to the scientists than how they look , cosmetically at least , is the data gained from where they were collected that 's of value . ` information gained from studying the structure of snow is vital to several areas of science as well as to activities that affect our daily lives ... ' the website of the electron and confocal microscopy laboratory states . the hydrologists explain the flakes ' use to determine the winter snow pack 's water content to better determine the nation 's water supply and how to better protect from flooding . artificial : a closeup on some artificial snow shows a much smoother contrast from the naturally made snow . shipped : the snowflakes are shipped to the center in maryland from natural sources outside the state . collecting : the snowflakes are either brushed onto copper flakes held by researchers or allowed to fall naturally on them . preservation : once the flakes are captured they are right away dipped in liquid nitrogen , cooling them down to -196 c . stuck : the copper plates used to catch the flakes are also coated on one side with methyl cellulose - a gel like solution . shipping : once captured on the copper plate , they can be shipped in a previously liquid nitrogen-cooled dewar . using flat copper plates precooled to the same outside temperature and coated on one side with methyl cellulose - a gel like solution - researchers from outside the state collect the snow samples on this pallet before sending it out . the field researchers report either allowing the snowflakes to fall and settle on the plate 's surface or lightly brushing them on themselves . once collected , the plates are rapidly plunged in liquid nitrogen , cooling them down to -196 c . the plates can then be shipped in a previously liquid nitrogen-cooled dewar , providing them with thermal insulation before transported by air or ground . resemblances : like a prickly sundial , one flake reveals a hexagon plate with a frosty siding . extra details : a glass-like snowflake in the upper right-hand corner shows the center flake before pulling in to a view 79 times its size . depth : zooming into each flake reveals more and more spiny edges and crevices that appear to go on forever . magnifications : shown at the top , a flake is seen magnified 908 times while at the bottom the same area is seen magnified 1,860 times . variety : appearing as though brushed with icing , some snowflakes appear more rounded than the others typically seen as thorny . guessing game : depending on your interests , a close up on this snowflake could resemble a simple barbell or a tie fighter from star wars . surfaces : another snowflake , tinged in blue with the help of a computer , shows smoother , stacked surfaces . structures : another snowflake shows what the researchers call columns and plates . video : montage of some of the most amazing snowflakes captured on camera ...", "summary": " hydrologists study the snowflakes ' composition to understand their effects on ecosystem .   naturally occurring snowflakes are collected outside maryland research center and shipped in .
