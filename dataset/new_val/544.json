{"text": "well , it 's a start but it was not exactly a performance to strike fear into the hearts of the leading contenders for this world cup . for now england will be relieved to have finally got off the mark in this tournament here at the hagley oval and avoided the fierce opprobrium that defeat by scotland would have inevitably brought . yet deep down they will surely know that there will have to be a vast improvement on this 119-run victory if they are to ensure they get out of their group let alone become credible challengers for their first 50-over trophy . moeen ali salutes the crowd after his excellent century which gave england the platform to win . moeen took the game to the scots , playing aggressively while those around him floundered in christchurch . england will be relieved to have finally got off the mark at the 2015 cricket world cup at the hagley oval . moeen of england celebrates with his team-mates during the 119-run win over scotland in christchurch . moeen receives the player of the match award for his performance against the scots . on the face of it a score of 303 for eight followed by a bowling display that restricted the scots to 184 should represent a job fairly well done . it is just that , with the exception of an excellent all-round performance from moeen ali , too few england players could be satisfied with their contribution . specifically , england must look at how they let a score in excess of 350 slip out of their fingers when they were perfectly placed at 172 without loss from 30 overs to inflict carnage on their neighbours . moeen should be exempt from criticism . first he played with class and an improved shot selection to hit his second one-day international century and dominate england 's largest opening partnership in any world cup . then he again showed that he is a worthy first-choice spinner by taking two wickets , including the crucial one of kyle coetzer who had given the group a minnows a glimmer of hope with his 71 . other than that this was a display from england that betrayed the nerves and anxiety that are perhaps inevitable after the sheer scale of their defeats by two of the strongest teams in the tournament in australia and new zealand . too many batsmen appeared to be playing with a fear of failure when they had the perfect platform and opposition accommodating enough to have put on a show worthy of the aggressive intent they have vowed to produce . instead a tone was set by ian bell , who looked curiously out of touch after starting this tour in such vintage form that it appeared incredible he had been missing from the top of england 's one-day order for so long . here bell limped along to 54 from 85 balls and was only rescued by the fluency and style displayed at the other end by moeen , who passed 50 for the first time in 12 one-day internationals and went on to hit five sixes in his 128 . for a while it seemed that moeen was destined to race past robin smith 's long-standing record england one-day score of 167 and had he done so then his team would surely have got close to 400 against a modest scotland attack . kyle coetzer led the fightback for scotland with an impressive 71 but they fell well short in the end . steven finn -lrb- left -rrb- celebrates taking a wicket in a much-improved bowling display against scotland . moeen should be exempt from criticism after his impressive showing for england against scotland . after starring with the bat moeen was also influential with the ball , finishing with two wickets for 47 . ian bell limped along to 54 from 85 balls and looked out of knick throughout on a good batting wicket . bell stumbles after being hit on the pads , and he never really got going , despite scoring a half-century . but once moeen fell inertia gripped england , not least when they could manage just 22 for the loss of two wickets in their batting powerplay . gary ballance , in particular , will worry england . he has done little to justify his last-minute inclusion at the expense of ravi bopara ahead of this world cup and looked rusty in falling for his third score of 10 in three matches . at least captain eoin morgan looked something like his old self as he hit 46 off 42 balls including two sixes of his own , only falling in a disappointing climax to the england innings along with jos buttler and chris woakes . the memory of ireland chasing down 328 against england in the last world cup was fresh enough to provide some apprehension in the break but the fact is scotland did not have sufficient quality in their batting to threaten . freddie coleman gets up high to pull the ball down but scotland 's batting never really got on top of the chase . joe root -lrb- right -rrb- celebrates removing scotland captain preston mommsen to end a dangerous partnership . scotland 's matt machan dives to stop the ball as scotland responded well to england 's big opening stand . scotland have never won a world cup game and for all their pre-match bombast aimed at turning up the heat on england it would be a surprise if they break their duck here , even against afghanistan . at least coetzer gave them respectability against an england attack who were relieved that they had no-one of the calibre of aaron finch or brendon mccullum to bowl at . not least steven finn , who was retained by england ahead of chris jordan and james tredwell despite being demolished for 49 off two overs in wellington , and repaid england 's faith with three wickets of his own . so england live to fight another day but will need to win their three remaining group games , starting with sri lanka back in wellington on sunday , to ensure their quarter-final place . for now at least they can sleep easily again . moeen celebrates scoring his century with team-mate bell during the 2015 cricket world cup match .", "summary": " england beat scotland by 119 runs to win world cup tie in christchurch .   moeen ali hits 128 in score of 303-8 and takes two wickets for 47 .   steven finn impressive with the ball but england 's batting lacks fluency .   ian bell looked curiously out of touch in an unconvincing win for england .
