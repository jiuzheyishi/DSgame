{"text": "warning : professor carrie paechter , of the department of educational studies at goldsmiths , university of london . private school girls who are under intense parental pressure to excel are being driven to eating disorders , an academic has warned . they are being treated as ` projects ' by middle-class parents who push them too hard to achieve in music and sport as well as exams , it was claimed . but the stress of striving to be ` perfect at everything ' can lead to anorexia , bulimia and binge-drinking , according to professor carrie paechter , of goldsmiths college , london . she warned that the pressure to succeed is particularly intense at private schools , where pupils feel they must conform to the stereotype of the straight-a pupil . professor paechter will next week tell the heads of top private schools ' girls they should start telling some girls they are ` doing too much ' . girls also need a ` hard dose of reality ' about the sexist world they face when they leave school , she will tell the annual conference of girls ' schools association . speaking ahead of the event , the academic , a professor of education , warned that girls face further pressure to fit in with their classmates and avoid being excluded by cliques . girls who are sociable and successful may find friendships more difficult since those who are popular may not actually be well-liked , she said . stress is also caused by leading ` overscheduled ' lives in pursuit of perfection and a desire to ` live up to expectations ' . ` girls are under pressure as never before ' , professor paechter told the times educational supplement . ` there are girls in private schools who are  projects  of their parents , learning two or three instruments to grade eight standard and excelling in sport and academia because they feel that is what is expected of them , and that is what they expect of themselves . ' concern : carrie paechter , of goldsmiths college , is worried there is too much pressure on school girls -lrb- file picture -rrb- . ` but a few of them end up in anorexia clinics complaining that their schools only cared about their results . ` good schools need to start saying :  you ca n't do that many a levels , even if you want to . ' ` the schools need to start looking at girls , saying :  this is too much , you do too many things . ' she added : ` in middle-class families it 's not just about doing well at school , they have to be fabulous all-rounders . ` schools give them that message to an extent that to stand out from the crowd they must be a fantastic human being as well as doing really well at gcses and a levels . ' the professor also said it was important for schools to avoid turning young women who expected to have four children , a fulfilling career and a full social life . ` if you 're being picked on that 's awful , but if you 're just ordinary you can have a decent time at school , keeping out of it ' ` you want to keep them aspirational , but you want them to be confident enough to say ,  i do n't want this  , if it is too much , ' she said . girls also need to be warned about the ` very serious glass ceiling they could confront , ' she added . in a separate interview , she described research into friendship groups among girls . ` these friendship groups frequently have low tolerance for difference between group members and keep each other under constant scrutiny , excluding those who do n't make the grade , ' she said . ` we need to be aware that it is frequently those girls who appear to be the most socially successful for whom this is a problem , and to act rapidly when problems come to our attention . these are likely to be the tip of a much larger iceberg . ' concern : the impact of a demanding school life could drive some school girls to anorexia , it has been warned -lrb- file picture -rrb- . she added : ` there is a lot of pressure to be top of the social group , but often girls who are popular are n't well liked - they 're feared because they 're dominant . ` one group we studied at a school was very dominant and they kept constant surveillance on each other , checking they had their socks rolled down in the exact way and that their hair was done properly . ` this was a very affluent school . they all had long blonde hair and highlights and all wore designer clothes outside school . there was pressure to be beautiful all the time or you were letting the group down . ` one of the girls was whispered about because her ponytail was n't how it should be , and it took her all day to realise what was wrong , then she was mortified . ` the  terms  of the group can change overnight without a member realising . girls further down the pecking order do n't notice how their socks should be . ` if you 're being picked on that 's awful , but if you 're just ordinary you can have a decent time at school , keeping out of it . ' on its mydaughter website , offers advice and support to parents of girls , the girls ' schools association points out the ` danger of expecting  the best  from each girl ' . ` the fall from dizzy heights of success can be a painful experience and undoubtedly it can be lonely at the top , ' it says . ` our job is to ensure that the girls are ready and armed to cope with such challenges and the inevitable ups and downs . '", "summary": " girls are being treated as ` projects ' by their middle class parents , professor carrie paechter has warned .   she said the stress of ` being perfect ' can lead to anorexia , bulimia and binge-drinking .   pressure to succeed is particular intense at private schools .
