{"text": "it 's a touching tribute that was put together by a complete stranger . but a video that collates the final tweets of a girl purportedly dying of terminal brain cancer - posting on her social media site right up until her death - has been the cause of plenty tears this weekend . while there remains some debate over the authenticity of the tweets and the possibility the account is a hoax , the ever-increasing amount of viewers do n't seem to care based on the message the clip is leaving with people . there is no last name attached to the twitter handle of ` amanda ' -lrb- @trappedatmydesk -rrb- , which chronicles the musings of a young woman who moves to ottawa , canada , works for the government , discovers she 's sick and then dies from her illness . however the four-minute video - which brings together a snapshot of amanda 's final five months - is showing people how short life is and what we might take for granted . touching : twitter user ` amanda ' -lrb- left -rrb- documented the last few months of her life on her social media site after discovering she had a brain tumor . blogger and mom shannon mckarney -lrb- right -rrb- gathered all the tweets together and made a video of them as a tribute to amanda 's life and a reminder of our own . see video here . and , with many noticing that amanda 's death is dated april 2013 , it 's a stark reminder of the need to pay more attention to those around us , because these haunting posts are only really being noticed now . ` that 's the main thing that struck me , ' said the creator of the video , blogger and stay-at-home mom shannon mckarney stated in her blog zchamu.com . ' i never met her , but her story stayed with me . ' i kept going back and reading her tweet stream , wishing i had reached out when she was alive . ` but i missed the chance . she was gone . ' the video was initially made for a presentation for a digital strategy conference but , after recently posting it online , mckarney realized how quickly it was resonating with people . however mckarney 's attempts to verify amanda 's story have so far been unsuccessful , despite her attempts to reach out to family members and friends using her video , blog and social . ` you ca n't verify anything online , but i chose to take it at face value because there 's nothing else to be done , ' mckarney said . the beginning : the tone of ` amanda 's # twitter feed began to change in early january when she started worrying about a forthcoming doctors appointment . this is the moment amanda finds out she has advanced glioblastoma multiforme - a brain tumor . amanda discusses quitting her job with only a few months to live . ` it is a moving story . ... i believe that she was an individual , and i believe that her life mattered . ' mckarney also said the story said alot about social media and the world we live in . ` it used to be that you would just find batches of letters in somebody 's attic , and you would read their history that way , ' she said . ` now we leave these digital traces behind us everywhere we go -- tweets and facebook posts and blog posts -- and it really stayed with me that some day that may be the only way that people can get to know you and the person that you were . ' the @trappedatmydesk account produced almost 170 tweets , and states that amanda was in ottawa , according to the ottawa citzen . the feed was launched in november 2009 , with : ` figuring out twitter . how do i find more people in ottawa ? ' however early last year , everything changed . ` my doctors office just called me to come in to discuss some test results . that can only be bad , right ? the -lrb- sic -rrb- do n't call unless its -lrb- sic -rrb- bad news , ' the writer stated on january 14 , 2013 . after finishing up her job , amanda said she went on a trip , but had to return she when started to get sick . final three : these are the official last tweets on amanda 's twitter account . by january 18 , the writer referred to test results : ` advanced glioblastoma multiforme . ' -lrb- brain tumor -rrb- . the next the account statedl ` deciding what to do for the rest of my life . ' then on january 21 : ' i just resigned from my #goc -lrb- government of canada -rrb- job . no point when i have 3mths to live , right ? i wonder if i 'll get my pension money . ' there were no tweets for a couple of months , until the writer stated in march that she 'd gone travelling and returned home after she started to get sick . on april 10 , the writer stated : ` do n't spend time being angry at people . forgive them . life is entirely too short . ' the last post came that day : ` tomorrow , i go back into the hospital for the last time . thank you all for the good vibes . be good to each other . #quietlastnight ' the next and final tweet from the account was apparently written by someone named james on april 15 . ` my dear little sister amanda passed away from brain cancer late last night , ' it says . heartbreaking : someone purporting to be amanda 's brother , named james , announces that she has died .", "summary": " twitter user known only as ` amanda ' revealed on her account in january 2013 she had a brain tumor and would soon die .   the account stated her death occurred three months later in april .   during that time amanda continued to tweet her thoughts while aware of her fate in short but heartfelt posts .   now blogger shannon mckarney - who did n't know amanda - has found and pieced together the tweets alongside music for a youtube video that is touching people all over the world .
