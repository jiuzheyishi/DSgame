' the story , in the first instance , goes back to the nineties . parma had been delightfully successful through the whole decade , picking up four european trophies as well as three italian cups and finishing runners-up in serie a . their squad included gianluigi buffon , fabio cannavaro , lilian thuram , ariel ortega , juan sebastian veron , faustino asprilla and hernan crespo . when they were beaten by rangers in the champions league in 1999 it was a big result for the scottish side . no one predicted how much they would have in common down the line . parma supporters protest in the city ahead of their cancelled serie a game against udinese on sunday . the supporters have been angered to see a once-great club fall to the point of near-oblivion this season . a fan hangs a sign reading ` chiuso per rapina ' or ` closed for robbery ' on the gates on parma 's stadium . police officers look on as the supporters march through the streets in protest at the financial mismanagement . parma 's ground is closed off but they still have over 100 players on their books who have not been paid . for parma , the route from the champions league to here is odd and mysterious . when tommaso ghirardi bought the club for # 21m during the 2006-07 season , the club 's gross debt was a manageable # 12m . since then parma have acquired a barely believable playing staff of 240 players , with the vast majority out on loan , including gianni munari and daniel tozser at watford . the parma view has long been that ` this is the project ' without detailed explanations of how the business would work , though it is understood the plan depends on paying little and sending players elsewhere to be developed . if the player comes good , the club can sell for profit . if not , the overheads per player are relatively low . however , as one well-placed source put it : ` these were not just young players who would be very cheap with potential -- some were 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 . these players will cost the club more money . ' the scale of the operation was reported in 2013 by italian newspaper la repubblica , who calculated more than 300 transactions had taken place for only # 5.5 million . the club has previously been described in the same pages as a ` cattle market ' . ` like everything else , there has been no transparency , ' babris says . to that end , it is unclear how much that unique business model might be responsible for the mess the club finds itself in . the source added : ` it is hard to say , but the feeling is that these transfers have really not been good . ' signs that something was seriously amiss financially only came in the summer . having finished sixth in serie a last season , parma were prevented from taking part in the 2014-15 europa league because of an unpaid tax bill of $ 300,000 . the club captain has placed blame firmly at the door of parma 's current president giampietro manenti . alessandro lucarelli says he would happily captain parma in serie d , which could be what the future holds . ghirardi huffed and puffed but had no answer . in december , having run up such monstrous debts , he sold the club to albanian businessman rezart taci for $ 1 . captain alessandro lucarelli claimed the squad felt ` betrayed and taken for a ride ' by ghirardi . taci never met the players and also sold the club for $ 1 after less than two months as owner . in came manenti and one of his first encounters with the squad proved memorable . ` he showed us a bank document stating there was $ 100m available to invest in parma , ' said lucarelli . ` we had some doubt .
