' volatile : charles saatchi returns - alone - to scott 's , the restaurant where had grabbed nigella by the throat . nigella has fled to a # 10,000-a-week mayfair apartment where she is struggling to consider the best way forward for herself and her two teenage children , and decide whether the couple has a future . the friend added that while nigella has not consulted divorce lawyers she feels desperately exposed by the public scrutiny . they added : ` nigella feels frustrated that the whole world has an opinion about something she feels is a private situation . ' saatchi accepted a police caution for assault following the publication of the damning pictures last sunday , which he initially tried to dismiss as ` a playful tiff ' . but the incident sparked an outcry . it was raised in the house of lords on friday , as nigella 's father lord lawson looked on , when lord avebury asked : ` do you think that the leniency shown to mr saatchi when he half-strangled his wife set the wrong tone ?

' divorce lawyer vanessa platt , who has represented many women who want to leave abusive relationships , was surprisingly supportive of nigella 's private desire to save her marriage . she said : ` when a high-profile woman is in a situation with a controlling husband , people usually wonder why she wo n't leave him . ` but pressure from family and the press can be very overwhelming and does n't always help the situation . it can make it difficult for them to make a decision . i always recommend that the couple go for counselling . ' most of nigella 's family , especially her father nigel , are said to be furious that saatchi has created this hugely embarrassing storm . platt suggests that saatchi may have a narcissistic personality . ` if it is the case he has anger issues , then he must see a specialist to get help . nigella is right to insist that is a requirement for the marriage to continue . ' baroness fiona shackleton , who represented prince charles in his 1996 divorce from diana and sir paul mccartney in his 2008 divorce from heather mills , is a relative of nigella 's and someone she might turn to for advice should divorce become unavoidable . the couple are not believed to have signed a prenuptial agreement . saatchi 's former wife , american kay saatchi , the mother of their 19-year-old daughter phoebe , has previously said he was an ` appalling bully ' but last week issued a statement saying : ` while charles has always had his faults , i never experienced him to be physically abusive . ` he may be hard work , but i feel he is being treated unfairly . ' brian basham , a former business associate , said saatchi had gone from a sweet and humble genius to becoming a ` monster ' and a ` deeply unpleasant man ' . they fell out over a business deal in the late 1990s . ` he was the most brilliant advertising man , ' he said . ` back then he was warm and nice , but it is almost as if the more successful he became , the meaner be got . ` i sometimes wonder what went wrong and whether some personal disappointment turned him into the man he became . ' nigella , it seemed , was one of the few people able to charm him back to good humour . yet in spite of her high-voltage radiance , she is a woman who admits she is driven by a desperate desire to please . ` i am so pathetic i even crave the approval of my toothbrush , ' she once said . it is not only the personal humiliation that is said to be worrying nigella . her new success in america , where she found fame with the television reality show the taste , could now be vulnerable , after the row . torn apart : she has fled to a # 10,000-a-week mayfair apartment after the public row . the daughter of former conservative chancellor nigel lawson and vanessa salmon , a socialite and heiress to the lyons corner house empire , nigella has admitted that she was often beaten by her bipolar mother . her friendship with charles saatchi began before the 2001 death of her husband , journalist john diamond , to whom she had been married for ten years . that year she moved in to saatchi 's belgravia mansion with her children cosima , now 19 , and bruno , now 17 . she was already a household name following the publication of her first cookery book , how to eat , in 1998 . she was named author of the year for her 2000 follow-up , how to be a domestic goddess . her television cooking shows made her a star . although diamond saw her full potential -- supervising her ` makeover ' and persuading her to wear more glamorous clothes and make-up -- it was saatchi who saw her become a superstar . according to friends , none of whom wanted to be named , saatchi made himself indispensable to nigella when her husband was dying . ` he saw her as mother theresa , struggling to cope with two small children , and he rode in like sir galahad to rescue the situation . ' he met her at a private dinner and was immediately totally captivated . but as her career flourished he apparently became less comfortable . ` charles prides himself on being the lone wolf , the enabler , ' said a friend who knows the couple well . ` he grew frustrated as he had less and less control over her . ' another friend said : ` it appears nigella has had to put up with a shedload more at home than she will ever let on . she has to be capable for her children . she wants to be remembered as a nurturer , not some weak , needy woman . ' the current debacle has added strain to a relationship that has been rumoured to be in trouble for some time . but it is not only the personal humiliation that is said to be worrying nigella . her new success in america , where she found fame with the television reality show the taste last january , could now be vulnerable . a spokesman for nigella refused to comment last night .", "summary": " nigella , 53 , tells friends she wants to rebuild relationship with saatchi , 70 .   most of family are ` furious that husband has created embarrassing storm '   tv chef has fled to # 10,000-a-week apartment in mayfair , central london .   photographer who captured throat-grabbing admits he was in ` disbelief ' "}
