' they wrestle with division that requires the use of squares , slashes and dots . they rage over impenetrable word problems . adopted by 44 states , the common core is a . set of english and math standards that spell out what students should . know and when . the standards for elementary math emphasize that kids . should not only be able to solve arithmetic problems using the . tried-and-true methods their parents learned , but understand how numbers . relate to each other . stacey jacobson-francis , 41 , of berkeley , california , said her daughter 's homework requires her to know four different ways to add . ` that is way too much to ask of a first grader , ' she said . ` she ca n't remember them all , and i do n't know them all , so we just do the best that we can . ' simple arithmetic is n't so simple anymore , leading to plenty of angst at home . even celebrities are n't immune : the comedian louis c.k. took to twitter recently to vent about his kids ' convoluted homework , writing that his daughters went from loving math to crying about it . comedian louis c.k. has even taken to twitter to make fun of how ridiculous he thinks the common core math standards are . he has two daughters , mary lou and kitty , who attend elementary school in new york city . ` part of what we are trying to teach children is to become problem solvers and thinkers , ' said diane briars , president of the national council of teachers of mathematics . ` we want students to understand what they 're doing , not just get the right answer . ' that 's a radically different approach than many parents are accustomed to . jennie barnds , 40 , of davenport , iowa , was puzzled by her fourth-grade daughter 's long division homework , a foreign amalgam of boxes , slashes and dots with nary a quotient or dividend in sight . ` if we are sitting there for 20 minutes trying to do a simple problem , how is an 8 , 9 , 10-year-old supposed to figure it out ? ' she said . ` it 's incredibly frustrating for the student and the parent . ' a sample question from new york 's common core math exam for the third grade . another sample question from new york 's common core exam for the third grade . whether common core itself is responsible for the homework headaches is a contentious issue . some experts say common core promotes reform math , a teaching method that gained currency in the 1990s . derided as ` fuzzy ' math by critics , reform math says kids should explore and understand concepts like place value before they become fluent in the standard way of doing arithmetic . critics say it fails to stress basic computational skills , leaving students unprepared for higher math . this question , for new york 's common core math test for fourth graders , is one of the most detailed questions asked on the exam . stanford university mathematician james milgram calls the reform math-inspired standards a ` complete mess ' -- too advanced for younger students , not nearly rigorous enough in the upper grades . and teachers , he contends , are largely ill-prepared to put the standards into practice . ` you are asking teachers to teach something that is incredibly complicated to kids who are n't ready for it , ' said milgram , who voted against the standards as part of the committee that reviewed them . ` if you do n't think craziness will result , then you 're being fundamentally naive . ' under common core , parents are likely to see some unfamiliar terms on their children 's elementary-school math homework . here are some examples drawn from new york state 's math curriculum : . second grade . addition : solve using your place value chart and number disks , composing a 10 when necessary : 53 + 19 . subtraction : craig checked out 28 books at the library . he read and returned some books . he still has 19 books checked out . how many books did craig return ? draw a tape diagram or number bond to solve . are these comparisons true or false?a -rrb- 2 hundreds + 3 ones > 5 tens + 9 ones ______ b -rrb- 9 tens + 2 hundreds + 4 ones < 924 ______ c -rrb- 456 < 5 hundreds ______ . third grade : . what is another way of expressing 8 × 12 ? a. -lrb- 8 × 10 -rrb- + -lrb- 8 × 2 -rrb- . b. -lrb- 8 × 1 -rrb- + -lrb- 8 × 2 -rrb- c. -lrb- 8 × 10 -rrb- + 2d . 8 + -lrb- 10 × 2 -rrb- . the number of objects described in which situation can be represented by 24 ÷ 4 ? a . there are 24 boxes with 4 pencils in each box.b . there are 24 people on a bus , and 4 people get off the bus.c . there are 24 marbles that need to be sorted into 4 equal groups.d . there are 24 books on a shelf , and 4 more books are put on the shelf . what number sentence is another way to represent the missing number in the equation 36 ÷ 4 = ? a. ? × 4 = 36b . 36 × 4 = ? c. 36 + 4 = ? d. ? ÷ 4 = 36 . fourth grade . multiplication : represent the following expressions with disks , regrouping as necessary , writing a matching expression , and recording the partial products vertically : 3 x 24word problem : cindy says she found a shortcut for doing multiplication problems . when she multiplies 3 × 24 , she says , ' 3 × 4 is 12 ones , or 1 ten and 2 ones . then there 's just 2 tens left in 24 , so add it up and you get 3 tens and 2 ones .
