{"text": "one night last november , when we arrived home from school , mummy and daddy told us that they had heard strange sounds from the area behind our garage . we put on our wellies and ran excitedly across the grass , past the chickens and the pond , to the back of the garden where daddy parks his car . balancing on top of the builders ' rubble and our old bikes was a pile of sparkly boxes . he 's the genuine article : scott and megan met the real santa claus at his snowy home at the top of the planet . there was a small one labelled ` megan ' , a slightly bigger one labelled ` scott ' , a bigger one still labelled ` mummy ' , and the biggest one of all labelled ` daddy ' . we tore off the silver ribbon and bows and opened the boxes . each one contained a jumper with a picture on it . megan and daddy had a snowman , scott had a father christmas and mummy had a sparkly penguin . in ours we also had a rolled up sheet of thick paper , tied with a red bow . daddy unrolled it and read what it said . written in swirly hand writing , like we 'd seen in old books , it said : . dear megan and scott . i hear from my robins that you have been very good this year . i 'd like you to come and meet me at the north pole . your mummy and daddy can come too . it 's very cold , so i have asked my elves to send you some new jumpers to keep you warm . see you soon ! lots of love , santa x . for a moment we did n't quite understand . then mummy and daddy explained . we had been written to by the real santa claus , and he 'd posted us the boxes and the letter from his home at the north pole . we 've both seen all the helpers who look like santa that appear around town at christmas . but this was the real santa , really inviting us to visit him in his real home at the real north pole . and he 'd sent us new jumpers to keep us warm . we could n't believe how lucky we were . thank goodness we 'd been good ! a few weeks later mummy and daddy drove us to the airport in bristol . santa had sent a special plane to collect us and some other lucky children . we were worried it would take a very long time , but by the time we 'd watched a film and done some colouring we were there . when we arrived at the airport at the north pole we had to collect our suitcases , but before they arrived we spotted two elves with pointy ears who had been hiding under the place where the bags go round . jumpers required for big adventures : scott and megan with mum kirsty and tv presenter dad martin roberts . they were very naughty elves , because they kept tapping people on the back and then running away . it made us laugh a lot . all around the airport it was snowy . there was a man dressed in funny clothes that mummy said everyone would have worn here years ago . he had a pet reindeer . we gave it a carrot . it looked a bit like sven from frozen . in fact , everything looked frozen . we got on a coach that took us to the place we were staying . on the way , some different elves made us sing silly songs . after half an hour mummy and daddy said the songs were driving them mad . but we carried on singing . our hotel was made from wood . the room was really big and had a tv . there was a kitchen where mummy could cook our tea . the best thing was that the room had a balcony that was covered in snow that came up to our tummies . there were lots of other wooden hotels all around , and a place we went to for our breakfast . there was even a supermarket . we did n't think they would have a supermarket at the north pole - especially one that sold dvds . that night we went for a ride on special machines that could go through the snow . they were like the ones from scott 's star wars lego . daddy drove one , and we snuggled under a blanket in another with mummy . we went through the car park and out into the forest . eventually we arrived at a place where there was a bonfire and a man who gave us hot chocolate with marshmallows in it . the grown-ups said we had come to see the northern lights , but someone had switched them off . the next day we got on another coach and went to a secret place in the forest . there were loads of fun things to do , like sledging , rides on a sleigh pulled by real reindeer , and a funny show starring the elves . but then we got into a special sledge that was pulled by an elf on a sort of motorbike for the snow . a bit different to a sleigh ride : a snowmobile ride in search of the northern lights was also part of the holiday . we went down a path through the trees to a clearing where there was a little wooden house . inside the house , sitting beside a roaring fire , was the real santa claus . he looked the same as lots of other santa clauses we 'd seen , but his tummy was even bigger and his beard even longer and whiter than anyone else 's . somehow he knew our names , and he asked us what we wanted him to bring us on christmas night . he said we could take a picture and gave us an early christmas present . on the way home we heard mummy and daddy say that it had cost a lot , and that the food ` left a bit to be desired ' . we did n't understand what they meant . santa had invited us to come for free . and as for the food - it was better than eating snow , and the hotel was at the north pole , so the person cooking would have to find things to cook in the forest . and anyway , on christmas day we got exactly what we had asked santa for , so it was worth it . i hope we get invited again this year , although santa did say that there were a lot of children in the world that he wanted to invite , so it 's ok if we do n't as we 've already had our turn . and if any silly boys or girls at school say ` there 's no such thing as santa claus ' , we will know they are fibbing , because we have met him . santa 's lapland -lrb- www.santaslapland.com , 01483 791945 -rrb- offers a range of holidays to lapland . a three-day trip to the finnish village of saariselka costs from # 499 per person , including return flights , transfers , half-board accommodation , private family meeting with santa and gifts for under-13s , and a full day 's activities .", "summary": " scott and megan roberts , aged 6 and 4 , were ` invited ' to visit santa claus .   they visited father christmas at his home at the north pole -lrb- well , lapland -rrb- .   garish christmas jumpers were required -lrb- well , it can be chilly that far north -rrb- .
