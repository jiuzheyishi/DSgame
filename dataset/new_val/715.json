with their findings mainly based on the discovery of broken glass by a housekeeper . the shots were reportedly only connected to the white house four days later when a housekeeper noticed broken glass and a chunk of cement lying on the floor inside . less than a week later , mrs obama , who had arrived back in washington from hawaii after spending the veterans day weekend with her husband , reportedly arranged a meeting with then-secret service director dan sullivan . during the encounter , she addressed mr sullivan so sharply that she could be heard through a closed door , the post reported . angry : president obama was ` infuriated ' by the secret service 's response to the shooting . president obama , who was continuing from hawaii to australia , was also said to have been ` infuriated ' by the secret service 's response to the shooting . one day after the broken glass was spotted , ortega-hernandez , from idaho , was arrested . he was later sentenced to 25 years in prison after pleading guilty to firing an assault rifle at the white house . although prosecutors had initially charged ortega-hernandez with attempting to assassinate president obama , they agreed to drop the charge as part of a plea deal last year . the post alleges that some secret service officers knew immediately that shots had been fired into the white house , but that they were ` largely ignored ' . ` some were afraid to dispute their bosses ' conclusions ' that the shooting was not directed at the white house , it said . the agency allegedly conducted only a cursory inspection of the white house for evidence or damage , while key witnesses were not interviewed until after bullets were found . the suspect was able to park his car on a public street , take several shots and then speed off without being detected , the post noted . it added that it was ` sheer luck ' that ortega was identified as the shooter , mainly because the troubled and jobless 21-year-old wrecked his car seven blocks away and left his gun inside . the recent allegations were unearthed by the post following interviews with agents , investigators and government officials , as well as the review of hundreds of documents . it comes just a week after omar gonzalez , 42 , was arrested inside the presidential residence with a knife in his pants after making it over the fence and running across the lawn , the secret service said . president obama and his family were not in the mansion at the time . previous incident : last week , omar gonzalez , 42 , was arrested inside the presidential residence with a knife in his pants after making it over the fence and running across the lawn -lrb- pictured -rrb- , the secret service said . white house pair : gonzalez , a 42-year-old iraq veteran -lrb- left -rrb- and kevin carr , a 19-year-old college student -lrb- right -rrb- were both arrested after trying to get into the white house within 24 hours of one another . less than 24 hours later , kevin carr , 19 , was taken in by officers after allegedly driving a car up to a screening point then refusing to leave when he was asked . the two attempts to gain entry to the white house prompted the secret service to increase security by stepping up patrols around the building . it has been suggested they could set up security checkpoints around the building for the public . in a statement to the associated press , the secret service said it ` implemented both personnel and structural enhancements ' following a review of the 2011 incident . it also employed ` other physical and technical enhancements , including additional surveillance cameras . ' a secret service official , who requested anonymity for lack of authorization to comment for attribution , said the delay in understanding what happened that night was not the result of misconduct or incompetence . instead , they said it was ` an uncertain situation ' that included echoing shots from a quarter mile away and confused initial witness reports . ` i 'm not saying this was our shining moment , but we never stopped looking for this guy , ' the official said .", "summary": " oscar ramiro ortega-hernandez fired at least seven bullets at white house .   president barack obama 's daughter and wife 's mother in mansion at time .   secret service officers rushed to respond , with one withdrawing handgun .   but then told , ` no shots have been fired ... stand down ' , by their supervisor .   agency ` took four days to conclude that a gunman had targeted residence '   obama and wife michelle were ` infuriated ' by response in november 2011 .   comes just a week after man wielding knife jumped the white house fence .
