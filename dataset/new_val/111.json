{"text": "premier league match delegate steve greaves -- whose report backed referee martin atkinson in all of his key decisions during chelsea 's controversial clash with burnley -- will only return to his role next week ... when chelsea face west ham . sportsmail can reveal that the 45-year-old is not on match duty this weekend but will be in the stands at upton park assessing andre marriner and his assistants next wednesday . that means he will again be returning his verdict on decisions involving jose mourinho 's men . this studs-up tackle from ashley barnes infuriated nemanja matic and jose mourinho backed up his player . nemanja matic will miss the capital one cup final after martin atkinson sent him off . the match delegate backed up atkinson 's calls and will be in his role when chelsea face west ham next week . born in chelsea , steve greaves made his professional debut with fulham in the late eighties . he made only one appearance for the cottagers and also played a handful of times for ipswich town , preston north end and scunthorpe united . he retired because of injury at 23 and later played for non-league sudbury afc . in 2006 he was appointed assistant academy manager at ipswich having previously coached their youth team . two years later he moved to stevenage as assistant to graham westley before joining southampton 's youth set-up , where he coached the likes of luke shaw , calum chambers and james ward-prowse . he left in 20013 before taking up his role as a premier league match delegate . and in a further twist , we can reveal that chelsea will cite evidence from a match in which greaves was the assessor when they bid to overturn nemanja matic 's red card from saturday 's 1-1 draw with burnley at stamford bridge . mourinho was furious with atkinson after he felt his side deserved two penalties in the first half and that ashley barnes should have been sent off for kicking out at branislav ivanovic . but it was atkinson 's failure to punish barnes for his high tackle on matic which led mourinho to label the challenge ` criminal ' . matic was red carded when he retaliated by shoving the striker and now faces a three-match ban . chelsea have appealed the suspension which starts with the capital one cup final this weekend . they are expected to point to swansea 's successful appeal over wayne routledge 's dismissal following his reaction to a dangerous challenge from qpr 's karl henry on new year 's day . ironically , greaves ' report was used in that instance . barnes catches branislav ivanovic with his right boot during an aerial challenge in the 30th minute . ivanovic fires a shot at goal but his effort was blocked by the raised arms of michael kightly . chelsea may point to wayne routledge 's appeal as they look to overturn nemanja matic 's sending off - greaves report was used in the game between qpr and swansea . but the former southampton academy coach is sure to have upset mourinho after reporting that atkinson was correct in each of his key decisions at the weekend . on the first penalty claim in the 32nd minute for a handball by michael kightly , greaves -- who had access to tv replays - wrote in his report : ` correct decision as ball hit with pace from close range and did n't see it as deliberate . ' before half-time chelsea appealed for another penalty when diego costa went down after a challenge by jason shackell . greaves wrote : ` both in real time and on dvd my opinion is that costa is looking to go down as soon as contact is made . however , shackell does put his hands on him so appreciate your thoughts !! also to note , ref ca n't actually see shackell 's hands on costa . ' youtube/officialburnleyfc . atkinson was heavily criticised during and after the game as chelsea drew at home to burnley on saturday . on the matic sending off and barnes challenge , he returned : ` in super slow mo it obviously looks awful , but in real time live and dvd barnes catches him as follow through from the challenge . -lrb- does barnes mean to harm him ? - only he knows -rrb- also , looks worse because matic has his foot planted ... ' greaves , meanwhile , was also on duty during the controversial 2-2 draw between qpr and manchester city in november , a match in which charlie austin had a goal ruled out after joe hart 's two-touch free-kick -- which led to the goal - was correctly deemed in breach of the rules .", "summary": " match delegate steve greaves wo n't be on match duty this weekend .   greaves backed up all of martin atkinson 's decision at chelsea .   he will again be returning verdict when west ham host chelsea next week .   chelsea will cite evidence from a match in which greaves was the assessor -lrb- qpr vs swansea -rrb- when they bid to overturn nemanja matic 's red card .
