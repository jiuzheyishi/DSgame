{"text": "humans through the ages have wondered what it is like to be a bird but now hi-tech headwear has revealed the complex hunting strategies of falcons . u.s. scientists got a bird 's eye view of falcons ' attack strategies by fixing helmets containing tiny cameras to the heads of the birds , which also wore backpacks to record footage of their predatory flights . they discovered that falcons catch prey in mid-flight by manoeuvring so that their target seems as if it is stationary , which allows them to make their attack with precision . scroll down for video . the scientists worked with 13 falconers in europe and the u.s. to capture footage of aerial attacks from the birds ' point of view -lrb- pictured chasing a crow -rrb- and painstakingly logged the position of the birds in each frame of video to reconstruct their attack techniques . adult falcons have thin tapered wings , which enable them to fly at high speed and to change direction rapidly . falcons intercept their prey in mid-air after following it at a distance . they keep their target in the centre of their field of vision . to conserve energy , falcons . readjust their flight position so that their prey appears to be . motionless in relation to the surrounding landscape , . this helps them . predict the future position of their victim . falcons are able to intercept their prey in less time than if they tail it in a straightforward way . bats and dragonflies use a similar hunting technique . researchers from haverford college , pennsylvania explained that the hunting technique allows the birds to intercept their prey in mid-air , without having to follow it closely - giving the predators the element of surprise . the scientists worked with 13 falconers in europe and the u.s. to capture footage of aerial attacks from the birds ' point of view and painstakingly logged the position of the falcons in each frame of video to reconstruct their attack techniques . by comparing the position of the targets in the falcons ' visual field , they were able to map the bird 's flight path . researchers from haverford college , pennsylvania explained that the hunting technique allows falcons -lrb- pictured -rrb- to intercept their prey in mid-air , without having to follow it closely - giving the predators the element of surprise . this revealed that if the prey appeared at the centre of the falcon 's field of view , the falcon was probably intending to attack it from a distance and was keeping an eye its target 's every move . however , the birds also used more complicated strategies . suzanne kane , from the university , told live science , said : ` this strategy of heading straight toward the prey at all times is easy to implement , but it involves following a very winding pathway and it turns out to be a very inefficient way of catching prey . ' to boost efficiency , the predatory birds readjusted their flight position so that their prey appeared to be motionless in relation to the surrounding landscape , which helped the falcons predict the future position of their victim and conserve energy . the falcons were able to intercept their prey in less time than if they tailed it , professor kane said . during pursuit , the falcons appeared to . head off their prey using a strategy called motion camouflage , meaning . they intercept the prey in the least amount of time while also masking . its approach . the scientists discovered that falcons catch prey in mid-flight by manoeuvring so that their target seems as if it is stationary , which allows them to make a targeted attack . here , the landscape is blurred , but the falcon has zeroed in on its target - the crow -lrb- pictured centre -rrb- . researchers from haverford college , pennsylvania -lrb- pictured with professor suzanne kane , author of the study , centre -rrb- explained that the hunting technique allows the birds to intercept their prey in mid-air , without having to follow it closely , to give it the predators the element of surprise . previous studies have shown that bats and dragonflies use the same technique . professor kane explained that the falconers made special hoods so that the cameras were fixed tightly to the birds ' heads , but did not impede their view . ` we had some birds who did n't want to wear them , but overall most were unconcerned with the cameras and tolerated the equipment just fine , ' she said . the research , published in the journal of experimental biology , was based upon data from eight different falcons making flights in the u.s. belgium , the netherlands and the uk . the scientists now aim on investigating other aspects of falcon hunting behaviour , including how the birds select their victims from a flock . professor kane said : ` falcons are magnificent , charismatic animals and the falcon 's - eye videos of their hunts are very exciting . ` i can still say that , even though i have spent hours studying them frame by frame using image analysis software . ` this is truly nature red in tooth and claw . there is something really primal and moving about watching that elemental struggle between predator and prey .
