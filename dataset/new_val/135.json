{"text": "the united states is now the world 's biggest supplier of oil overtaking the world number one , saudi arabia , according to latest output figures . a surge in us oil output , which includes natural gas liquids and . biofuels , has swelled 3.2 million barrels per day -lrb- bpd -rrb- since 2009 . the spike in oil production is the fastest expansion over a four-year period since saudi arabia 's output surge from 1970-1974 , energy analysis firm pira said in a statement . lead supplier : the u.s. has overtaken saudi arabia as the world 's leading supplier of oil , including crude , natural liquid gas and biofuels . pictured , a well pumping oil in an field near ponca city , oklahoma . it was the latest milestone for the us oil sector caused by the shale revolution , which has upended global oil trade . while still the largest consumer of fuel , the rise of cheap crude available to domestic refiners has turned the united states into a significant exporter of gasoline and distillate fuels . last month , china surpassed the united states as the largest importer of crude , according to the us government , as the rise of domestic output cuts the u.s. dependence on overseas oil . ' -lrb- the us -rrb- growth rate is greater than the sum of the growth of the next nine fastest growing countries combined and has covered most of the world 's net demand growth over the past two years , ' pira energy group wrote . while the u.s. trails several other nations for crude oil production and stockpiles imported crude at the st james terminal , pictured , near baton rouge , la. , on the mississippi river , it has ramped up production of shale . ` the us position as the largest oil supplier in the world looks to be secure for many years , ' it added . total liquids produced by the united states , which pira defined broadly to include supplies such as crude oil , condensate , natural gas liquids and biofuels , should average 12.1 million bpd in 2013 , pushing it ahead of last year 's no. 1 supplier , saudi arabia . output from the opec state also rose last year , but the gains lagged those from the united states , the consultancy said . shale production remains a controversial industry in the u.s. however , due to fears over the impact on the environment . pictured , artist and musician sean lennon at a gas drilling site in pennsylvania during an ` artists against fracking ' tour of gas drilling sites in upstate new york and pennsylvania . pira said the increase in oil from . shale , which has been centered in areas such as eagle ford in texas and . the bakken in north dakota , has seen u.s. supply grow by 1 million bpd . in 2012 and again 2013 . the . united states still lagged both saudi arabia and russia in production of . just crude oil by abut 3 million bpd , pira noted . rounding out the top . 10 oil suppliers were china , canada , uae , iran , iraq , kuwait , and . mexico . fracking involves injecting a mixture of water , sand and chemicals into the ground at high pressure to crack shale rock holding oil and gas reserves deep underground . it generates around 43 per cent of oil and 67 per cent of the current natural gas production in the united states . first , engineers drill down through up to 10,000 feet of earth to reach a shallow layer of shale . they then turn their drills sideways to bore thousands of feet horizontally . then vast amounts of sand and chemicals are pumped into the hole under high pressure - a technique called hydraulic fracturing - which creates fissures in the shale . the fissures allow the gas locked in the shale to escape back along the pipe and up the well to the surface . fracking in the us first began in 1949 . according to the us department of energy as of 2013 at least 2million oil and gas wells in the us had been hydraulically fractured . concerns . there are fears , however , that toxic chemicals used in fracking may contaminate underground water supplies , a problem which will only grow as fracking proliferates , environmentalists warn . case studies have shown that residents living near some fracking sites can ignite water that comes out of their taps . tests in wyoming found high levels of methane , ethane , diesel and phenol in water supplies which could have been caused by nearby fracking . concerns also surround increases in earth tremors , believed to be caused by injecting fluid at high pressure into geological structures .", "summary": " us oil output has surged in last four years overtaking the world leader .   total oil supplies include natural gas liquids , crude and biofuels .   ramping up of shale production played major part in output surge .   us is world 's largest fuel consumer , but china is biggest crude importer .
