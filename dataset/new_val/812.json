' ` we 're tories , we believe in low taxes . and believe me -- we will keep on cutting the taxes of hard-working people . ' david cameron . tory strategists believe mr miliband made a major blunder in his speech last week by shifting decisively to the left , proposing 1970s-style price fixing in the energy market , state seizures of undeveloped land and penalties for businesses who fail to take on trainees . in his 50-minute address , mr cameron said labour had comprehensively lost the economic argument and it was clear to all that the economy was ` turning the corner ' . he said : ` there was a time when i 'd look across to ed balls and he was shouting his head off , screaming that the economy was flatlining with such glee . ` but recently , it 's gone a bit quiet . could it be because there was no double dip and the economy 's growing ? ' key note speech : mr cameron and his wife samantha wave to crowds following his address . mr cameron said the last government had left behind a ` casino economy meets the welfare society meets the broken education system ' . business , he pointed out , had already created 1.4 million new jobs since the last election and must be helped , not deterred . ` profit , wealth creation , tax cuts , enterprise : these are not dirty , elitist words -- they 're not the problem , they are the solution , because it 's not government that creates jobs , it 's businesses . ` you do n't do this job to be popular . you do it because you love your country . i do the best i can . ' david cameron . ' i know that bashing business might play to a labour audience . but it 's crazy for our country . ' mr cameron said he knew voters were asking whether the ` struggle ' of the past few years of austerity had all been worth it . he said : ` here 's the honest answer : the struggle will only be worth it if we as a country finish the job we 've started . ' to abandon deficit reduction now would throw away ` all the progress we 've made ' , the prime minister insisted . ` how did they -lsb- labour -rsb- get us into this mess ? ` too much spending , too much borrowing , too much debt . and what did they propose last week ? ` more spending , more borrowing , more debt . reprise : mr cameron 's speech echoed a 1987 speech from then pm margaret thatcher . history repeating ? the tories last won an election outright with a similar sentiment - one that saw john major 's conservatives beat off a challenge from neil kinnock 's labour party . ` they have learned nothing -- literally nothing -- from the crisis they created .

' david cameron . ` and for me it comes back to some simple things -- country first , do what 's decent , think long-term . ' it was not enough simply to clean up labour 's economic ` mess ' and pay off the deficit , he said , the conservatives wanted to ` build something better in its place ' . the conservative leader also sought to march onto centre-ground territory , where his party has traditionally found it difficult to make inroads against labour -- promising to drive industrial regeneration in the north of england and positioning the tories as the true defenders of the nhs . listening : -lrb- left-right -rrb- michael gove , theresa may , and george osborne listen intently to mr cameron 's speech . support : william hague , iain duncan smith and jeremy hunt applaud following mr cameron 's speech . after the scandal of the mid-staffordshire hospital trust , where hundreds of patients died , the conservatives would take no lectures from labour on the nhs , he said . he even praised the ` noble calling ' of social work -- promising to get more top-flight graduates into the profession . and the prime minister sought to assure tory troops that he is fighting for a majority tory government , not another power-sharing administration with the lib dems . john cridland , head of the . confederation of british industry , said mr cameron had ` sent out a . strong message about how vital british business is to the future . prosperity of people across the uk ' . but labour vice-chairman michael dugher said : ` there 's a cost-of-living crisis and he 's got nothing to say about it . ` rather . than standing up for hard-working people he has always puts a . privileged few first , prioritising a tax cut for those earning over . # 150,000 while everyone else pays more .
