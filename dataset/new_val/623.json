' ofgem analysis shows that the average bill stood at # 1,320 this month , up # 70 or 5.6 per cent on the same month last year . the price hikes will add # 50 to every family 's bill with some households seeing annual rises of more than # 100 . wholesale energy costs -- which make up the singled biggest part of the bill - have barely changed , up just 1.67 per cent or # 10 in a year . vat , operating and other costs make up # 1,255 of the bill , up # 40 or 3.29 per cent . however the biggest increase is the average net profit margin made on bills , up 111 per cent from # 45 in 2012 to # 95 now . caroline flint , labour 's shadow energy secretary , said : ` energy companies always blame rising global energy prices for putting up people 's bills , but these figures show that under david cameron they 've been increasing their profits on the back of spiralling energy bills for hard-pressed households . ` if energy companies wo n't treat . their customers fairly , then people deserve tough action from the . government . but david cameron shows how out of touch he is , refusing to . act . that 's why labour would freeze energy bills for 20 months and . create a tough new watchdog with the power to force energy companies to . cut their prices when the cost of energy falls . ' prime minister david cameron is under pressure to tackle soaring energy bills but came under fire last week when he suggested ` rolling back ' green levies which he claims are pushing up prices . the revelation will fuel public anger at near double-digit rises in bills at a time when wages are up by around one per cent . ofgem admits that overall wholesale costs have soared in the last decade , up by around 140 per cent for electricity and 240 per cent for gas . although in the last year wholesale costs have barely changed . however , power firms insist that future prices for them to buy in supplies for this winter have risen . the wholesale price of gas for use this winter is 8 per cent higher than the price of gas for use last winter , ofgem says . the wholesale price of electricity is 13 per cent higher . mr cameron sparked a furious coalition row last week when he vowed to ` roll back ' the green levies which he says are forcing up bills . over many years ` extras ' have been added on all bills to pay to help the elderly heat their homes and cut the cost of energy efficiency measures like insulation . ofgem estimates that in the last decade environmental and social costs have risen from # 10 to over # 100 on the average bill . in the last year they have risen by around # 10 to # 115 of an average annual dual fuel household bill . more increases are expected . however , the energy firms disputed the way ofgem calculated the figures . british gas said : ` the prices that individual suppliers pay depend on their own hedging strategies , and the ofgem methodology is , at best , an approximation of what those hedging profiles are . ` we buy a certain amount of gas more than two years in advance , and if you look at the 24 month figure to october 2013 , there has been an 18 per cent increase in the wholesale cost . ' sse insisted it was ` simply false ' to suggest wholesale costs had not risen . a spokesman added : ` this is very much a global market and we are seeing increased international competition for supplies , which is putting up prices .
