{"text": "like a king with a royal proclamation , the inventor of the gif file format has put an end to all debate over how his invention 's name shall be pronounced . or so he wishes . ` it is a soft  g ,  pronounced  jif .  end of story , ' said steve wilhite . the man who gave the world the quintessential meme-making file type hath spoken . but was there really that much question ? in a word : yes . so says he : steven wilhite , inventor of the gif , accepts a webby lifetime achievement award may 21 . he says his invention is pronounced with a soft ` g. ' once just a part of the jargon of hardcore computer enthusiasts , how to properly say gif has been debated since it was invented in 1987 as a means of neatly compressing images . it has since become synonymous , with the help of a famous dancing baby , with brief and catchy animated images . you need only visit a tumblr page or peruse any buzzfeed article to see how ubiquitous the once nerdy name has become . and you need only run a google search for ` how to pronounce ' to see how active the pronunciation war remains . before you 've even hit the ` g , ' the engine has already guessed what you were thinking . the internet is rampant with websites , blogs , and articles dedicated to the question of how to pronounce the shortened form of graphics interchange format . choosy : an image by the heavy gif users at buzzfeed concurs , likeing the pronunciation to that of the ubiquitous peanut butter . a tumblr dedicated to the question exists , though it comes to no solid conclusion . there is also the gif pronunciation page , which takes the side of mr. wilhite , who purportedly uses the mnemonic device ` choosy developers choose gif , ' to remind everyone it 's a soft ` g ' just like the peanut butter . there 's also a youtube video on the subject . even the president of the united states has taken a stand . when the white house debuted its own tumblr page in april , it posted a graph of what to expect on its new microblog . among the offerings was ` animated gifs -lrb- hard  g  -rrb- ' . and that is , if you were wondering , the other way to speak the term . a hard ` g ' like in ` gift . ' partisanship : barack obama , disagrees . the official white house tumblr promises ` animated gifs -lrb- hard  g  -rrb- ' but do n't mention that to wilhite . and do n't try to say both are correct , either . ` the oxford english dictionary accepts both pronunciations , ' mr. wilhite said in an email interview with the new york times . ` they are wrong . ' wilhite 's invention has won him much praise over the last 25 years and even more in the last five or so as meme culture has embraced the file as a means of quickly and easily moving messages motivated by everything from comedy to politics across the web . wilhite was even honored tuesday with a lifetime achievement webb award in recognition of inventing the file format . in the words of the official webby website : . ` the proliferation of the gif within today 's meme-powered , tumblr-driven pop culture , proves it a lasting format still among the most celebrated on the web -lrb- despite the hotly contested controversy over its correct pronunciation -rrb- . with 2012 being the 25th anniversary of the gif we think the 17th annual webby awards is a most fitting event to honor and celebrate steve wilhite and this historical achievement . ' brave : but even in the face of tyranny and elitism , the gif 's inventor stands firm . ` the oxford english dictionary accepts both pronunciations ' he said . ¿ they are wrong . ¿ .", "summary": " steven wilhite accepted a life time achievement webby award on may 21 for giving the gift of the gif to the world .
