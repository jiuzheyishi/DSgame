{"text": "steven gerrard had just given one of his finest liverpool performances when he was asked a question that stopped him in his tracks . having scored two goals to inspire a 4-0 demolition of real madrid in the champions league , steven was soaking up the atmosphere inside anfield when raul , the legendary spain striker and emblem of madrid , came up to him . he congratulated him and then got straight to the point . ` will you come and join us next season , steven ? ' asked raul . video scroll down to watch funny steven gerrard impressionist and rodgers praising him . staying put : steven gerrard has been at liverpool for the whole of his career . holy grail : could gerrard lift the premier league trophy this season ? that offer , which was made five years ago this week , was not the first he received to leave liverpool , nor was it the last , but it illustrated how the powerhouse clubs in europe viewed him - a big-game player who produced the big moments exactly when they were needed . of course , there was never any chance of stevie going to madrid , but had he done so it would have been impossible to begrudge him the opportunity . those with his quality deserve to perform on the biggest stage and deserve to have trophy cabinets that are full to the brim . had he chosen to leave , he could have doubled his collection of 11 major honours . if , say , he had joined chelsea when the chance first arose in 2004 -- the same year manchester united tentatively enquired about him -- stevie would have lifted the barclays premier league trophy three times . my only advice to him back then , when chelsea ramped up their efforts , was to look at the big picture . he could have gone to stamford bridge and returned with all kinds of medals but when he eventually returned home to liverpool , how would he have been viewed ? would liverpool fans have congratulated him ? would they have been happy to see him be successful ? given the rivalry between the clubs , it would have been impossible . that 's why one title with liverpool would mean more to him than 10 anywhere else . ultimately , he was right to stay ; 12 months after that first offer from chelsea , stevie got his hands on the biggest prize of all in istanbul . he immortalised himself with his performances that season , most notably in the champions league final against ac milan . no go : gerrard was asked by raul when he was going to join the spanish giants . it could have been so different : chelsea made a move for gerrard but he opted to stay at liverpool . tittle winner : gerrard could have won the premier league title if he had moved to chelsea . when you think about it , though , his loyalty to liverpool has been unbelievable . had he not come from this city , i do n't think for one moment he would have stayed , particularly given that liverpool have n't been anywhere near the champions league for five years . i do n't believe he needs the medal to cement his legacy but if you are a genuine football fan , for everything he has done over the past 15 years , you should want to see him complete his collection . there are parallels with his current situation to how it was for bryan robson at united in the early 1990s , a club captain who had enjoyed great success , led his country with distinction but had found the one honour he craved most of all frustratingly out of reach . robson was still united 's driving force when they mounted their first real assault on the title in 1991-92 , but their quest to end a 25-year wait was shattered at anfield when liverpool won 2-0 . stevie could easily find himself in a similar position on sunday . if chelsea beat aston villa and liverpool lose at old trafford , i feel a 10-point gap would be too difficult to overhaul , but stevie is going into this make-or-break collision playing some of the best football of his career . he has been questioned at times this season and there was even a theory liverpool would be better off without him after they blitzed tottenham 5-0 in december , but such talk about a man who has scored in each of the four major cup finals and at two world cups was nonsense . without any kind of fuss , he has slotted into what has been called ` the pirlo role ' and dictated liverpool 's play , showing his exemplary range of passing . it is the latest role he has mastered . he is a player who grandfathers will tell their grandchildren about . we love foreign players who can star in a variety of positions . we hear about how they have been well-schooled but what about stevie ? he has thrived as a no 10 , a deep-lying central midfielder , on the right flank or at right back . he could even play as a central defender and do n't forget fabio capello used him on the left for england . landing the big one : gerrard 's won the champions league with liverpool in 2005 . here to stay : gerrard speaks with then liverpool manager rafael benitez after committing his future to the club in 2005 following interest from chelsea . silver lining : gerrard has won every domestic trophy in his time at anfield - except the premier league . there has been talk he will end his international career after the world cup but he is still england 's first-choice midfielder and i ca n't see anyone emerging to dislodge him . jack wilshere and jordan henderson are the new kids on the block but they are still playing catch-up . leading england to brazil is something i know he is very proud of , but nothing would make him prouder than leading liverpool to a first title since 1990 . full steam ahead : gerrard will lead england in brazil . the next generation : jordan henderson and jack wilshere could be the future of england 's midfield . after the rafa benitez era was over , we both felt our chance to become champions of england had gone . certainly when brendan rodgers became manager , that feeling was even more acute as we knew it was a new project that would take a while to get going , so to be in this position is not something stevie is going to want to let slip . captain marvel : bryan robson went years at united without winning the league title . job done : robson finally got his hands on the premier league title in 1993 . followers of chelsea and manchester city will disagree -- so , too , will manchester united fans and evertonians -- but there would be no more romantic end to this season than seeing stevie lift the premier league trophy at anfield on may 11 . for his quality and loyalty , it would cap a glorious career . it was a privilege to be in the nou camp on wednesday to see the exhilarating battle between lionel messi and vincent kompany . earlier this season , after his colossal display against manchester united , i said kompany had given one of the best performances i 'd seen by a central defender , and had city managed to get through to the last eight , i would have said the same again . star turn : lionel messi played a big part in barcelona beating manchester city on wednesday . dink of delight : messi scores at the nou camp against city . to see him playing with such power , presence and understanding , it reminded me of marcel desailly at his best . he was like a man playing against boys . his signing for # 6million in 2008 must rate as city 's best value-for-money signing of their modern era . but it has to be noted that kompany was marking a messi who was only playing at 70-80 per cent of his maximum . you could see him walking around for long periods , protecting himself so he did n't suffer any further hamstring problems . marked man : vincent kompany gets to grips with messi . dejected : kompany reacts after his team 's defeat in barcelona . when messi came alive , though , he was a joy to watch . he was always aware of what was going on around him and he produced six or seven pieces of play that took the breath away . when he got the chance to finish the tie , there was never a sense he would miss . we must all hope that messi does not get plagued by hamstring trouble because he could light up the world cup this summer . if he produces in brazil what we have seen him do for barcelona , argentina will have an outstanding chance of winning their first title since 1986 . what 's more , if messi peaks in june and july , we 'll be talking about the greatest player of all time . a fortnight has flown by since my last column and once again i 've had plenty of things to keep me busy . 1 dinner with roy hodgson - it was good to catch up with my old manager in barcelona . he 'd been to watch manchester city 's champions league game and , after i 'd finished my duties with sky , we had a bite to eat . he is relishing going to the world cup . good catch up : jamie carragher went for dinner with his former manager roy hodgson in barcelona . 2 watching some authentic football - marine , who play in the evo-stik northern premier league , are based not too far from where i live and last weekend i took my son , james , to see them play ashton united . marine lost 1-0 but it was an enjoyable game and we will go again . 3 starting a new playing career - it was good to be involved in the ` game against poverty ' with a host of stars 10 days ago in switzerland but earlier this week i stepped on to the five-a-side court for the first time . it certainly got the old legs moving ! star turnout : carragher joined ronaldo , luis figo , zinedine zidane and a many more stars in the match against poverty . 4 tuning into the six nations - i 've become more interested in rugby union since my visit to twickenham last month and the action this afternoon promises to be riveting . fingers crossed england get the convincing win they need to become champions . final chance : stuart lancaster and england go into their final game with italy with a chance of winning the six nations . 5 waiting for the great escape - i will be at old trafford to see if manchester united can retrieve a difficult situation against olympiacos and that will evoke some memories . liverpool , of course , needed a dramatic victory against the greek side on the way to the champions league final in 2005 . can united do the same ? you beauty : gerrard celebrates scoring for liverpool against olympiacos in 2004 to earn a 3-1 win .", "summary": " liverpool man has had plenty of chances to leave anfield but stayed loyal .   gerrard could end england career this summer - but who will replace him ?   if he did not come from liverpool he would have left the club ages ago .
