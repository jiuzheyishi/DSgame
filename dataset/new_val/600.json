{"text": "and to think this was not deemed attractive enough for television . what more do they want ? the league one conquerors of chelsea versus another terrified top-flight opponent , old boys rejected by sunderland with a score to settle , a deafening capacity crowd and a pitch which even cattle would turn their noses up at . and boy , did it deliver -- a beautifully ugly contest , blood , studs and thunder from the off . goalscorer jon stead is mobbed by his team-mates james hanson and billy clarke after scoring bradford 's second goal at valley parade . stead gets beyond sunderland defender john o'shea to score against his former club and double bradford 's advantage . stead puts his finger to his lips while celebrating his goal after continuing his run of scoring in every round of this season 's fa cup . stead is all smiles after notching his ninth goal of the campaign to put bradford firmly in control of the fifth round tie at valley parade . billy clarke jumps for joy after his shot took a hefty deflection off john o'shea for bradford 's first goal after just three minutes . clarke -lrb- centre -rrb- fires across the shot that deflected off o'shea -lrb- no 16 -rrb- and into the net to hand bradford the early advantage . sunderland goalkeeper vito mannone was totally wrong-footed by o'shea 's deflection on clarke 's shot and ca n't keep it out . bradford city -lrb- 4-3-1-2 -rrb- : williams 7 ;
