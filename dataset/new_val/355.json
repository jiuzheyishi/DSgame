{"text": "bionic mother corinne hutton will become the first person in the uk to have a double hand transplant in september . when ` bionic mum ' corinne hutton had both hands and feet amputated because of a devastating illness she promised her five-year-old son she would be re-built . one year later she 's been true to her word . the 44-year-old had two hi-tech prosthetic legs fitted , she was recently given a # 35,000 robot hand and now she 's had the go ahead for the final and most astonishing piece of the remarkable human reconstruction . mrs hutton is to undergo the uk 's first double hand transplant later this year . the operation will be carried out by professor simon kay , the same surgeon who successfully performed the first single hand transplant last year . and if all goes well son rory will ` get his mummy back ' as promised . businesswoman mrs hutton , of lochwinnoch , renfrewshire , set up the charity finding your feet within days of losing all four limbs in june last year . thanks to the funds raised through her charity , the outdoor enthusiast , who has previously run a marathon , has already managed to ride a bike and is determined to be walking and running in the hills again before long . mrs hutton was accepted for the publicly-funded life-changing surgery at leeds general infirmary after undergoing rigorous physical and psychological tests . if the operation goes well mrs hutton should get some sensation in her hands immediately , but it could take many months for the new hands to settle down and function to improve . the mother-of-one will take anti-rejection drugs for the rest of her life . however , she believes she is in a win-win situation . ` i thought with a transplant they 'd cut away my wrists and if it failed i 'd be much worse off . but they said the donor 's hands would attach to my wrists and therefore if it fails i 'm no worse off . ' mrs hutton , who owns a glasgow-based graphics company , said she had already spoken to the first hand transplant patient mark cahill , 51 , about the operation . ` i 've been told that it 's psychologically tough . i like to think that i 'd be grateful to whoever had given me those hands . i spoke to mark and he agreed that was his angle on it . ' mrs hutton , who is mother to five-year-old rory , lost both hands and lower legs in june last year , when a bad cough turned into pneumonia and septicaemia and her vital organs began to shut down . the 44-year-old already has two bionic hands , allowing her to carry out day-to-day tasks , as well as a pair of ` cosmetic ' hands . the double hand transplant surgery -- likely to be carried out in the autumn - will involve four surgical teams and skin from the donor 's forearms will be used to cover scarring on mrs hutton 's arms . professor kay said the operation will be more complex than surgery on mr cahill but he told the bbc he believed the results will be ` exceptional ' . it will certainly cap an astonishing transformation from the moment when doctors gave mrs hutton just a 5 per cent chance of survival as she fought for her life in hospital . ' i just want to be a normal mum who can do normal things for rory and normal things with rory ' - corinne hutton . her ordeal began when a bad cough turned into pneumonia and septicaemia . her vital organs began to shut down . mrs hutton was flown down from glasgow to a specialist unit in leicester . she was linked up to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation -lrb- ecmo -rrb- machine to oxygenate her blood and it saved her life . she returned to glasgow , but the illness and her treatment starved her hands and feet of blood and the devastated mother required a quadruple amputation . her hands were cut off from the wrists and her legs from below the knees . mrs hutton bravely endured seven operations , spending 30 to 40 hours in theatre , but immediately set about getting back on her feet . the first stage of mrs hutton 's re-building operation took place earlier this year when she travelled to dubai to be given two state-of-the-art prosthetic legs costing # 16,000 . it is set to be completed this september when mrs hutton becomes the first person in the uk to have a double hand transplant . mrs hutton 's operation will be carried out by professor simon kay , the same surgeon who completed the first successful single hand transplant on mark cahill , pictured , last year . she formed a charity to raise funds to help her and other people in her situation and so far it has raised around # 200,000 from a variety of events . the first stage of her re-building operation took place earlier this year when mrs hutton travelled to dubai to be given two state-of-the-art prosthetic legs costing # 16,000 . then earlier this month she was fitted with a ` bionic ' left hand , which picks up signals from her brain telling her to point a finger or clench her fist . ` i 've learnt to do a lot of things , i can use my smartphone , i do my own make up with both hands , i can dress myself , but there are a lot of things i ca n't do , ' said miss hutton , who also has fake ` cosmetic hands ' . she said her son had ` got his mum back ' , adding : ` i just want to be a normal mum who can do normal things for rory and normal things with rory . ' that process should be complete with the ground-breaking double transplant operation .", "summary": " corinne hutton lost both hands and lower legs in june last year .   44-year-old 's bad cough turned into pneumonia and then septicaemia .   she has two bionic hands and a pair of cosmetic hands allowing her to carry out day-to-day tasks including applying her make up and using her phone .   but in september mrs hutton is expected to become the first person in the uk to undergo a groundbreaking double hand transplant operation .   mother to rory , five , has already had state-of-the-art prosthetic legs fitted .   last year mark cahill became the first hand transplant patient in the country .   the same surgeon , professor simon kay , will carry out mrs hutton 's surgery .
