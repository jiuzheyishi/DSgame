{"text": "emmanuel adebayor was drinking from a coconut and harry kane was shuffling on the bench . it 's hard to imagine either of them making the kind of mess of the game-changing chance that came roberto soldado 's way during the first half . he went through on goal at 0-0 and was caught between thoughts of passing to nacer chadli or shooting . in that moment , he forgot his prime function in this team and also forgot how to pass . such is the lot of a striker without great confidence ; such is the frustration for a manager -- you make a choice and be damned . roberto soldado reacts after missing a golden chance to open the scoring for tottenham . soldado showed his fragile confidence by playing a soft pass to nacer chadli instead of shooting . spaniard watches as his tame pass fails to reach chadli during the europa league last 32 decider . soldado knows immediately that he made the wrong decision with the goal at his mercy . mauricio pochettino knew people would be wondering about the shooting star on his bench . he also knew that if kane , fresh and ready , turns up and grinds chelsea into the wembley dirt on sunday then all will be forgotten . indeed , he would be the ` genius ' who figured it all out . pochettino knows better than anyone that such rash judgements have always run always through football . win and you 're smart ; lose and you 're stupid . win on sunday and you picked the right team on thursday , regardless of how you did in florence . he summed it all up rather neatly on wednesday afternoon when he was asked to explain the dilemmas of selecting a side to play a hard game in europe four days before a potentially season-defining cup final . ` if you make the rotation and on sunday you win , you are a genius . sunday you may rest some players and play others and win the final -- genius . if you lose in italy and the final , you are a bad manager and coach . ` i 'm the same coach but when you take a decision sometimes you are right or wrong , but this is football . we take a decision to try to win tomorrow and play better than fiorentina . after we analyse again and try to put the best team out for the final on sunday . ' mauricio pochettino knows that he will be judged on results during this crucial three day period . tottenham 's leading scorer harry kane started on the bench with the capital one cup final on sunday . emmanuel adebayor did n't travel to florence , but posted a picture of him drinking from a coconut at home . it is a black and white view , except here he found a shade of grey . it remains to be seen what kind of a beating he will take . this was neither an excessively strong side nor one you would say was a cop out to rest players for the weekend . kane was the notable omission and you could also make reasonable predictions that ryan mason , danny rose and kyle walker will start at wembley . they were all on the bench in florence , with as many of seven of the starters good bets to line up from the beginning against chelsea . so the numbers were good . but there is no escaping that the club 's most incisive player was on the bench for a game against a team unbeaten in 10 . more to the point , tottenham needed to score to simply stay alive , the consequence of the away goal they conceded at white hart lane last week . pochettino will point to the subtleties of a decision few can fully understand . they alone will know how tired kane is after leading this team in his breakthrough season . kane was eventually introduced but his second half strike was ruled out for offside . the spurs academy graduate has gone from reserve striker to the club 's most valuable player this season . the inquest begins between tottenham players as their european dream fades away . football is full of players pushed too hard too soon . and in a team that has played 43 games this season -- more than any other barclays premier league side -- fatigue needs to be managed carefully . but there have been no indications that kane , in particular , is carrying injuries or struggling with his workload . the only indications are that he is a player who scores goals when they are needed . they were needed on thursday night as a chance went begging in a competition that rewards its winner with champions league football . of course it is the kind of short-term thinking that pochettino dislikes . if he scores on sunday , no doubt all will be forgiven . chelsea loanee mohamed salah rips off his shirt after scoring fiorentina 's second to send the italians through .", "summary": " tottenham were knocked out of the europa league by a 2-0 -lrb- 3-1 agg -rrb- loss .   mauricio pochettino gambled by leaving in-form harry kane on the bench .   roberto soldado wasted a golden opportunity to give spurs the lead .   tottenham face chelsea in the capital one cup final on sunday .
