{"text": "if you 're a fan of gears of war , then judgment promises not to disappoint . but for those looking for revolutionary gameplay , emotional storytelling and deep , multifaceted level design , you may want to look elsewhere . make no mistake , new developer people can fly - behind the brilliant bulletstorm - have honed and perfected everything that makes a gear of war of game great . sadly , given how far the third-person genre has come since the gears ' inception in 2006 , the welcome changes and modifications ca n't hide the tired gameplay . all together now : most of the time , your teammates ' ai works well but the same ca n't be same for the locust . set as a prequel and told in flashback after the events of emergence day , plot follows the adventures of kilo squad as they endeavour to save halvo bay from a locust chief called karn . familiar faces cole and baird are joined by new recruits sofia hendrik and garron paduk . unfortunately , although it 's interesting seeing the youthful exuberance of cole and baird , character development pales in comparison to its predecessors . there are no moments - such as the devastating death of dom 's wife maria in the second game - that stick with you . instead , battles are largely forgettable - but that 's not to say they 're not fun . there are more enemies on screen than ever before and ai is -lrb- largely -rrb- smart enough to stop you camping and gunning down locust at ease . levels are now split up into sections - each one containing a ` declassifed ' optional mission . here , you can choose to add a variant to the level - for example allowing a toxic gas to impair vision or replace easier enemies with tougher ones . successful completion of levels and declassified missions rewards you with medals - which essentially act as bragging rights to other gears players . this , coupled with levels featuring frequent mini ` hordes ' -lrb- where you must take on waves of enemies -rrb- makes the entire thing feel more ` arcade-like ' than ever before - a move that may jar with some hardcore fans . what will be universally appreciated , though , are the visuals . judgment is easily the prettiest of the bunch . whether it 's watching baird grimace as he mangles a locust with his chainsaw lancer or roadie-running across intricately bump-mapped cobbled streets , judgment is a visual tour-de-force . multiplayer , too , is a triumph . overrun mode - where a team must stop a horde of locust troops from opening emergence holes - is a particular highlight . this coupled with an easy-to-use class and xp system means there 's still plenty of life left after the 10-or-so hour campaign draws to a close . death from above : enemies come at you thick and fast making firefights exciting . but by the end of the campaign you would have had your fill . there 's no denying that judgment is a good third-person shooter , and , if released a few years back it would be one of the greatest . but gamers ' demands have caused the third-person genre to evolve - with many wanting more than just gunning down enemies , walking to another room and doing the same over and over again . the game has changed and gears are beginning to grind . gears of war : judgment is out now in the us and released on march 22 in europe . watch the latest trailer here : . follow us on twitter : @dailymailgames and on facebook : daily mail games .", "summary": " new developers people can fly have tweaked gameplay to perfection .   visuals are the best in the series .   not a particularly engaging story and lack of character development .   gameplay feels slightly stale and ` arcade-like ' level design may jar with hardcore fans .   strong multiplayer - especially overrun mode .
