{"text": "from clumsily eating a bacon sandwich to posing in a ` feminist ' t-shirt made by exploited female labour , ed miliband 's public appearances during recent months have been a catalogue of gaffes . few of these moments have been more awkward than his spontaneous decision to give some loose change to a young beggar while he walked along a street in manchester last week . if this was an attempt to parade his decency , it backfired disastrously . instead of looking compassionate , he came across as foolish , opportunistic and embarrassed . scroll down for video . founder of the big issue john bird , who says giving money to beggars does nothing to alleviate their plight . much attention has focused on the reportedly small sum he gave the girl , later identified as a 14-year-old romanian immigrant . miliband has also attracted criticism for the disdainful look on his face as he handed over the cash , as if he were repelled by his own action . yet that air of self-disgust was appropriate . for miliband knew only too well that he was doing the wrong thing . the key problem was not the size of his donation , but the fact that he actually handed over any money at all . mr bird 's comments come after labour leader ed miliband was pictured dropping money into a beggar 's cup outside manchester town hall . it 's a familiar predicament when we 're faced with another desperate-looking figure huddled on the street , palm outstretched . it 's only human to feel that impulse to help -- to give a few coins to alleviate another 's misery -- and , all too often , for that impulse to override the quiet voice which asks : am i really helping ? the answer is no . giving to a beggar might momentarily salve the donor 's conscience , but in the longer term it does absolutely nothing to alleviate the plight of the recipient . on the contrary , it locks the beggar in a downward spiral of abject dependency and victimhood , where all self-respect , honesty and hope are lost . indeed , by reinforcing the beggar 's pitiable condition , a donation is really an act of cruelty rather than kindness . if there is one thing most beggars detest more than people who refuse to give , it is those who do . i should know , because i was a beggar for much of my early life . growing up in an irish immigrant family in london with a father who made it his life 's mission to single-handedly prop up the drinks trade , i first experienced homelessness at the age of five , and between the ages of seven and ten was raised in an orphanage , supplementing my meagre pocket money with what i could get on the streets . mr bird says that reinforcing the beggar 's pitiable condition , a donation is really an act of cruelty rather than kindness . begging descended into crime , and through my teenage years i was in and out of prison . but it was that background which gave me the determination to do something for the homeless beyond the usual mix of counter-productive financial concern and judicial punishment -lrb- begging and rough-sleeping have been illegal here since the 16th century -rrb- . what i wanted to do was something that would give the destitute a sense of purpose . so , in 1991 , i came up with the idea of the big issue magazine , a product which people could sell for a decent profit . the big issue represented dynamic street trade , not degraded street aid . instead of remaining passive , dependent victims , the sellers would become active merchants , gaining discipline , self-worth and honesty . the initiative was widely adopted here and abroad , transforming institutional attitudes to homelessness . i am still gaining insights into how well the scheme can work . the other day , i met up with an old mate called mark dempster . more than 20 years ago , he was a real hard-case : an alcoholic drug-dealer who lived on the streets and had served time in prisons all over the world . mr miliband made his donation while walking through manchester with shadow transport secretary mary creagh , left , and manchester withington candidate jeff smith , right . thanks to the self-respect the big issue gave him , he cleaned up his act , escaped his destructive habits and became a responsible adult . he is now a harley street specialist in drug and drink addictions , helping others to break free as he did . the alternative -- embodied in ed miliband 's desperate move -- of people giving money to those who simply sit on the street asking for money , only worsens the begging problem . moreover , such an approach amounts to a collusion with criminality , for not only is begging illegal under a host of laws , such as the 1824 vagrancy act , but it is often accompanied -- as in mark dempster 's example -- by other law-breaking , like drug possession , theft , disorderly conduct , and even violence . so there is no doubt that giving to beggars worsens criminality by encouraging the destitute to remain outside the margins of society . most of the homeless are mentally ill or in the throes of addiction , so cash enables them to spend more on drink or drugs . alternatively , they can become part of an organised gang that exploits the public 's generosity . that is why i often say the big issue is a also ` crime reduction initiative ' , because it helps to steer the magazine vendors away from the possibility of sliding into illegal behaviour . this is true even of the large number of romanians who now sell the big issue on british streets ; on my estimates , one in five of all big issue vendors is east european . now , understandably , many british people strongly object to this trend . why on earth are we , a small country with overstretched public services , importing destitution on such a scale from eastern europe ? the beggar was later revealed to be 14-year-old rebeca state , who lives with her aunt as her parents have returned to romania . that is a question not for the big issue organisation , but for the politicians such as ed miliband who opened the sluice gates and insisted , for ideological reasons , on open borders within europe . they are the ones who decided the romanian poor and homeless should be allowed to settle here . at least the big issue gives them work , an income , a roof over their heads and a route away from crime . but that does not mean i am blind to some of the excesses and abuses . unfortunately , thanks to the ill-conceived bureaucracy of the welfare system , some bulgarians and romanians have been allowed to exploit their positions as vendors to gain self-employed status , opening the way to a raft of income-related welfare benefits . that is certainly true in the case of the girl beggar who mr miliband met in manchester . rebeca state , 14 , lives with her aunt , livia stoica , in rented accommodation ; her parents have returned to romania because of a family illness . as a ` self-employed ' big issue seller six days a week , ms stoica can claim # 550 a week in welfare . but again the big issue should not be the organisation under attack . it is up to the politicians to close the loopholes over self-employed status and access to social security . this whole case shows the laxity of the authorities ' approach . ms stoica might be within her rights to claim welfare as a self-employed individual , but she should certainly not be allowing her 14-year-old niece out on the streets to break the law by begging . are social services and the police investigating ? if not , why not ? and why is rebeca , still only a child , not in school or back with her parents ? mr bird estimates that one in five people selling the big issue on the street are of eastern european decent -lrb- file picture -rrb- . i fear the answer is there is far too much sentimentality and cowardice in our political system , which has been ruthlessly exploited by society 's parasites . i have absolutely no time for the pathetic , bleeding-heart mentality so prevalent these days -- and which destroys traditional concepts of morality and justice . i firmly believe that anyone who breaks the law or abuses our generosity should be deported -- not protected by the morally perverted human rights regime which allows them to remain in this country on the basis of their so-called ` right to a family life ' . indeed , early this year i led calls for the deportation of razvan dumitru , a romanian big issue seller based in north london who robbed a blind pensioner of # 50 when she tried to pay him for the magazine . for this sickening crime , he was sentenced to just four months in prison . but it is the politicians who created this mess , through their contempt for our borders , reluctance to uphold our laws , and remorseless expansion of our welfare benefits . ed miliband 's desperate donation is a classic illustration of warped priorities and lack of ethical rigour . he should be ashamed of himself .", "summary": " john bird co-founder the big issue in 1991 after being a beggar himself .   says that ed miliband should never have gave money to beggar last week .   explains that giving to beggars is not an act of kindness but one of cruelty .   adds that it does nothing to alleviate the plight of the recipient .
