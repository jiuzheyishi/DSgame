{"text": "health risk : painkillers used by millions of britons have been linked to higher risk of irregular heartbeat that could trigger a stroke -lrb- file picture -rrb- . painkillers used by millions of britons have been linked to higher risk of irregular heartbeat that could trigger a stroke . the extra chance of developing atrial fibrillation is as high as 84 per cent , dutch researchers say . the condition -- a leading cause of first-time strokes -- means the upper chambers of the heart are out of rhythm and beat much faster than normal , which allows blood to pool and clot . at least seven million britons with arthritis take prescription painkillers , including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs -lrb- nsaids -rrb- such as diclofenac and ibuprofen , and newer medication called coxibs . in the study , the heart health of 8,423 people aged 55 and older was tracked since 1990 in rotterdam . cases of atrial fibrillation were diagnosed using heart tracer recordings , while the details of drugs prescribed were gathered from pharmacies . the average age of the study participants was 68 , and just over half were women , says a report in the online journal bmj open . during the average monitoring period of just under 13 years , 857 participants developed atrial fibrillation . of these 261 had never used nsaids when they were diagnosed , while 554 had used nsaids in the past , and 42 were currently taking these drugs . current use was associated with a 76 per cent greater risk of atrial fibrillation than for those who had never taken nsaids . age , sex and underlying heart problems were taken into account . use of the painkillers within the preceding 30 days was linked to an 84 per cent greater risk of atrial fibrillation . while there was a trend for higher doses to be linked to higher atrial fibrillation risk , the finding was not statistically significant . anti-inflammatory : at least seven million britons with arthritis take prescription painkillers , including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs -lrb- nsaids -rrb- such as diclofenac and ibuprofen -lrb- pictured -rrb- . it is thought nsaids may contribute to heart rhythm problems by increasing blood pressure as a result of fluid retention . bruno stricker , of the erasmus medical centre in rotterdam , said previous research had thrown up a link between atrial fibrillation and these painkillers . ` our results also suggest that the increased risk occurs shortly after starting treatment and may disappear over time , ' he added . nsaids work by blocking the cox-2 enzyme which reduces pain and inflammation , but is also important in regulating heart function . there were 17million prescriptions for nsaids in the uk in 2010 . ibuprofen can be bought from pharmacists and supermarkets , along with voltarol tablets containing diclofenac but at far lower doses than on prescription . around ten years ago the anti-arthritis drug vioxx was voluntarily taken off the market because of an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes . professor colin baigent , of the clinical trial service unit and epidemiological studies unit at oxford university , said : ` this study is consistent with previous reports indicating that some nsaids increase the risk of atrial fibrillation . ` atrial fibrillation is just one of several cardiac hazards associated with nsaids , the most important of which is an increased risk of heart attacks . on sale : there were 17million prescriptions for nsaids in the uk in 2010 . ibuprofen can be bought from pharmacists and supermarkets , along with voltarol tablets -lrb- pictured -rrb- containing diclofenac . ` although nsaids are very effective for . the treatment of pain , it is important that both risks and benefits are . considered carefully before they are prescribed . ' oxford researchers last year found that high doses of nsaids can increase the risk of heart attacks , strokes and heart failure . their study confirmed the existence of a ` small but significant ' extra risk of dying from heart problems after prolonged use . the research , published in the lancet medical journal , found naproxen was the safest nsaid . researchers looked at the highest doses of painkillers prescribed by doctors , twice the daily amount recommended for headache and other minor ailments . they said a short course of tablets bought over the counter for a muscle sprain was unlikely to be hazardous . the study pooled the findings from 639 trials after numerous small trials showed a link between nsaids and heart side effects .", "summary": " painkillers may raise risk of irregular heartbeat that could trigger stroke .   extra chance of developing atrial fibrilliation as high as 84 % , says study .   condition means the upper chambers of the heart do not beat in rhythm .   it is leading cause of first-time strokes as it allows blood to pool and clot .   at least seven million britons with arthritis take prescription painkillers .
