' the challenge now is for tottenham 's two leading outfield forces to take on a fresher , stronger chelsea side . the 5-3 home win over mourinho 's side in january is still fresh in the mind . ` we showed that we can beat them , ' eriksen said . now eriksen must show chelsea what they might have won . * eriksen was speaking at a tottenham hotspur foundation event highlighting the education and football development centre programme , which provides academy-standard coaching alongside btec and fa level qualifications to create life-changing opportunities for young people aged 16-18 not in education , employment or training . visit tottenhamhotspur.com/foundation . kane and chelsea 's diego costa -lrb- left -rrb- will carry their team 's goal scoring expectations at wembley .", "summary": " tottenham face chelsea in the capital one cup final on sunday .   christian eriksen was rejected as a youngster while on trial with the blues .   denmark star has been impressed by harry kane 's breakthrough .
