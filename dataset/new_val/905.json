{"text": "happily ever after : pro-marriage campaigner harry benson and his wife kate , who argue that policy must be changed to support married couples . children are more likely to be in single-parent families in britain than anywhere else in western europe , figures have revealed . almost one in four live with a lone mother or father , compared to about one in six across the rest of the eu . britain is now ahead of belgium , denmark , ireland and france , where the number of youngsters living with just one parent is dropping -- or rising more slowly . the figures point to the dramatic impact of family breakdown and have been linked to a ` meteoric rise ' in cohabiting relationships . a pro-marriage group is calling on politicians to do more to encourage couples to wed -- and stay together . the marriage foundation obtained a breakdown of the most recent figures -- for 2012 -- from the eu 's statistics arm eurostat . according to its analysis published yesterday , 24 per cent of dependent children in the uk lived in single-parent families -- up three percentage points on 2010 and marginally ahead of belgium . the figure for belgium , rounded to 24 per cent by eurostat , was up by just two percentage points since 2010 . in denmark , france and ireland , the percentage fell . the only eu country with a higher figure than britain was the eastern state of latvia , where sky-high divorce rates have pushed up the number of single parents . in britain , by contrast , divorce rates have been falling and family break-up is largely a matter of collapsing cohabiting relationships . harry benson , of the marriage foundation , said : ` while most lone parents do an amazing job with fewer resources , few have chosen lone parenthood as their lifestyle choice . ` our research clearly shows that in the uk 's case -- and that of other countries in western europe -- this rising rate of lone parenthood is a symptom not of a rising divorce rate , but instead by the meteoric rise in the numbers of children brought up by unmarried parents . ' he said it was ` essential ' for policymakers to face up to the realities of a generation brought up in single-parent households to avert a ` host of negative social and economic implications ' . he added : ` western europe policy must focus on supporting existing marriages . being brought up in a stable two-parent household is essential in affording children the decent start in life they deserve .

' children who have been through break-ups are said to be less likely to do well at school and more likely to suffer from adverse effects such as poor physical and mental health , unemployment and drug abuse and crime . couples are married in only 56 per cent of british families , according to the results of the 2011 national census . meanwhile , the number of cohabiting couples with children has risen to more than a million . such relationships are estimated to be three times more likely to end in break-up than marriages , and a typical cohabiting relationship that does not lead to marriage lasts no more than three years . marriages , by contrast , last 11 years on average and a high proportion of couples are separated only by death . david cameron has spoken regularly about the need to encourage marriage . but so far coalition ministers have offered only a minor tax break , worth up to # 200 a year , to lower-income married couples . some senior tories , including former chancellor lord lawson , have called for fully transferable tax allowances for married couples with children .", "summary": " in 2012 around 24 per cent of uk children lived in single-parent households .   eastern state of latvia was only country in europe to have higher figure .   campaigners call on government to do more to make sure couples marry .
