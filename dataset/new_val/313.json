{"text": "a failing nhs hospital has won a major health award just two years after it was rescued by a private firm . hinchingbrooke had been described as a ` basket case ' for running up debts of # 40million while letting standards plummet . but , in an extraordinary turnaround , it has been voted top in the country for patient care . scroll down for video . hinchingbrooke had been described as a ¿ basket case ¿ for running up debts of # 40million while letting standards plummet . areas assessed included mortality levels , readmission rates and speed in dealing with cancer cases . the cambridgeshire hospital , which is run by circle , expects to break even this year and produce a small surplus in 2015 . its success is a blow to labour leader ed miliband who last week claimed the nhs was going backwards thanks to private sector involvement . julie bailey , the founder of cure the nhs who helped expose the mid staffordshire neglect scandal , said : ` what this shows is the potential of allowing those on the frontline to lead , as circle do . ` the potential is there within the nhs -- the majority of people would n't care who provides their services as long as it was safe . ' hinchingbrooke , which is in huntingdon and serves 160,000 patients , was described as a ` financial and clinical basket case ' by then health minister earl howe in november 2011 . the cambridgeshire hospital , which is run by circle , expects to break even this year and produce a small surplus in 2015 . the royal college of surgeons branded the 369-bed hospital ` dysfunctional ' . it was among the lowest ranking trusts in the region for patient satisfaction . waiting time in accident and emergency regularly exceeded four hours and every target for suspected cancer patients to be seen within a fortnight had been missed since june 2010 . circle took over in february 2012 -- the first private contract for an nhs hospital -- on a ten-year deal and quickly saw results . it topped a ranking of 46 trusts in the midlands and east anglia for a&e waiting times , with 98.2 per cent of patients seen within the required window . it was fifth for referrals for cancer tests . its success is a blow to labour leader ed miliband who last week claimed the nhs was going backwards thanks to private sector involvement . a key to the transformation was loosening the grip of managers and accountants . the majority of the 15 board members are now clinicians . doctors , nurses and admin staff have also been put into small groups which have representatives who meet senior managers twice a month to flag up problems . nurses can recommend that consultants adjust the way they work . patients are asked for feedback and any problems must be dealt with within three weeks . circle 's john lewis-style blueprint could be adopted at other failing hospitals , although insiders believe no decision will be taken until after the general election . circle reduced the annual # 10million deficit to # 3.5 million in its first year -- and made up the difference with its own money . this dropped to # 1million last year and the trust , whose chief executive steve melton is a former argos supply chain director , expects to break even this year before moving into the black in 2015 . a spokesman said : ` the biggest chunk of the savings was from improving quality . bad quality care exposes you to lots more litigation for mistakes . patients also stay longer than necessary or have to come back for further treatment . locum costs have also dropped . there is a 50 per cent premium for temporary staff and the hospital had problems with recruiting as people did n't want to work there . ' private firms already own and run limited units for the nhs . circle operates day-surgery units in nottingham where routine operations including hip and knee replacements are carried out -- but the wholesale takeover of a hospital had never been approved previously . huntingdon conservative mp jonathan djanogly said : ` before this contract was in place there was an annual deep breath about what was going to happen and whether the hospital was going to survive . ` now there 's a future for the hospital and we know through the security of the contract that they can operate for a certain period . i do n't know where that leaves ed miliband . ' hinchingbrooke was the only small hospital on a chks group quality care awards shortlist of five on tuesday . the 12 indicators looked at by an expert panel also included rates of emergency readmission , discharge within 56 days of emergency admission for strokes and discharge within 28 days for hip fractures . mr melton said : ` two years ago , hinchingbrooke suffered from a series of problems so severe it faced imminent closure . now , thanks to the incredible efforts of our leading doctors and nurses , we are the top-ranking hospital for quality of care in the whole of england . ` it is clear proof the growing number of hospitals in special measures across the nhs can be transformed too , staying open to deliver the critical services their patients need . ' a department of health spokesman said : ` patients should get the best possible care , regardless of who provides it . ' looked after : phil martin at the hospital . living only a short distance from hinchingbrooke hospital , phil martin had heard plenty of ` horror stories ' from other patients . but after seven major operations in the space of a few weeks , his own experience could n't be more different . the grandfather-of-two said his treatment had been ` spectacular ' since he was admitted with septicaemia caused by a cyst . ` it 's been absolutely first class . i could n't have asked for more , ' said the 61-year-old from eaton socon , near st neots . ` the first time i came in as an emergency walk-in they apologised and said it would be 90 minutes . when i was in intensive care ... i had two nurses looking after me full-time . ` now i 'm on a general ward i am with five other people and we are well looked after . i am always kept in the picture and staff are very reactive . ' the father-of-four , a widower who is chairman of a purchasing consortium , was in acute pain when he was admitted five weeks ago and underwent several procedures to save his life . he spent nine days in an induced coma and was moved to a general ward last week . speaking from his hospital bed yesterday , he added : ` i have n't experienced any of these horror stories . yesterday i was bored out of my skull so i started drafting a couple of letters about people who deserve to be commended . ' the hospital also received glowing reviews from lilian carris . she had ` hated ' her first stay at the hospital in 1999 and when she was put on to a mixed-sex ward with seven other patients . but the 65-year-old was overwhelmed by the remarkable turnaround at the hospital when she was readmitted earlier this year . mrs carris said the exceptional level of care was so good that many older patients ` did not want to leave ' . after being admitted in february following a severe asthma attack , the mother-of-one said she ` could n't believe ' the number of nurses and doctors constantly on hand to provide assistance . ` they were n't there just to care . they were investigating all the possibilities of what was wrong with me , ' she said . she said the standards at the hospital are ` so much better ' than when she had her appendix removed there 15 years ago -- and said even the food is ` excellent ' , with patients offered five choices for each course and allowed to order 24 hours in advance . relatives are not limited to strict visiting times , common at many nhs hospitals , and are allowed to see patients when they wish .", "summary": " hinchingbrooke ran up debts of # 40million while letting standards plummet .   it has been now been voted top in the country for patient care .   areas assessed included mortality levels and readmission rates .   the cambridgeshire hospital is run by private firm circle .   it expects to break even this year and produce a small surplus in 2015 .
