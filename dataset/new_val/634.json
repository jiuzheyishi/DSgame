{"text": "the piano man was once on top , finding glory and fortune as one of the top-selling songwriters worldwide . in luck and love , the entertainer has suffered for the longest time , and over three marriages billy joel let a lot slip through his fingers thanks to depression and drink . a new biography comes out this week that , according to page six , involved 100 hours of interviews by writer fred schruers before joel exited the project . scroll down for video . tops : billy joel , who has sold more than 150 million records worldwide , found his love life and career dogged by drinking and depression . in ` billy joel : the definitive biography , ' the singer lays bare his history of suicide attempts , his tumultuous marriages -- including one to supermodel christie brinkley -- and how he 's now trying to keep his life together . joel met his first wife , elizabeth weber , in 1970 and was smitten from the start . ` she was n't like a lot of the other girls i knew at that time who had taken home ec and cooking classes , ' he recounted . ` she was intelligent and not afraid to speak her mind , but could also be seductive . ' joel began a relationship with her , in spite of the fact that weber was married to jon small , the drummer of joel 's short-lived duo attila , with whom she had a young son named sean . when small uncovered the infidelity , weber split , leaving both him and joel . while her husband was left alone , it was joel who took her disappearance the hardest . one day , joel took a fatal dose of the anesthetic nembutal and phoned small to apologize . ` the next thing i remember , i woke up in the hospital and learned that they had pumped my stomach , ' he told schruers . rough waters : joel said in the book that he fell in love when he first met elizabeth weber , who cheated on her husband jon small , with joel , before leaving both . it was small who saved joel 's life , rushing to joel 's mother 's long island home , finding joel lying on the floor and getting him medical attention . another suicide attempt ended with joel checking into a mental health center , where he found himself surrounded by others who were not as lucky . ` the people i was locked up with were never going to be able to overcome their problems , whereas mine were all self-made . i can fix this , i thought . ' weber returned , to joel this time , not small , and began to manage the songwriter 's career , which began to take off even as he medicated his depression with a steady stream of alcohol . though friends found weber controlling and brusque , joel was enchanted , writing singles such as ` she 's got a way ' and ` she 's always a woman ' for her . joel describes the relationship now as a transaction . he says when he debuted ` just the way you are ' for her on her birthday , she asked him deadpan ` do i get the publishing , too ? ' inspiration : weber inspired three singles , but christie brinkley , who joel married in 1985 inspired all of an innocent man . beauty : brinkley had been featured on three back-to-back sports illustrated swimsuit edition covers when she met joel in st bart 's and went on to star in a number of his music videos . the relationship entangled weber 's brother frank in the finances as well , and years after she and joel finally divorced , the songwriter found frank had siphoned $ 30million out of his fortune . ' i hooked up with the borgias ! ' said joel . ` what a family to pick . ' shortly after things ended with weber in 1982 , joel was vacationing and met his second wife during an unreal encounter on the caribbean island of saint bart 's . sitting down at a piano , joel caught the attention of elle macpherson and then-unknown whitney houston . tagging along was their companion , christie brinkley . joel later later said ' i kind of felt like a teenager all over again ' when he returned to new york and started dating both brinkley and macpherson , the latter actually was a teenager when he met her . brinkley was asked to star in the music video for uptown girl , leading to the pair growing closer together . in 1985 , brinkley and joel married and he dedicated the album an ` an innocent man ' to her , though the declaration proved to be questionable in later years of their relationship . third time : joel reportedly picked up katie lee in a hotel lobby when she was a college student , before the two married in 2004 . striking : joel said he took lee to a performance of his own musical during one of their first dates , though she did n't know who the fading songwriting star was then . touring constantly to make up for his past financial struggles , joel became worn down by a life on the road and strained the marriage . one night in 1993 , after a concert at nassau coliseum , rather than go home to brinkley , joel booked a hotel . a band member told brinkley that joel was unfaithful that night , a claim joel denies but one that led to his eventual split with her . ` christie likes to joke that the end of the marriage spelled the end of my songwriting career , ' joel said , but it became a reality , as the next two decades saw him write and record very little . instead , he drank and spiraled into depression . he had three car accidents between 2002 and 2004 , which he once blamed on 911 and denied the involvement of alcohol . his romantic partner at the time was katie lee , who was in college when he flirted with her in the lobby of the peninsula hotel . according to an interview in the new york times , one of their first nights out was to joel 's own broadway musical , movin ' out . the two married in 2004 , when lee was 23 and joel was 55 , moving into a $ 4million penthouse in tribeca together . while the relationship did n't spur joel to new songwriting endeavors as it had with his past two wives , but it did eventually unravel just the same . joel was in and out of rehab , but at lee 's insistence went back on tour , often playing shows with elton john . lee herself became a fixture in the art scene . one day joel saw a photo of her dancing with another man at a gallery showing at art basel miami , though she rebuffs any accusations of an affair . joel could not handle his jealousy , and lee seemed uninterested in couples counseling that he suggested . ' i realized , it 's not going to happen , ' joel said , and told her ` we 're over . just do n't send me messages , do n't leave me cute little phone calls , do n't tease me , do n't f -- with me , just end it . ' ` i 'm an old man now , a vulnerable man . do n't do that to an old guy . ' the pair divorced in 2009 . it now seems the man once described by music critic robert christgau as a ` force of nature and bad taste ' has cut back on his time in the spotlight . though he released an album of classical compositions in 2001 and in spite of still touring arenas , joel has n't released studio music for a solid two decades . his drinking and depression have still not been resolved , at least according to the man himself , who in spite of numerous trips to rehab says he still has the occasional drink . he 's somewhat humbled from his days of dating supermodels , and is living with a girlfriend , 33 and a former hedge fund manager , but he says he remains a romantic . ` you can have all the money in the world , you can have mansions , you can have properties , you can have yachts , you can have limousines , you can have motorcycles , ' he told schruers . if you do n't have love , ` it does n't mean a goddamn thing .
