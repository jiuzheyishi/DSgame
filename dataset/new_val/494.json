' the wooden pallets have been hammered together over the previously green grass - now destroyed into mud - and the shacks have been built on top . hard at work : michael watkins , 29 , washes dishes on a hand built work surface as part of the occupy protests . protestors have even mapped out ` roads ' through the camp made of pallets topped with pieces of old carpet . they have also erected a gazebo reception area with chairs and cushions and boards listing their aims . there are currently six shacks , including a communal kitchen area where food is prepared . occupy bristol is the largest protest of its kind outside of london . the first occupy protest began in september in wall street , where police in riot gear raided the camp and evicted dozens of protestors . but hours later the national lawyers guild obtained a court order allowing the protestors to return with their tents . in britain , the city of london corporation has attached eviction notices to tents on the public highway near to st paul 's cathedral . they told protestors to leave the area before 6pm yesterday or legal proceedings would be issued in the high court . one protestor , named only as matt , 22 , insisted that the camp would soon be developed into a wooden city right in the heart of bristol . he said : ` eventually we want to get rid of all the tents and live in these wooden structures .

' the very rev dr david hoyle , dean of bristol cathedral , also called for the protestors to leave . he said : ` the first of the structures went up over a week ago and since then they have built more . ' it is of no surprise to me . they have . said all along that they are going to stay here and they are now making . it more physically evident . solidarity : protesters pitch their tents at the second occupy glasgow camp in blythswood square . long haul : -lrb- left to right -rrb- glasgow protesters marina gray , emma kane , mark porciani and susan , who did n't give her surname . ` it has become more visible and people are reacting to that . ` at the moment we have no plans to evict them but we are asking them to leave and we have done that formally .

' nathan cravens , 27 , who runs the camp library , said : ` the general feeling is excitement at the moment . it 's brought us together . ' the eviction notice was issued after u.s. police cleared the occupy wall street movement camped in new york which had inspired the british protest . but legal experts said clearing the british protest is expected to be a protracted legal battle that will rack up a huge legal bill . adam chapman , head of public law at kingsley napley , said because of the human rights act it could drag on for months . he said : ` it will cost at least # 10,000 to get it to the high court and if there is a lot of going back and forth with appeals as we expect , it will run into the hundreds of thousands . ' with the added costs of policing the protest for months and clearing up the mess made by protesters , the total bill to the taxpayer is expected to hit # 1million . demonstrators have been camped outside st paul 's since october 15 after an attempt to occupy the nearby london stock exchange failed . similar camps have also been set up in other parts of the country , including a camp in the grounds of exeter cathedral . st paul 's cathedral decided not to join the legal action against the protesters .", "summary": " protesters at st paul 's have until 6pm to depart .   they threaten to burn their tents if they 're evicted .   in glasgow a second camp springs up in solidarity .
