{"text": "nearly seven in 10 americans believe the united states should shut its doors to foreigners traveling from countries that have seen cases of the ebola virus , and six in 10 say there should be a total ban on incoming travel for everyone -- including americans -- who want to enter the u.s. republicans are overwhelmingly against issuing travel visas to people who have been to the ebola hot zone , with 90 per cent favoring the no-room-at-the-inn approach . older americans also preferred a closed-door policy by large numbers . the gop also leads the field in asking for travel restrictions on anyone entering the u.s. from liberia , sierra leone and guinea . more than three-fourths of republicans hold that view , compared with barely half of democrats . republicans also far outstrip democrats on the question of 21-day forced quarantines for those entering the u.s. from affected countries . two-thirds of gopers think isolating potential patients is a must-do . barely one in three democrats agree . the stunning results come from a mailonline/yougov poll that surveyed 1,000 americans , suggesting they 're eager to see the obama white house embrace the position of australia -- which shut its borders last tuesday to all travelers from ebola-stricken nations -- and of canada , which followed suit on friday . scroll down to read the full polling results . close the borders : significant majorities of americans believe no one ebola-land should be allowed to enter the u.s. -- not even americans who have traveled to the worst-hit countries . vote of no confidence : just 34 per cent of americans say they have faith in president barack obama to manage the ebola crisis the right way moving forward . slow and steady wins a giant raspberry : the obama administration should have been quicker on the uptake when ebola first hit the u.s. , according to 55 per cent of americans , while just 29 per cent say the white house was n't too slow to act . americans overall are split on the question of mandatory ebola quarantines , with 48 per cent saying they believe ` people who have been to ebola-infected areas should be quarantined by the government for 21 days . ' another 29 per cent believe only those showing symptoms of the disease should be forced into isolation . older americans are the most likely to demand quarantines.fully 57 per cent of americans 65 or older fall into that camp , compared to just 41 per cent of those age 18 to 29 . and republicans are 75 per cent more likely than democrats to insist that the government isolate travels who have been to west africa . the obama administration gets low marks for its handling of the crisis . just 10 per cent of americans approve of the job ` ebola czar ' ron klain is doing , with 40 per cent saying they have never heard of him . only 2 per cent of republicans say he 's doing a good job , but democrats do n't support him either . less than one in five of them approve of klain 's work on the issue . fewer republicans than democrats -- 24 to 44 per cent -- have no idea who he is , an indication that klain , a longtime democratic political operative , has become a lightning rod on the right . fully 54 per cent of americans age 29 and under say they have no idea who he is . ron klain who ? obama 's ` ebola czar ' is n't exactly a rousing success , with 40 per cent of americans saying they 've never heard of him and just 10 per cent saying he 's doing a good job . medical schizophrenia : while more than half of americans approve of encouraging doctors and nurses to donate their talents in ebola-stricken nations , a similar majority thinks that same volunteerism puts public health at risk back in the united states . fifty-five percent -- including 61 per cent of republicans but just 13 per cent of democrats -- agree that the administration has been ` slow to react . ' african-americans match democrats ' 13 per cent showing , largely supporting the white house . obama himself only wins plaudits from 34 per cent of the u.s. population , compared with 49 per cent who disapprove of how he 's handling it . not surprisingly , just 10 per cent of republicans approve of how the president has responded to the ebola crisis . perhaps more shocking is that 35 per cent of democrats would n't agree . obama continues to be a racially polarizing figure as he tackles the public-health threat , the mailonline/yougov poll shows , with 51 per cent of blacks , 46 per cent of hispanics , but just 29 per cent of whites backing him . a similar split dominated the question of whether americans ` have faith ' in the president to handle the problem moving forward . fifty-eight percent of blacks say they do , compared to 29 per cent of whites . just 16 percent of blacks have their doubts . the centers for disease control and prevention , which drew jeers for allowing an ebola-infected nurse to fly on commercial aircraft , has the support of 39 per cent of americans , four percentage points lower than the 43 per cent who disapprove of its performance . gop hard-liners : more than two-thirds of republicans told yougov 's pollsters that they believe the federal government should forcibly quarantine people who enter the us after spending time in ebola-affected nations . democratic softies : fully 62 per cent of democrats believe there 's no need for a 21-day quarantine when people enter the country from liberia , sierra leone or guinea . the obama white house has assumed a leading role in the global fight against the deadly disease , which has infected more than 10,000 people in africa . but barely one-third of americans say the public-health mop-up is the responsibility of the united states . nearly half say it 's not . the administration 's efforts have included deploying military men and women by the thousands to help build field hospitals in liberia and build other critical infrastructure . the cdc has also encouraged scientists and medical personnel to volunteer their time and skills in the ebola hot zone . but while more than half of americans think it 's a good idea to nudge doctors and nurses toward western africa , they feel the opposite about uniformed servicemen and women . younger americans , those under age 29 , are the most likely to have their doubts about putting a lab-coated cadre of temperature-takers in harm 's way . just 44 per cent of them approve and one-third are undecided -- making them the largest demographic group to be scratching their heads over the question . most of the u.s. medical volunteers who have served or are serving overseas combating ebola are under age 30 , according to a physician source at doctors without borders , an international medical relief charity . a clear majority , 53 per cent , say the federal government should not be ` sending military personnel to ebola-infected areas of africa to help battle the disease . ' that number includes 67 per cent of republicans but just 40 per cent of democrats , an unusual case where dovish liberals prefer to deploy troops and hawkish conservatives would rather not . just three in 10 overall approve of the pentagon 's deployments . 34 per cent for obama : the president barely has one-third of americans behind him as he battles the ebola scourge , and nearly one-half disapprove of how he 's handling it . reserving judgment on chris christie : the pugnacious new jersey governor who insists his quarantine policy is the right path has left nearly 2 in 5 americans unsure what to think -- but he 's winning over more than he 's offending . cdc gap at five : the centers for disease control and prevention has a five point approval-gap on ebola , with 39 per cent saying the agency is doing well and 44 per cent disagreeing -- and among those with strong feelings , the dissenters outnumber the applauders nearly two-to-one . the thorny question of what happens to americans who have been exposed to the ebola virus is still vexing the obama administration . already more than 100 military personnel , including a commanding major general , have entered 21-day quarantines on an military base in italy -- to the consternation of the italian military stationed there . and nurse kaci hickox 's refusal to remain isolated during the disease 's potential incubation period became national news after she returned from africa via the newark , new jersey airport . she had a 101-degree fever when she was tested hours after her arrival . hickox spent three days in a hospital isolation tent before the cdc cleared her to go home to the far northern reaches of maine . she has defied public health authorities since then by taking bike rides and strolls , shaking hands with reporters -- including one from mailonline -- and doing her own shopping . the mailonline/yougov poll found that more than half of americans believe that by giving a green light to medical volunteers , the federal government ` could increase the risk of ebola being brought to the united states . ' bring them home : a majority of americans think it was a mistake to send military servicemen and women to western africa , where they have been building field hospitals and providing infrastructure help -- but also potentially exposing them to the deadly ebola virus . inside the numbers : democrats who approve of sending soldiers into ebola 's path far outnumber republicans who back that approach . not our problem : just 36 percent of poll respondents said they agree that it 's america 's job to lead the global ebola response , while 48 percent said it 's not . this week hickox and the obama administration both crossed swords with new jersey governor chris christie , a feisty republican who refused to back down from his insistence that health care workers who show disease symptoms must be quarantined before they can enter the interior of the u.s. from the newark airport . obama objected , blaming christie -- although not by name -- for stoking fear by adopting a more stringent disease control regime than the cdc 's , and the white house may have the public-opinion upper hand . only one-third of americans say they approve of christie 's approach . -- . yougov polled 1,000 americans on october 29 and 30 . the poll has a margin of error of ± 4.3 percentage points . about 90 per cent of those polled said they are registered to vote . the sample was matched and weighted to be representative of the general u.s. adult population on the basis of gender , age , race , education , voter registration , ideology , and geography by region . mailonline-yougov ebola polling / october 2014 by mailonline .", "summary": " mailonline/yougov poll finds 60 per cent support outright travel ban for anyone planning to enter the us from one of the affected countries .   larger 69 per cent majority says the us ` should not allow foreigners from ebola infected areas to enter the united states '   48 per cent want mandatory quarantines for everyone who has been to liberia , guinea or sierra leone -- including two-thirds of republicans .   only 10 per cent approve of the job ` ebola czar ' ron klain is doing -- a lower rating than congress .   just 34 per cent ` have faith in the president to handle the ebola crisis effectively ' -- compared to 49 per cent who do n't -- and 55 per cent say the obama administration has been ` slow to react ' to the crisis .   9 out of 10 of those surveyed said they are registered to vote .
