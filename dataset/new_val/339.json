{"text": "david cameron could win a parliamentary vote for air strikes on iraq , it has been claimed . a leading tory said he believed david cameron could win a parliamentary vote for air strikes in iraq , where the us is continuing its offensive against isis . sir richard ottaway , chair of the commons foreign affairs select committee , said there would be support for arming the kurds -- including carrying out air strikes if they request them . britain has so far contributed technical and humanitarian aid to stricken northern iraq , but reports in the us suggest barack obama will ask the uk and australia to join the air campaign . australia has already said it may send war planes if asked . sir richard said he believed there would be support for targeting is in northern iraq , although downing street has said it no formal request had been made and it was not under discussion . he said : ` as far as kurdistan is concerned i think there 's a case for arming the peshmerga , and if they request it , for working with the us on air strikes , although this will need the support of parliament . ` my hunch on iraq is that the view in parliament has changed and there would be a majority there . syria is not so straightforward , but i think the situation has changed in iraq . ' the government suffered an embarrassing commons defeat last year when 30 conservative mps and nine lib dems joined labour in voting against a motion supporting the ` principle ' of military action against syria . but sir richard said strikes against the jihadists in iraq would be a ` legitimate case ' . he believed some of those mps who opposed action in syria last year would back it . one unnamed minister said this week that the government would not want military action so close to a general election . but sir richard said britain , as a leading member of the eu and nato and with a permanent seat on the un security council had a responsibility to help the kurds if they requested assistance . ` if we think kurdistan needs support , and might collapse without our support , then electoral thinking would be immaterial . we have to do what people expect of a country like britain ' , he said . ` britain has a longstanding interest in kurdistan , it was established by john major after the first gulf war , it is a well-run country with a proper constitution , and respect for diplomacy , does not have the religious tensions we see elsewhere in the middle east . it has a very important strategic position . the west should help kurdistan . ' any military action must be based on a thorough assessment of how the west can best help them , not a ` knee jerk ' reaction , he said . barack obama this week claimed that an international coalition of willing partners would help root out isis once and for all . mr obama has authorized surveillance flights over syria , a move that could pave the way for us airstrikes against isis militant targets -- and for international coalition-building at the state department . the uk is already sending technical support such as night vision goggles and body armour , and transporting ammunition from eastern european countries to the kurds . the us began targeted air strikes across northern iraq on august 8 . the us president is set to authorise new air raids around the town of amerli where 12,000 turkmen people are under siege from is militants . the administration is also considering targeting is fighters in northern syria . but sir richard said that in syria mps would be unlikely to accept any military action without far more intelligence and a clear exit strategy . tory mp richard ottaway said the pm may get parliamentary approval to attack isis . australia 's defence minister david johnston said their super hornet aircraft were ` incredibly capable ' and in a ` high state of readiness ' if action was approved . ` they 're exactly what flies off us aircraft carriers ' , mr johnston said . ` now , that 's an obvious first port of call were we to consider it necessary to participate with our friends and our ally . ' prime minister tony abbot told his parliament yesterday that the government had not received an official request to provide military assistance , but was in discussions with the us about it . mr abbott described president obama 's decision to authorise air strikes against the ` murderous hoard ' of is as being ` to his great credit ' , but said their involvement would need careful consideration . however john baron mp , who forced the commons vote on military action in syria last summer , in which the government was dramatically defeated , cautioned against air strikes in iraq . he said the islamic state fighters must be defeated by local armies -- not the west . ` we have a certain responsibility to the iraqi people to rid the country of isis in the north but we must fully explore local options . the west must not be seen as trying to defeat this caliphate -- the symbolism would be very strong . ` is is not a disparate group of terrorists living in caves , but a well-organised and equipped guerrilla army which will be difficult to defeat through air strikes alone . the elephant in the room is the iraqi army , numbering over 250,000 , which should be able to regain all lost territory quickly if properly organised and supported , against only 8,000 is fighters . '", "summary": " foreign affairs select committee chair said pm had support for intervention .   sir richard said the pm could win mps ' backing for air strikes to help kurds .   comes amid claims the us will ask the uk and australia to join air campaign .   australia has already said it may send war planes if asked by barack obama .
