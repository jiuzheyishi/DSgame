{"text": "the former head of the military , lord richards , pictured , has hit out at government defence cuts . the former head of the military has hit out at the government 's defence cuts , saying they could leave britain with an army more suited to a ` banana republic ' . lord richards of herstmonceux , who stood down last summer , said the reduced numbers of regular soldiers would be ` a problem ' if the country was involved in another long-running conflict . in a separate swipe at defence secretary philip hammond , he said he respected him , but suggested he was not ` clubbable ' , and said that he would ` never make a soldier ' . and lord richards said he had disagreed with the strategy of cutting soldier numbers and relying increasingly on reservists - claiming he was not involved in the decision , which was taken out of his hands . around 20,000 soldiers will be cut over the next four years in the largest redundancy programme ever attempted , coinciding with the end of britain 's 13-year campaign in afghanistan . but the peer - formerly general sir david richards -- warned that a failure to retain quality people in the army , navy and air force would be disastrous for the long term future of the forces . ` you will always have an army or armed forces . every country does ' , he said . ` the difference between the british armed forces and those of most other countries , and i 've come across many , is the quality of our people . we do n't pay them brilliantly by any means . only now , when i 'm outside , do i realise for the first time what people can be paid . ` but because we look after them and because it 's socially at every level acceptable to be in the army . whether you are a private in the greenhouse from yorkshire , or the heir to the throne , or you are a captain in some smart organisation , the fact is there is a consensus that it 's a good to be in the armed forces . ` if you lose that because you do n't look after your people well , you will have an army , a navy and an air force , but it will be the sort of army , navy and air force with which we do n't associate with the british , that you associate with banana republics ultimately . ' lord richards said defence secretary philip hammond , pictured , would ` never make a soldier ' lord richards commanded the armed forces in afghanistan in 2006-7 and was made chief of the defence staff in 2010 . cutting the numbers of soldiers to 82,000 meant on similar sustained campaigns ` they yes , we would have a problem . our regular soldiers would have to go back more frequently than is desirable . ' this would be a long-term problem , but by 2020 , he said , ` the british forces will look very impressive , will still be the second biggest spender in nato and after the americans we will be the most capable . ' while he added that he would always wonder if people would feel he let the forces down by allowing soldiers to be made redundant , he had felt it was crucial to get the economy back on track . as to relying on reservists , he said this decision was taken out of his chain of command , and he had argued for smaller cuts . in his maiden speech to the house of lords this week , lord richards said britain 's armed forced would need more resources to deal with the global threat of jihadis , and called for defence spending to increase as the economy starts to grow or the forces ' effectiveness ` will inevitably deteriorate ' .", "summary": " lord richards of herstmonceux has hit out at government 's defence cuts .   reducing soldier numbers ' a problem ' in the event of long-running conflict .   ex military chief says defence secretary philip hammond would ` never make a soldier ' "}
