' they were both right ! that moment proved to be the turning point as moments later newcastle equalised through cisse 's strike .", "summary": " everton have not had much luck with referees over christmas .   craig pawson should have sent papiss cisse off on sunday .   the newcastle striker elbowed seamus coleman twice .   everton lost 3-2 at st james ' park despite having taken the lead .
