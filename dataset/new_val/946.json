' tradition : the set up may seem peculiar , but it is custom in the small village near dehradun , northern india , for women to also marry the brothers of her first husband . wife : they sleep together in turn , but that they do not have beds , just ` lots of blankets on the floor ' . rajo does not know which of the brothers is the father of her son . housewife : rajo said she got a lot more attention and love than many other wives . the practice of polyandry is believed to stem from the tale of mahabharata , the ancient indian epic . the text , one of the cornerstones of indian culture , sees draupadi , daughter of the king of pancha being married to five brothers . it is not legal , but in its most common form - whereby women in polyandrous relationships marry more than one man from the same family - it is permitted . it tends to be practised in male dominated villages , who still follow primitive rituals and customs . brothers who refuse the union are often treated as outcasts . in polyandrous families , the woman often can not say which of her husbands fathered which children . recently , there have been instances of dna testing , to solve inheritance disputes . the ancient hindu tradition of polyandry was once widely practiced in india , but is now only observed by a minority . it sees a woman take more than one husband , typically in areas which are male dominated . in fraternal polyandry the woman is expected to marry each of her original husband 's brothers . it is thought to have arisen from the popular sanskrit epic of mahabharatha , which sees draupadi , daughter of the king of pancha being married to five brothers . the practice is also believed to be a way of keeping farming land in the family . it is most commonly found near the himalayas in the north of the country , as well as in the mountainous nation of tibet . while the advance of modernity has seen the archaic practice largely die out in most areas , the shortage of women in countries such as china and india has helped keep it alive as a solution to young men 's difficulties in finding a wife . rajo said she knew she was expected to accept all of her husbands , as her own mother had also been married to three brothers . she said they sleep together in turn , but that they do not have beds , just ` lots of blankets on the floor ' . she added : ' i get a lot more attention and love than most wives .
