{"text": "premier league chief executive richard scudamore and fa chairman greg dyke will fight to save england 's christmas football programme when the world cup moves to winter in qatar in 2022 . but the plan now mooted by fifa 's task force will wreck the global club calendar for years . the most severely disrupted season for the english game will be the 2022-23 campaign , but it will not be the only one with fixtures shunted around . the 2021-22 and 2023-24 seasons will also be affected and some 50 other leagues will pay a price for fifa 's discredited decision to award the world 's greatest tournament to a desert nation that is too hot to stage it in the summer . fifa president sepp blatter names qatar as the winning hosts of 2022 at a conference in zurich in 2010 . qatar 's delegate party celebrate being awarded the 2022 world cup back in december 2010 . premier league chief executive richard scudamore is among those on the world cup task force . october , november and december are the only months the 2022 world cup can be held , according to a graphic provided by the fifa task force . the fifa task force has recommend that the 2022 world cup be held later in the year , when temperatures are lower . june . average min temperature - 29c . average max temperature - 42c . july . average min temperature - 31c . average max temperature - 42c . november . average min temperature - 21c . average max temperature - 30c . december . average min temperature - 16c . average max temperature - 25c . * figures from worldweatheronline.com . scudamore on tuesday voiced his fears that a tournament pencilled in from november 26 to december 23 , 2022 will devastate ` the entire premier league , football league and fa cup christmas and new year programme that season ' . football across all levels in england could grind to a halt for around 20 days so as not to distract from the world cup , even at clubs without players involved . scudamore added : ` we are extremely disappointed with the recommendation to move the 2022 fifa world cup to a november and december schedule . it is clear that the views of the european leagues , along with the numerous other competitions globally that will be negatively affected , have not been given serious consideration . ` we will consult our clubs , other stakeholders in english football and other leagues before deciding on what , if any , further action might be appropriate or worthwhile . ' the most probable scenario is that england 's top-flight clubs will play an 11-month season from mid-july 2022 to june 2023 , breaking for two months for players to prepare and compete in the world cup . november and december will probably have no top-flight domestic football . a computer-generated image of the ` education city ' stadium to be built in doha for the world cup . fa cup replays that season will probably also have to be scrapped to ease fixture congestion and two-legged ties in the league cup will likely be reduced to one match . fifa will ratify the dates next month , with scudamore and dyke sure to be lobbying hard to save part of that season 's festive programme . former manchester united captain and current england coach gary neville was a rare voice in saying that football had to ` get over ' the disruption that the winter switch will cause . here is a computer-generated image of how the main stadium in doha is set to look for the world cup in 2022 . he said : ` you 're making the world cup sound like the sherpa vans trophy . the world cup 's the world cup , it 's hardly a tin-pot competition . the premier league will be disrupted for a year , every 24 or 28 years , for a continent to have a world cup . we 've got to get over it . football 's a world game . ' neville added that it was ` shoddy ' that the decision to move the tournament ` has taken so long and been a shambles of a process . but i 've been to the middle east a number of times and they deserve a world cup . fifa have now got to the right place , to make allowances for a continent to host a world cup in normal heat . ' a switch to november and december 2022 had been virtually inevitable because fifa 's task force , headed by asia confederation head sheik salman bin ebrahim al-khalifa of bahrain , had little room for manoeuvre . a computer-generated image of the ` al khor ' stadium to be built in doha for the world cup . a computer-generated image of the ` sports city ' stadium to be built in doha for the world cu . january and february 2022 were ruled out to avoid a clash with the winter olympics , then the month of ramadan precluded the event , and may to september is too hot . ` some people have concerns , but whatever decision you 're going to take will have some questions about it , ' sheik salman said . ` but we need to look at the overall benefit for everybody . ' dyke said november and december are the ` best of the bad options ' , adding : ` we can not possibly play in the summer in qatar . ' he then blasted fifa 's decision to award the event to a nation incapable of staging it during the period for which it bid to host it . ` the best option would be to not hold it in qatar , ' he said . ` but we are now beyond that . you might be able to keep the disruption to one season if you start earlier and end later but it 's going to be tough . ' the fifa task force members , including richard scudamore , in discussion on monday in doha . hassan al thawadi , head of the 2022 organising committee , speaks to the media on tuesday . fifa secretary general jerome valcke addresses the media ahead of the meeting in monday . we are extremely disappointed with the fifa task force recommendation to move the 2022 fifa world cup to a november and december schedule . it is clear that the views of the european leagues , along with the numerous other competitions globally that will be negatively affected , have not been given serious consideration throughout this process . the prevailing view from the leagues has been that displacing the 2022 world cup significantly from the original summer dates disproportionately impacts the sporting integrity of our competitions . our particular concern is that a fifa world cup that finishes late in december could result in damaging one of the english game 's great traditions and attractions , with the removal of the entire premier league , football league and fa cup christmas and new year fixture programme that season . clearly there is still time within the process to consider our position further , but first we will consult with our clubs , other stakeholders in english football , and other leagues before deciding on what , if any , further action might be appropriate or worthwhile . the chalifa international stadium in the aspire zone in doha will be used at the world cup . an open-air doha stadium built with zero carbon , solar powered cooling technology to combat high heat . when will the 2022 world cup in qatar run ? the exact dates have yet to be confirmed but ` late november to late december ' 2022 has been recommended by fifa 's task force , with saturday november 26 to friday december 23 mooted as a possible 28-day slot . a final decision is expected on march 20 . a world cup final near to christmas sounds crazy ... it would mean travel chaos over an already tricky holiday time . there is sure to be lobbying to play the final earlier , perhaps on sunday december 18 , which is also qatar national day . what 's the problem with having an earlier final ? whenever it 's played , domestic seasons will need to stop weeks before the first match to allow squads to prepare . typically this run-up period is a month . it will need to be a minimum of two weeks . a world cup ending on december 23 would mean domestic competitions breaking in early november . any earlier and football might have to stop as early as october . what happens to the 2022-23 premier league season ? two months of club football will be ` displaced ' , and if the period cleared for the world cup is as mooted , that will essentially be november and december . that would mean 10 premier league games and three champions league games being played earlier or later . so , for example , the premier league season may have to start a month earlier -lrb- mid-july 2022 -rrb- and finish a month later -lrb- mid-june 2023 -rrb- . the seasons before and after would also need to shift to accommodate this . there will be disruption , to about 50 leagues , for about three years . what about the football league ? club football across england would almost certainly be suspended for a chunk of the world cup as fifa insist on a ` blackout ' of about 20 days when no attention is taken from their showpiece . how will the fixture congestion affect domestic action ? fa cup replays could be one victim for at least a season . premier league clubs might play fewer league cup games . some european competition fixtures will need to be rescheduled . the africa cup of nations due for january 2023 may have to be shelved . will the move to winter hit clubs in the pocket ? almost certainly in terms of missing out on the holiday-season bonanza of capacity crowds , but also untold millions if tv companies bid less for disrupted domestic seasons . arguably hardest hit will be smaller football league clubs , reliant on turnstile cash , who are forced to go without games -- and income -- for weeks . what do sky and bt sport think ? both broadcasters declined to comment . but by 2022-23 , we will be two more premier league tv deals down the line after the # 5billion extravaganza just agreed . who knows who will have uk live rights then ? maybe bein sports ... based in qatar ! you 're not serious ? that 's what several hundred million fans said when it was announced in december 2010 that qatar would host 2022 . rule out nothing , no matter how seemingly ridiculous or outrageous . is there any chance this all wo n't even happen ? very little . and when fifa announce a world-record sponsorship deal with qatar airways later this year , as insiders expect , none at all . merry christmas !", "summary": " fifa task force recommend world cup starts later in the year .   temperatures will be lower than in june and july .   task force has also recommended that the world cup is shortened .   decision expected to be ratified by fifa 's executive committee next month .   richard scudamore says premier league are disappointed by the decision .   greg dyke says fa will try and protect annual christmas fixture schedule .
