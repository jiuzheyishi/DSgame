{"text": "my wife and i have been to nice every summer for the last five years . why ? because it 's like being on a cruis . everything is right on your doorstep , especially the sparkling sea . anyone who climbs to the park on a hill called the colline du chateau , at the east end of town , will see what i mean . from here you can watch the planes - far enough out to sea to be inaudible - as they approach the airport at the west tip of the bay on which nice stands . not exactly like blackpool : nice has long been a seafront favourite with british travellers . arriving passengers can board a bus that leaves from outside the terminal and skirts the sea for 20 minutes , then you 're in the middle of the bay , where most of the hotels are located . this is the promenade des anglais , named after the britons who launched nice as a holiday resort - albeit a winter one - 200 years ago . you still hear a lot of english voices , and the niçoise french are not as intimidatingly chic as the parisians : they tend to be overripe ladies with small fluffy dogs in tow . they get through a lot of the staple niçoise drink - rosé - while basking at the seafront cafes . the city , with its sparkling sea and hinterland of slumberous villas , is more beautiful than any british resort , but it is bracingly reminiscent of some of the more rackety ones . the stony beach - the penance you pay for entering the turquoise sea - reminds me of brighton . the palm trees along the centre of the prom are fairy-lit at night , like a more tasteful blackpool . the manager of the most select hotel , le negresco , would be appalled to learn that its belle Époque architecture reminds me of the grand hotel , scarborough . the grand is no longer grand but le negresco keeps its end up : a glass of wine in its stately bar costs around # 25 . so we do n't stay there , but at the hyatt regency palais de la méditerranée , a couple of blocks along . the original palais , built in 1930 , was a general house of fun , with a restaurant , casino and theatre . by the year 2000 , it had fallen into decay and was rebuilt as a hotel , although the lovely art-deco façade is preserved . the palais is not extortionate - no tip-hungry porter is thrust upon you at check-in - but it is still glamorous , like nice itself . with all due respect to blackpool and scarborough , you would n't catch bono , elton john , sean connery or bill gates living there , as they do in nice . the city stars in many films featuring beautiful people involved in shady business , including the jewel of the nile -lrb- kathleen turner and michael douglas -rrb- , ronin -lrb- robert de niro and natascha mcelhone -rrb- and the day of the jackal -lrb- the jackal , played by edward fox , naturally stays at le negresco -rrb- . but nice is one of the less expensive jewels on the côte d'azur . big screen : films such as the day of the jackal -lrb- left -rrb- and the jewel of the nile have used nice as a backdrop . it does not exist solely to exploit tourists . the streets inland of the front are full of the french being french : smoking in café terraces ; discussing their ailments in the numerous pharmacies . when my wife lisa and i ask the way to the museum of modern art , nobody knows . perhaps it is the profusion of museums and galleries that causes the confusion . nice has more than any french city except paris . many are run by the municipality , and these are free . we like the ones close to the prom - partly , i admit , because we ca n't be bothered to walk far in the heat . the musée masséna , a blessedly cool 19th-century mansion featuring many paintings of old nice , is right on the prom , at no. 35 . five minutes inland , at 33 avenue des baumettes , is the musée des beaux-arts , formerly the residence of a ukranian princess . it is full of paintings even i can appreciate -lrb- thank goodness for post-impressionism -rrb- . there never seems to be more than half a dozen visitors , so i pad around the elegant rooms pretending it 's my house . at the westward base of the colline is the old town , with its medieval alleyways , baroque churches and the most interesting shops , including maison auer , at 7 rue saint-francoise de paule , which is unchanged since 1820 , and sells glacé fruits . lisa likes the antique/bric-a-brac market held in the main square of the old town , the cours saleya , every monday . my role is to follow her about carrying the linen napkins she buys in bulk . the square is lined with restaurants serving good italian and niçoise food . our favourite is la favola , where you dine on a terrace under art nouveau street lamps . seafood and pasta are the specialities , and everything is on a huge scale . plates are 2ft across ; the olive oil comes in a sort of petrol can . at night , the green hill of the colline - atmospherically illuminated - soars above the old town like a vision of heaven . immediately east of the hill lies the small harbour , where the yachts of the billionaires look somehow less brash than those in monaco , 12 miles along the coast . i always visit monaco when in nice , mainly for the scenic train ride , which costs around # 6 for a return ticket . in monaco , an entry-level property costs # 5 million , whereas in nice , you can buy a two-bedroom flat with sea view for a twentieth of that - my retirement dream . british airways -lrb- 0844 493 0787 , www.ba.com -rrb- flies from london to nice from # 68 return . double . rooms at the hyatt regency palais de la méditerranée -lrb- 0033 04 9327 . 1234 , nice.regency.hyatt.com -rrb- cost from # 150 -lrb- room only -rrb- .", "summary": " nice , a jewel of the cote d'azur , has long been popular with british tourists .   its main seafront drag , promenade des anglais , is lined with cafes and bars .   many movies have been set here , including classic the day of the jackal .
