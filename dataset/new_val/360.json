{"text": "rampant nigel farage aims to destroy the tory party , take over a new right-wing british political party , get britain out of the eu - and then quit politics . the ukip leader 's breathtaking ambition , revealed in an interview with the mail on sunday , comes hours before he is set to achieve a historic victory in the european elections . the results from thursday 's polling , announced today , are expected to show ukip will have gained more than 20 meps , more than the conservatives , with the possibility of a total wipeout of all lib dem meps . scroll down for video . triumphant : nigel farage at his home in kent on the eve of the european election results . the ukip leader hopes to have britain out of europe within a decade . mr farage rejects claims by david cameron that ukip 's challenge will fade away in next year 's general election , and says today 's gains mark the beginning of the end of the conservative party . he aims to repeat the destruction two decades ago of canada 's conservative party , when the rebel right-wing reform party , compared by many to ukip , sparked a political earthquake . in an interview with this newspaper earlier in the campaign , mr farage said a canadian-style tory meltdown ` could happen ' here -- and compared attacks on him to those on reform party leader preston manning and reform 's first canadian mp , schoolteacher deborah grey . ` they called him a right-wing extremist , a nutter , away with the fairies , he 'll never get anywhere and what happens ? they won one by-election , a schoolmistress way out west , who resisted every bribe and temptation to rejoin the conservative party . ` now you have a canadian prime minister , stephen harper , who was first elected on a reform ticket , as were half the cabinet . ` do n't think this ca n't happen here . the public want something different . we are catalysing a big change in british politics on fundamental issues that have been brushed under the carpet and ignored by a completely out-of-touch career political class for too long . ' ambition : nigel farage dismissed jibes that the rise of ukip will hand power to pro-eu ed miliband at the next general election by taking votes from the tories . canada 's conservative party was destroyed overnight in the country 's 1993 election by the populist , low-tax , reform party . the century-old ruling progressive conservatives lost all but two of their 156 seats after sensational gains by reform , which had been called racist , sexist and homophobic , just as david cameron famously called ukip ` fruitcakes , loonies and closet racists ' . the split in canada 's centre right enabled the liberals , canada 's equivalent of our labour party , to take power . but after ten years of infighting , the reform revolution succeeded . the canadian alliance , a merger of reform with the ruins of canada 's old-style tories , led to former reform official stephen harper becoming prime minister in 2006 . and it had all started with the victory of a sole reform mp , ms grey , in 1989 . mr farage hopes a victory by ukip 's roger helmer in the newark parliamentary by-election on june 5 will trigger a similar political shake-up at westminster . in his interview with the mail on sunday , mr farage dismissed jibes that the rise of ukip will hand power to pro-eu ed miliband at the next general election by taking votes from the tories . he said : ` the arithmetic does n't suggest that . firstly , the reason conservative voters have deserted the party is that they do not believe cameron is conservative . it 's got nothing to do with me , but thinking there is going to be a conservative majority is fantasy . ` the second reason is the tories are dying as brand in the north of england just as they did in scotland.the third reason cameron ca n't win a majority is he ca n't get the blue-collar vote . thatcher got it , reagan got it , john major got it . but these two guys -lrb- cameron and osborne -rrb- who allegedly do n't know the price of a pint of milk , do n't connect with the blue collar . ' celebration : nigel farage aims to use ukip 's new support from labour voters to force a weakened ed miliband to take a tougher stance on the eu in next year 's election . while farage says publicly an ed miliband victory next year would be a ` disaster for the economy , ' some of those who know the ukip leader well claim that in private , he says it could help him achieve a canadian-style upheaval here . one ukip aide said : ` if miliband wins , the tories would be shattered and split with eurosceptics on one side and europhiles on the other . nigel could team up with the eurosceptics and possibly lead them . and , if , as nigel believes , miliband would be a pathetically poor pm , a labour government could collapse quickly with another election . then , the canadian scenario is on . ' mr farage aims to use ukip 's new support from labour voters to force a weakened ed miliband to take a tougher stance on the eu in next year 's election . ` if i want to get this country out of the eu , i have got to change the position of the labour party on the referendum . if you accept it is impossible for cameron to win a majority on his own , there could be a ukip-tory coalition after the election . who knows ? if it looks less and less likely that miliband can form a majority without a referendum pledge , he 'll do it . ' farage , 50 , insists he is not interested in power for himself -- and by the time he turns 60 , wants to have quit politics -- with britain out of the eu . ` i will consider my job 's done and i would be very happy to hand over to people who might be very good at running the country . i 'm in politics because i want to change things , not because i want a career . i do n't want to do this for ever , i do n't want to sit here in ten years ' time , i want to be doing something else by then , in the media , radio , writing , hopefully enjoying myself . ' he has no desire to move into no 10 , emulating ` canada 's nigel farage ' stephen harper . ` i think i could do it but do i think that 's really what i would be best at in life ? ` no . what i 'm best at is spotting when something 's wrong and needs to change and agitating to wake people up to what 's gone wrong . ' pressure on embattled ed miliband grew last night after a survey showed labour would have more chance of winning the next election if they dump him . a survation poll for the mail on sunday revealed that 31 per cent of labour supporters back the party at the ballot box ` because of ' miliband , while 36 per cent do so ` despite ' him . by contrast , 48 per cent of tories back the party because of cameron , and 18 per cent support the party despite him . the leadership popularity gap was . repeated when voters were asked if they would be more likely to support a . party if it had a new leader . voters said ` yes ' by a margin of 26 per . cent in the case of labour , compared to a margin of 13 per cent for the . tories . the most common . criticism of miliband in the poll , which saw 1,017 adults questioned . online on friday , is that he lacks charisma and the ` common touch ' . city slicker : sharp-suited chuka umunna -lrb- right -rrb- has emerged as the surprise new favourite to succeed current labour leader ed miliband -lrb- left -rrb- . cameron was also seen as lacking the common touch but the prime minister fared significantly better on charisma . mr miliband will face further attacks today , with widespread forecasts of poor results in the european elections on top of similar disappointment in the town hall elections . the labour leader , who has been criticised for failing to stop ukip taking votes in his party 's northern heartlands , is due to launch a fightback on tuesday . he will say in a speech : ` i am determined to show people , including those who voted for ukip , that we can change our country for the better . ' but a shadow minister said the attempt to win back voters was like ` bolting the stable door after the ukip horse has bolted ' . the poll also revealed that boris johnson is the strong favourite to succeed mr cameron , backed by 44 per cent of tories . he is followed by theresa may and george osborne . energy secretary ed davey has emerged as lib dem favourite to succeed deputy prime minister nick clegg , with support from 32 per cent of the party 's voters , followed by treasury chief secretary danny alexander with vince cable a distant third place . meanwhile sharp-suited chuka umunna has emerged as the surprise new favourite to succeed ed miliband , according to the poll . in previous surveys , umunna has lagged behind other labour hopefuls . but those who voted in the survation poll did so after watching videos of miliband 's potential successors . the survey saw shadow business secretary umunna , 35 , triumph over bookmakers ' favourite yvette cooper , the shadow home secretary . little-known umunna was seen as ` more charismatic , normal , in touch and trustworthy ' among labour supporters than any of his rival leadership contenders . asked who would be most likely to make them vote labour , umunna won again , and he also stormed to victory in the ` better than miliband ' category . dubbed the ` british obama ' , manchester university-trained lawyer umunna was fast-tracked into the shadow cabinet . but his ` rising star ' status has led to him being taunted by david cameron and privately mocked by some of his labour colleagues .", "summary": " ukip leader reveals ambitions ahead of european election results .   party is expected to gain more than 20 meps - a historic victory .   farage says idea of tory majority at next general election is ' a fantasy '   he added that he plans to retire from politics by the time he turns 60 .   aged 50 now , farage hopes to have britain out the eu within a decade .
