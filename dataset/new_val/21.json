{"text": "new drug : sofosbuvir , when taken in combination with the current treatment options , cures up to 90 per cent of patients . experts have declared the end of hepatitis c , thanks to a three-month course of tablets that could see the killer blood disease eradicated from britain . the development of sovaldi -lrb- sofosbuvir -rrb- has been hailed as a ` game-changer ' in the treatment of the illness . ` this new drug gives us the opportunity to clear hepatitis c from the uk , ' says graham foster , professor of hepatology at queen mary , university of london . hepatitis c is a blood-borne virus that was first identified in 1989 . many of those affected received contaminated blood from transfusions or medical procedures prior to 1989 , or by sharing needles or having tattoos . famous sufferers include body shop founder dame anita roddick , who died of a brain haemorrhage in 2007 , and former baywatch star pamela anderson . the virus is estimated to affect 215,000 adults in the uk , of whom more than half remain undiagnosed . untreated , it rots the liver and , over a period of 30 to 40 years , leads to cirrhosis and liver cancer . death rates have been rising rapidly . in 2011 there were 381 deaths from hepatitis c , but it now kills more people than diseases related to hiv . until now , treatments , which can last up to a year , have been fairly effective , with a 60 to 70 per cent cure rate . but they have unpleasant side effects . sofosbuvir , when taken in combination with the current treatment options -- injections of interferon and ribavirin tablets -- cures up to 90 per cent of patients in just 12 weeks , and is tolerated by almost everyone . prof foster says : ` if we treat 20,000 patients every year for the next ten years , nobody will transmit the virus and it will be gone . ` hepatitis c mutates every time it copies itself , making treating it like hitting a moving target . ` sofosbuvir hits at the enzyme at the very heart of the virus , stopping it from mutating or becoming resistant . ' the drug is now awaiting approval from watchdog nice . at a cost of # 35,000 for a 12-week course , it is not cheap , but experts are optimistic it will be seen as cost-effective . ` it is estimated that hepatitis c currently costs the nhs # 156 million per year , ' says william rosenberg , professor of hepatology at university college london . blame game : sufferer pamela anderson claims she got hepatitis c from her ex-husband tommy lee after they shared tattoo needles . prof foster adds : ` later this year we expect to see the availability of other new drugs , which we can combine with sofosbuvir . this will allow us to stop using interferon , which causes the worst side effects and ca n't be tolerated by the sickest patients . ` studies show these new drugs administered with sofosbuvir have a 97 per cent success rate . it 's possible the treatment period will go down to a few weeks . ' there is just one shadow on the horizon : the low hepatitis c detection rate in the uk , which means many of those needing treatment will not be identified until they are seriously ill . the uk has no comprehensive screening programme , meaning we lag behind other european countries and the united states in identifying sufferers . ` we need a proper screening programme if we are to gain full benefit from these drugs , ' says prof rosenberg . charles gore , chief executive of the hepatitis c trust , says : ` this will be a huge step forward for patients towards the goal of short , easy-to-tolerate treatments that will cure hepatitis c in almost everyone who takes them . ` we will be able to stop thinking of the virus as a chronic illness leading to cirrhosis and liver cancer and think of it instead as a nasty virus that is easily treatable . i hope this means that many more people will think about getting tested .
