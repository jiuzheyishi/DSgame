{"text": "dozing in a mother 's lap , eyes half-closed , or throwing their arms around a father 's shoulders in a great hug -- every child craves a parent 's affection . for sirga the lioness , it is no different . though , in this case , her parent is a human . conservationist valentin gruener , 27 , coâ€‘founder of the modisa wildlife project in the kalahari , botswana , has his hands full with the three-year-old lioness he has raised almost from birth . now a teenager in lion years , sirga is preparing to live in the wild -- and surrogate parent valentin is teaching her to hunt . scroll down for video . friends for life : the story of the abandoned lion cub sirga who was raised by a german wildlife enthusiast in his 20s was one of the most shared stories on social media last year . sirga was found close to death on a farm , in february 2012 , after a litter of three cubs was born to a pride of lions . two of the babies died and the third was abandoned by the adults . working with a vet , valentin put the tiny animal , weighing just 4lb , on a drip to combat severe dehydration . over the next few days , he experimented with a recipe to fatten her up , until he hit upon a mixture of fresh eggs , cream , milk , vitamins , sunflower oil and calcium . ` to this day we believe she is probably the most spoiled and well-fed lion in botswana , ' he laughs . within a year , she had put on 175lb , was weaned and was eating raw meat . valentin , born in germany , and his fellow conservationist , mikkel legarth from denmark , were determined to help sirga return to the wild , and have been coaching her to hunt . that meant hours spent teaching her to stalk and kill -- skills which are not wholly instinctive and which cubs typically learn from the adults in their pride . ` we did n't want sirga to become like other lions in captivity , constantly fed by streams of tourists , ' says mikkel . ` she hunts her own food , taking antelopes , and she will let us be near her when she eats it , which is remarkable . ` we want to release her eventually as a wild lion , not as one who has met lots of people . that would be dangerous . she only interacts with me and valentin . ' best buds : conservationist valentin gruener , 27 , raised sirga after she was abandoned by her pride . new challenge : a documentary series follows sirga and mr gruener as he teaches her how to hunt . realising that they were developing a unique bond with sirga , the two naturalists invited filmmaker jurgen jozefowicz in , and a six part series called lionheart will be released later this year . the film shows how sirga nuzzles and even hugs her human ` parents ' , and will allow them to scratch her tummy or rub her jaws . she keeps her claws sheathed during play sessions and lies with her head contentedly on valentin 's lap while he strokes her ears . most of us can only imagine the thrill of raising a lion from a cub . but john partridge , senior curator of animals at bristol zoo gardens , and his team have shared a similar experience over the past two years . as sirga does not have a pride to teach her how to hunt , mr gruener has to get down and dirty and show her . in order to teach her how to live as a wild lion , mr gruener has spent many hours crouching in scrubland or pouncing in watering holes alongside sirga . success ? a proud sirga managed to catch a large swollen toad , and carried it in her mouth . the zoo 's pair of endangered asiatic lions had twin cubs , called kamran and ketan , in november 2012 . but the mother rejected them when they were just 13 days old after her mate died . ` we do n't carry out hand-rearing unless there 's a strong reason , ' emphasises john . ` if the babies have been with their mother for a while , it is quite a challenge to get them used to artificial milk and teats , as they are obviously used to suckling naturally . ' lions reared by humans will treat them as part of their pride , he says . many readers will remember the story of john rendall , who bought a lion cub in the pet department at harrods in 1969 with his friend anthony bourke , and raised it in his flat above a shop on the fashionable king 's road in london . as one : mr gruener is fulfilling a lifelong ambition by living with lions in the wilds of africa . family : mr gruener observes as a veterinarian cares for his beloved lioness friend . the new documentary has been called an ` extraordinary story that transcends all known borders between man and lion , predator and prey ' by its makers . sustainable living : a team from the modisa wildlife project feed a group of young male lions in an enclosure . when the cub , who they called christian , outgrew the flat , they arranged , with the help of conservations , to introduce him to the wild in kenya . when john and anthony returned to kenya a year later , christian recognised them instantly , putting his paws on their shoulders in rapturous excitement . the footage subsequently became an internet sensation when it was posted on youtube in 2008 . it has since been watched more than 100 million times . perhaps the extraordinary bond between sirga and her surrogate parents valentin and mikkel will prove as touchingly enduring .", "summary": " video of lion hugging her conservationist carer went viral last year .   lioness sirga was saved as a cub by 27-year-old valentin gruener .   new documentary follows pair as mr gruener teaches sirga to hunt .
