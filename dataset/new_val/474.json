{"text": "david cameron has piled the pressure on the growing crisis in tony blair 's reputation by calling for an end to hold-ups in a long-delayed report on the iraq war . the former prime minister has been accused of trying to delay publication of the chilcot inquiry over well-sourced reports that it will savage his handling of the conflict . now mr cameron has stepped into the dispute by making it clear sir john chilcot 's findings should be made public as soon as possible . tony blair , pictured answering questions in 2010 , has been accused of trying to delay publication of the chilcot inquiry . it follows claims that mr blair and labour hope to delay the report until after next year 's general election , arguing any criticism of the last labour government could hit ed miliband 's hopes of success . ` the pm believes there is no excuse for any further lengthy delay in publishing chilcot , ' said a no 10 aide . ` it would be unreasonable to postpone it beyond the next election . ' the controversy comes as mr blair faces an increasing struggle to retain his standing . the mail on sunday 's disclosure of his weekends with rupert murdoch 's wife wendi deng -- and the role it played in the murdochs ' divorce -- damaged his personal image . his reputation as a statesman and businessman has also come under heavy fire . a recent speech , during which he urged britain to set aside its differences with russia to fight radical islam , was dismissed as ` embarrassingly simple-minded ' by some experts . it led to some questioning how long he can continue as the west 's envoy to the middle east . and an attack on mr blair by his biographer philip stephens , published on friday by the financial times , claimed he had built up a # 100 million fortune since leaving downing street in 2007 in his ` lust for personal riches and attention ' . one of the main bones of contention over the report into the conflict -lrb- pictured -rrb- is private notes between blair and the then us president george w. bush . friends of mr blair fear that with his overall reputation in the balance , public condemnation by chilcot will be the last straw . a former labour ally said : ` since leaving downing street , tony has managed to remain a big player on the world stage and use it to earn money , justifying it by doing good work at the same time . ` it has served him well , but it is all starting to collapse . if chilcot points the finger of blame squarely at him , which blair himself knows full well it will , the whole edifice could crumble . that is why it is in his interest that chilcot should be delayed for as long as possible . ' mr blair has dismissed the inquiry , saying ` going back ' over events will not help britain solve the middle east crisis , but he denies blocking it . one of the main bones of contention is private notes between him and the then us president george w. bush , which show the decision to go to war was taken long before mr blair indicated the measure publicly . concerns : friends of mr blair fear that with his overall reputation in the balance , public condemnation by chilcot will be the last straw . chilcot wants to publish the notes and told mr cameron last year that it was ` regrettable ' this had not been agreed . mr cameron said he hoped for a resolution ` as soon as possible ' . mr blair 's camp is resisting , arguing it would compromise future prime ministers and presidents . there are claims that former barrister mr blair and his advisers are challenging every detail raised by chilcot and his panel of experts . mr cameron can expect little support from the current labour leader in bringing forward chilcot . even though ed miliband has disowned the iraq war , strategists fear it will remind voters of the last labour government 's record on iraq and cost them votes .", "summary": " former pm accused of trying to delay publication of chilcot inquiry .   well-sourced reports suggest that it will savage his handling of the conflict .   blair has argued criticism could dent ed miliband 's general election hopes .   comes as former labour leader struggles to maintain his standing .
