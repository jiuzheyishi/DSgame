{"text": "violent tackles by burnley 's ashley barnes , a lack of protection for eden hazard and jose mourinho and chelsea at war with the world . southampton too had reason to complain after numerous penalty appeals were rejected -lrb- although they did it a little more quietly -rrb- and so referees are again back in the spotlight . sportsmail 's panel of experts , jamie redknapp , martin keown and former top referee graham poll , got together to discuss the fall-out . head of sport lee clayton asked the questions and listened in . sportsmail trio graham poll -lrb- left -rrb- , jamie redknapp -lrb- centre -rrb- and martin keown -lrb- right -rrb- have aired their views on the weekend 's refereeing controversy . q : describe the current standard of refereeing in three words please , gents . poll : inconsistent , inaccurate , outdated . keown : not . good . enough . but i want to qualify that . working as a co-commentator for the bbc , i understand their difficulty . i sometimes need two or three replays to see what has happened at high speed . referees get one go . we should always try to remember that . what is most irritating , however , is when it happens right under their noses and they fail to see what is blindingly obvious . redknapp : you asked for three words , did n't you ? honest . average . difficult . q. do players and managers have to take their share of the blame too for causing this crisis ? poll : of course ! it 's players more than managers . refereeing has never been harder . players exaggerate or even simulate contact and go down so easily that you struggle to believe what you are seeing . the way they roll around as if injured to get opponents in trouble is embarrassing to watch . look at branislav ivanovic on saturday after he was fouled by ashley barnes . managers are understandably frustrated at some of the very poor decisions this season but they should try and help rather than attack . ashley barnes -lrb- right -rrb- catches branislav ivanovic with his right boot during an aerial challenge . this studs-up tackle from barnes -lrb- centre -rrb- infuriated chelsea midfielder nemanja matic -lrb- right -rrb- . atkinson shows the red card to matic after the serbian midfielder retaliated to the tackle . atkinson -lrb- right -rrb- can not see the full extent of barnes ' horror challenge as matic is blocking his view . keown : there certainly needs to be more honesty . players have introduced confusion by diving , so is it a foul , or not ? also , i 'm not buying this ` agenda ' claim from mourinho . his latest outburst is a contrived attempt at cranking up the pressure on officials . there is no campaign against him . southampton manager ronald koeman had just as many reasons to be furious at the weekend , but he rises above it . matic reacts angrily after being sent off for his reaction to a tough challenge from barnes . ivanovic fires a shot at goal but his effort was blocked by the raised arms of michael kightly . former arsenal defender keown has praised ronald koeman for his conduct , despite a number of decisions going against his southampton side at the weekend . redknapp : is there really a crisis ? yes , there is diving , but get used to it , it is here to stay . referees have made mistakes this weekend , but it 's only because of the attention applied by jose mourinho that we are having this debate . look , the game is so quick , the rewards are so high and everyone is looking to gain an advantage , but behaviour towards referees is n't any worse than when i was playing . ask graham ! jose mourinho -lrb- right -rrb- shouts at former referee poll during a premier league clash in may 2007 . q : eden hazard is being kicked all over the place , so does jose mourinho have a point -- are chelsea being mistreated ? redknapp : hazard is so quick , of course he will be tripped and draw fouls . they are trips , kicks . there is nothing malicious behind it . and chelsea are not being mistreated . come on ! they are a team of men , they have every trick in the book themselves . keown : my only concern with hazard is this : is he always being fouled , or is he buying the foul ? he 's a brilliant footballer , i love it when he runs with the ball , but he is difficult to referee because he lightening quick . as for chelsea ... they are not mistreated , but they 've had some poor calls . they can handle it . eden hazard was fouled a remarkable nine times during chelsea 's champions league clash against psg . marco verratti -lrb- left -rrb- goes in with studs showing on hazard during the encounter at the parc des princes . poll : chelsea have not had the rub of the green , they 've been unlucky . one could argue that mourinho has brought this on himself with his constant bleating , but the main point must be that however the chelsea manager behaves , referees must see each individual incident on its own merits and deal with it accordingly . as for hazard , yes , he needs better protection -lrb- as does diego costa -- to stop him taking the law into his own hands -rrb- . they are outstanding footballers and we do n't want them kicked out of matches . chelsea 's diego costa reacts after not being awarded a penalty during saturday 's match against burnley . q : do big clubs try to bully and influence referees in a game-management style ? is this new ? keown : the aggressive behaviour of players is n't new , especially when they swarm around the referee . it 's unpalatable , but i remember george graham once accusing us at arsenal of ` being too nice ' and to ` get around the referee ' in a game against manchester united . john terry is the leader of the pack now . he runs faster towards a row involving the referee than he does in the rest of the game ! he will argue his captain 's armband gives him the right to be there , but there is more to it than that . he leads the charge . john terry -lrb- right -rrb- remonstrates with referee martin atkinson after the latter sent off nemanja matic . redknapp : sir alex ferguson demanded it of his teams too and then followed up by pursuing the referee down the tunnel . his manchester united team were good at it , they won key decisions because of it . mourinho is trying it now . poll : players will try to influence referees , they always have . referees have to be strong and they must n't be influenced by it . fergie was the past master at it and was better at it than anyone around at the moment . he had a fear factor that mourinho does not have . alex ferguson -lrb- middle -rrb- had history of pursuing referees down the tunnel when he was a manager . chelsea boss mourinho speaking on sky sports ' goals on sunday programme during the weekend . q : what can be done to help officials ? poll : to solve any problem one must first accept that there is one . select referees need better support , motivation and direction . look at atkinson on saturday at chelsea and you see a man fatigued . just back from a trip to germany where he focused on performing to get to france 2016 he looked tired and lethargic . after all it was ` only chelsea v burnley ' . he missed blatant offences which , if he were at his best , he would not have . redknapp : a radical change would be a referee in each half , like two umpires in hockey . but , before that , we must allow retrospective punishment , even if the fa have to overrule the officials . how can ashley barnes get away with his tackles at chelsea on saturday ? if the referee misreads it or misunderstands what he has seen , he must have the chance to rectify it , or else he looks stupid and football looks stupid . they need help , so please let 's help them . keown : i agree with retrospective punishment , but they also need to help themselves . when a player has had a bad game , he goes straight on the training pitch and begins preparing for the next match and the chance to put it right . referees ca n't do that . i 'd like to see the elite group refereeing midweek under-21 matches , which would give them the chance to restore confidence and also the opportunity to build relationships with the next generation of players . poll believes atkinson is fatigued and as a result is not at his best resulting in his recent below-par display . q : who are the three top referees in the country ? poll : mark clattenburg , michael oliver and mike dean . keown : i do n't disagree with clattenburg and oliver , but i 'm struggling to find any more . lee probert is a good referee and took charge of the fa cup final last season , but was then injured and it coming back via the championship . it 's a damning indictment that there are n't more . redknapp : michael oliver is the best , no question . none of the others stand out -- as i said to the first question , they are honest people , whose performances have been average this season and they have a difficult job . let 's move on . redknapp regards michael oliver as the best english referee in the business , bar none .", "summary": " sportsmail columnists graham poll , martin keown and jamie redknapp discuss the weekend 's refereeing controversy .   all three believe the current standard of refereeing is not good enough .   both redknapp and keown dispelled mourinho 's claim there is an agenda against chelsea .   poll maintains blues boss mourinho does n't have the fear factor former manchester united manager sir alex ferguson had .   redknapp regards michael oliver as the best referee in the business .
