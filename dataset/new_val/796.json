{"text": "a 93-year-old man has been charged with 300,000 counts of accessory to murder for his role as an ss guard at auschwitz concentration camp , prosecutors said today . a sergeant , oskar groening worked at the camp in german occupied poland for two and a half years . groening was charged with sorting the possessions of the inmates and collecting and tallying any money that was on them . a picture taken in january 1945 shows children in the auschwitz concentration camp in oswiecim . at least 1.1 million prisoners died at auschwitz , around 90 per cent of them jewish . in one period between may and june 1944 , 425,000 hungarian jews went there and around 300,000 were immediately sent to the gas chambers . hanoverian prosecutors said of groening :  he helped the nazi regime benefit economically , and supported the systematic killings .  groening 's lawyer , hans holtermann , refused to comment on the charges . he was never punished after the war , a tribunal cleared him of involvement in 1948 , but groening who worked as the manager of a glass factory has openly talked about his time as a guard and said that he witnessed atrocities . the main gate of the nazi concentration camp auschwitz i , near oswiecim , poland , which was liberated by the russians in january 1945 . writing on the gate reads : arbeit macht frei -lrb- work sets you free - or work liberates -rrb- . a group of ss officers gathered in front of a building at solahutte , the ss retreat outside of auschwitz , poland . from left , josef kramer , dr. josef mengele , richard baer , karl hoecker and an unknown officer . ss officers socialising in the grounds of their retreat , solahutte outside of auschwitz , poland . from left , dr josef mengele , rudolf hoess -lrb- the former commandant of auschwitz -rrb- , josef kramer -lrb- commandant of birkenau -rrb- , and an unknown officer . nine years ago , he was interviewed by der spiegel and told the magazine of one incident when he heard a baby crying :  i saw another ss soldier grab the baby by the legs ... he smashed the baby 's head against the iron side of a truck until it was silent . ` on one night in january 1943 i saw for the first time how the jews were actually gassed . it was in a half-built farmyard near to the auschwitz-birkenau camp . a gas chamber was built there . the women 's barracks in the auschwitz concentration camp in oswiecim . all that remains : a pile of shoes from prisoners at the auschwitz museum near former death camp auschwitz . ` there were more than 100 prisoners and soon there were panic-filled cries as they were herded into the chamber and the door was shut . ` then a sergeant with a gas mask went to a hole in the wall and from a tin shook zyklon b gas pellets inside . in that moment the cries of the people inside rose to a crescendo , a choir of madness . these cries i have ringing in my ears to this day . members of the ss helferinnen -lrb- female auxiliaries -rrb- and ss officer karl hoecker sit on a fence railing in solahutte eating bowls of blueberries in auschwitz . ` it was completely understood by all that the majority were going straight to the gas chamber , although some believed they were only going to be showered before going to work . many jews knew they were going to die . ' ' i made an application for a transfer and at the end of october 1944 i was shipped to the belgian ardennes where i served with a fighting unit until capture . ' groening , who lives near the lueneburg heath in lower saxony , is one of around 30 former auschwitz guards who federal investigators recommended last year that state prosecutors pursue charges against under a new precedent in german law . reichsf√ºhrer heinrich himmler was buried in an unmarked grave at lueneburg heath after his suicide in may 1945 , following his capture by the british . groening is the fourth case investigated by hanoverian authorities -- two have been abandoned because the suspects are unfit for trial , and one was closed when the suspect died . herr holtermann said , however , his client is in good health . thomas walther , who represents 20 auschwitz victims and their families as co-plaintiffs in the case against groening as allowed under german law , said it 's their last chance  to participate in bringing justice to one of the ss men who had a part in the murder of their closest relatives .   many of the co-plaintiffs are among the last survivors of auschwitz .
