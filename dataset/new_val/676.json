' the 79-year-old city grandee , who was responsible for transforming the skyline of london with the development of the giant broadgate office complex in the heart of the city , added : ` this all adds to the impression that mr miliband is unfit to govern ' . last night one of britain 's leading fashion entrepreneurs harold tillman also joined the backlash against labour , accusing it of wanting to ` stamp on aspiration . ' arguing mr miliband warrants his ` red ed ' nickname , mr tillman - who previously owned british fashion chain jaeger - said : ` i am only just realising how socialist miliband is . i am shocked at this , but labour sound as if they want to stamp on aspiration . ' the criticism will be blow to labour , which this week slipped behind the tories in the polls following a series of bruising battles with big businesses . a succession of company bosses have raised concerns about a lurch to the left under a labour government and accused the party of not supporting business and enterprise . labour 's plans to freeze energy prices and break up the banks recently prompted former marks & spencer boss lord rose to brand mr miliband a ` 1970s throwback ' whose policies echo those of the socialist labour government of that era . mr miliband 's late father ralph was a marxist intellectual who rose to prominence in the 1960s and 1970s . business leader : sir john , pictured , voiced concerns that a labour government would ` pick up some of the flaws of the french economy ' the opposition leader has spoken of the formative influence of his father , recalling political discussions around the dinner table at the family home in primrose hill . mr miliband also alarmed the business community after cosying up to francois hollande 's socialist french government after its 2012 victory . last week one of the world 's biggest investment banks , bank of america warned labour would reduce britain to an economic basketcase like france , with stunted growth and soaring unemployment . sir john ritblat , who retired from british land in 2006 and is now chairman of family property company delancey which is involved in redeveloping the olympic village site in east london , said : . ` i do n't want to go the way of france and other high tax regimes , but there is a real danger that we could end up picking up some of the flaws of the french economy -lrb- under labour -rrb- ' . referring to the financial crisis which started under the previous labour government , sir john - a conservative party donor - said : . ` it is very disappointing that the labour leaders have learnt nothing and forgotten everything . this collective amnesia about the damage caused to the economy under the previous labour government is extraordinary ' . mr miliband was ridiculed for failing to mention the near # 100billion budget deficit in his party conference speech last september . the concerns among business leaders were echoed by fashion entrepreneur harold tillman , 69 . he said : ` labour would be very bad for the economy and very bad for employment . we need to be creating a nation of entrepreneurs . it is idiotic to criticise businesses . ' the boss of one of the country 's leading manufacturers also warned of the danger of returning to failed 1970 's socialism under a labour government . john neill , the chief executive of motor parts and logistics giant unipart , which was carved out of the old british leyland empire , said he has bad memories of the 1970s when british leyland was riven by strikes . he said he is worried about the risk of going back to the ` failed models of the past ' . attacking mr miliband 's plans to freeze energy prices as ` harebrained ' , he said : . ` we can not afford to be complacent . think about china . how do we compete , how do we achieve that if we go back to the failed models of the past . i am concerned we might do that yes . labour has come under attack from a long list of prominent businessmen , including sir charles dunston , the co-founder of carphone warehouse and sir ian cheshire , who ran the diy chain b&q .", "summary": " sir john ritblat accused miliband of ` learning nothing ' from financial crisis .   said miliband 's ` family tradition is one of left wing , card carrying marxists '   business leader added he is ` only just realising how socialist ' miliband is .
