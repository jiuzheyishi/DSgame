{"text": "dave attwood studied physics and philosophy at university , so when he is throwing his weight around in the colours of bath , he has a fundamental grasp of the attitude he must adopt . playing on the edge , but not over it ; that is the key . he already knew the theory and over time -- via a couple of jolting reminders -- he has learned to apply it . the 27-year-old lock is intelligent , a deep thinker and an assured talker . he is armed for a debate , as well as for the gruelling demands of his day-job . having made a storming start to the new aviva premiership season and a strong case for england recognition , attwood considers the extremities of his role . he may have lost a few pounds , but his brief is to impose himself on the opposition . in the past , he has occasionally over-stepped the mark in that regard and the tag of ` enforcer ' has duly been applied . dave attwood pictured at bath 's picturesque farleigh house training ground in somerset . the second row has been one of the form players this season and is pushing for an england position . attwood will come up against england rival joe launchbury at adams park on sunday afternoon . most occupants of the second row would embrace it , but attwood is wary . ` i think the connotations of it are the difficult thing , ' he said , ahead of sunday 's showdown with wasps and their leading england lock , joe launchbury . ` the term  enforcer  harks back to an era when rugby was a very different game ; when a bit of shoe on someone 's shoulder was completely acceptable . rugby has changed and i am testament to that . rugby is a different game to when i started playing and you have to adapt to that . ` the trouble with the term  enforcer  is that it harks back to an era when that sort of player ran round grabbing people by the face and throwing them around , or laying down the law under the cover of a ruck or scrum . that does n't exist anymore and you ca n't do that . ` there 's no real benefit either . people are so professional these days that putting in a bit of a cheap shot on someone does n't really make a difference and you risk getting yourself cited and banned . so it 's a difficult term , but i do think there 's a place for it , in terms of being someone who takes a lead when it comes to physicality . that is definitely something i aim to do . ` you have to impose yourself , without doing it illegally -- put in a big tackle , then get up and do another one . when your defensive line is pushing the attack back , pushing the attack back , pushing the attack back ; you have to be the guy leading the charge . if anyone was to use the term  enforcer  about me ; that is what i would want them to mean . ' back in june , 2010 , when england were on tour in australia , the uncapped attwood made a major impression on the-then national manager , martin johnson . the former lock-enforcer saw the rookie as an emerging talent in his own image , but since then he has n't quite taken the next step to become a fixture in the test pack . dave attwood of bath holds off ken pisi of northampton in last season 's amlin challenge cup final . dave attwood makes a charge forwards for england against samoa at twickenham in 2010 . attwood looks on during an england training session held at bath university in 2011 . to date , he has earned 12 caps but started just twice for his country , on tour in argentina last year while the lions were in australia . his status as a regular replacement appeared to be under threat on the recent trip to new zealand , as ed slater made a positive impact as midweek captain , but the leicester skipper has been ruled out for the season and attwood had been outstanding for bath . when his club smashed the tigers 45-0 at the rec last month , he was bloodied and brilliant , in front of watching england forwards coach , graham rowntree , and he has maintained supreme standards , thanks in part to more mobility . ` they -lrb- england coaches -rrb- want the same explosive qualities , but they want us to be a bit lighter and fitter , ' he said . ` after the argentina tour last year , the feedback from england was ,  we want you big , strong and as effective as you can be in a five-metre square . now the emphasis has shifted ; they still want me to be destructive , but also get my numbers up . that is going well for me so far -- i 've made a fairly good account of myself in the early part of this season . ` i am a very good scrummaging second row -- one of the best scrummaging second rows around . it is great for me to be working with david wilson , who is one of the best tightheads in europe at the moment . so i have that string to my bow , but for the last test in new zealand i was weighing around 127kg and now i 'm about 119 . i 'm trying to get around the pitch a bit more . ' dave attwood claims a line-out for bath . sunday 's game at adams park will act as another momentous examination of his test ambitions . in recent weeks , attwood has thrived in match-ups with geoff parling and courtney lawes , now launchbury is on his radar . he is driven , but wary of being side-tracked by a personal agenda . ` you ca n't just run round the pitch , following the guy , saying ,  i 'm coming after you !  , ' he said . ` i think i 'm on a good road . i 'm not the one holding the shirt -- i 'm chasing someone else 's shirt at the moment . i 'm third or fourth or fifth choice , but i 've got a possibility of getting hold of it . i do feel like there 's an opportunity for someone with my skills-set to be a reigning england second row . ' his superb form has come in the build-up to becoming a first-time father . he senses he is entering a critical phase , in various ways . ` it may be coincidental that things are going particularly well with bath so far this season , the world cup is looming , we 've got a baby on the way and i 'm on the verge of getting established in international rugby , ' he said . there 's an awful lot going on at the moment . ` i 'm very excited and aware that i 'm on the cusp of a life-changing period . '", "summary": " second row dave attwood has become known for his physical approach .   but the lock believes the term ` enforcer ' is outdated in the modern game .   attwood will face england rival joe launchbury on sunday .   bath face wasps at adams park in the final match of the weekend .
