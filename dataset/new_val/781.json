{"text": "a new australian study has revealed homeopathic medicines are no more effective than a placebo . homeopathy is no more effective than a placebo , a national medical agency has concluded in a hard-hitting report . australia 's national health and medical . research council -lrb- nhmrc -rrb- analysed research into the effectiveness of . alternative medicines on 68 health conditions and found ` there is no . reliable evidence that homeopathy is effective ' on any of them . the review , conducted by a working committee of medical experts , said homeopathy had no impact on a range of conditions including asthma , arthritis , sleep disturbances , cold and flu , chronic fatigue syndrome , eczema , cholera , burns , malaria and heroin addiction . the authors of the report said : ` no good-quality , well-designed studies with enough participants for a meaningful result reported either that homeopathy caused greater health improvements than a substance with no effect on the health condition -lsb- placebo -rsb- , or that homeopathy caused health improvements equal to those of another treatment . ' they went on to dismiss anecdotal support for the effectiveness of homeopathy , and urged health professionals to take account of scientific evidence when informing patients . ` it is not possible to tell whether a health treatment is effective or not simply by considering individuals ' experiences or healthcare practitioners ' beliefs , ' they said . homeopathy is a complementary medicine , the central principle of which is that ` like cures like ' -- that a substance that causes certain symptoms can also help to remove them in tiny doses . in england there are several nhs homeopathic hospitals and some gp practices offer the treatment but it is not widely available . the report prompted medical professionals to call for governments to stop legitimising homeopathy . professor john dwyer , an immunologist and emeritus professor of medicine at the university of new south wales , told guardian australia the report was long overdue and said homeopathic treatments should now be ` put away ' once and for all . australia 's national health and medical research council analysed research into the effectiveness of alternative medicines on 68 different conditions , and found ` there is no reliable evidence that homeopathy is effective ' on any of them . he said : ` obviously we understand the placebo effect . we know that many people have illnesses that are short lived by its very nature and their bodies will cure them , so it 's very easy for people to fall in trap that because they did a , b follows . ' he added he did not think it ethical to prescribe a placebo . dr richard choong , western australia president of the australian medical association , also welcomed the report and said his organisation has long held there is no evidence to support homeopathy . ` homeopathy is not a science . it is not based in science , ' he said . ` in a lot of cases it can be considered dangerous and can risk people 's lives , ' said dr choong . submissions from homeopathy interest groups and the public were among the studies assessed by the nhmrc , but did not alter the conclusions of the council , in some cases due to the poor quality of the studies submitted .", "summary": " australian team looked at the impact of homeopathy on conditions including asthma , arthritis , sleep disturbances , cold and flu and eczema .   study found ` no reliable evidence ' homeopathy was effective on any illness .   homeopathy is a complimentary medicine , which works on the principle of ` like cures like ' - a substance that causes symptoms can help remove them .
