{"text": "george north brushed off his three-week lay-off through concussion , saying rugby will always have more risks than ` table tennis or tiddlywinks ' . the 22-year-old wales winger , who will become the youngest player to win 50 caps when he faces france in paris on saturday night , has been sidelined after suffering two head injuries during the defeat by england in the opening fixture of the rbs 6 nations . his record achievement has crept up amid a cloud of debate about concussion , but the northampton winger does not bear any grudges about the high-profile incidents . george north -lrb- centre -rrb- walks out for wales training ahead of his return from concussion against france . north brushed off his three-week lay-off and compared rugby with table tennis and tiddlywinks . ` at the end of the day it 's rugby , is n't it ? ' said north . ` it 's not table tennis or tiddlywinks , it 's a contact sport and you are going to get some bangs . unfortunately they were all on my chin . ` it 's nice to be back in the squad and involved again . it has been a few weeks of hard work , ticking the boxes and taking my welfare into account , which is what happened from minute one . ' criticism was levelled at the team doctors after they failed to notice a second-half collision and subsequently allowed north to stay on the pitch . it sparked debate about the safety of the sport and coach warren gatland decided to leave the youngster out of his side to face scotland . north discovered during a meeting with medical manager prav mathema that he suffered a third potential impact , but he was still left feeling frustrated by his omission for the murrayfield victory . wales head coach warren gatland -lrb- right -rrb- decided to leave north out of wales ' win over scotland . liam williams celebrates at murrayfield - but his try was ruled out as wales ground out a 26-23 victory . north suffered concussion in the rbs 6 nations opener against england at the millennium stadium . ` when you are a player at this level , the greatest honour you can get is to play for your country , ' said north . ` i was passing all the tests and i was symptom-free . i was up for selection so your initial thoughts when not picked are that you are gutted . ` the neurologist reckons i had a third blow from falling from 6ft 5in to the deck like a floppy sausage and it was n't really worth pushing it . in hindsight it was the right decision , but at the time i was like ,  arghh !  ' he will be hoping to vent that frustration through his performance at the stade de france . including his three lions caps , north will become the most junior player to reach the 50-test mark , eclipsing australia 's joe roff , who reached the milestone when he was 24 . a special pair of boots have been commissioned for the occasion and north intends to hang them on the wall alongside those from his first test in 2010 . ` for me it was never a case of 50 or 100 caps , ' said north . ` it was always about being in that jersey once , then anything more is a bonus . north has had a special pair of boots commissioned for north 's 50th cap in paris against the french . the adidas boots include the branding ' # 50 - 28/02/2015 ' , marking the number of caps and the date . ` i 'm obviously super-proud to achieve it and hopefully i can keep my head down and get to my welsh 50 . i kept my first-cap boots , my lions boots and i 'll probably keep these boots as well . you keep your jerseys , too -- hopefully my mum has n't thrown any of them out ! ' his mother will be among the crowd in paris to watch her son . the 17st 2lb speedster has a promising record against les bleus -- two tries in his two previous appearances -- but is not expecting a repeat of 2013 , when his father earned himself cult status by running on to the pitch to celebrate north 's 71st-minute try . ` i 've ordered tickets for my family but my old man is up the top , ' joked north . ` my mam and sister are at the front but my dad is in the top right-hand corner . if i score and he manages to get down from there , i 'll be impressed ! ' north shares a laugh with his wing partner liam williams -lrb- left -rrb- during wales training ahead of the game . with or without his father , north will certainly celebrate if he crosses the whitewash . having scored just one try in his last six wales appearances , the national coaches are demanding more from the former scarlet . his club form is much better -- 11 tries in 15 appearances this season -- and gatland has told the wideman that he must look for more touches on the ball . ` it 's obvious to see , ' said north . ` i 've been very happy with my club form over the past few weeks but i 've just not been able to get into my groove for my country . ` the england game was a step forward from the autumn series and the summer tour for me . i missed the scotland game but hopefully this will be the next step back on to that track . ' north talks to the press ahead of the game that marks his comeback from concussion . france : dulin ; huget , lamerat , fofana , guitoune ; lopez , parra ; ben arous , guirado , slimani , taofifenua , maestri , dusautoir -lrb- capt -rrb- , le roux , chouly . replacements : kayser , atonio , debaty , suta , goujon , tillous-borde , tales , bastareaud . wales : halfpenny ; north , davies , roberts , l williams ; biggar , webb ; jenkins , baldwin , lee , charteris , a-w jones , lydiate , warburton -lrb- capt -rrb- , faletau . replacements : hibbard , james , jarvis , b davies , tipuric , phillips , priestland , s williams .", "summary": " george north has been out with concussion for three weeks .   but the wales winger brushed it off , saying rugby will always have risks .   north makes his return on his 50th wales appearance .
