' dr crowther today apologised for failing to detect mrs humpage 's cancer . he said : ' i would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere sympathy to mrs humpage 's family for their loss . ' i am sorry for the delay in making a diagnosis . i . have reflected extensively on the episode and discussed it with . colleagues and i have learned from this process , now being more aware of . the danger in similar situations . ' a year after mrs humpage 's symptoms appeared she was finally referred to a specialist at walsall manor hospital -lrb- pictured -rrb- , where she was diagnosed with incurable cancer . lindsay tomlinson , from irwin mitchell solicitors , who represented the family , said : ` this is a tragic case that has left a family devastated by the loss of a wife , mother and grandmother . ` during out investigations an independent medical expert found that cheryl 's gp should have recognised her symptoms as typical of those experienced by cervical cancer sufferers . ` any yet no pelvic examination was made , she was not referred to a gynaecologist and no advice was given advising her to return for further medical attention should the bleeding continue . ` had she been referred earlier she would have avoided such a long period of pain and suffering without a diagnosis and our expert was of the opinion that on balance she would have lived for longer and had more time with her family . ' ms tomlinson added that if her cancer had been picked up earlier , her suffering would have been ` greatly reduced and it was ` incredibly hard for all her family to see her deteriorate so quickly ' . about 2,900 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed each year in the uk and it is most common in sexually active women aged between 25 and 45 . the symptoms of are n't always obvious and the disease may not cause any symptoms until it has reached an advanced stage . in most cases , abnormal bleeding is the first sign . its usually occurs after sex although any usually bleeding should be investigated . other symptoms include pain in and around the vagina during sex , an unpleasant smelling discharge and pain when passing urine . if the cancer has spread there may be other symptoms including constipation , blood in the urine , loss of bladder control , bone pain , a loss of appetite and a lack of energy . because of routine screening in the uk it is usually picked up in the precancerous stage . therefore it is recommended that all women between the ages of 25 and 49 are screened for cervical cancer every three years . women aged between 50 and 64 are offered screening every five years .", "summary": " cheryl humpage saw her gp several times complaining of nausea , unusual bleeding and fever - all well-documented symptoms of cervical cancer .   but it took another year before she was referred to a specialist .   by the time she was diagnosed in july 2010 it was too late to save her .   her family have now received a five-figure payout from the gp 's insurer after suing for medical negligence .
