' i think the message is clear . the town hall wo n't tolerate activities of the kind featured in the video under any circumstances . ` we will use all the laws we have available to us to ensure there is no repetition . ` playhouse and carnage now have 15 days to defend themselves and i am sure they will do so because a 12-month closure could make anything think about closing up permanently . ' the spokesman added : ` there 's nothing to stop carnage opening up again under a different name if the council decision prospers . ` but if they chose to do so they 'll have to be aware of what they 're up against .
