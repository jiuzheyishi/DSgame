{"text": "a quarter of children in britain are living in poverty , a controversial report by a united nations agency claimed yesterday . millions ` have fallen prey to the dangers of austerity ' during the recession years , unicef said . britain was even ranked 25th on a child poverty league table of 41 developed countries -- below romania , bulgaria and chile . the proportion of children in poverty is higher in the uk than in france , germany , holland or australia . however , critics last night described a measurement that assesses children in the uk as worse off than those in eastern europe as ` worthless ' . they said unicef was using distorted measures to paint a false picture of the real levels of poverty in britain . calculations are relative to average income -- so britain appears to be worse than countries where most people are poor , because average incomes in the uk are higher . in the latest of a succession of highly critical reports about britain by un agencies , unicef said child poverty in the uk increased by 1.6 percentage points between 2008 and 2012 to 25.6 per cent . topping a table of countries deemed to have best protected children during the recession was chile , where child poverty was said to have dropped by 8.6 points . unicef attacked the government 's cuts to benefits for contributing to a rise in child poverty since 2008 . policy : jeffrey o'malley is behind the report . the un official behind the children of the recession report is unicef director of policy and strategy jeffrey o'malley . the canadian has spent his career working for the un and other global organisations . mr o'malley is an active user of twitter , which he uses to publicise not only the un agency 's activities but his other interests , which include campaigning against climate change , and supporting the global drug policy commission , which wants to see drug abuse decriminalised . before joining unicef mr o'malley spent 20 years working for hiv and aids campaign groups . for 11 years he ran the hiv/aids alliance , which is claimed to be ` the world 's largest international development non-governmental organisation specialising in hiv and aids ' . he then moved to the un development programme , an agency which has also provoked controversy in britain . in 2011 it published a ` human development index ' that put britain in 28th place , below recession-ravaged greece , spain , italy and ireland . mr o'malley took over the policy role at unicef in 2012 . in romania , in 12th place , child poverty fell 2.3 points , while the measure dropped by 0.6 in 20th-placed bulgaria . the children of the recession report said many affluent countries had suffered a ` great leap backwards ' in terms of household income . jeffrey o'malley , unicef 's head of global policy and strategy , added : ` the impact on children will have long-lasting repercussions for them and their communities . ` all countries need strong social safety nets to protect children in bad times and in good -- and wealthy countries should lead by example , explicitly committing to eradicate child poverty , developing policies to offset economic downturns , and making child well-being a top priority . ' unicef 's use of ` relative poverty ' in its report is unpopular in britain . work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith has been trying to stop whitehall using such measurements because they are seen by many to record levels of inequality , rather than poverty . relative poverty counts people as poor if they live on an income below a poverty line , set at 60 per cent of median income . but if the median income in a country rises , so do the number of people who appear to be in ` poverty ' . conversely , if everyone is poor , but median incomes are low , it will suggest fewer people in poverty . however , critics condemned the methods used by the un agency to arrive at its figures . jill kirby , former chief of the centre for policy studies think-tank , described the findings as ` worthless ' and said unicef should be using measures of ` real deprivation ' . a source close to work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith said unicef is using ` out of date statistics ' and said national data showed that around 300,000 fewer children are now in poverty . in another unflattering table of national comparisons , yesterday 's report also highlighted britain 's ` neets ' -- young people who are not in employment , education or training . unicef found that neets rose from 12.1 per cent in 2008 to 13.3 per cent in 2012 , placing the uk 14th out of 41 on the league table -- below turkey and mexico . ` many will suffer the consequences for life , ' the report said . in fact turkey has more than doubled the percentage of neets aged 15 to 24 compared to britain , and mexico close to double . but by looking at relative changes in the years 2008 to 2012 , unicef put both countries higher in its league table . the report said britain should ` review ' its economic policies as a ` priority ' and raise working tax credit , increase benefits in line with inflation , and push up the minimum wage for under 21s . other un reports have criticised britain . last year the un 's special rapporteur on adequate housing , brazilian raquel rolnik , angered tory politicians when she demanded the abolition of the so-called ` bedroom tax ' . and south african official rashida manjoo claimed that sexism in britain is worse than elsewhere and that public spending cuts were making things worse . bad parents should be given government classes on how to cuddle their children , according to a major new report published last week . politicians have been reluctant to ` call out ' bad parenting , despite this having a bigger impact children than money or schooling , the former labour minister alan milburn said . mr milburn , who was brought in by david cameron as the government 's social mobility tsar , attacked mps for being ` tentative and timid ' about bad parenting . deputy prime minister nick clegg -lrb- left -rrb- has attacked the tories for blocking the introduction of ` meaningful ' new child poverty targets following alan milburn 's report into social mobility . child poverty is now a bigger problem than during the 1960s , the national children 's bureau warned last week . it said britain is at risk of becoming a place where ` children 's lives are so polarised that rich and poor live in separate , parallel worlds . ' it found that around 3.6 million children are now living in relative poverty today compared with 2million in the late 1960s . he called for a national parenting campaign , funded by cutting childcare tax breaks from families with at least one parent earning more than # 100,000 a year . mr milburn 's report also calls for the best teachers to be paid more to work in deprived areas , action to close the gap in gcse results between rich and poor youngsters and for universities to admit 5,000 more students from disadvantaged backgrounds by 2020 . it also says that unpaid internships should be made illegal , and that the ` living wage ' should be introduced by 2025 . the recommendations come amid warnings that the generation of workers will stay poorer than their parents throughout their lives unless ` urgent action ' is taken to boost wages and slash youth unemployment . mr milburn said the uk was at risk of becoming a ` permanently divided ' nation , with the poorest in society left behind . it says that the country is likely to see an unprecedented rise in child poverty over the next decade , amid the biting impact of welfare cuts and low pay .", "summary": " children 's rights body blamed coalition cuts for increase in child poverty .   uk now 25th out of 41 developed countries for children living in poverty .   child poverty increased by 1.6 % to 25.6 % following the 2008 recession .
