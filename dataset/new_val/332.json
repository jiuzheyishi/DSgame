{"text": "taking a painkiller can numb emotional pain , say experts . paracetamol could be used to help treat emotional pain and anxiety , according to a new canadian study . it found that the common painkiller could help alleviate the symptoms of existential dread - the anxiety that arises from uncertainty surrounding the meaning of life and death . the researchers knew from previous . research that both physical and social pain - such as bumping your head . or falling out with friends - can be alleviated with paracetamol . lead researcher daniel randles from the university of british columbia said : ` pain extends beyond tissue damage and hurt feelings , and includes the distress and existential angst we feel when we 're uncertain or have just experienced something surreal . ` regardless of the kind of pain , taking -lsb- paracetamol -rsb- seems to inhibit the brain signal that says something is wrong . ' he and his colleagues speculated that the uneasiness we feel when faced with thoughts of death might involve similar brain processes . they wondered whether it would it be possible to numb that type of suffering with a simple pain medicine , too . the study involved 120 university students who were divided into two groups . one group was given a 1000mg pill of tylenol , an american brand of paracetamol , and the other was given a placebo sugar pill . some from both groups were asked to write about dental pain while the rest were asked to write about what would happen to them after they died . all participants were then asked to read about the arrest of a prostitute . participants were asked to set an amount for bail , ranging from nothing to # 325 , for the hypothetical prostitute . the humble paracetamol was shown to alleviate symptoms of anxiety . as expected , the control group who wrote about dental pain - who felt no existential anxiety - gave relatively low bail amounts of around # 195 . however , those who wrote about their own death and took no paracetamol , gave the highest amounts , suggesting a fee of around # 260 . the second part of the study required watching a surrealist video by director david lynch and then a video of rioters . researchers found that people who took paracetamol were less judgmental about the behaviour of the rioters . the study demonstrated that existentialist dread is not limited to thinking about death , but can be experienced in any situation which is unpredictable or surprising . ` we 're still taken aback that we 've found that a drug used primarily to alleviate headaches can also make people numb to the worry of thinking about their deaths , or to the uneasiness of watching a surrealist film , ' said randles . the researchers believe that these studies may have implications for new treatments in the future . ` for people who suffer with chronic anxiety , or are overly sensitive to uncertainty , this work may shed some light on what is happening and how their symptoms could be reduced , ' concluded randles .", "summary": " tylenol , an american brand of paracetamol , was found to reduce emotional pain of worry surrounding death .   experts believe similar therapies could be used to help alleviate symptoms of anxiety in the future .
