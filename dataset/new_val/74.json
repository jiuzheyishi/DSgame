{"text": "a college student from new york was waiting for ups to deliver some weightlifting equipment he had ordered - but instead he received a government drone . the shocking discovery was made monday by reddit user seventy_seven , who promptly took to the online forum to share photos of what he found inside the ups parcel . the box delivered to the engineering student 's doorstep contained wings , a control panel and a card stating that the items were federal property and should be returned to a national oceanic and atmospheric administration -lrb- noaa -rrb- office at macdill air force base in tampa , florida . special delivery : an unsuspecting college . student got a ups delivery containing a puma ae drone , which was property of the federal government . incomplete set : the box was one of eight containers carrying parts of the drone used for environmental observation . pricey video game : the parcel contained a control panel used to operate the drone from the ground . the box came with this card explaining that it was federal property that came from a noaa office at macdill air force base . ' i think i just got a drone in the mail . ' the unsuspecting recipient wrote in a reddit post that quickly went viral . when the student called ups about the package , he was allegedly told that because his name and address were on the box containing the equipment , the drone was his to keep , if he so chose . ` in all fairness , the ups guy that delivered it said it was part 2 of my package , so i genuinely thought at first , that it was part of the weight lifting bench set i ordered , ' the student said . ` not sure if that will protect me from the government though . ' another reddit user , who described himself as an afghan war veteran , identified the drone as a puma ae unmanned aerial vehicle , the daily dot reported . the soldier said the noaa drone features high-definition thermal camera , a range of nearly 13 miles , and if handled improperly , its rotors could easily cut off a finger . ` the thing will take a beating ! ' the soldier wrote . ` do n't play chicken with this thing , i 've seen one go half way through a car door . ' when fully assembled , a puma ae unmanned aircraft like the one seen in this picture is worth about $ 350,000 . noaa . spokesman david miller later confirmed that the machinery that was . mistakenly brought to the home of the college student was indeed a puma . drone worth about $ 350,000 when fully assembled , which had been shipped . in an eight-box set from tampa to stellwagen bank marine sanctuary in . massachusetts . but . somewhere en route from florida to massachusetts , one of the boxes . containing drone parts allegedly got mislabeled and went missing . ups spokeswoman susan rosenberg has released a statement confirming the delivery snafu . she . added that the shipping company , which delivers nearly 17million . parcels each day , was working to recover the drone from the reddit user . and ship it to the sanctuary as intended . rosenberg . said she suspects a label became displaced from a package ordered ups . is still investigating exactly what happened to the package . seventy_seven has revealed himself as somewhat of a drone enthusiast , calling them an ` awesome tool . ' he told the huffington post that he was . especially eager to return the unmanned aircraft to noaa because it was . meant to be used in the observation of marine life and migratory birds . point of departure : the $ 350,000 unmanned aircraft was shipped in eight boxes from macdill air force base in tampa last week . mistaken identity : ups says that the name and address label from a box containing the student 's weightlifting bench may have somehow ended up on the box containing the drone . on tuesday night , ups staff reportedly picked up the box with the puma wings and control console , and it is said to be on its way to the massachusetts nature preserve now . according to noaa , the puma drone is a ` flying camera ' that researchers use to ` spy on nature , ' the washington post reported . the hand-launched aircraft comes with 5-foot wingspans , a 5-megapixel camera and can fly for two hours at speeds up to 55mph and altitudes up to 10,000 feet , according to stars and stripes . the reddit user admitted that he should not have posted photos of the drone online before contacting noaa , and said he was glad the situation was resolved without him being led away in handcuffs , or ` dead , ' as he wrote half-jokingly in response to other users ' quips . ` generally , i was an idiot , ' the student wrote . ` but i 'm a lucky idiot , who currently is n't serving jail time . even so , i really do n't think hypersensitive government equipment would be shipped through ups , let alone get delivered to a civilian .
