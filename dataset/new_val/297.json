{"text": "david cameron and barack obama will today prepare the ground for multi-national air strikes against islamic state and for sending troops to form a nato training force in iraq . there is intense pressure on mr cameron and the us president to use a nato summit to act decisively against the ` terrorist state ' . in britain , cross-party support for joining us military action was increasing . multi-national effort ? david cameron is facing intense pressure to act decisively against isis by joining the us in launching air strikes . meanwhile , as he heads to the nato summit , obama is being accused of indecision . with world leaders gathered in wales , the prime minister will argue for a multi-national effort to crush jihadist forces who have already murdered two americans and are threatening to kill a british hostage . he told the commons he has no doubt that millions of dollars raised by is -- also called isil or isis -- from ransom payments is used to promote terrorism affecting the uk . and he said britain will continue with its policy of not paying ransoms to terrorist kidnappers , adding the uk needed to ensure that other countries were also ` good to their word ' . a video showing the beheading of american journalist steven sotloff also included is extremists threatening a uk hostage . at prime minister 's questions , mr cameron said : ` there 's no doubt that the many tens of millions of dollars that isil has raised from ransom payments is going into promoting terrorism , including terrorism affecting our own country . ' he said that at last year 's g8 summit he had ` launched an initiative to try to get other countries to sign-up to a very clear doctrine that in the case of terrorist kidnap , no ransom should be paid . ` britain continues with this policy , america continues with his policy but we need to redouble the efforts to make sure other countries are good to their word . ' pressure : cameron told the commons the uk will not cow to terrorists as he races to free a british hostage . threats : an islamic state fighter spoke with a british accent as he beheaded us journalist steven sotloff . government sources suggested that as well as backing air attacks , in the longer term britain was ready to contemplate putting boots back on the ground in iraq in a potential nato force to train iraqi and kurdish forces -- if requested by baghdad . there is international dismay at the lack of a coherent strategy from america for tackling is as the sunni extremists killed thousands and seized large areas of iraq and syria . mr obama and mr cameron are today expected to insist that western allies stand shoulder to shoulder in the fight against is -- and argue its forces pose a direct threat to british and us families . the prime minister said : ` a country like ours will not be cowed by these barbaric killers . if they think we will weaken in the face of their threats , they are wrong . ` it will have the opposite effect . we will be more forthright in the defence of the values , liberty under the rule of law , freedom , democracy that we hold dear . ' he told mps that the fight against islamic extremism is akin to a new cold war , and could last for many years . ` it is not unlike the cold war , where we did not just pursue those who wanted to do us such harm , we also had to challenge all those who gave them succour . that is what we need to do in a struggle which , as i have said , i think will last for decades . ' determined : government sources claim obama will tell the summit , ` we 'll win against the psychopaths ' asked as he arrived for the summit in newport if people can expect british involvement in air strikes , mr cameron said : ` we must do what is in our national interest . ' however , he insisted that while britain and the us stood ready to assist , regional powers must take the lead in tackling is . government sources at the summit said mr cameron and mr obama 's message would be ` we 'll win against the psychopaths ' . former labour foreign secretary jack straw said he believed the uk should join in air strikes , adding : ` no one is more aware than i am of the legacy of the 2003 iraq war . of course we should learn from the past , -lsb- but -rsb- we should not be paralysed by the past . this is a threat to civilisation . ' he accused mr obama of being indecisive on foreign policy -- a sentiment being expressed widely in london and washington . he said : ` as much as i respect him , he 's very long on analysis , but he 's not quite as fleet of foot on being decisive . this nato summit provides a clear opportunity for some very clear leadership by the united states . ' deputy prime minister nick clegg is understood to have indicated he is ready to back air strikes , and labour also appears on the point of backing action .", "summary": " cross-party support growing for uk support of us military efforts .   isis has already killed us journalists james foley and steven sotloff .   now group threatening to kill british aid worker david haines .   the extremist group controls land the size of the uk and 4m people .   british government will try ` every option ' to recover the hostage .   david cameron has defiantly declared : ` we will never give in to terrorism ' "}
