{"text": "israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has been left red-faced after a video shot by a celebrity home designer depicting his modest lifestyle was revealed to be recorded in his servants ' quarters . the 15-minute film by moshik galamin showed mr netanyahu 's wife sara guiding the viewer around the couple 's home , where run down parts of the property such as creaking doors and frayed carpets , are detailed . but it has now emerged galamin was not granted access to the couple 's upstairs living quarters , and israel 's channel 10 tv claimed the kitchen in question was not even the one the netanyahus use , but rather a secondary administrative kitchen . netanyahu 's wife sara bemoans the state of their kitchen in a home remodelling show . however , it has emerged the kitchen is used by administrative staff , not the the netanyahus themselves . israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu -lrb- pictured -rrb- has become embroiled in an expenses controversy after an official watchdog criticised his spending of taxpayers ' money on food , furniture and gardening . the embarrassing video forms just one of a series of damaging developments in netanyahu 's expenses controversy after an official watchdog criticised his spending of taxpayers ' money . in the clip , sara netanyahu unveils to interior designer galamin a simple home with creaking doors and windows , frayed carpets , dusty lamps , cracked light fixtures and paint peeling off neglected walls . she bemoans how they did n't have the budget to fix upholstery before the 2013 visit of president barack obama and says he was forced to sit on a coffee-stained couch . ' i do n't notice the details because i do n't dare think about it , ' she says as she points to mildew in a courtyard . ` when you walk out , make sure the door handle does n't break off , ' she said with a giggle as he parted . galamin , who hosts a popular home remodeling tv show , said he funded the shoot - which opposition lawmakers say violated israeli campaign finance laws . a former chief of the shin bet security service called the film a ` severe security breach ' and said terrorist groups would have been willing to pay a hefty sum to acquire such an inside look at the prime minister 's home . netanyahu 's office had no immediate comment on the tv report . sara netanyahu - a former member of the couple 's housekeeping staff has filed a lawsuit claiming he was mistreated and verbally abused by her . the video , perhaps ironically , is set to catchy background music that includes the theme song from the netflix series ` house of cards ' and justin timberlake 's hit ` cry me a river . ' ` it was like a horrific traffic accident-something that you ca n't bear to watch but at the same time you ca n't tear your eyes away , ' wrote sima kadmon , a frequent critic of the netanyahus , sarcastically adding outrage over ` the shameful quality of life the royal family has been forced to live in during its years in power . ' netanyahu 's rivals pounced on the material . the centrist yesh atid party , which has made corruption a centerpiece of its campaign , said the report and video reflected how disconnected netanyahu was from real problems of average israelis , who just three years ago took to the streets en masse to protest the country 's high cost of living . ` what matters are the citizens , not the carpets , ' it said . meanwhile , the government 's state comptroller has found ` excessive ' amounts of public funds have been spent by mr netanyahu and his wife sara , on food , furniture and gardening at their state residence and private home . in a report by the official watchdog , it was claimed cleaning expenses in the home on the coastal city of caesarea averaged more than # 1,370 a month in taxpayer 's money even though the couple only spent the occasional weekend there . it was also said they pocketed proceeds from recycling bottles that had been purchased for entertaining official guests . it said the bottle returns , and purchases of garden furniture for their private home , may have violated the law . the watchdog 's findings have ramped up tensions between the premier and his opponents in the run - up to elections on march 17 which have focused on the economic woes of middle and lower-class voters . mr netanyahu promised to follow the recommendations to curb spending but he also criticised the ` ongoing media campaign ' surrounding the report , which he said was aimed at toppling him . netanyahu 's opponents have tried to portray him as enjoying a lavish lifestyle and being out of touch with the struggles of average israelis . netanyahu 's allies angrily dismissed the allegations as part of a campaign to deflect attention from important national security issues . mr netanyahu and his wife are no strangers to such scrutiny . the prime minister has long been saddled with an image as a cigar-smoking , cognac-drinking socialite , while his wife has come under fire for her own expensive tastes and alleged abusive behavior toward staff . the netanyahus accuse the israeli media of a longstanding witch hunt against them . in a statement , netanyahu said he respected the findings of the comptroller and pledged to implement recommendations to curb wasteful spending . two days before the state comptroller released its report , netanyahu posted a 15-minute video on facebook that appeared aimed at countering his hedonistic image ahead of march 17 elections . at the same time he lashed out at the ` ongoing media campaign ' that he said is aimed at toppling him . ` there is absolutely no indication of any assault on the public 's integrity and certainly no indication of any criminal transgressions , ' he said . a former member of their housekeeping staff has filed a lawsuit claiming he was mistreated and verbally abused by sara netanyahu . in one instance , meni naftali alleged she called him at 3am to complain that he had bought milk in a plastic storage bag instead of a carton . in another , he claimed that she chastised him because some flowers in a vase were a day old . netanyahu said expenses have dropped significantly in the two years since the departure of naftali , a man he described as ` an embittered former public employee . ' over the years , reports have been released about the high cost of the netanyahus ' catering , housekeeping , furniture , clothing and makeup . in one case , the premier was chided for spending $ 127,000 in public funds for a special sleeping cabin on a flight to london . even their costly purchases of scented candles and pistachio-flavored ice cream have been derided . two days before the state comptroller released its report , netanyahu posted a 15-minute video on facebook that appeared aimed at countering the hedonistic image ahead of march 17 elections that have focused on the economic woes of middle and lower-class voters .", "summary": " benjamin netanyahu has become embroiled in an expenses controversy .   an official watchdog has criticised his spending of taxpayers ' money .   found ` excessive ' amounts of public funds has been spent by pm and wife .   but video at his home revealed to have been filmed in servants ' quarters .   in it , his wife sara bemoans the state of their kitchen and frayed carpets .   she said there was no budget to fix upholstery before obama 's 2013 visit .
