' talking to el mundo deportivo , zabaleta admitted : ` it will be a tough game . we ' re confident of a better result than last year . ` there were doubts about barcelona after the christmas break and problems between the coach and some players . but football is about now and nothing more . wilfried bony -lrb- left -rrb- , samir nasri -lrb- centre -rrb- and bacary sagna -lrb- right -rrb- are put through their paces in training . city 's spanish playmaker david silva plays a flashy pass during training on monday . city right-back pablo zabaletta -lrb- right -rrb- keeps the ball up with team-mate samir nasri -lrb- centre -rrb- . ` they recovered quickly and put together a run of wins that put them a point behind real madrid . the defeat at home to malaga does n't mean they 're in bad form . they 're in good form but lost . ` one game does n't change anything . we still believe that we will face the best team in europe , with great players . ` on our part , we needed to show we could control the game and move the ball -lsb- against newcastle -rsb- . the five goals give confidence to the team . for us it was a very important result . ' discussing former liverpool striker suarez , zabaleta added : ` he is one of the best in the world . perhaps at liverpool , he played as the focal point of the attack . he shared space with sturridge and sterling , but was the most important striker . midfielder james milner -lrb- right -rrb- shrugs his shoulders in training ahead of city 's game with barcelona . nasi sprints past city team-mate wilfried bony -lrb- left -rrb- as pellegrini watches his side train . ` it 's his first year at barca and like everybody he needs a period of adaptation . he has n't scored the same amount of goals as messi and neymar , but he 's created a lot . ` the goal against levante the other day shows the quality that he has . i 'm sure that he will be key . ` we 're a team that has only recently been in this competition . when you face teams with experience and prestige it 's an extra boost . ` we are in great form and with all our players available . that 's ideal when you ' re playing against one of the best teams and barca are one of those . ` between two teams that try to play football , that want to have the ball , the possession and that , above all else , will try to create goalscoring opportunities . two teams which will try to attack quickly - it will be an open game .
