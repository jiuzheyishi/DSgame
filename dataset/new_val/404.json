{"text": "nick clegg fractured the coalition 's unity over defeating islamic state yesterday by warning he will block any bid to bomb jihadi bases in syria . the liberal democrat leader indicated he would not allow david cameron to call a fresh commons vote on expanding the raf 's current campaign targeting the terrorists in iraq . until now , the coalition has presented a united front on dealing with is . but mr clegg rejected early action in syria , where jihadis have murdered four western hostages , including british aid workers alan henning and david haines . scroll down for video . deputy prime minister nick clegg said he would not support airstrikes against isis in syria , despite backing action in iraq . his stance alarmed senior tories , who had believed that ed miliband was the main barrier to britain joining the international fight against is as it relentlessly spreads its poisonous tentacles from its syrian heartland . a senior tory source said : ` clegg seems to have shifted . the question is whether it is just a shift to get him through his party conference , or something more serious . ' former tory defence minister sir gerald howarth accused mr clegg of being ` utterly irresponsible ' . he added : ` clegg is all over the place on this . he said we must do all in our power to stop these brutal killings , yet now he 's saying that we wo n't do all in our power . ' former defence secretary liam fox said : ` it is very clear that the lib dems are willing to have us fight is with one hand tied behind our back , allowing these murderers to retreat behind an imaginary line in the sand . this is a desperate lib dem leader playing to the gallery rather than standing up for the national interest . ' hms defender has been deployed to protect the us navy carrier task group in the gulf , using its ` world-class air defence weapon systems ' , as part of the international coalition against isis . tory ministers have been agitating for a fresh commons vote to authorise military action against is in syria . but mr clegg told the bbc 's andrew marr show : ` i would n't advocate that we extend the air campaign into syria . that 's why we did n't do it last week . ' asked whether there would be a fresh vote on syria , he added : ` no , well it wo n't come to a vote unless the government proposes it , and what i 'm saying is the government is not proposing it right now . ` we need to persuade the british people , indeed parliament as well , that every time we put servicemen and servicewomen in harm 's way , we do so with a clear strategy in mind . ` and i think the combination of air strikes and ground forces needs to be properly thought through . that was obvious in iraq . it 's a little bit more complicated in syria . ' aides to mr clegg said the lib dems were not opposed to air strikes on is in syria by the us and arab countries but would not back british involvement until there was a credible syrian opposition able to take the fight to is on the ground -- and that could take years . former chief of the defence staff lord richards said tackling is in syria was a ` no-brainer ' , as it was impossible to defeat it by focusing only on its operations in iraq . he added that ` thousands ' more british troops should be recruited to fight islamic terrorism around the world . lord richards , who stood down as head of the armed forces last year , said : ` you either have to put your own boots on the ground at some point or else you have to very energetically and aggressively train up those who will do that with us and for us . my worry at the moment is that the scale of the challenge is n't being met by the right scale of response . mps backed government plans to join air strikes against isis in iraq by 524 to 43 , majority 481 , after more than six hours of debate in an emergency recall of parliament last month . ` i am worried that without more intensive use of western boots on the ground in a support role then we wo n't do it in the time we need to get on and do this in . ' relatives and friends of mr henning , murdered by is last week , accused the government of doing too little to try to secure his freedom and that of mr haines , who was beheaded last month . mr henning 's brother-in-law , colin livesey , 47 , said : ` they could have done more when they knew about it months and months ago . just the same with david haines -- i do n't think they did enough for him either . ' lord richards played down expectations that the sas would be able to hunt down the hostage killers in syria , saying : ` as good as the sas are , they are also rightly very cautious and i think to expect them to do that is a tall order and it needs to be part of this grander strategy . '", "summary": " lib dem leader said he ` would n't advocate ' attacks against isis in syria .   comes after pm said he needed ` consensus ' before striking outside iraq .   mr miliband has called for un security council resolution before syria strikes .   former armed forces chief lord richards said syria airstrikes a ` no brainer ' "}
