{"text": "hands off in the box is our new campaign to rid football of the dark arts of the penalty box . whether it is wrestling , grappling , shirt pulling - or the outrageous headlocks witnessed in the manchester united vs chelsea match - the area has become a free-for-all for cheating . and that means fewer goals in the barclays premier league . for too long , referees have failed to punish players for blatantly stopping opponents from scoring . it 's time to end that . so join us in our campaign to say hands off in the box to players and referees . we 'll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it . a few years ago , during a promotional event with some journalists at qpr 's harlington training ground , one of the world 's finest central defenders made his way into the penalty area to wait for a corner . as the ball was launched in , he pulled down hard on his marker 's shirt on the blindside of the referee to prevent his opponent jumping and used it to propel himself into the air . he scored with a header easily enough and made the sap on the end of it look like he did n't fancy aerial combat with a top class centre half -lrb- true , as it happened -rrb- . john terry ran away chuckling , laughing at the naivety more than anything -lrb- plus the fact he had swapped sides at half-time with his team leading 5-0 and had brought it back to five-all -rrb- . for the avoidance of doubt this is not an attack on terry 's integrity because he is one of the finest defenders this country has produced . at 33 he is playing better than ever in chelsea colours . he did , however , provide a fascinating insight into the tricks of the trade used by players competing at the very highest level . stuff goes on and the players just hope to hell that the referee does n't spot it or , if he does , lets you get away with it . which brings us nicely to the official phil dowd , the poor fella who is still being given a good kicking three days on from manchester united 's 1-1 draw with chelsea . on sunday afternoon , in the seconds before robin van persie 's dramatic equaliser for united , a text message arrived from the boss : ` are you mad ?! ' . phil dowd had his work cut out at old trafford on sunday trying to spot all the grappling and wrestling . sat in the mail 's kensington office he was reacting to a tweet , sent from the press box at old trafford , that had the audacity to praise dowd 's performance involving two highly-charged teams who did not want to give an inch . here is the offending tweet : ` this is n't terribly fashionable to say , but phil dowd has refereed this game brilliantly ' . in the marks awarded on mailonline , dowd was given an eight out of 10 . that 's a decent mark in the biggest game of the season and more than any of the players or the managers received . what a crime that turned out to be on an afternoon when people were not quite sure who was man of the match and who had the upper hand . still , when in doubt , give the referee the mother of all kickings . sitting at home , or in the office , it is easy to re-referee a football match when there are 26 -lrb- sometimes more -rrb- cameras inside a stadium . john terry holds on to marcos rojo while defending a corner against manchester united . terry grabs rojo while the argentine holds nemanja matic 's shirt and the serb gives some back . those replays , plus the commentary , along with full-time and half-time analysis , do n't half come in handy . terry and branislav ivanovic were ` double headlocked ' at ever corner according to chelsea 's captain . the pictures of the pair grappling with chris smalling and marcos rojo backed him up . dowd was given an eight for , by and large , keeping these warring teams on the straight and narrow by issuing eight yellow cards and dismissing ivanovic . the default mechanism in the game is thus : there is a man in authority , so give him the coating because the pgmol , the match officials ' guardian angels , prevent the poor sucker defending himself in a post-match press conference . match officials are soft , soft targets . terry is bundled to the floor by rojo -lrb- right -rrb- as chris smalling wrestles with branislav ivanovic -lrb- centre -rrb- . as reporters , we will never have to justify ourselves to dowd , or any other match official , because we rarely come across them -lrb- apart from a nod and a handshake at st george 's park on international weeks -rrb- . the players and managers are different because we are more likely to come across them in press conferences or in mixed zones down by the tunnel area . gary neville believed juan mata was manchester united 's best player in the first half . by the time he was substituted in the 66th minute he had touched the ball just 35 times . marouane fellaini , the man who smothered cesc fabregas and is now apparently fully acclimatised to life at united , had the third worst passing record in the home team . fabregas , subdued it has to be said , was upgraded to a seven because he provided the killer ball for drogba to put chelsea in front . goals pay the rent and all that . dowd -lrb- right -rrb- lays down the law to a smiling cesc fabregas during the clash at old trafford . dowd dismisses branislav ivanovic -lrb- left -rrb- for a second bookable offence after a foul on angel di maria -lrb- right -rrb- . back to dowd . to put his performance at old trafford into perspective , the pgmol asked a 51-year-old man to make key decisions when he is trying to keep up with twenty-something footballers who often hoover 100 metres in less than 11 seconds . in addition we are asking a guy who is usually on the move to make the correct decision in a top class sporting arena with 22 players launching themselves into a full-bloodied contact in all areas of the pitch . sat in the office , the boss will benefit from the 26 or more cameras stationed at old trafford to help the broadcaster , in this case sky , come to a conclusion . was dowd right ? ` well let 's take a look at the replay ... '", "summary": " john terry provided insight into tricks during event at qpr years ago .   phil dowd was given a kicking -lrb- although not by this reporter -rrb- after his display during manchester united 's 1-1 draw with chelsea .   it 's easy to have a go at a referee when you have benefit of replays .   how 's official meant to see everything that happens on pitch ?
