{"text": "virgil van dijk branded slovakian referee ivan kruzliak the worst he had ever encountered after the controversial red card that crushed celtic 's europa league dreams . the dutchman was sent off after just 36 minutes of the 1-0 second-leg defeat to inter milan following two bookings in rapid succession . initially cautioned for a foul on rodrigo palacio , van dijk earned his marching orders for a second soft-looking offence against mauro icardi . celtic defender virgil van dijk was sent off against inter milan following two bookings in rapid succession . van dijk -lrb- third left -rrb- looks away as he is dismissed in the first half for celtic against inter milan . celtic were incensed by a number of other decisions -- including the denial of a penalty appeal by stuart armstrong -- and kris commons earned a yellow card after the final whistle for voicing his opinion towards kruzliak . it was , however , the dismissal of van dijk that left ronny deila 's men facing a titanic task , with their fate sealed two minutes from time when fredy guarin netted a spectacular strike to clinch a 4-3 aggregate victory for inter . ` it was a terrible decision , ' van dijk insisted . ` that is the worst referee i have ever experienced in my career . ` i do n't know why he made this decision but it was shocking . but i watched the whole game and i do n't understand all of the decisions he made . van dijk -lrb- right -rrb- looks dismayed as he leaves the pitch at the san siro after being shown a red card . kris commons -lrb- centre -rrb- and celtic will have reason to feel aggrieved with the referee after the game . ` i got the red card and the second yellow was just a ball in the air we are challenging for -- two players . we are shoulder to shoulder and icardi got up and asked for the referee to book me again . he did that and it was a terrible decision . ` i would never ask for an opponent to be booked but it happens in football . ` what disappoints me most is that they were n't yellow cards and it happened so early in the game . it was a bad decision and that should n't happen . ` there was also a shout for a penalty and a lot of other things . like i said , the referee got so many things wrong . ` he booked adam -lrb- matthews -rrb- and nir -lrb- bitton -rrb- in the second half and they were n't yellows , either . it was unbelievable . ' despite his outrage , van dijk also felt a sense of personal responsibility for celtic failing to reach the last 16 . fredy guarin -lrb- centre -rrb- scores from outside the area in the 88th minute to send inter milan through over celtic . craig gordon -lrb- left -rrb- had been in great form on the night for celtic but could not keep guarin 's strike out . ` i want to apologise to my team-mates and all the fans who travelled to italy , ' he added . ` i let them down and i feel terrible . if i 'd stayed on the pitch for 90 minutes , we 'd have had a big chance to go through . ` the guys are all with me . they know it was n't a red card and they have supported me already . but it 's an awful feeling as the ref made a decision , i was sent off and i feel like i 've let them down . ` we had a good gameplan and we started well . we learned a lot from the first leg at celtic park . we stayed close together as a back four and we talked a lot . we had chances and i think we would have had a good chance to go through . ` it 's so disappointing and i need to learn from this . i am young , i am learning every day and i 've high expectations for myself .
