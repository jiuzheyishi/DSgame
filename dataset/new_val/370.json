{"text": "gps will be paid # 55 for every patient diagnosed with dementia under a controversial scheme to boost detection . it is being rolled out by the nhs over concerns that family doctors are picking up less than half of all cases . but leading gps have branded the incentives unethical and say they will lead to patients being wrongly diagnosed and suffering needless anxiety . undetected : gps will be paid an incentive of # 55 for patients diagnosed with dementia -lrb- picture posed by model -rrb- . around 850,000 patients in britain are thought to have dementia but only 45 per cent have had a formal diagnosis . this has partly been blamed on an attitude of fatalism among doctors and patients who assume the diagnosis is pointless as so little can be done . but health secretary jeremy hunt has called the situation ` shocking ' and pledged to increase diagnosis rates to two-thirds by next year . nhs officials suspect this target is unreachable and are resorting to paying practices # 55 for every patient diagnosed over the next five months . the incentives -- uncovered by pulse magazine -- will see practices given the extra money depending on how many more patients are on their dementia register in march , compared to september just gone . it will be up to doctors how they spend this money and to either put it towards salaries or general running costs . but dr martin brunet , a gp from guildford , surrey , said it could potentially lead to doctors misdiagnosing patients . he also warned it may result in patients with very unlikely symptoms and their families having to go through the ordeal of rounds of dementia screening just in case . health secretary jeremy hunt has pledged to increase diagnosis rates to two-thirds by next year . ` we need to think very carefully about this as it crosses a line that has not been crossed before -- the direct payment on the basis of making a diagnosis --  cash for diagnoses  , ' he said . ` patients are at their most vulnerable when we make a diagnosis , because it is the doctor 's judgment and so very difficult for the patient to challenge it . ` the payment is not on the basis of caring for our patients , but only the diagnostic label we apply -- this creates a major conflict of interests that is frankly unethical . ' dr iona heath , former president of the royal college of gps who practises in north london , said : ` i think the proposal is an intellectual and ethical travesty . ' charities warned that the payments would only partly solve the problem as many patients with dementia are too frightened to make a gp appointment . george mcnamara , of the alzheimer 's society , said : ` any step towards improving diagnosis is a good thing . however , a focus on enhanced payments is only part of the answer . ` we know some doctors are reluctant to give a diagnosis because they know the right help and support is n't available locally . ` it 's absolutely vital that every person with dementia understands what is happening to them and has access to the help they need afterwards . ' last month the head of the nhs , simon stevens , urged gps to diagnose more patients with dementia , saying it was their ` basic human right ' to know . he warned that there was an ` attitude of fatalism ' about dementia in the nhs -- and society -- with patients and doctors thinking nothing could be done . an nhs england spokesman said : ` more needs to be done to ensure that people living with dementia are identified so that they can get the care they need . this additional investment is part of a drive to ensure this . '", "summary": " move is response to fewer than half of cases being picked up by gps .   but leading family doctors say patients could be wrongly diagnosed .   more than 400,000 people are thought to have undiagnosed dementia .
