{"text": "she 's just days from giving birth but even impending motherhood could n't keep zara phillips away from her beloved horses . the olympic silver medallist was on hand to monitor her equine charges as they were put through their paces during the heythrop hunt point-to-point races in gloucestershire . the 32-year-old , whose first child is due this month , was later spotted making her way through the paddock to a vantage point on the sidelines and watched intently as her runners flashed past . not long now : zara phillips makes her way through the paddock at the heythrop hunt point-to-point . ready to pop : the 32-year-old royal is just days away from the birth of her first child . wrapped in a cosy parka , complete with a fashionably furry hood , the fresh-faced mother-to-be appeared less than impressed with their performance but still managed to summon up a smile for the watching crowds . although rugby player husband mike tindall was nowhere to be seen , the royal was n't short of company and was seen laughing and joking with friends during gaps in the programme . phillips , who is a trainer in addition to being a successful eventer , had three horses entered for the event , among them , the hotly tipped devils boy -lsb- sic -rsb- who appeared in the first race of the day . other entries included calusa comet , a six-year-old irish bay , and fiddle faddle , a horse owned by her mother , the princess royal . oh no ! miss phillips appeared less than impressed with the performance of her trio of horses . fresh-faced : the mother-to-be was spotted enjoying a joke with friends from the sidelines . cosy : mrs brooks and her one-year-old daughter scarlett were both well wrapped up against the january chill . and ms phillips was n't the only notable name to appear at the event . also watching the races was former news international boss , rebekah brooks . mrs brooks , who along with david cameron has previously turned out to hunt with the heythrop , was seen watching from the sidelines , her daughter scarlett in her arms . despite looking pale , perhaps as a result of the ongoing phone-hacking trial , mrs brooks brightened up her look with a jaunty orange scarf , which she wore with a cosy padded jacket and a pair of tweed breeks . elegant : the queen plumped for a chic turquoise ensemble but once again refused to accept posies . while princess anne was nowhere to be seen , despite having a horse entered in the races , another royal to brave the cold was the queen , who was seen arriving at st mary magdalene church in sandringham this morning for the sunday service . much to the surprise of onlookers , the queen , who was colourfully dressed in a turquoise ensemble , once more refused to accept flowers from waiting children , and left the honours to a lady-in-waiting . by contrasts , the duke of edinburgh was in fine fettle and beamed at well-wishers as he arrived at the village church on foot . with a new great grandson or daughter just days away , the duke could have something else to smile about come next sunday . good spirits : the duke of edinburgh was on fine form as he walked with members of the royal household . not stopping : after the service , the queen was driven away in a maroon bentley without collecting flowers .", "summary": " the 32-year-old wore a cosy parka to the heythrop hunt point-to-point .   three of her horses competed , including one owned by princess anne .   just days away from her due date with her first child expected this month .
