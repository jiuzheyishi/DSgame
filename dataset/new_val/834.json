{"text": "peekaboo : researchers found that young children believe they are invisible if people ca n't see their eyes . it 's an adorable game parents have played with their young children for generations . but now researchers are looking for a scientific answer to explain why children think they actually disappear when they cover their eyes while playing peekaboo . researchers led by james russell at the university of cambridge have carried out the first study into this bizarre trait with groups of three and four-year-old children . the children 's eyes were covered with masks and they were then asked whether they could be seen by the researchers - with most saying no . many also believed that the researchers could not see adults who were wearing eye masks - leading to the conclusion most young children believe that anyone who covers their eyes is obscured from other people 's view . the researchers then attempted to distinguish what exactly creates the feeling of invisibility - whether it was not being able to see at all or just because the other person could n't see their eyes . the children were given a pair of mirrored goggles so that while they could see through the glasses , no one could see their eyes . unfortunately , only 7 of the 37 participating children were able to get to grips with the idea that while they could still see , no one could see their eyes . but of those who did understand the concept , six believed they were invisible if the researchers could n't see their eyes , even if they could still see them . although when the children were asked to . explain how they were made invisible by simply hiding their eyes , many . knew that their bodies remained visible , suggesting a childhood . distinction between their physical bodies and the ` self ' they connect to . their eyes . hide and seek : the children in the survey also believed that other people become invisible if they cover their eyes even though their bodies are still visible . to test this theory that children believe they can be seen only through their eyes , the researchers looked directly at each of the children while asking them to avert their gaze . they then did the same process in reverse , with the children looking at the researchers while they diverted their eyes . in each instance , the majority of children felt they were not being seen so long as their eyes did n't meet the other person 's , giving some support to the ideology of eyes being the the window to the soul .", "summary": " university of cambridge researchers found that children believe they become invisible if other people ca n't see their eyes .   toddlers also thought adults ca n't be seen if their eyes are hidden - even if their bodies are visible .   study shows link between the ` sense of self ' and the eyes .
