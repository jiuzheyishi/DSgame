{"text": "it 's always all about lionel messi at barcelona . it has been since the ethereal teenager imposed himself on the british consciousness in a champions league tie with chelsea nine years ago . on tuesday he takes on manchester city in the etihad and the questions surrounding him are frenzied as ever . should he have made a late-night visit to a casino with gerard pique and cesc fabregas 24 hours after the 1-0 defeat by malaga ? why did he play so badly against malaga ? what is his relationship with manager luis enrique ? -lrb- non-existent , say sources at barcelona -rrb- . and , most importantly , will the ongoing tax inquiry into his financial affairs by the spanish authorities cause him to up and leave the club with which he has been synonymous ? lionel messi laughs as barcelona train ahead of their champions league last-16 clash with manchester city . messi is the centre of attention as he walks towards the etihad pitch for training on monday evening . gerard pique -lrb- left -rrb- and adriano -lrb- right -rrb- share a joke with messi as barcelona prepare . that is the unspoken fear around the nou camp . this summer there are presidential elections at barcelona and the candidate who is able to demonstrate that he has the backing of messi and that the argentine will stay at the club is the candidate who will win a landslide . just as the coach who can demonstrate he is approved by messi , will be the coach who takes over from enrique . the current president , josep maria bartomeu , was forced to deny a report by a catalan tv station at the turn of the year that he and messi had come to an agreement : give 100 per cent until the end of the season and then the club will replace enrique in the summer . messi denied it too . and the 11-game winning run which preceded the dire defeat by malaga at the weekend had done much to ease the tension which had bedevilled the club after christmas . enrique would have probably been sacked had he lost to atletico madrid in january but he won . and the recent run of form suddenly convinced some that three trophies might be looming , the copa del rey , champions league and la liga . but one defeat is enough these days to allow onlookers to pick open old wounds and , short of winning the league or the champions league , those close to the club do n't expect enrique to survive the summer . and , it is acknowledged round the nou camp , that in order to ensure messi does n't decamp to paris or london , the new coach and , if possible , the new president should have messi 's seal of approval . barcelona boss luis enrique is under pressure to reach the champions league quarter-finals . messi looks dejected during barcelona 's home defeat on saturday - their first loss in 12 games . it is not that his relationship with the club that is particularly bad but the ongoing tax case , with the spanish authorities pursuing him and his father for # 3m tax on image rights deals , which is said to have irked him enough to consider leaving the country . spanish footballers and sports stars , including some of the heroes of the 2010 world cup win , have had similar tax issues , claim messi 's team . only the argentine is being pursued through the courts rather than being allowed to negotiate a settlement . aside from messi , there are myriad problems at barcelona at present which a new president will have to address . what is the club 's vision now and where is it heading ? into the arms of qatari money , whereby the arab nation state sponsors not just the once-sacred team shirt but the name of the stadium as well ? the club which so bewitched and dominated europe under pep guardiola is no more . the world famous youth system , la cantera , has ceased to be the conveyor belt of world-class talent and the recruitment of foreign players to join it has resulted in a fifa transfer ban for 2015 ; the leaders of the great team , carles puyol and xavi , have retired or are feeling their age while victor valdes is at manchester united ; and a club which had two managers in nine years under frank rijkaard and pep guardiola , an era which saw them win three champions league trophies , have reverted back to type with three in three years . barcelona last lifted the champions league under pep guardiola after beating manchester united in 2011 . the la liga giants have had three managers in three years including tito vilanova , who died in april last year . messi , pictured in action against malaga , will be hoping to return to form against manchester city on tuesday . they could hardly be blamed for failing to foresee the tragic death of tito vilanova from cancer at the age of 45 . but it appears that since he had to step down due his ill health in 2013 , the club has lacked any coherent strategy . or rather , the only strategy that does appear to dominate is : ` keep messi . ' keep him happy and keep him at the club . in catalunya they have been cheering themselves in the last 48 hours by saying no-one can remember when messi last had two bad games in succession , the inference being that manchester city will feel the backlash from saturday ' s anonymous performance . it 's quite possible of course . no-one who watches football needs reminding of messi 's genius . prior to saturday night , everyone in barcelona - players , fans , journalists - were relaxed about facing city , expecting a comfortable win over the two legs . and that is still the most likely outcome . and should they win the major trophies at the end of the season , the lack of direction at the club over the past two years will doubtless be forgotten amidst the celebrations . but real madrid are forging ahead in la liga at present and , if not city , then real , bayern or chelsea all look capable of beating them in the champions league . if that happens both messi and a new president will have to answer the hardest question of all ; what does barca stand for at the moment , other than keeping messi happy ?", "summary": " barcelona face manchester city in the champions league on tuesday .   lionel messi is looking to bounce back after a poor display against malaga .   the argentine 's future has been the subject of speculation for months .   messi is involved in a # 3m tax case and has spoken about leaving the club .   barca have lacked a coherent strategy since losing the late tito vilanova .   manchester city vs barcelona : how do the two teams compare ?   click here for all the latest barcelona news .
