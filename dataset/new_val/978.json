{"text": "professor les ebdon said undue pressure on pupils meant they were forced into the wrong courses . school leavers must ignore the ` dreadful snobbery ' which forces them to go to study for a degree , the universities watchdog has warned . sir les ebdon said too much pressure was put on pupils to get into oxford or cambridge , regardless of whether it is the right for them to do . he also warned that some black and minority ethnic parents in particular were too focussed on their children studying law and medicine at top universities , and missed out on places elsewhere as a result . sir les became the head of the office for fair access in september , with a remit to improve the number of children from poor backgrounds who gain a degree . education secretary michael gove ordered the publication of ` destination data ' on where pupils go after a levels , and challenged schools who resign themselves to children doing badly . ` once you accept that a child is likely to do less well than his contemporaries , you condemn that child to fall further and further behind , to never know the satisfaction of pushing himself beyond his limits , to be a prisoner of others ' prejudice , ' mr gove has warned . ` the victim of the bigotry of low expectations . ' but sir les , in an interview with the times educational supplement , said the focus on universities meant schools risked ignoring vocational courses and apprenticeships which could be better for pupils who should be ` choosing the subjects in which they excel and enjoy ' . he said schools should be encouraging students to take ` the most appropriate route to realise their full potential ' and warned that society ` really undervalues apprenticeships ' . sir les said black and ethnic minority pupils were pressured into applying for medicine and law courses at oxford and cambridge , despite being over-subscribed . sir les added : ` one of our problems is there 's such a dreadful snobbery about whether people go to university or which university they go to . ` i would hate to see that work through into undue pressure on schools . ' he said black and minority ethnic students are put under pressure by their parents to apply for medicine and law courses at oxford and cambridge , despite those courses being some of the most over-subscribed . ` this is one of the reasons that some groups are underrepresented at some universities . we should be treating people as individuals . ` this perceived feeling in our society that to be a doctor or lawyer is a high-status profession that black people aspire to for their children ... there 's nothing wrong with it , but the most important thing is that students should be encouraged to fulfil their full potential in whatever subject that is .
