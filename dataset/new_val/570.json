' i understand that this absence may reduce the productivity of your workplace , but i can assure you that it is for an important cause . ` the #usmnt has a critical world cup game vs. germany and we will need the full support of the nation if we are to advance to the next round . ` by the way , you should act like a good leader and take the day off as well . go usa ! ' when jermaine jones stands for the national anthems of his countries on thursday , he will soak in the moment . jones , like four american teammates and his coach , will be familiar with both the star-spangled banner and the deutschlandlied before the united states ' world cup game against germany . after playing three games in 2008 for the nation in which he grew up , jones switched allegiance to the u.s. two years later . ` when i hear the anthem from the united states , i will close my eyes and let everything go through , ' the tenacious midfielder said . and then comes the big game . four years of work by the u.s. come down to 90 or so minutes in the afternoon heat and possibly rain at arena pernambuco on the outskirts of a sprawling beach city known as the brazilian venice . now you see stars ! the back page of german daily bild anticipates klinsmann and his usa team will be handed a beating against germany . having squandered the chance to clinch advancement earlier this week against portugal by allowing a stoppage-time goal in a 2-2 draw , the americans might need at least a tie against the three-time champions to reach the knockout stage of consecutive world cup for the first time . the story lines are gripping : . mission : klinsmann in training with his usa squad ahead of their group g showdown for top spot . the germans beat portugal 4-0 and tied ghana 2-2 , leaving them with four points and a plus-four goal difference . the americans , who defeated ghana 2-1 , have four points and a plus-one goal difference . ghana and portugal , with one point each , play simultaneously in brasilia , knowing a tie in either game would eliminate both of them . u.s. soccer federation officials will have a system to relay the score of the other match to the bench . ` to be able to keep that level of interest for another four , five , six and hopefully more days would be great for the sport , ' ussf president sunil gulati said . ' i think for the first time in our history - recent history , i 'm not going to talk about 1950 or before - our players believe they 're capable of beating anyone . ' he rejects the notion the dual nationals are any less american than those who came up through the u.s. youth system . preparation : usa can top the group but have to beat germany to do so due to their superior goal difference . when the u.s. and germany met for the first time in the group stage of the 1998 cup , klinsmann scored the second goal in a 2-0 win . the teams played four years later in the quarterfinals , when michael ballack 's 39th-minute goal gave the germans a 1-0 victory . the americans still complain scottish referee hugh dallas declined to call a penalty kick when gregg berhalter 's 49th-minute shot hit the left arm of defender torsten frings at the goal line . while the germans have four off days between matches , the u.s. has only three . and teams are 0-4 after games in the steamy amazon rainforest capital of manaus , where the americans played sunday night . ` it 's the biggest game of all of our lives , ' beckerman said . ` any fatigue in our legs will be erased . we 've got to give it everything we 've got and more . ' all but through : usa know a draw would be enough to see them through for definite . there is an outside chance the u.s. and portugal could tie for second with four points and be even on all tiebreakers - for instance , if the americans lose 3-0 and the portuguese win 2-0 . in that case , a drawing of lots would decide which team advances . the teams that move on will have second-round matchups with belgium , russia , south korea or algeria . gulati hopes for more , much more , that will help boost the growing american fan base . ` it 's pretty easy to get emotional about , ' he said , ` wanting to see this day happen . it 's not the day . that day is still to come . and that day has got a trophy involved .
