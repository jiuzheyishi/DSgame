{"text": "a drug dealer caught with a huge block of cannabis when he was in a serious car crash is in line for a multi-million pound payout . the department of transport had been trying to stop sean delaney profiting from the injuries he suffered in the smash . but yesterday a judge ruled this would have breached eu directives and the 40-year-old father of five should receive compensation despite the ` public revulsion ' . delaney was a passenger in a speeding # 80,000 mercedes roadster driven by a fellow drug dealer who overtook on a bend and ploughed into a car carrying a family . ruling : a judge at the high court said delaney is entitled to compensation . peter and lisa houston and their three . children all suffered serious injuries as well but were awarded only . # 20,000 between them . in the judgment at the high court in london , mr justice jay said : ` many readers may be wondering how it comes about that a drug dealer is entitled to compensation against her majesty 's government in circumstances where he was injured during the course of a criminal joint enterprise . ` the understandable reaction might be : there must be some rule of public policy , reflecting public revulsion , which bars such a claim . the short answer is that there is not . ' delaney , from bedworth , warwickshire , suffered fractures , ruptured organs , amnesia and ` intellectual blunting ' in the november 2006 crash near nuneaton . mr justice jay said : ` readers might think : there must be a rule reflecting public revulsion which bars such a claim . there is not ' when he and the driver , shane pickett , were cut free from the wreckage , a small package of cannabis was found hidden in pickett 's sock and a block the size of a football in delaney 's bomber jacket . pickett was jailed for ten months for dangerous driving and possessing cannabis . no action was taken against delaney , probably because of the severity of his injuries . he demanded compensation from pickett 's insurers but they invoked an exclusion clause in that pickett was under the influence of cannabis and driving dangerously . delaney 's lawyers sued the secretary of state for transport , claiming the exclusion under a clause of the uk uninsured drivers ' agreement was incompatible with the 2009 european motor insurance directive which , in the interests of standardisation , allows no exclusions . the 1999 agreement helps innocent victims of uninsured drivers obtain compensation . in 2011 the court of appeal found against delaney saying he would , or should , have known the mercedes was being used for ` the furtherance of crime ' . but yesterday mr justice jay ruled in his favour , saying the department 's failure to ensure uniformity between uk law and the eu directives was ` so serious that ... it must pay compensation to mr delaney ' . the court found the illegality involved in the journey itself was merely ` scene setting ' and not the cause of the accident . but delaney 's tory mp dan byles said : ` i 'm sure i speak for the majority of my constituents who would be horrified that a drug dealer is getting extremely large amounts of taxpayers ' money for what is essentially a self-inflicted injury . it seems highly unfair . ' dominic raab , the eurosceptic tory mp for esher and walton , said it was absurd ` criminals can sue the government at huge taxpayers ' expense for harm suffered in the course of committing their crimes ' . he said it added ` insult to injury that this nonsense is being forced on us by brussels contrary to all notions of basic democratic accountability ' . accident : delaney was being driven in a ` flashy ' mercedes sl 500 -lrb- left , posed by model -rrb- when it crashed . on rescuing him , emergency services found 240 grams of cannabis -lrb- right , file photo -rrb- . the amount of compensation the department must now pay delaney will be assessed at a later date , but millions are routinely awarded in cases of such serious injury . the houston family , from exhall , near bedworth , were hospitalised after the crash with broken bones , collapsed lungs and bruised kidneys . yesterday mr houston said he was surprised by the judgment . ` if delaney is getting multi millions then it is quite disappointing when we did n't get anything near that , ' said the salesman . ` it seems stupid that the loophole is allowed to exist and the eu law allows him to get that money . ' the family received a new car on top of their compensation , which came from a pot built up by the motor insurers bureau under the uninsured drivers agreement . when approached at his semi-detached home , delaney claimed he had not heard about his court victory . ` all i can say is i 'm in shock , ' he said . ` i have n't been able to work for eight years because apparently i 've got a brain injury . i do n't feel like there 's anything wrong but apparently there is . ' a department for transport spokesman said : ` we thought that the directive was drafted in a wide-enough way to allow governments some autonomy . we are considering an appeal . '", "summary": " sean delaney , 40 , was passenger in ` flashy ' mercedes when it crashed .   he ruptured organs and was left in a coma in 2006 accident .   but as rescuers cut him free they found 240g block of cannabis .   delaney , who now needs care , later tried to sue the car 's uninsured driver .   insurers dodged claim due to clause excluding vehicles involved in crime .   but high court today ruled that clause is in breach of eu laws .   as a result the government must pick up the tab - expected to be millions .
