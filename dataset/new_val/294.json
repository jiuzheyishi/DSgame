{"text": "ed miliband today faces the biggest crisis of his leadership , amid rising panic that his personal unpopularity will cost labour victory at the next election . analysis of voter satisfaction ratings over four decades reveal mr miliband is down to minus 34 . it means he is less popular than any prime minister or opposition leader at this point ahead of an election , except michael foot who led labour to its worst ever defeat . jim callaghan , neil kinnock , john major , william hague , michael howard and gordon brown all had higher net satisfaction ratings with ipsosmori six months before being hammered at the ballot box . analysis of ipsosmori polling dating back to 1977 by mailonline shows how only michael foot had worse personal satisfaction ratings than ed miliband six months before a general election . mr miliband has come under growing pressure from his own party to improve his own image and standing with voters , who do not view him as a future prime minister . since becoming leader four years ago mr miliband has seen a collapse in his public satisfaction ratings . a month after he defeated his brother for the leadership , 41 per cent per of voters were satisfied with mr miliband with just 19 per cent dissastified , giving a net rating of 19 points . in the latest ipsomori survey , published two weeks ago , the figure had slumped to -34 , twice as bad as david cameron 's -17 . ` it 's all just depressing , ' a shadow cabinet minister said . ` people tell me they ca n't vote labour it means ed becomes pm . but it 's my name on the ballot paper , not his . ' a senior backbencher added : ` people normally grow into the role , but he 's shrunk . ' the tories have made clear they will present the election campaign as a direct choice between mr cameron and mr miliband as a future prime minister , which senior labour figures fear most . growing numbers liken the panic gripping the labour party to the run-up to the 2010 election , when gordon brown 's personal unpopularity and poor image was repeatedly raised by voters as a concern . but the analysis shows that mr brown 's satisfaction ratings stood at -25 six months before he led labour to a thumping defeat in 2010 . every prime minister and opposition leader since the late 1970s had better net satisfaction ratings than mr miliband , expect for mr foot . mr miliband started off well , but has seen his net satisfaction rating plummet . a senior labour mp said : ` people normally grow into the role , but he 's shrunk ' only a quarter of voters say they are satisfied with mr miliband as labour leader , with almost two thirds dissatisfied . tory leaders john major , william hague and michael howard all had better ratings than mr miliband before they were beaten by tony blair 's new labour in 1997 , 2001 and 2005 . only michael foot had worse support six months before his defeat to margaret thatcher in 1983 , but only just - his net satisfaction of -38 . ben page , chief executive of ipsosmori , said : ` ed miliband 's personal ratings among voters are a serious problem for labour -- no-one has ever become prime minister with ratings like these , and without a lead on managing the economy . ` only michael foot 's ratings in the run up to the 1983 election were worse . ` on the other hand of course only twice has a government been in power for over two years and increased its share of the vote , and while cameron is more popular than miliband , the conservatives remain much less liked than the labour party among voters . ' critics point to mr miliband 's disastrous party conference speech , which he delivered without notes and forgot to mention the deficit or immigration . after being mocked for his difficulties eating a bacon sandwich , mr miliband claimed he was not a photo opportunities politician , contrasting his high-minded approach to david cameron putting style over substance . in a speech in july he attempted to present himself as serious and principled compared to mr cameron 's ` superficial ' and image-driven approach . the photo opportunity , he said , is ` not where my talents lie -- as you may have noticed ' . he said : ` if you want a politician who thinks that a good photo is the most important thing , then do n't vote for me . because i do n't . but here 's the thing : i believe that people would quite like somebody to stand up and say there is more to politics than the photo op . and that culture diminishes our politics . ' but since then the labour leader has posed wearing a pro-feminism t-shirt and gave a handful of change to a beggar while surrounded by photographers . a former cabinet minister told mailonline said : ` what p *** es me off is he said he would be about content not style , but it 's all style and spin ... and it 's s *** . ` the only thing worse than the idea he wo n't be prime minister is the thought that he might . ' in july mr miliband promised he was not a ` photo opportunity ' politician , but has since been pictured wearing a pro-feminism t-shirt -lrb- right -rrb- and giving a handful of change to a beggar while surrounded by photographers . last night mr miliband reshuffled his frontbench team , appointing lucy powell as vice-chairman of the general election campaign . she said she was going to ` unblock ' the system to make sure the operation was working effectively . it follows growing unease about the leader 's office , and its failure to communicate with voters . one frontbencher said : ' i told them we need to talk in a way that normal people understand . i 'm not sure they understood what i meant . ' in a fresh blow , the new statesman , which is traditionally supportive of labour , warns that mr miliband 's approach is haemorrhaging support on the left to the greens and the scottish national party . the magazine says the labour leader appears a product of his ` narrow background ' and demonstrates no understanding of lower middle-class aspiration . jason cowley , editor of the new statesman , one of only two national publications to back mr miliband over his brother david for the labour leadership in 2010 , said he appeared ` very much an old-style hampstead socialist ' . ` he does n't really understand the lower middle-class or material aspiration , ' he writes . ` he does n't understand essex man or woman . politics for him must seem at times like an extended ppe seminar : elevated talk about political economy and the good society . ' he adds : ` miliband has a deterministic , quasi-marxist analysis of our present ill . ` the ukip insurgency , scottish nationalism , the hollowing out of political parties , islamist radicalisation , the loathing and distrust of elites : all are manifestations of a failed economic model . ' david miliband . who was defeated by his brother for the labour leadership in 2010 , is now ceo of the international rescue committee . last night he hosted the annual freedom award benefit event in new york , attended by rock singer sting and opera singer danielle de niese . mr miliband also posed for photographs with ballet dancer and actor mikhail baryshnikov -lrb- left -rrb- and his louise shackelton -lrb- right -rrb- .", "summary": " pollster says miliband 's -34 % net satisfaction rating is a ` serious problem '   only michael foot was worse ahead of labour 's 1983 election drubbing .   brown , howard , hague , major , kinnock and callaghan were all better .   growing fears miliband 's unpopularity will cost labour victory in 2015 .   two labour mps call on leader to resign now , according to bbc reports .   senior labour mp : ` people normally grow into the role , but he 's shrunk '   left-wing new statesman labels him an ` old-style hampstead socialist ' "}
