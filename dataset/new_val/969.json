{"text": "a new type of solar cloud has been discovered emanating from the sun . the magnetic cloud is a smaller version of larger clouds of particles known as solar flares and coronal mass ejections , which can produce auroras on earth . and the finding could apparently help us understand how such space weather affects our planet . dr janvier from the university of dundee has discovered a new solar cloud . solar clouds are groups of particles emitted by the sun into space , often as coronal mass ejections -lrb- cmes -rrb- , shown . this latest finding is smaller than comparable cmes . but she says it could help us understand how space weather affects earth . the discovery was made by dr miho janvier from the university of dundee together with pascal d√©moulin of the lesia observatoire de paris in france , and sergio dasso at the university of buenos aires . she made the discovery while looking at matter expelled from the sun and thrown out into space . ` our work has been studying how solar flares are generated and the effects they cause , ' explained dr janvier , reports the bbc . ` we already knew there were these large magnetic clouds generated by solar flares . ` we also knew that smaller magnetised structures existed , but what we have found is that they have a completely different origin . the earth 's magnetic field could flip in just 100 years , researchers have found . the move , which would mean all compasses pointed south instead of north , was thought to take thousands of years . however , a new study found it can happen far faster . the new study by a team of scientists from italy , france , columbia university and the university of california , berkeley , demonstrates that the last magnetic reversal 786,000 years ago actually happened very quickly , in less than 100 years - roughly a human lifetime . the discovery comes as new evidence indicates that the intensity of earth 's magnetic field is decreasing 10 times faster than normal , leading some geophysicists to predict a reversal within a few thousand years . ` these smaller clouds have different characteristics which mean they must be generated in a different place and/or in a different way . ` they must be coming from the sun but we are not sure yet where in the sun 's atmosphere they are being born . ' she explained to mailonline the finding is comparable to hurricanes and regular storms on earth . in this instance coronal mass ejections are much larger clouds of particles , whereas these new ` flux ropes ' are much smaller . their size can be one tenth the earth-sun distance , but they are thought to be much more numerous on the sun than larger coronal mass ejections . but she adds : ` we did n't just see one cloud , it was a population of smaller clouds . ' solar clouds are storms of energised particles sent across the solar system at speeds of up to 370 miles -lrb- 600 kilometres -rrb- per second . when they arrive at earth they can cause geomagnetic storms and pose a potential danger to satellites and even astronauts on the iss . solar clouds are storms of energised particles sent across the solar system at speeds approaching that of light . when they arrive at earth they can cause geomagnetic storms and auroras -lrb- shown -rrb- , and pose a potential danger to satellites and even astronauts on the iss . numerous spacecraft are in orbit around the sun to observe these events , including nasa 's twin stereo spacecraft . the two probes observe the sun simultaneously to produce stereoscopic images and observe solar phenomena including coronal mass ejections - commonly associated with solar storms . however , the agency announced the other day that they had lost contact with stereo b -lrb- ` behind ' -rrb- , putting the mission in jeopardy . ` communications with the stereo behind spacecraft were interrupted on 1 october , immediately after a planned reset of the spacecraft performed as part of a test of solar conjunction operations , ' nasa said . ` the cause of the anomaly is not yet known , though a sensor anomaly in the guidance and control system is suspected . attempts to recover the spacecraft are continuing . ' the latest findings , though , will be useful for other spacecraft including the sun , such as a planned probe by esa in 2017 . the discovery comes as one of nasa 's twin sun-observing stereo spacecraft failed -lrb- illustration shown -rrb- . the two probes observe the sun simultaneously to produce stereoscopic images and observe solar phenomena including coronal mass ejections - commonly associated with solar storms .", "summary": " university of dundee 's dr janvier discovered a new type of solar cloud .   solar clouds are groups of particles emitted by the sun into space .   this latest finding is smaller than comparable coronal mass ejections .   she tells mailonline they are known as ` flux ropes ' owing to their shape .   but they were found to be much more numerous than bigger solar eruptions .   she says it could help us understand how space weather affects earth .   discovery comes as one of nasa 's sun-observing stereo spacecraft failed .
