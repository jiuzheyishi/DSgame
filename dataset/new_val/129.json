{"text": "the number of illegal migrants reaching european borders is on track to swamp the 140,000 who fled the arab spring in 2011 , according to new figures . frontex , the european union border agency , said that 42,000 illegal immigrants reached the european union between january and april this year , four times the number in the same period last year . italian authorities have said that in may another 14,000 arrived in their country making the total who have used central mediterranean routes for illegal immigration at least 55,000 . an excavator destroys an illegal camp in calais where around 650 migrants were living . french police search the illegal immigrant camp at calais for anyone hiding there before the site was bulldozed . examining patterns of illegal immigration means that of those who have arrived in europe , unknown numbers will try to reach britain via calais . last week , the french police disbanded and demolished two squatter camps near the channel . with this information , serious questions will be asked about how britain will cope with an influx of yet more immigrants . the immigration question was a key factor in the recent european elections and could be again ahead of the general election less than a year from now . ewa moncure , a spokesman for frontex , said : ` by the end of april the number of illegal border crossings was close to 42,000 , including 25,500 through italy . ` the italians gave a new figure a couple of days ago of over 39,000 so far this year , so the overall total will have grown significantly . migrants and activists scuffle with police after french authorities started to clear out makeshift camps in calais , housing hundreds of illegal migrants from syria , afghanistan and africa . migrants try their luck on lorries out of calais in an attempt to get into britain . these three were caught but many others are expected to try . ` if we look at the number of migrants who have arrived in italy last year compared with the number who have arrived in the first five months of this year , the total has already been exceeded . it was 40,000 or so for the whole of 2013 and it seems like we have nearly reached that point by the end of may . ' the figures are especially worrying as they come ahead of the traditional summer peak months for illegal immigration . miss moncure said : ` there have historically been more arrivals in the summer because of the weather and particularly because the sea is less treacherous for boat crossings from africa . ' frontex 's annual report also showed the whole of 2013 saw a 48 per cent rise in illegal migration compared with the previous year , from 72,437 to 107,365 . syrians accounted for almost a quarter of last year 's total - 25,546 - with eritreans -lrb- 11,298 -rrb- , afghans -lrb- 9,021 -rrb- and albanians -lrb- 9,500 -rrb- making up the main other nationalities . detections of nigerians -lrb- 3,386 -rrb- , malians -lrb- 2,887 -rrb- , gambians -lrb- 2,817 -rrb- and senegalese -lrb- 1,643 -rrb- all quadrupled last year , it added . gil arias fernandez , frontex 's deputy executive director , also cautioned that large numbers of syrian and eritrean refugees are in libya ready to be illegally smuggled to the european union . his warning comes in the wake of comments earlier this year by salah mazek , the libyan interior minister , who said that it would think of helping migrants get to europe unless countries agreed to help his nation . ` i 'm warning the world and europe in particular -- if they do not assume their responsibilities , libya could facilitate the transit of this flood , ' he said .", "summary": " 140,000 fled arab spring ; at least 55,000 have arrived already this year .   immigration question was a key factor in the recent european elections and could be again in general election next year .   more will attempt to reach europe in summer when seas are safer .
