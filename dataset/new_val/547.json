Â· . jonathan woodgate nods home the winner - getting to the ball before goalkeeper petr cech . dimitar berbatov netted a cool penalty during the 2-1 victory at wembley stadium . which of your players will make the difference this time around ? rj : i think the only bright spot when tottenham destroyed us on new years day was the performance of eden hazard . he seemed to really understand the rivalry and how desperate chelsea fans were to get something from the game . if he plays to a similar level and those around him raise their game , i think that he could be too much for spurs to deal with . dk : kane and eriksen are the obvious ones but i 've got a good feeling about lamela too . harry kane will be looking to make the difference against chelsea at wembley this weekend . that 5-3 game is still fresh in the memory -- how will that affect this game ? rj : i think it will affect the game positively for everybody . it will definitely inspire tottenham , they scored five goals against us . however , i also think it will inspire chelsea . there is n't a better way to get back at a team to whom you feel you owe one , by beating them at a final at wembley . dk : on the one hand , it will give spurs belief they can outplay and beat chelsea , which is crucial . on the other , it will make the chelsea players -lrb- who must be prioritising the premier league and champions league -rrb- extra motivated to exact revenge . so , it could be beneficial for both teams . chelsea players look dejected after losing 5-3 to tottenham at white hart lane on new year 's day . and what of nemanja matic 's ban ? rj : huge . disastrous . close to being irreplaceable . but i think that mourinho will opt for ramires . now i concede that ramires does n't have the presence of matic but he is a wonderful player , capable of chipping valdes in the nou camp or scoring in the fa cup final against liverpool . i have full faith in him . dk : he 's a good player and hopefully eriksen can exploit the space created by his absence . but it should n't make too much difference . if chelsea -- one of the richest clubs in the world , who routinely buy players to stop them joining rivals -- ca n't cope without one midfielder , then their squad is n't nearly as strong as everyone thinks . nemanja matic was sent off against burnley and will miss the final - his absence is a huge loss for chelsea . generally , spurs do n't beat chelsea that often , do they ? rj : well over the course of my lifetime generally not . however , we have never beaten them in a cup final which is slightly worrying . third time lucky i hope . dk : no but i 'm happy with spurs ' record against chelsea in cup finals . tottenham players celebrate with the fa cup after beating chelsea 2-1 in 1967 . what are your plans on the day of the game ? rj : a pint of guinness around great portland street to ease the nerves before met-lining it into wembley . there is n't a better feeling in football . dk : i have n't got a ticket -lrb- yet -rrb- so i 'm going to watch at home with some mates and try to write a few articles , then go out to celebrate our victory afterwards . there 's no better feeling in football than making your way to wembley on cup final day . finally , your predictions , please . rj : 3-1 chelsea . dk : there 's been lots of goals when we 've played chelsea this season , so i 'll go 3-2 spurs after extra time .", "summary": " chelsea take on tottenham in the capital one cup final on sunday .   spurs beat blues 2-1 in 2008 - their last final at wembley .   chelsea looking to bounce back after 5-3 defeat on new year 's day .   we ask rory jennings and dan kilpatrick questions ahead of the final .   two clubs have plenty of history - making an intense rivalry .   paul scholes : tottenham must show they ` have the balls to take risks '   read : chelsea vs tottenham capital one cup final head-to-head .
