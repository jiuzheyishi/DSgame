{"text": "angry farmers have hit out against european union rules which they claim will force cows to wear nappies . under an eu nitrates directive , the use of fertilisers is being prohibited on hillsides with gradients of more than 15 per cent . the bavarian farmers ' association fears the new rules effectively ban them from grazing cows on the slopes - because their cow pats might be construed as fertilising . german farmer johann huber has created homemade nappies for his cows in protest to the new eu rules . the upper-bavarian farm president anton kreitmar and petra duehring from the bavarian farmer 's union attach a diaper to doris the cow in gmund am tegernsee , germany , as part of the protest against the eu rules . under eu rules , the use of fertilisers is being prohibited on hillsides with gradients of more than 15 per cent and farmers fear it effectively bans them from grazing cows because cow pats might be construed as fertilising . one german farmer , johann huber , whose family has farmed on the mountain slopes of gmund am tegernsee in the alps for more than 400 years , has created homemade nappies in an unusual protest at the new rules . he had made them from large pieces of cloth so his 18 cows do n't fall foul of the fertiliser ban . mr huber said : ` we have no standard nappies , they have not been developed commercially yet . ' farmers in breach of the nitrates directive could lose their eu agricultural subsidies , worth thousands of euros each year - while they fear that complying with the restrictions could also force many out of business . anton kreitmair , farmers ' association president in upper bavaria , said : ` we demand that the ban is stopped in germany . in bavaria no fertilisation would be possible on half the cultivated land and restrictions would be needed on cows grazing in alpine pastures . ' the farmers have made the nappies from large pieces of cloth so their cows do n't fall foul of the fertiliser ban . mr huber 's family has farmed on the mountain slopes of gmund am tegernsee in the alps for over 400 years . the european union says its nitrates directive is necessary ` to avoid leaching of nitrates and water pollution ' . but a spokesman for the european commission denied the ban would affect cattle . he said : ` the directive does not foresee a ban on grazing animals on sloping land . ' the spokesman added that he believed it ` unlikely ' that germany would propose its own ban on grazing animals on sloping land .", "summary": " german farmer has created ` nappies ' for cows to protest against eu rules .   new rules say use of fertilisers is prohibited on hillsides with gradient of 15 % .   bavarian farmers ' association fears it effectively stops workers grazing cows .   johann huber has made cloth ` nappies ' so his 18 cows do n't fall foul of ban .
