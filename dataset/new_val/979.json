{"text": "teenagers could be given national rankings according to their scores in the new ` o-levels ' being introduced by the government , it emerged yesterday . certificates for the replacements for gcses in the core subjects of english , maths and science would go beyond a simple grade . they are likely to include the student 's overall position as well as a graph showing the overall distribution of scores . the proposed overhaul of the exams system for 16-year-olds is to halt the ¿ dumbing down ¿ of exam passes . a similar system already operates for the cambridge pre-u qualification , where students ' certificates also provide a distribution of overall marks . last october , education secretary michael gove suggested the controversial idea for a-level students , but unions claim ranking pupils on exam results could ` brand ' them for life . the plan , revealed in the times educational supplement , forms part of an overhaul of the exams system for 16-year-olds . mr gove is already proposing to allow only one board to design an exam in english , maths and science to halt the ` dumbing down ' of exam passes . a government source said yesterday : ` no decision has been made yet but if you look at the pre-u , they print on the back of the certificate the distribution of all the marks so if you do maths pre-u , you see a distribution curve of how everyone scored . ` what we are thinking about is , if we move to a single exam board , then there 's no reason why you could n't do that with new exams at 16 . michael gove mp , secretary of state for education , is proposing a raft of changes to assessments for 16-year-olds to halt the trend of easier exams . ` at the moment , all you get is a grade score . you do n't actually know how you scored specifically in different papers and how that compares with everyone else . ' mr gove wants exam boards to compete for the chance to produce the new english , maths and science papers . ministers plan to change the marking system so the new ` o-levels ' will not be norm-referenced , meaning that top grades would not be limited to a fixed proportion of pupils . the current a to g grading system for english , maths and science is also set to be scrapped and replaced with a numerical system such as 1 to 5 . ` otherwise it will be too confusing with all the as and bs and -lrb- people asking -rrb- did you get an a before the change or after the change ? , ' said the source . the proposals come just days after a inquiry by a committee of mps found that exam standards have dropped because boards are competing to offer the easier papers . nansi ellis , of the association of teachers and lecturers , said mr gove needed to ask himself whether there was any evidence that any proposed changes , ` will benefit learning and the acquisition and development of skills ' .", "summary": " a similar distribution marking system is used by cambridge pre-u qualification .   the plan forms part of an overhaul of the exams system for 16-year-olds .
