' i never signed on for having that image used for another purpose , ' she said in an interview . when the photo was tweeted to her @lenorezann two weeks ago , she asked the sender to remove the image , which she said included a message that said , ` what happened to the old lenore ? ' the tweeter , nickscissons @ncissons , a 17-year old high school student from truro , said he meant it as a joke . ' i just thought it would be funny , pretty much , ' he said . ` it was just meant to be funny and got out of hand i guess , ' he said . but ` she was on that show voluntarily and she knew that image was out there and i do n't think i said anything mean about her . ' zann said she noticed the tweet that night and messaged scissons to ask him to take it down . twit on twitter : nick scissons said he deleted the naked image of lenore zann from his twitter feed after she phoned his father at home to complain , however he continued to tweet obscenities at her because he felt frustrated . number 1 dummy : the 17-year-old teenager , nick scisson , was told my his mom , susan mccarron , that it was a dumb move to tweet the picture of lenore online . ` luckily the old lenore zann got in shape so she can kick some political butt ! please remove this photo , ' she tweeted . but the scissons refused , and an online conversation soon included others who began retweeting the image and began hurling insults at her . on twitter she wrote : ` perhaps you 've missed the new federal legislation ' and ` distribution of this image falls under the criminal code . it has been reported . ' scissons replied , arguing the photo was public on the internet . during the exchange , which lasted around three hours , zann said she felt increasingly picked on . ' i never signed on for having that image used for another purpose , ' she said in an interview . ' i signed a contract ... for my image only to be used in ` the l word ' show . it 's not just the image of the picture that was disturbing . it was the way that these people ... suddenly targeted me . it increased in velocity and intent . it was constant and it was harassing . ' i was being cyberbullied so i felt that i needed to call the police . the police suggested that i call the cyberscan unit as well and that 's what they 're there for . that 's why we legislated them , so that they 'd be there to help people who feel that they are being bullied by other people online , ' she said . ` it was twitter where i was being tweeted at . i was being sworn at . they were swearing at me . they were disrespectful . it was constant . it was harassment and it was frightening . i was afraid . so that for me accounts for my feeling that i was being bullied . and because it 's online , that 's cyberbullying . ' the actor-cum-politician said she got in touch with the original tweeter 's parents , and the principal at his college . previous career : lenore zann -lrb- left -rrb- , a canadian politician from nova scotia who acted in an a tv series and appeared in lesbian shower scene at a women 's prison has claimed she was ` cyberbullied ' after the image was tweeted online . ms. zann 's exchange about the incident on twitter : she tried to bring the full force of the law upon the teenager but the federal cyber-bullying legislation , introduced in november has yet to become law . case dismissed : lenore zann has employed a new law to launch an investigation against a teenager she alleges was cyberbullying her on twitter . scissons said he deleted the naked image of zann from his twitter feed after zann phoned his father at home to complain . his mother , susan mccarron , said she was angry . ` it was like , ` take the photo down . period . ' and he responded , ` it 's down . ' that was around suppertime on saturday , ' said mrs mccarron . mccarron said she told her son it was a dumb move . ' i think it was done without considering consequences and i think it was a poor decision , ' she said . scissons agreed , but both mother and son said the complaint to the cyberbullying unit went too far . ' i can see why she was angry , but i think this is an over-escalation of the situation and i 'd like to see it end , ' mrs mccarron said . the former actress also summoned the local school board , truro police and nova scotia 's new cyberbullying investigation unit , known as cyberscan . teen twit : nick scissons , 17 , sent a screen capture from the l word showing zann 's exposed breasts . truro police chief david mcneil said an investigation last week determined the case was not a criminal matter . ` since then , our file has been concluded , ' he said . they have since closed their investigation without finding any criminal wrongdoing . a spokesman for nova scotia 's justice department said the cyberscan unit does not discuss details of individual cases . the unit was set up earlier this year when nova scotia introduced the cyber-safety act , which the province describes as the first law in canada aimed at protecting the victims of cyberbullying and making those responsible accountable under the law . the act defines cyberbullying as any electronic communication ` that is intended or ought reasonably be expected to cause fear , intimidation , humiliation , distress or other damage or harm to another person 's health , emotional well-being , self-esteem or reputation . ' excuse : nick scissons said , ` it was just meant to be funny and got out of hand i guess . she was on that show voluntarily and she knew that image was out there and i do n't think i said anything mean about her . ' the cbc reported that scissons , the teenager from truro , said he sent the tweet , thought it was nothing more than a joke and the issue was blown out of proportion . however , ms. zann insisted that subsequent tweets from scissons and others were filled with nasty taunts and vulgar insults . ` it was becoming more and more like a pack mentality , ' she said . ` they were attacking me . ' ms. zann said the image was eventually deleted after she spoke with the boy 's father and school officials . no sympathy for ` bullied ' politician : despite lenore zann telling the parents of the boy who tweeted her , informing the police and even tell his school about his actions , there will be no penalties or prosecutions for nick scissons . wayne mackay , a law professor at dalhousie university in halifax and an expert on cyberbullying , said ms zann 's complaint appears to meet the act 's definition of cyberbullying . he said even if the sender intended the message to be a joke , the law states that an offence has been committed if the accused ought to have known their actions would cause harm . ` it 's not about whether you absolutely intended to do it , ' mackay said . ` it 's really looking more at what 's the impact on the victim . ... the fact that you did n't really intend to be malicious is not necessarily a form of defence . ' professor mackay said just because an image is in the public domain , that does n't mean it can be used for any purpose .", "summary": " before moving into politics , lenore zann was an actress and once appeared topless in showtimes , the l word .   teenager , nick scissons , tweeted lenore 's raunchy topless scene and refused to take it down when asked .   ms. zann went to the police , informed the boy 's college and even rang his father .   offending picture was finally removed and police have dropped the case ; no prosecutions will occur .
