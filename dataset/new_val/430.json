{"text": "leading optometrist andrew hogan said a fringe across the face can obstruct light and stimulation to eye making it amblyotic . but expert dr leonard press said this can only happen if the eye is permanently covered before the age of seven . it 's a hairstyle favoured by celebs from rihanna to justin bieber and often copied by their young fans . but a leading optometrist has warned that having a side fringe that falls into the face can cause long-term eye damage . andrew hogan told the australian daily telegraph : ` if a young emo chap has a fringe covering one eye all the time , that eye wo n't see a lot of detail . and if it happens from a young age , that eye can become amblyotic . ' hair raising : rihanna , left , and cameron diaz often wear a side fringe - but could it damage their sight ? not according to experts . amblyopia is more commonly known as a lazy eye and is a childhood condition which means the sufferer ca n't see as clearly out of one eye , so they rely on the other . it can occur as a child 's sight develops so if a child has one of their eyes blocked , eg by an eye patch , when they are in a key developmental stage then they could develop a lazy eye . mr hogan believes having a side fringe means the hair can become like an eye patch across the eye and so cause the condition , and also short-sightedness , by restricting sunlight and stimulation from reaching the eye . ` if you walk around with an eye patch on all day , then that eye will end up seeing more poorly than the other eye , ' he explained . emo trend : members of the band 30 seconds to mars favour the fringe across the face look . he added that he was aware that visual development took place between birth to seven years , but that research had shown him vision could still be affected at later stages . but experts have poured cold water on mr hogan 's theory . amblyopia specialist dr leonard press told msnbc : ` the story would only be true if you had somebody young enough , and if that person never looked out of that eye - if it was blocked 24-7 . the reason it 's false is that you do n't have that constant deprivation . ' dr press added that vision is ` so well-established ' after the age of seven that ` combing your hair over your eye will not do anything to that system ' . so teenagers and young people can rest assured that they wo n't be risking their long-term eye sight by wearing the trendy style . however , a leading australian hairdresser told the australian telegraph they do run another risk - a sore neck ! roseanne anderson said : ' i have to wonder how they do n't get a stiff neck . i . have seen lots of fashions come and go - but really when i think about . it , this is probably the only hairstyle in my 40 years of hairdressing . that could be a health hazard .
