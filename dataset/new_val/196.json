{"text": "arsenal usually spread around the goals and the glory . they had hit the net 76 times this campaign but now , in their biggest game of the season , they drew a blank until injury-time . while arsenal 's strikeforce do not have the class of barcelona 's lionel messi , neymar and luis suarez , they should still have been good for more than alex oxlade-chamberlain 's late goal against monaco . at times olivier giroud , usually so reliable , alexis sanchez , mesut ozil , danny welbeck and the deeper-lying santi cazorla looked like they had never played together . arsenal 's expensively assembled front line look dejected during the 3-1 champions league loss to monaco . main men alexis sanchez -lrb- centre -rrb- and olivier giroud -lrb- third right -rrb- could not find the net at the emirates . arsenal centre forward giroud was particularly guilty of missing several inviting chances . chile international sanchez has gone off the boil since his blistering start to the season . here at the emirates stadium , the five figures arsene wenger turned to in this first leg failed him . miserably , as it turned out , because his former club monaco romped to a 3-1 victory . despite giroud 's catastrophic miss in the second half , when he skied a shot into the stands after danijel subasic had failed to hold sanchez 's shot , there was something wrong about the reaction when he was substituted . arsenal were 2-0 down by the time giroud was replaced by theo walcott in the 62nd minute . he left to howls of derision from home supporters . giroud , who has been leading the line brilliantly of late , did not deserve that . this monaco side are the clean-sheet kings , with five in their six champions league group games against bayer leverkusen , zenit st petersburg and benfica . they are a resilient bunch . the first cries of ` come on arsenal , come on arsenal ' came after half an hour , betraying frustration that the forward line had hit a brick wall . they had tomas rosicky , walcott and oxlade-chamberlain sitting on the bench . something had to change . danny welbeck -lrb- second left -rrb- races through but could not add to his meagre tally of goals for the season . germany playmaker mesut ozil -lrb- centre -rrb- struggles to evade the attention of monaco defenders . monaco keeper danijel subasic claims another cross as arsenal struggle to get on the scoresheet . in-form santi cazorla had a relatively quiet game in comparison to his recent displays for the gunners . last weekend , when arsenal went to crystal palace and won 2-1 , they kept plenty in reserve by boxing clever . here they lacked any punch , with the killer instinct deserting them after monaco had taken a surprise lead through geoffrey kondogbia 's deflected strike . arsenal struggled to find their rhythm , blocked by the powerful presence of wallace , who might have given away a penalty when he appeared to handle , and aymen abdennour . it is rare for this gunners team to look around for answers but they lacked conviction , returning to the bad old days when they believed they could walk the ball into the net . monaco took a surprise lead after geoffrey kondogbia -lrb- left -rrb- shot was deflected off per mertesacker . former tottenham striker dimitar berbatov doubled monaco 's lead with a smart finish . monaco 's yannick ferreira carrasco celebrates after coming on to score their third in injury time . sometimes sanchez wants it too much , as he did on saturday when he was taken out of his comfort zone in the victory over palace . the chilean has been desperate to get things going again , to hit another purple patch like the one which saw him score in successive games against hull , burnley , anderlecht and swansea in the autumn . sanchez was electric then , the spark in this arsenal team while they waited for the return of ozil from his injury lay-off . there were chances to make an impression in the first half , but arsenal lacked the expression that they have shown during their recent run of good form . giroud hit a couple of chances high and wide in the opening 45 minutes and it is fair to say that much more was expected of the man up top . arsene wenger watches on as his champions league hopes look to end in the last 16 for another season . arsenal could n't score despite calling on the likes of substitute theo walcott -lrb- second left -rrb- . ozil produced some lovely touches , including a cushioned lay-off into the path of hector bellerin as he made his way into the penalty area . for some reason , referee deniz aytekin penalised the full back for a foul . walcott offered an alternative when he came on , forcing a save from subasic that fell at the feet of welbeck . his follow-up shot struck walcott and flew over . wenger gambled , sending for oxlade-chamberlain to replace francis coquelin with 22 minutes left . he provided a goal , only for arsenal to blow it again . big time . alex oxlade-chamberlain -lrb- right -rrb- came on to finally score , but gunners have it all to do in the second leg .", "summary": " arsenal were defeated 3-1 by monaco in champions league last 16 clash .   gunners frontline of olivier giroud , alexis sanchez , santi cazorla , mesut ozil and danny welbeck could n't find the net .   geoffrey kondogbia , dimitar berbatov and yannick ferreira carrasco scored for the ligue 1 side .   substitute alex oxlade-chamberlain came on to give home side a lifeline .
