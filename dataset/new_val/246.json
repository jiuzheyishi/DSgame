{"text": "how per mertesacker must long for the days when he danced onto stage with the world cup in front of an adoring crowd of half a million in berlin . that was in july , a few weeks before his return to arsenal and the promise of a season in which he would silence the doubters and prove his worth as a world champion . there was , to begin with , a world cup hangover . but six months on and his sobering performance has left arsenal fans and arsene wenger nursing a banging headache . per mertesacker looks dejected after arsenal were beaten 3-1 at home to monaco on wednesday night . the defender admits that arsenal will need a ` wonderful night ' in monaco to qualify for the quarter-final . during wednesday 's disastrous 3-1 defeat at home to monaco , mertesacker was at his indecisive and lumbering worst . and this , do n't forget , was arsenal 's captain . for geoffrey kondogbia 's opener -- deflected in via the german -- he was lethargic in his closing of the france midfielder and his limp body was an all-too-easy detour on its path to goal . a john terry , for example , would surely have closed with more aggression and purpose . mertesacker continued to dither and unnerve until his fatal involvement in monaco 's tie-changing second . for reasons only known to the 30-year-old , he chose to chase possession inside the opposition half , a pursuit which was always destined to fail . and so it did . monaco broke , mertesacker was a spectator and dimitar berbatov -- the former fulham reserve -- climaxed their attack with a cool finish . geoffrey kondogbia lets fly and his shot takes a wicked deflection off mertesacker 's chest for the opener . dimitar berbatov enjoyed his second half strike which put the game beyond arsenal . alex oxlade-chamberlain struck a sublime effort deep in injury time which appeared to give the gunners hope . but that was extinguished after yannick ferreira-carrasco punished more defensive laxity to make it 3-1 . in the aftermath of the concession the cameras cut to the forlorn centre-back -- for it took a few seconds to locate him on halfway . but his face was pained , remorseful for his part in the goal . even for the tie-clinching third he was slow to close the scorer , although he had been left brutally exposed by the shortcomings of his team-mates . ironically , mertesacker 's best performance was saved for the post-match rallying cry he issued ahead of the second leg in monaco . ` let 's try to raise everyone 's level at monaco . let 's try to get in our rhythm there . we could have scored more than three goals last night and we can hurt them , ' he said . ` we have to focus on that . we ca n't look back and think too much about this game . we will analyse what went wrong , but when we travel to monaco we have to be on the front foot , be brave and get the best out of ourselves .
