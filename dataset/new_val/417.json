{"text": "gift : prime minister david cameron claims the donations are a mark of britain 's compassion . an ethiopian farmer has been given legal aid in the uk to sue britain -- because he claims millions of pounds sent by the uk to his country is supporting a brutal regime that has ruined his life . he says uk taxpayers ' money -- # 1.3 billion over the five years of the coalition government -- is funding a despotic one-party state in his country that is forcing thousands of villagers such as him from their land using murder , torture and rape . the landmark case is highly embarrassing for the government , which has poured vast amounts of extra cash into foreign aid despite belt-tightening austerity measures at home . prime minister david cameron claims the donations are a mark of britain 's compassion . but the farmer -- whose case is set to cost tens of thousands of pounds -- argues that huge sums handed to ethiopia are breaching the department for international development 's -lrb- dfid -rrb- own human rights rules . he accuses the government of devastating the lives of some of the world 's poorest people rather than fulfilling promises to help them . the case comes amid growing global concern over western aid propping up corrupt and repressive regimes . if the farmer is successful , ministers might have to review major donations to other nations accused of atrocities , such as pakistan and rwanda -- and it could open up britain to compensation claims from around the world . ethiopia , a key ally in the west 's war on terror , is the biggest recipient of british aid , despite repeated claims from human rights groups that the cash is used to crush opposition . dfid was served papers last month by lawyers acting on behalf of ` mr o ' , a 33-year-old forced to abandon his family and flee to a refugee camp in kenya after being beaten and tortured for trying to protect his farm . he is not seeking compensation but to challenge the government 's approach to aid . his name is being withheld to protect his wife and six children who remain in ethiopia . ` my client 's life has been shattered by what has happened , ' said rosa curling , the lawyer handling the case . ` it goes entirely against what our aid purports to stand for . ' mr o 's family was caught in controversial ` villagisation ' programmes . under the schemes , four million people living in areas opposed to an autocratic government dominated by men from the north of the country are being forced from lucrative land into new villages . their land has been sold to foreign investors or given to ethiopians with government connections . people resisting the soldiers driving them from their farms and homes at gunpoint have been routinely beaten , raped , jailed , tortured or killed . exodus : the farmer claims villagers are being attacked by troops driving them from their land . ` why is the west , especially the uk , giving so much money to the ethiopian government when it is committing atrocities on my people ? ' asked mr o when we met last year . his london-based lawyers argue that dfid is meant to ensure recipients of british aid do not violate human rights , and they have failed to properly investigate the complaints . human rights watch has issued several scathing reports highlighting the impact of villagisation and showing how ethiopia misuses aid for political purposes , such as diverting food and seeds to supporters . concern focuses on a massive scheme called protection of basic services , which is designed to upgrade public services and is part-funded by dfid . force : ethiopian federal riot police point their weapons at protesting students in a square in the country 's capital , addis ababa . critics say this cash pays the salaries of officials implementing resettlements and for infrastructure at new villages . dfid officials have not interviewed mr o , reportedly saying it is too risky to visit the united nations-run camp in kenya where he is staying , and refuse to make their assessments public . a spokesman said they could not comment specifically on the legal action but added : ` it is wrong to suggest that british development money is used to force people from their homes . our support to the protection of basic services programme is only used to provide healthcare , schooling , clean water and other services . ' intimidation : riot police confront a man -lrb- not the claimant -rrb- near the tegbareed industrial college as officers beat rock-throwing students during a demonstration . as he showed me pictures on his mobile phone of his homeland , the tall , bearded farmer smiled fondly . ` we were very happy growing up there and living there , ' he said . this was hardly surprising : the lush gambela region of ethiopia is a fertile place of fruit trees , rivers and fissures of gold , writes ian birrell . that was the only smile when i met mr o in the dadaab refugee camp in kenya last year . he told me how his simple family life had been destroyed in seconds -- and how he blames british aid for his misery . ` i miss my family so much , ' he said . ` i do n't want to be relying on handouts -- i want to be productive . ' his nightmare began in november 2011 when ethiopian troops accompanied by officials arrived in his village and ordered everyone to leave for a new location . men who refused were beaten and women were raped , leaving some infected with hiv . i met a blind man who was hit in the face and a middle-aged mother whose husband was shot dead beside her -- she still bore obvious the scars from her own beating and rape by three soldiers . unlike their previous home , their new village had no food , water , school or health facilities . they were not given farmland and there were just a few menial jobs . ` the government was pretending it was about development , ' said mr o , 33 . ` but they just want to push the indigenous people off so they can take our land and gold . ' after speaking out against forced relocations and returning to his village , mr o was taken to a military camp where for three days he was gagged with a sock in his mouth , severely kicked and beaten with rifle butts and sticks . ` i thought it would be better to die than to suffer like this , ' he told me . afterwards , like thousands of others , he fled the country ; now he lives amid the dust and squalor of the world 's largest refugee camp . he says their land was then given to relatives of senior regime figures and foreign investors from asia and the middle east . ` i am very angry about this aid , ' he said . ` britain needs to check what is happening to its money . ` i hope the court will act to stop the killing , stop the land-grabbing and stop your government supporting the ethiopian government behind this . ' as the dignified mr o said so sagely , what is happening in his country is the precise opposite of development .", "summary": " the farmer claims aid is funding a despotic one-party state in his country .   alleges regime is forcing thousands from their land using murder and rape .   prime minister david cameron says donations are a mark of compassion .   if farmer is successful , ministers .   might have to review overseas donations .
