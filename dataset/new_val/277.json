{"text": "the gambling aspect of tim sherwood 's management style has been a major contributing factor to harry kane 's ridiculous rise to prominence , and the striker knows it . kane is set to start for tottenham against chelsea in the capital one cup final at wembley on sunday , but knows his career might have gone down a much different path . that 's down to sherwood , who the 21-year-old says changed his prospects . kane wants other players to be given similar opportunities and believes there is a lack of faith in prospects . harry kane knows he is indebted to tim sherwood for his fast rise at tottenham hotspur . kane scored twice against chelsea when spurs beat them 5-3 back in january at white hart lane . sherwood took a leap of faith with kane , who he had managed in the development squad . kane was talking to the weekly sport magazine . the pair had previously worked together before the now aston villa boss was handed the first-term reins last season . and , even though kane had impressed in fits and starts , he had n't looked like breaking through permanently . now , with 24 goals in 37 games this season , roy hodgson is certain to call the youngster up to his england squad next month . ` tim sherwood first of all played me -lsb- regularly -rsb- in the premier league , ' kane told sport magazine . ` i knew tim from the development squad , and we had a great relationship . ` he threw me in when maybe other managers would n't have . maybe that 's what a few more young strikers coming through need . ' kane 's rise to prominence has been swift , the plaudits plentiful ; some have characterised the front man as a hybrid of alan shearer and teddy sheringham . ` i can see a bit of both in me , which is n't bad , to be honest , ' kane added . ` to be compared to someone like alan shearer is very special . he 's the all-time premier league top goalscorer . if i score anywhere near as many as he did , it would n't be a bad career . ` i feel sometimes i play in both of those roles for spurs , and i see little bits that they had in my game . shearer was a great finisher , and i like to think i 'm a good finisher . ` sheringham brought others into play , so you can definitely say i have some similar attributes . hopefully i can do well and continue to score goals , and one day people will say that this player is like harry kane . ' kane has scored 24 goals in just 34 appearances for spurs under mauricio pochettino this season . kane was in the stands to see tottenham beat chelsea in the 2008 capital one cup final . it matters little to kane who he resembles on sunday , so long as it is he who sinks chelsea . this was the spurs fan who stood in the stands in 2008 to watch his team beat the blues and who is now living out his childhood dreams . ` i was there watching spurs beat chelsea on the big stage , and winning trophies , ' kane said . ` it was something i grew up dreaming of doing , and now i have the opportunity . ` to win a trophy for a club like spurs would be something very special , but we want to try and get into the champions league too , so we 're focused on doing the best we can in every competition .
