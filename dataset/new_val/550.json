{"text": "that was n't in the script : penalties , the ataturk stadium and a momentous anniversary looming -- surely the only outcome could have been a liverpool win ? not this time . here was a european first , liverpool failing in a shootout , and that it happened at the scene of their greatest triumph thickened the plot . going out of the europa league at the hands of besiktas was not how they aimed to mark 10 years since winning the champions league . inevitably , it went to the wire and it took place at the same end at which they outwitted milan in the 2005 champions league final . but when tolgay arslan thumped home besiktas ' fifth successful penalty , dejan lovren wilted and sent his kick high and wide . dejan lovren missed the 10th penalty as liverpool crashed out of the

after lovren was the unlucky man to miss from the penalty spot . ` unfortunately , on this occasion , istanbul is not a happy place , ' conceded a crestfallen brendan rodgers . with better finishing , it might have been . liverpool had opportunities to build on the lead mario balotelli had given them at anfield last week but lacked a killer instinct and it was their misfortune to run into a side , high on energy and fervour , that wanted to create history . it was never going to be a quiet night . with ticket prices reduced to attract a big crowd , the atmosphere had been building all day . thousands of home fans congregated at the site where their regular stadium is being redeveloped , and come 8pm local time , they were ready to play their part . yet as loud as the turks made themselves , liverpool 's players never flinched . besiktas had admirable endeavour but no star quality and it became apparent early on that mistakes -- or a stroke of genius -- would be the visitors ' biggest foe . liverpool 's mario balotelli accuses besiktas 's necip uysal of going down easy after a push by the premier league striker . balotelli yells at uysal on thursday evening during their

would not have put any money on liverpool holding their nerve but they have turned things around impressively and with the defence working smoothly it became a question of whether they could score to kill the tie . they had enough chances to do so before the break as balotelli and daniel sturridge -- a pairing rodgers had started with only once before -- began causing problems for besiktas with power and running . balotelli was in the thick of the action straight away , jostling with necip uysal and picking up a booking for a lunge at veli kavlak , but this was n't an erratic display and the deft pass he produced to send sturridge through should have produced the first goal on 33 minutes . alberto moreno and raheem sterling had both gone close but neither had the time and space sturridge was afforded when balotelli ushered him through . much to rodgers ' frustration , however , he wanted to take the shot with his left foot and that allowed besiktas to scramble the danger away . sturridge was involved again moments later , this time exchanging passes with moreno on the edge of the area , but the wing back succeeded only in shooting straight at cenk gonen , who comfortably clung on to the drive . besiktas offered little in response . for all that slaven bilic hopped around his technical area , frantically trying to provide some inspiration , the closest they came to finding a breakthrough before half-time was a tame effort from olcay sahan that simon mignolet easily gathered . everything , it seemed , was going to plan for liverpool and the game followed a similar pattern when they emerged after the interval . though the onus was on besiktas to be creative and clever , all they offered were speculative attempts from serdar kurtulus and jose sosa . but there was one key difference . liverpool 's intensity as an attacking force dwindled and , gradually , they started dropping deeper and deeper . bilic , who was like a coiled spring , sensed there might be an opening and he made a change , sending on arslan for the tiring sosa . how it paid off . within 12 minutes of his introduction , arslan dramatically changed the balance of the tie , dispatching a glorious left-foot drive beyond mignolet after gokhan tore and demba ba created an opening for him 20 yards out . the stadium erupted as it curled inside the post . there is no question it stunned liverpool . they looked groggy and were almost knocked out cold in injury time when ba smashed a shot against the woodwork from eight yards , the chance coming after arslan slalomed beyond three challenges to win a corner . tolgay arslan -lrb- right -rrb- scores the goal that put besiktas 1-0 up on the night after demba ba -lrb- second from right -rrb- provided the assist . besiktas 's

europa league round of 32 second leg match . liverpool went 1-0 down against besiktas in the second leg as the game went to extra time in the europa league tie . it was only the third penalty shootout defeat in liverpool 's history -- they also lost to northampton town in 2010 and wimbledon in 1993 . extra-time at least enabled rodgers to work on his squad but that did not halt the shift in momentum . liverpool looked spent up front and the first 15 minutes became a test of endurance . mignolet , in particular , excelled , standing firm when besiktas threatened . a figure of derision not so long ago , he was comfortably liverpool 's top performer and it became inevitable , as besiktas started to run out of ideas , that the belgian would become the main character in the final reckoning . ultimately , he could n't reprise jerzy dudek 's role and , for this season , the european adventure has no happy ending . the task now is to make sure they have europe to look forward to next year . all these years after the turkish fans welcomed english clubs to hell , and they still put on quite of a show for their visitors . thousands had massed inside the ataturk fully two hours before kick-off and a cacophony of boos and whistles greeted the liverpool players when they emerged in their tracksuits to sample the atmosphere 90 minutes before the start . liverpool landed back on merseyside in the early hours of friday morning confident of escaping any punishment from uefa over financial fair play regulations . the club have made substantial losses in the last two years , but it is understood that uefa accept the next financial figures will show a small profit and that liverpool are on course to make an even bigger one the following year . besiktas issued an apology to liverpool fans after some were left stranded in the centre of istanbul , 90 minutes ' drive from the stadium , when their pre-arranged transport failed to turn up . liverpool complained to the turkish
