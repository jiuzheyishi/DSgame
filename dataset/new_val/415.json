{"text": "` mockery of justice ' : convicted rapist mustafa abdullahi can not be deported to somalia because it would breach his human rights . a somali rapist who held a knife to a pregnant woman 's throat as he raped her has been allowed to stay in britain to protect his human rights . mustafa abdullahi , 31 , was jailed for ten years after he threatened to kill his victim and repeatedly assaulted her . he was set to be deported on release , but immigration judges have ruled he can not be kicked out because his mother and other family members live in the uk . they said he had been here so long , it would breach his right to a private and family life to force him to return to somalia . the judges also gave him credit for having ` faced up to what he has done ' and having put his criminal behaviour ` behind him ' . they also concluded he posed a ` low risk ' of committing further offences , based on evidence from a psychiatrist who only saw him for a couple of hours . the case is the latest in a series of human rights judgments in which judges favour the rights of criminals over those of victims and the wider public . tory mp dominic raab said : ` this vicious man should be on the first plane back to somalia . it makes a mockery of british justice and human rights to see such a dangerous thug dance rings around the uk system . ' abdullahi came to britain aged 11 in february 1993 to join his mother , brother and sister , who arrived three years earlier . they were all given indefinite leave to stay in 2000 . but in 2007 he was sentenced to ten years in prison for the horrific sex attack , in which he repeatedly raped a ` vulnerable ' pregnant woman in her early twenties who had been sleeping at her home , after holding a knife to her throat and threatening to kill her . despite the evidence against him he refused to accept his guilt , forcing his victim to go through the ordeal of a trial . even while in jail he refused to admit what he had done . when the home office began efforts to deport him , he immediately claimed asylum . this application was rejected last year , by which time he was out of prison after serving half his sentence . but abdullahi 's lawyers appealed against his deportation on human rights grounds . earlier this year , a home office lawyer told a tribunal abdullahi should be deported because of the ` very serious and disgusting nature of his offence ' . the home office pointed out that even after he was released from prison he continued to show ` no respect for the law ' . for example , while on probation , he was caught using cannabis but instead of being returned to jail , he was given a # 60 fine . abdullahi said he was ` afraid ' to return to the somaliland region because of the civil war . he claimed that he was n't a practising muslim , despite having ` allah ' tattooed in arabic on his arm and chest . and because his parents had never taught him about the clan structure in somalia , he would also struggle to fit in , he said . the tribunal accepted that because he had tattoos , which are considered un-islamic in muslim countries , he would be ` vulnerable to serious harassment ' , but concluded it was safe for him to return . legal row : abdullahi immediately claimed asylum when the home office , pictured , began efforts to deport him . however , they then allowed him to stay because of his right to a private and family life under article 8 of the human rights act . despite not having any children or a wife in britain , they said it would be wrong to send him home because of the length of time he has lived in britain . the judges also decided he could stay because of his ` close relatives ' here and ` very regular contact with his parent and siblings ' . first tier tribunal judge nadine finch , sitting in london , said that even though he did not admit his guilt in prison , he had since owned up and completed a ` victim empathy ' course while on probation . she concluded it was ` shame and fear that he would be disowned by his family ' that meant he did not confess at the time , and attributed his lack of candour to the fact that it was his first time in prison and that the offence was ` against the sensibilities of his own community ' . psychiatrist dr harriet hunt-grubbe said . that abdullahi would be ` deprived of the emotional support of his . mother and immediate family if deported to somaliland ' . after speaking to him for just two hours , she said there was only a low risk that he would commit serious sexual or violent crimes . she said he was ` depressed as a result of possibility of deportation and from witnessing his brother committing suicide ' . sending him to somalia would also increase his suicide risk because he would be unlikely to have access to the anti-depressants and therapy he receives on the nhs . she concluded that he was a ` well-loved member of his family and his friendship network and that his deportation would have a negative impact on their own lives ' . the home office appealed but this was rejected by an upper tribunal , which said : ` although he has committed serious offences , he has at last faced up to what he has done and has taken significant steps to put behind him that kind of criminal behaviour . ' abdullahi , of fulham , south west london , said : ` i 'm not commenting about the case . you 'll have to speak to my solicitor . ' his aunt , sali abdullahi , said he did not want to go back to somalia because he had ` no family or friends there and it is dangerous ' . a home office spokesman said : ` we are extremely disappointed with the court 's decision and plan to appeal . ` those who come to the uk must abide by our laws and if they do not we will seek to remove them . in 2012 we removed more than 4,500 foreign national offenders . ` for too long the human rights act has been abused by foreign criminals to avoid deportation . ` that 's why we introduced tough new rules to protect the public that are being included in our immigration bill .
