' -lsb- sic -rsb- . he later posted : ` from what dark hole have these cretins crept from i wonder . ' his remarks were made in relation to a project called ` counting dead women ' run by feminist karen ingala smith that produces information about the number of women in the uk killed by their partners or sons . last week she launched her femiside census : profiles of women killed by men - which records details of all the women murdered by men in britain . twitter user @liraelclayr , who wished to remain anonymous , told mailonline : ` the tweet was offensive , but i was n't overly surprised as i tend to receive a lot of abuse on twitter . ` the direct leap to calling a group of woman  lesbos  in my opinion was an attempt to diminish our words as if it was a shameful thing to be . ` although i myself am not a lesbian , others included are and found it even more offensive as is their right . ` the gentleman apologised to me the next day and donated to a charity in way of that apology . i accepted the apology for myself but told him that others would accept or not accept as is their right . ` as far as i 'm aware several people are still cross about it . ' following a backlash on twitter , mr morris hastily deleted the offensive tweets and his account . he has since resigned from the party . nikki bond , labour party councillor in sheffield and an active feminist , said it was ` pretty appalling ' he later issued a statement apologising for his remarks . he said : ` it was a very foolish tweet which i have apologised for . there was no justification for it whatsoever . ' i have since resigned from the conservative party and the lady in question has accepted my apology . ` i 've made a donation to a charity of her choice . it was sent on the spur of the moment and it certainly does n't reflect my views . i 'm deeply ashamed about my comment . ' nikki bond , a labour party councillor in sheffield and an active feminist , said : ` unfortunately i 'm all too familiar with this kind of attitude . ` for anyone to have that kind of attitude is pretty appalling but for someone in a political role , where people are looking up to them for guidance , it is really important they do not come out with this sort of language .
