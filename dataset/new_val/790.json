{"text": "women who took ssris antidepressants during pregnancy were three times more likely to have a baby boy with autism . mothers-to-be who take antidepressants have an increased risk of having a child with autism , a study has found . u.s. researchers say women who took commonly prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors - ssris - were three times more likely to have a baby boy with autism or developmental delays . the effect of the drugs , prescribed for depression , anxiety and other disorders , is particularity pronounced during the third trimester , they say . researchers from the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public looked at nearly 1,000 mothers and their babies . the study , published online in the . journal pediatrics , looked at data from mother-child pairs in the . childhood autism risks from genetics and the environment -lrb- charge -rrb- study . the researchers divided the data up into three groups - children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder -lrb- asd -rrb- , those with developmental delays and those with typical development . all the children were aged between two to five and of them , 82 per cent of those with autism were boys ,66 per cent with developmental delay were boys , as were 86 per cent of those with typical development . while the study included girls , the substantially stronger effect in boys alone suggests they may be much more susceptible for the effects of ssris in the womb , the researchers concluded . ` we found prenatal ssri exposure was nearly three times as likely in . boys with autism relative to typical development , with the greatest risk . when exposure took place during the first trimester , ' said study author li-ching lee . ` ssri was also elevated among boys with developmental delay , with the strongest exposure effect in the third trimester . ' the effect of the drugs , prescribed for depression , anxiety and other disorders , is particularity pronounced during the third trimester . the ` happy ' hormone serotonin is critical . to early brain development , so the researchers suggest exposure during . pregnancy to anything that influences serotonin levels can have . potential effect on birth and developmental outcomes . with diagnoses of autism on the rise , they suggest increased use of ssris in recent years may be contributing to this . commenting on the study , irva hertz-picciotto , chief of the division of . environmental and occupational health at uc davis , said : ` this study provides further evidence that in some children , prenatal exposure to ssris may influence their risk for developing an autism spectrum disorder . ` this research also highlights the challenge for women and their physicians to balance the risks versus the benefits of taking these medications , given that a mother 's underlying mental-health conditions also may pose a risk , both to herself and her child .
