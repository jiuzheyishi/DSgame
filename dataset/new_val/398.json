{"text": "alex salmond begins the most crucial week yet in the battle for scotland 's future -- without the hoped-for commonwealth games ` bounce ' in favour of independence . three days before mr salmond 's live tv debate with anti-independence campaign leader alistair darling , a poll for the mail on sunday revealed no boost for the ` yes ' campaign from the games in glasgow . the survation survey , the first of scottish voters to be conducted since the games began , puts the ` yes ' vote on 40 per cent -- down one point on last month -- and ` no ' unchanged on 46 per cent . the outcome will be a bitter disappointment for scottish nationalists , who had hoped that scheduling the independence referendum on september 18 on the back of the games would lead to a surge of votes to break up the uk . scroll down for video . unaware : surrounded by saltires , mr salmond is unaware of the solitary union flag behind his head . daniel wallace of scotland celebrates winning the gold in the men 's 400m individual medley final . it also flies in the face of reports that a feel-good factor at glasgow 's success in staging the games and scotland 's record haul of medals would provide a so-called ` braveheart bounce ' and revitalise the ` yes ' campaign . but the survey does show that scottish first minister mr salmond is a clear favourite to win tuesday night 's debate -- the first head-to-head contest between the two campaign leaders . the charismatic scottish nationalist leader is backed by 37 per cent of voters to come out on top , with barely one in ten predicting that dour ex-labour cabinet minister mr darling will triumph . the result will heap pressure on mr darling , the chairman of the anti-independence better together campaign , who faced criticism that he is too lacklustre to take on ` showman ' mr salmond . opponents : alex salmond -lrb- left -rrb- wants an independent scotland while alastair darting -lrb- right -rrb- wants a union . the televised debate , before a studio audience of 300 drawn from ` yes ' , ` no ' and undecided voters , is seen as crucial if mr salmond is to overhaul a stubborn anti-independence lead in the polls . yesterday , it emerged that mr salmond has been having performance lessons from a lifestyle coach ahead of the showdown . but in an article for the mail on sunday danny alexander , the mp for inverness , backs mr darling to present the ` clear , unvarnished ' case for staying in the uk , in contrast to the ` verbal acrobatics ' of mr salmond . david cameron has faced criticism for refusing to take on the first minister himself in a tv debate . and the poll reveals nearly half of scottish voters brand the prime minister a coward . danny alexander , the mp for inverness , backs mr darling to present the ` clear , unvarnished ' case for staying in the uk . however , more than one in three agree that he was sensible to leave mr darling -- as a scot -- to tackle mr salmond . the survation poll found that more than 80 per of voters say the games have made no difference to how they were likely to vote . only 12 per cent said they were more likely to vote ` yes ' , with some voters -lrb- 7 per cent -rrb- even saying it would actually make them more inclined to vote against independence . a spokesman for the yes campaign said the poll was ` very encouraging ' and matched evidence that the result was too close to call . a spokesman for mr salmond said : ` this poll makes clear that scots believe david cameron is afraid to take part in a debate with the first minister . '", "summary": " first poll of scottish voters conducted since the games began puts ` yes ' vote on 40 % -- down one point on last month .   those in favour of keeping the union remain static on 46 % .   nationalists hoped games would lead to surge of anti-uk votes .
