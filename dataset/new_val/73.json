{"text": "you might look at your desk and think it looks pretty clean . but a gruesome new video shows how it could be riddled with invisible bacteria all the way from the bathroom - and is easily spread to your hands and mouth . as one in four office workers fail to wash their hands after going to the loo , anything from the door to the keyboard and computer mouse is covered with millions of bacteria . in order to avoid getting ill , experts have revealed the best ways to try and remain as germ-free as possible . flushing the loo without putting the seat down causes a ` sneeze effect ' , in which bacteria is sprayed all over the cubicle and can cover surfaces as far as 20 feet away . bacteria spreads throughout the office . previous studies have revealed 3,000 organisms per square inch on a keyboard or over 1,600 on a computer mouse . touching the keyboard and then later eating lunch transfers the bacteria from the hands to the mouth . using hand sanitiser throughout the day can stop the spread of bacteria , experts say . it 's known 16 per cent of people carry the norovirus -- which causes vomiting and diarrhoea -- but show no symptoms . dr lisa ackerley , professorial fellow at the royal society of public health , warns of the ` sneeze effect ' when flushing the toilet . failing to put the toilet lid down before flushing means bacteria is sprayed and can cover surfaces as far away as 20 feet . she said : ` if you go to the toilet and you do n't put the lid down before you flush , when you do flush the germs that are in the toilet will spread around the toilet cubicle . ` this means they could land on the toilet seat or toilet paper itself and that means they could be spread on your hands and other surfaces later on . ' to combat the sneeze effect , use an antibacterial seat cleaner to wipe the germs away , she added . usually after going to the toilet we have around 200 million bacteria per square inch on each hand . and hands contaminated with viruses can transfer them to five more surfaces or 14 other subjects . in fact , u.s. researchers found that when they contaminated a single doorknob or table top with a ` tracer virus ' it spread through an office building , hotel or healthcare facility within two to four hours . after using the bathroom one hand has 200 million bacteria per square inch , often picked up from the toilet paper or toilet seat . contaminated hands transfer viruses to five more surfaces or 14 other people . previous research found viruses can spread through and office within two to four hours . 700 harmful bacteria inhabit car interiors. , but almost half of illnesses can be reduced by washing hands effectively , experts advised . dr ackerley continued : ` we know from studies 3,000 organisms per square inch can be found on a keyboard or over 1,600 a computer mouse . ` over the course of a day you might be picking up those bacteria and then if you suddenly decide to have lunch at your desk without washing your hands first , you 're basically transferring those bacteria into your mouth . ' it 's known 16 per cent of people carry the norovirus -- which causes vomiting and diarrhoea -- but show no symptoms . ` so you may feel perfectly fine and well but you 're carrying around the virus and spreading it around the office ' dr ackerley said . she recommended using a hand sanitiser after leaving the bathroom , and over the course of the day . office workers come into contact with 10 million bacteria every day , with many spreading the norovirus around the office without knowing it . a keyboard is covered with 3,295 organisms per square inch and a computer mouse riddled with 1,676 organisms per square inch . a phone is covered in 25,127 organisms per square inch which can be transferred to the face and mouth . ` this means if someone else has forgotten to wash their hands you wo n't pick up their germs and then spread them around the office . ' but the most effective ways to stop infection in the office is simply washing hands , she said . around half of illnesses can be reduced by people simply washing their hands effectively . and just 20 seconds of hand washing can stop the journey of the germ . ensuring the hands are thoroughly dry after a wash is important too , added dr ackerley . ` it 's been found germs are more likely to be transferred to other surfaces if they 're damp . ` so dry your hands completely and you 've done the job . ' washing hands after going to the bathroom and drying them thoroughly is essential , as 80 per cent of infections are spread by hand .", "summary": " video shows the speed at which germs spread around an office .   1 in 4 office workers do n't wash their hands after using the bathroom .   flushing the loo without putting the seat down causes a ` sneeze effect '   this sprays the bacteria over the cubicle , including on the paper and seat .   after using the loo we have 200m bacteria per square inch on each hand .   people can then transfer the bacteria to their hands or mouths .   after using the bathroom , one hand has 200 million bacteria per square inch .   contaminated hands transfer bacteria to doors , keyboards , phones .   office workers come into contact with 10 million bacteria a day .   hands contaminated with viruses transfer them to 5 surfaces or 14 people .
