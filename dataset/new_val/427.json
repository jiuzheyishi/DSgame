{"text": "court case : a female soldier , known only as ab , is suing the ministry of defence for their handling of her sexual assault claims -lrb- file photo -rrb- . a sailor is taking the ministry of defence to court after she was sexually assaulted by a british soldier in afghanistan while they both stood guard over a terrorist . the woman , who is in her 20s , had her breasts fondled and was subjected to lewd demands for sex during the 12-hour ordeal , which left her ` disgusted and terrified ' . the incident happened after she was posted to camp bastion to watch over zia rahman , a rogue afghan policeman who turned his gun on three british soldiers , killing them in july 2012 . last night , the woman , an able seaman who can be identified only as ab , revealed how corporal christopher yard made unwanted sexual advances towards her as they stood guard in the compound 's hospital , where the injured taliban terrorist had been taken . she said : ` he groped my breast and i slapped his hand away . he said he could not help himself . he said he had cheated on his previous girlfriend and had a high sex drive , needing to have sex three to four times a day . ` he also suggested we went on a midnight run together and have sex in a military container . i felt trapped because i could not leave my post . ' she added : ` in a war zone and while we were guarding a significant terrorist , he fondled my breasts . ` to be sexually harassed and felt up by a more senior member of british forces , while guarding a notorious suspect , was shocking and traumatic . ' she is bringing a compensation claim for sexual harassment and sex discrimination at an employment tribunal in exeter . the mod is defending the case , saying she did not properly comply with the military complaints procedure before issuing her claim . under military rules , service personnel can bring a compensation claim only after they have exhausted the internal grievance process . attack : the camp bastion checkpoint where three soldiers died in 2012 . ms ab 's original complaint led to yard being tried by a court martial for sexual assault . although he pleaded not guilty , he was convicted and sentenced in june last year to 120 days ' detention and demoted two ranks to trooper . at an appeal hearing last august his sentence was reduced to 30 days ' detention and demotion by one rank to lance corporal . victim : ab was standing guard over a terrorist who killed three soldiers , including warrant officer leonard perran thomas , pictured . but ms ab , who returned to britain at the end of her posting in august 2012 , claims she was not properly supported after the assault , which left her feeling ` very vulnerable ' . in a statement submitted to an employment tribunal , she said : ` the next day , i reported the sexual assault to my superior . but cpl yard was not moved from his station so i was very afraid to have to work in relatively close proximity to him . ' she added : ` they prosecuted him , but forgot about me . i never felt listened to . they still see staff who complain about the conduct of an officer as being the problem unless you accept their outcome . ` they do not have a victim-centred approach . ' her lawyers say the legal action is a test case that will reveal how the military has closed ranks on sexual harassment by denying complainants the right to take their cases to civil courts . her solicitor , lawrence davies , of equal justice , said he believes there are ` dozens ' of other cases that have been suppressed through mod internal grievance rules . an mod report in 2012 found all of the 400 female soldiers questioned claimed to have experienced ` unwanted sexual attention ' . an mod spokesman said : ` while we can not comment on individual or ongoing cases , the armed forces have a zero tolerance approach to all forms of bullying , discrimination and abuse .
