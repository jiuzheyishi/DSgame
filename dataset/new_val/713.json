{"text": "the majestic transformation of a star has been revealed in a stunning time-lapse of a stellar explosion 20,000 light years away . the animation , spanning four years , documents a huge explosion emanating from v838 monocerotis -- a red star located in the constellation monoceros . before it exploded , v838 had grown to become one of the largest stars ever observed by astronomers , producing 600,000 times more light than our own sun . scroll down for video . the animation , which spans images taken over four years , documents a huge explosion emanating from v838 monocerotis -- a red star located in the constellation monoceros . a light echo is light from a stellar explosion echoing off dust surrounding the star . v838 . monocerotis produced enough energy in a brief flash to illuminate . surrounding dust , like a spelunker taking a flash picture of the walls . of an undiscovered cavern . the star presumably ejected the illuminated dust shells in previous outbursts . light from the latest outburst travels to the dust and then is reflected to earth . because . of this indirect path , the light arrives at earth months after light . from the star that travelled directly toward earth . as it burst , v838 created an expanding light echo that lit up the cosmic dust surrounding it , creating some of the most stunning images seen by the hubble telescope to date . the time-lapse uses a series of images captured by hubble between 2002 and 2006 , when v838 monocerotis produced a stellar flash so brilliant that scientists had never seen anything like it before . as it burst , v838 created an expanding light echo that lit up the cosmic dust surrounding it , creating some of the most stunning images seen by hubble to date . a stellar flash like this was unprecedented because supernovas and novas typically expel matter out into space , often obscuring them from view . while the animation appears to show v838 expel material into space , what it is actually showing is an outwardly moving ` light echo ' of the bright flash - about a million times solar luminosity . according to nasa , during echoes , light from the flash is reflected by successively more distant rings in the complex array of ambient interstellar dust that already surrounded the star . structures that resemble whirlpools in the star are noticeable in the time-lapse , and may have been produced by the effects of magnetic fields in the space between the stars . while the animation appears to show v838 expel material into space , what it is actually showing is an outwardly moving ` light echo ' of the bright flash - about a million times solar luminosity . according to nasa , in a light echo , light from the flash is reflected by successively more distant rings in the complex array of ambient interstellar dust that already surrounded the star . scientists still do n't know what caused the explosion . they originally predicted that astronomers were watching a supernova or the thermal pulse of a dying star . but these theories have since been dismissed after discovering the v838 was likely a young star . a paper with contributions from the us naval observatory , the university of arizona and the european space agency concluded : ` when combined with the high luminosity and unusual outburst behaviour , these characteristics indicate that v838 mon represents a hitherto unknown type of stellar outburst , for which we have no completely satisfactory physical explanation . ' v838 mon lies about 20,000 light years away toward the constellation of the unicorn -lrb- hence the name monoceros -rrb- , while the light echo in the image spans about six light years in diameter . the sequence captured by hubble from 2002-2004 showing the interstellar dust being illuminated by the star 's explosion .", "summary": " animation documents an explosion emanating from v838 monocerotis .   it was captured by hubble and spans the period from 2002 and 2006 .   as it burst , v838 created a light echo that lit up the cosmic dust around it .   scientists still have no idea what caused the stellar explosion of v838 .   a stellar flash like this was unprecedented because supernovas typically expel matter out into space , often obscuring them from view .
