{"text": "the campaign to save the union has more than doubled its lead to a record high following alex salmond 's tv debate meltdown , a sensational new poll has revealed . an exclusive survey for the scottish daily mail has found that viewers overwhelmingly believe alistair darling crushed his opponent , and nearly a quarter of those who watched are now more likely to reject independence . at the end of a torrid week for the snp , mr salmond now has only 39 days of campaigning to revive his lifeless bid to break-up britain before the historic referendum on september 18 . scroll down for video . the poll , carried out after the live debate between scotland 's first minister alex salmond and better together campaign leader alistair darling , shows nearly a quarter of viewers are now more likely to reject independence . the shock survation poll , carried out on wednesday and thursday , shows that opposition to separation has soared to 50 per cent for the first time since the firm began asking the question . that is a remarkable four point increase in the space of a single week , with only 37 per cent now in favour of a yes vote -- down three points . when undecided voters are excluded , the no camp is on 57 per cent -- a massive 14-point lead over yes , compared to just a six-point lead last sunday . mr salmond 's failure to answer questions about the currency of an independent scotland is at the heart of the dramatic collapse . more than two-thirds of the 1,010 scots polled by survation said the first minister should produce a ` plan b ' to his unrealistic bid to keep the pound before voters cast their ballots . asked to pick adjectives to describe the snp leader 's performance in the pivotal stv debate last tuesday -- which was watched by 1.7 million people -- the most popular choices were ` weak ' , ` uninformed ' and ` dishonest ' . his opponent , former chancellor mr darling who is spearheading the better together campaign , was described as ` knowledgeable ' and ` strong ' . mr salmond 's leadership is now under unprecedented scrutiny , with senior snp figures privately briefing against him throughout the week and some suggesting his deputy nicola sturgeon should replace him for a crunch tv debate on the bbc later this month . the survey found that viewers overwhelmingly thought that alistair darling -lrb- right -rrb- crushed opponent scotland 's first minister alex salmond -lrb- left -rrb- during a live televised debate on tuesday night . alarmingly for the first minister , 15 per cent of scots who backed the snp in the 2011 holyrood election would be more likely to vote yes in the referendum if miss sturgeon was the leader . a staggering 45 per cent of independence supporters now believe miss sturgeon should represent the yes camp in the bbc debate on august 25 . and to compound the crisis for mr salmond , the collapse in support is largely due to huge numbers of female voters who have switched to the no camp in recent days . patrick bri√¥ne , director of research at survation , said : ` following his unexpected success in the debate , alistair darling has seen support for no jump to its highest ever level in a survation poll , at 50 per cent and a 13-point lead . ` whilst this post-debate boost may fade over time , with little over a month remaining until scots head to the polls it looks as though alex salmond is fast running out of time to turn things around . barring a dramatic reversal in the next debate , the dreams of scottish nationalists appear increasingly likely to be dashed come september 18 . ' during a visit to glasgow yesterday , labour leader ed miliband told the mail : ' i think what this shows is that tuesday night was a very big moment because of alistair 's persistent and very forensic questioning . alex salmond was exposed on a central question about the referendum and an independent scotland 's currency . ' i think what has been laid bare is that he has no plan , he has no answers , and i think a lot of people seeking to make up their minds in this referendum will be thinking this is just too big a risk when there 's no answer on the currency . ' mr darling hammered his rival over his plans for a currency if scots back independence in the referendum . mr darling added : ` what 's happening is the closer we get to polling day , the more people are making their minds up and saying no thanks to the risks and costs of independence , and seeing the advantages that we can have . ` we 're not complacent , but i 'm increasingly confident that we 're going to win this . ' the findings come less than a week since yes scotland chiefs said a survation poll for the scottish mail on sunday put them ` within touching distance of success on september 18 ' . but the new figures suggest that even convincing every undecided voter to back separation may not be enough for victory . according to the poll , 49 per cent of men plan to vote no , with 41 per cent in favour of independence . among women , 52 per cent plan to reject separation -- up six points in a week -- and only 33 per cent said they will vote yes . younger voters aged 16 to 24 have also overwhelmingly swung behind the no camp , with 60 per cent now in favour of the union -- up from 43 per cent last sunday . there are also more supporters of the union than opponents in most regions of scotland , including the key battleground of glasgow . labour leader ed miliband said he believes it has been ` laid bare ' that alex salmond ` has no plan ' asked about tuesday 's tv debate , survation found that 65 per cent of the 1,010 respondents had watched the show . of those who saw the live clash , 53 per cent believe mr darling won , compared to just 28 per cent who picked mr salmond . even among those planning to vote yes to independence , the first minister was seen as the victor by fewer than two-thirds of respondents . asked if the debate had changed how they intend to vote , 13 per cent said they were more likely to back separation , but 22 per cent said they were more likely to cross the ` no ' box on the ballot paper . mr salmond can take some comfort in his personal ratings figures , with 39 per cent of scots satisfied with the way he is doing his job as first minister , compared to just 19 per cent who are satisfied with david cameron 's job as prime minister . mr salmond was also considered the best representative for yes scotland by 32 per cent of voters , with only 23 per cent picking his deputy miss sturgeon . a yes scotland spokesman said : ` the poll shows most scots agree with us that the westminster parties are bluffing on currency - and a majority want an independent scotland to keep the pound , which is exactly what will happen . ` the polls will always fluctuate , but what they all show is that support for yes is well above 40 per cent - and we are very confident our positive message that a yes vote is scotland 's one opportunity to protect the nhs , create more jobs here and guarantee that scotland no longer gets landed with tory governments we reject , will win a majority on september 18 .
