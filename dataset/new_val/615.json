' farrell said she did n't tell anyone what had happened for years . ` the first five to seven years after it happened , i was scared , ' she told the radio station . ' i was petrified , because i was young and in speedskating , and i was knocking on the door to the junior national team , then the senior national team , and i did n't want to do anything to jeopardize that . ` then , ' she added , ` there was a period of my life when i did n't say anything because i realized i was hurt , and i was broken . ` and it took a long time and a lot of work and some pretty dark times to come to grips with it and put myself together .
