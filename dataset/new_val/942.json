{"text": "there was an hour of daylight left in the omani desert when we hopped into the land cruiser . our guide , zubair , revved the engine - in another life he might have been a rally driver - and off we set . ` dune bashing ! ' cried zubair , encouraged by squawks of delight from our youngest daughter , aged ten . down and dirty in the dust : oman is a great place to try the very modern motorised pastime of dune-bashing . oman 's wahiba sands are classic desert terrain - the sort you get in a david lean film or one of those ` parched man crawls towards oasis ' newspaper cartoons . hillocks of sand stretched to the horizon . what was most striking was the colours , at once uniform and subtly different . the sand was all yellow , of course , but there were valleys of brown and black , too , lengthening as the golden sun dropped . zubair drove with gusto . we surged over and through the dunes . it was like skiing . ` snowplough ! ' i yelled when we seemed to be going down an incline far too steeply - and the car , thrillingly , was skidding sideways , throwing out a high spray of sand . where desert meets water : the omani capital muscat has a picturesque charm and an undiscovered vibe . our children cackled with laughter . zubair grinned broadly . my wife screamed . the moment we stepped out of the 4x4 , there came a contrast : complete , refreshing silence as we sat on the dune tops and watched the sun set on this astonishing landscape . this was the reason i 'd dug deep into the family savings and chosen oman for a week 's holiday over new year . it lived up to every expectation . the sultanate of oman , long an ally of britain , lies east of saudi arabia . to its south is troubled yemen . british airways flights from heathrow take seven hours to reach the omani capital muscat . for the first four days , we had the company of speed-merchant zubair . he took us to the fortified town of nizwa , where a splendidly busy and smelly livestock market is held on fridays . the nut sellers in the souk had copped on to the idea of overcharging western tourists -- when my wife asked for a small bag of cashews , she was charged the omani rial equivalent of # 3 . ` you should have haggled , ' i said . she told me she would have felt mean . ` they expect and enjoy haggling , ' insisted zubair . nizwa has a restored fort that could have been the setting for carry on up the khyber . i was half expecting to find kenneth williams round the next turret . a solid day 's work : fishing is still an important part of life in the waterfront muttrah district of muscat . even better than nizwa 's fort was the one at jabrin , where a 17th-century sultan reclined with dates , concubines and political worries . his reception room had hidey holes from which his henchmen could pounce to slay visitors . and his fortifications had gizmos worthy of james bond : false steps on stairs down where attackers might plunge to their deaths , and ` killing holes ' through which boiling-hot date syrup could be poured . the beautiful sun and moon room , meanwhile , was cleverly designed to keep the ruler cool by day and silver-lit by night . arid oman 's mountains are a purpling grey , and water is precious . where the irrigation projects have not yet reached , you see blue water lorries labouring up roads . government infrastructure work is everywhere . since 1970 , the country has been wrenched from medieval times into the 21st century , yet its people remain gracious and attractively modest . although western tourists are welcomed , women are urged to dress discreetly in the streets -lrb- no short skirts , low-cut tops or bare shoulders -rrb- . pleased to meet you : though a different prospect to dubai , oman is a place that offers a warm welcome . nor would you ever go to oman for a western stag night - alcohol is not plentiful . we spent a night on the country 's tallest mountain , 9,800 ft jebel shams , which has a not-so-mini ` grand canyon ' . our accommodation at the view camp was odd - freezing-cold , prefab huts with mod-con bathrooms worthy of a london hotel . but true to its name , it had a fine view of the plain below . the nearby village of misfat was a delight , an oasis perched on a hill with banana trees and palms . my wife was so enchanted by one deep-gorge wadi we visited that she has kept drawing pictures of it since we got home . in the desert , we stayed at another camp where the sleeping quarters were bedouin-style tents , and evening entertainment was provided by a discordant band of bongo drummers and overweight dancing ladies . for supper , the staff produced a side of spiced lamb that had been cooking for 24 hours . gosh , it was cold that night . but our children found it all fascinating - and they even got to grips with a few hesitant words of arabic . meeting the local wildlife : it is almost impossible to travel through oman without spotting a camel or two . the least interesting part of the trip was when we returned towards muscat and had a few nights at the opulent -lrb- but pricey -rrb- al waha hotel . great pools , comfortable rooms , but we could have been in western europe , complete with a clientele of bored white bankers and their pouting girlfriends . we did manage to escape into the city , however , and visit the souk , with its goodly whiff of frankincense , the fish market -lrb- rather different smells there -rrb- and the grand mosque , which was completed in 2001 . the chandelier in the mosque 's main chamber has more than 1,000 bulbs - just think of the electricity bills ! the mosque complex , which can accommodate 20,000 worshippers , is a monument to cultural and national self-confidence in a country blessed with rich natural resources and a lingering arabian mystique . abercrombie & kent -lrb- 01242 854 133 , www.abercrombiekent.co.uk -rrb- offers eight nights in oman from # 1,675 per adult , based on two sharing . children under 12 are an additional # 1,025 pp based on two sharing , including return flights with british airways .", "summary": " dubai 's next-door neighbour has plenty to offer as a holiday destination .   dune-bashing - driving on huge piles of sand in a 4wd - is a key attraction .   muscat , the omani capital , is an intriguing city of history , culture and luxury .
