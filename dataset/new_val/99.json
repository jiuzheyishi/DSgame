{"text": "there is no shortage of impressive houses in harpenden , the commuter-belt hertfordshire town that 's home to city hedge-fund types , high-flying lawyers and the odd footballer . but none is in the same league as flowton priory , a 500-year-old grade ii listed tudor mansion that has had more care and attention lavished upon it than a king 's mistress . its ancient timber frame , oriel windows and ornate herringbone brickwork are easy to fall in love with , as businessman and racing driver david pinkney did back in the 1980s when a friend of his , the former golf champion ken brown , pointed it out . tudor manor : flowton priory , a 500-year-old grade ii listed tudor mansion in harpenden , hertfordshire has been put on the market for # 8.75 million . at that time flowton priory was n't for sale , but david never forgot it . years later , he moved to monaco , but asked ken to let him know if it ever came on the market . when it did , in 1994 , david put in a sealed-bid offer and won by a margin of just # 4,000 . the house needed renovating , and over the next 15 years , david gave it five-star treatment . he carried out major repairs to the roof , completely rewired and replumbed the property , increased the number of bedrooms from five to seven and added new bathrooms . he landscaped the three acres of grounds and built an elegant glazed summerhouse from which the priory can be admired in all its elizabethan glory . ` i have given this house everything i could , ' says david . ` it 's such a beautiful and special building that i wanted everything that went into it to be of the very best quality . i have spent an absolute fortune , but the house has deserved it . ' it is certainly an appropriate setting for the motor-racing trophies that fill the shelves . until 2010 , david was a leading name in the popular british touring car championship , which pits high-performance versions of ordinary saloons -- hondas , renaults , fords -- against each other at silverstone , brands hatch and other well-known circuits . sprawling gardens : the immaculate gardens at flowton priory in green hertfordshire comes complete with a pond . unique charm : one of the impressive bedrooms at flowton priory , still keeping with the mansions tudor style . for brighter days : in addition to the seven bedrooms , flowton priory also boasts a summer house . flowton priory is in west common , on the edge of harpenden . but it was n't always in this spot . its origins are hidden in the name . for 400 years , the priory was in the village of flowton in suffolk . in the 1920s , its owner , a member of a wealthy brewing family , had it taken down , transported west and reassembled . a tree-lined drive leads up to the metal security gates , through which you can see the house , with its nine chimneys , set in immaculate formal gardens with box hedging and lollipop-shaped ligustrum trees . a walk through the heavy oak door into the entrance hall with an enormous chandelier takes visitors to a 36ft drawing room on the right . driving force : david pinkney in his racing gear . its oak-panelled walls and huge stone inglenook fireplace date from tudor times , as do many of the small-pane leaded windows . some contain beautiful 16th century stained glass , with one showing the coat of arms of cardinal wolsey , henry viii 's lord chancellor , who was born in suffolk . down the passage from the drawing room is the pink-walled dining room with a vast antique mirror reflecting its 12-seater polished dining table . ` we 've had some fantastic christmases here , ' says david . no less impressive is the 20ft square kitchen , installed by david himself . its vaulted , beamed ceiling is supported by enormously thick timber pillars either side of a marble-topped island , above which hangs another giant chandelier . beyond , is a sitting room , used as a den by david 's nine-year-old daughter , and a large , well-equipped utility room . a door leads out on to a pergola-covered terrace complete with a large circular dining table and barbecue . a shiny black hot tub is even equipped with a dvd player and a tv screen that rises at the touch of a button . a second staircase leads up from this end of the house to two bedrooms and a bathroom , creating a self-contained wing for guests or staff . the main 16th century staircase takes visitors to the majestic master bedroom and a bathroom . two more bedrooms , one each for david 's daughters , the eldest of whom is at university , and another bathroom complete this floor . david spent years collecting furniture and fittings for the house . unfortunately , he can no longer enjoy the fruits of his labours . he and his wife have separated , so flowton priory must be sold . it is on the market with savills at # 8.75 million . will david look for another project ? ` no , i could n't do anything like this again , ' he insists . ` it was a fantastic experience , but it takes it out of you . the house i 'm planning to move to is a modern four-bedroom place -- very nice but nothing like this . ` i 'm proud that i 've helped preserve a piece of english history , though .
