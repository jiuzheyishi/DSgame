' an attempt to drop water and safety equipment had to be abandoned on sunday night because there were too many refugees in the drop zone . last night 's drop is the second round of aid to thousands of people trapped on a mountain as they flee advancing militants in iraq . the government said the uk 's second aid drop included 3,180 reusable water purification containers filled with 15,900 litres of clean water and 816 solar lamps . british voters narrowly support taking part in air strikes against islamic state fighters sweeping through northern iraq slaughtering non-muslims . the government has refused to rule out joining a us military assault to protect civilians fleeing the jihadists - but has insisted its focus is on getting aid to refugees . but a yougov poll for the sun has revealed support for uk troops to bomb the fanatics . the revelation comes as the raf geared up to send tornado jets into iraq -- but only to monitor the humanitarian situation on the ground . some 37 per cent of britons approve of the raf taking part in air strikes -- while 36 per cent disapprove and the remaining 27 per cent saying they do n't know . last august 50 per cent of the country was opposed to missile strikes on syria -- with just 25 per cent in support . one of britain 's most senior generals accused the ` commitment-phobic ' government of being ` terrified ' of intervening in the iraq crisis before next year 's general election . general sir richard shirreff told the times : ` the longer we sit on our hands and prevaricate , the more dangerous the situation is going to become ' . but speaking after the cobra committee meeting yesterday , mr hammond rejected calls for parliament to be recalled to discuss the crisis and said there were no plans for british military involvement . ` we do n't envisage a combat role at the present time , ' he said . david cameron , who is on holiday in portugal , has been urged to call mps back from their summer break to discuss the crisis and he has also faced pressure - including from former head of the army lord dannatt - to consider a military intervention . downing street said the prime minister was ` very much engaged ' with the situation despite being abroad and a recall of parliament was ` not on the cards ' . but the prime minister is facing increasing pressure to join us military action against isis forces . tory mp mark pritchard said it was time for the uk to take direct military action - through air strikes and drone attacks but not ground forces - and predicted a recalled commons would vote in favour of the escalation . ` the international community can pour as much aid into the region as its likes , ' he wrote for the politicshome website . ` but unless islamic state fighters are killed and removed from the battlefield , they will go on killing and committing further atrocities . ` the uk must not walk by on the other side and that is why overnight news that raf tornadoes are once again going to fly in iraqi airspace is welcome . ` however , this intervention needs to be in an unequivocal combat role , not just in an intelligence , surveillance and targeting role . ' inaction at this stage would be ' a greater risk than positive action ' , he suggested . displaced people from the minority yazidi sect , fleeing violence from forces loyal to the islamic state in sinjar town , walk towards the syrian border , on the outskirts of sinjar mountain , near the syrian border town of elierbeh yesterday . a displaced iraqi man from the yazidi community carries his daughter as they cross the iraqi-syrian border at the fishkhabur crossing , in northern iraq yesterday . iraqi kurds and iraqi christians hold-up signd thanking the usa during a demonstration in front of the us general consulate in arbil , the capital of the autonomous kurdish region of northern iraq yesterday . he urged the government to support any effort to secure a united nations security council resolution in support of military action . a proposed french resolution was too weak and ` in danger of being just another un platitude whilst toddlers choke on their own blood ' , he said . mr pritchard said the different circumstances suggested there would be no repeat of mps ' refusal last year to endorse military intervention in syria . ' i suspect this time parliament would vote for decisive , precision , and targeted military action in iraq , with clearly defined rules of engagement .
