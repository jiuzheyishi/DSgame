' rowntree pinpointed hooker rory best and lock paul o'connel as key ` chokers ' in the irish team . the choke tackle involves a defender wrapping his arms around the neck and chest of the ball-carrier -- often one who is isolated and too upright -- and preventing him from going to ground . with assistance from team-mates , this can lead to the ball being stripped or a maul forming , which can produce a penalty to the defending team if the opposition collapse it in their bid retrieve the ball . if a maul forms and the ball does n't emerge , the defending team will win the put-in at the subsequent scrum . meanwhile england plan to use ireland 's favourite weapon -- the choke tackle -- against their rivals on sunday . while the irish long ago mastered the art of holding up isolated runners to win turnovers and penalties , now england have acquired the knack , led by the recalled wasps captain in their back row , james haskell . the order from lancaster and his assistants will be to carry on choking , but not to overplay it . ` it 's a powerful tool if a team can do it well -- stand you up there and quickly get mass under the body , ' said forwards coach graham rowntree . ` we 've done it more of late . we 've got a couple of personnel in our team now who are good at it and maybe were n't in our team six to 10 months ago . but it 's been around for six years . you 've got to employ it at the right time . we encourage our guys that they can choke , but they have to do it appropriately , at the right time . if you do it wrong you just get danced back for five metres , it goes into a ruck and you 've lost territory . but if you get it right , it 's a hell of a tactic . ' jack nowell is choke tackled by dave kearney -lrb- left -rrb- and gordon d'arcy at twickenham last season . best puts in a crunching hit on france scrum half rory kockott during his side 's victory against france . o'connell -lrb- centre -rrb- worked with rowntree during the 2009 and 2013 british and irish lions tours . rowntree initially refused to identify the leading english exponents of the ploy but eventually mentioned haskell , adding : ` it 's not limited to him . billy twelvetrees won a crucial penalty at the end of the wales game with the same tactic . ' rowntree pointed to three key irish chokers -- two of whom are available to face england . ` for ireland , best , heaslip and o'connell are all good at it , ' he said , before paying tribute to the young england lock who will go toe to toe with paul o'connell : george kruis of saracens . injuries to lawes and joe launchbury left the coaches with a problem but kruis has been the solution , first in the autumn and lately in victories over wales and italy . he is making a powerful case for a world cup place . george kruis has been outstanding for england following injuries to courtney lawes and joe launchbury . kruis , 25 , revealed that when o'connell was leading the lions in south africa six years ago he was cheering from the stands as a teenage prospect on a playing stint in cape town . asked if he ever imagined that one day he would find himself up against o'connell , kruis said : ` it was a very distant dream . i was rather underweight and not the best rugby player . i weighed less than our backs coach . ' a notable victory was secured by campaigners in the house of lords on tuesday that will curb online ticket touting ahead of the rugby world cup and the ashes series this summer . proposals for a provision in the consumer act -- to ensure that tickets traded online include block , row and seat number plus the face value -- had previously been rejected by the house of commons . but the persistence of the house of lords , backed by cricket 's ecb and rugby 's rfu ruling bodies , led to the government 's capitulation on the issue yesterday . the new regulations will be in place in time for the start of the ashes series in july .", "summary": " jonny may was released back to gloucester on tuesday night .   ireland have been prominent users of the ` choke tackle ' in recent seasons .   earlier this week , wales defence coach shaun edwards claimed that the choke tackle is dangerous and should be banned .   england have begun to utilise the tactic in recent games .   wasps flanker james haskell has led the way with his tackling technique .   england forwards coach graham rowntree praises paul o'connell .
