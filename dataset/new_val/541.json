{"text": "sales pitch : michael mcindoe as a wolves player in 2007 . it is claimed he approached potential investors on behalf of the scheme . dozens of top premiership footballers are said to have lost millions of pounds after the collapse of an investment scheme associated with a former star . millionaire players , including several household names , are said to have handed over cash after being promised a return of 20 per cent a month on their capital . however , the scheme collapsed late last year and the players are now anxiously awaiting news of their money . one international star invested # 1million in the scheme , according to a source . it is claimed that former wolverhampton wanderers and coventry city star michael mcindoe approached potential investors on behalf of the scheme , but there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing on his part . mr mcindoe previously dated glamour model helena fletcher , who appeared as a contestant on bbc gameshow total wipeout in 2009 . companies house records show mr mcindoe , 32 , became director of a number of businesses last year , including one business aimed at footballers which promised exclusive access to nightclubs and private jets . a source revealed that mr mcindoe began approaching stars in the midlands at the start of last year , claiming it was a ` guaranteed-return investment scheme ' . in april , an invitation-only party was held at a country house hotel in warwickshire featuring a performance by x factor winner alexandra burke . there is no suggestion she had any involvement in the scheme . as part of the scheme , syndicates were set up in different areas of the country , including the north-west and london . on the first day of each month , one nominated member of each syndicate would travel to a hotel in london 's west end to collect the payouts . but in november the payments dried up and mr mcindoe has not been seen since . a source said : ` the scheme was sold . to people as a guaranteed-return investment scheme . i personally know . 20 players who have put money in . you got 20 per cent back each month . and could withdraw your initial investment at any time . ` so if you invested # 100,000 , you got # 20,000 back a month and you could get your # 100,000 out . game on : mcindoe 's ex-girlfriend helena fletcher appeared as a contestant on total wipeout in 2009 . ` players did not ask questions as most knew another who had invested and was getting regular returns . ` the investors received regular monthly payments up until november but since then they have not been paid . now , players are falling out with each other . they 're blaming each other for giving them bad advice . ' the source added that mr mcindoe had recently contacted all of those demanding their money back and promised to repay the cash . there are now fears the investments were made in a ponzi-style scheme , similar to the one run by us fraudster bernie madoff . in a ponzi scheme , money from new investors is simply redistributed to existing members , rather than being invested to generate returns . that means such schemes eventually collapse . a football agent , who represents a number of premiership players , said : ` some got into the scheme early and did very well and got their money back and the interest . ` there 's a player with # 1 million in that scheme , a player with # 500,000 , a player with # 300,000 , and there 's some with # 5,000 and # 10,000 . ` it 's nothing more than greed . i 've heard this guy has got to walk around with protection . people have been to scotland to find his family . ` the players ca n't go to the police . what player is going to stand up in court and say ,  excuse me , your honour , i 've just lost # 50,000 of my savings  ? ` they 're going to look like idiots and the club could ask them what they 're doing . ' a financial expert who advises footballers said : ` we have known about it for a while and have kept our clients well away from it . ' born in the tough sighthill district of edinburgh , mr mcindoe spoke openly as a young player about his battle to overcome drink and gambling problems . nevertheless , he went on to enjoy a successful career , scoring 80 league and cup goals for ten clubs . sources say mr mcindoe was a charismatic and popular figure among other players . he left coventry last summer and retired to concentrate on his business career . fans reported seeing him driving his bentley around leamington spa , warwickshire , where he and a girlfriend shared an upmarket flat in a large townhouse . however , other residents told the mail on sunday mr mcindoe appeared to have left the property last year in a hurry . yesterday , mr mcindoe 's mother and brother declined to comment . mr mcindoe did not respond to messages left on his mobile .", "summary": " former wolverhampton wanderers player michael mcindoe ` approached potential investors on behalf of the scheme '   millionaire players ` promised 20 % - a-month return on their capital ' "}
