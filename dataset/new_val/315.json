{"text": "rebuilding an icon is no easy task , especially one so revered as lara croft . rhianna pratchett - daughter of discworld author terry - talks us through the process and why organisations such as little miss geek are vital in getting more women involved in gaming .1 . what made you want to work on the tomb raider game ? rhianna : it 's lara ! how could i not ? after working on a couple of female protagonists in the past -lrb- faith in mirror 's edge and nariko/kai in heavenly sword -rrb- it seemed like the perfect next step . the fact that the game was a reboot , and i would get to stamp a little bit of myself onto the new lara was also very enticing . reimagining a 16 year-old gaming icon like lara croft really is a once in a lifetime challenge . 2 . with the industry evolving , how have demands on writers changed over the years ? rhianna : when i first got into the industry 15 years ago as a games journalist , no one was really talking about games writing . it was still being done behind the scenes , but it was n't getting much focus or attention , either from the press or developers/publishers themselves . call for action : pratchett wants to see more female faces in games and the industry as a whole . nor was the industry really embracing professional writers as standard . in the years that followed the industry did start to remedy this and get more experienced writers onboard . unfortunately , it was often very late in the development process , when all they could be was something akin to a narrative paramedic . these days it 's got better , but the industry is still trying to work out how to incorporate writers and narrative designers into the development process and establish the best working practices . however , this is a two-way street and therefore more writers need to learn about the unique challenges and limitations that exist in writing for games . they also need to really understand the benefits of utilising the entirety of a game to express the narrative , not just traditional cinematic methods . 3 . what is your favourite thing about lara croft ? does the industry need more female stars ? rhianna : i like the fact that alongside the bad-a ** ery , she 's an intelligent , archaeology nerd with a real understanding how our history shapes us . yes , the industry does need more female protagonists , but it is also in dire need of more protagonists who fall outside the whitey-mcstubbly format . the industry has become far too reliant on male , white , straight , mid-20s , gravelly voiced , short hair and stubble covered heroes . we need to develop much greater diversity across the board when it comes to gender , ethnicity , age , sexual orientation and ability . 4 . what inspired you when writing tomb raider ? rhianna : researching the period and the mythology we draw upon was fascinating . we also looked towards real world tales of survival -lrb- such as aron ralston 's story and the andes survivors -rrb- for inspiration . this really is a story about the enduring nature of the human spirit and will to survive . 5 . any games you 've been signed up to work on in the future ? rhianna : yes . but nothing i can talk about yet . sorry ! at what time does your writing come in at the time of game development ? rhianna : this really depends on what kind of game is being developed , how important narrative is to the experience and whether the team behind it are used to working with writers . writers are not normally involved at the start of the process -lrb- which is generally focused on design and gameplay mechanics -rrb- but come in later to work on story structure , character development and script . built from the ground up : lara is still recognisable however there have been some drastic changes in both her appearance and personality . this can be anywhere from one to two years into a three to four year production cycle . ideally writers and narrative designers should be included much earlier in the process , where they can be of most benefit . however , although the industry is slowly getting used to fitting narrative professionals into games development , we 're still going through a bit of a ` square-peg in a round hole ' phase . what was the hardest aspect of re-writing a character as popular as lara and did you consult with fans at all ? rhianna : i did n't come into the process until about a year into development , so i 'm not sure what happened in the early stages . however , i know that crystal did feel obligated to innovate and refresh the franchise for their fans , and not just repeat what had been done before . certainly depicting lara at a time when she did n't have the guns , gadgets and knowhow to easily get herself out of every situation , was quite risky . fans are n't used to seeing lara like that . in fact we 're not used to seeing any videogames character express sentiments like fear , uncertainty or remorse . however , when you 're dealing with a character 's origin story , you need to show where they 've came from and not just where they finished up . we wanted players to experience that evolution for themselves . were you a massive fan of the early games yourself ? rhianna : i played and enjoyed the first game and a little of the second . the launch of tomb raider iii was actually my first experience of the games industry . but somewhere down the line i lost interest in the franchise . i felt that the sex-symbol nature of lara became overplayed by the wider media and that had somewhat obscured the games themselves . what influence did your dad have on your love of gaming ? rhianna : dad really kick-started it . he was always into electronics , computers and robotics and introduced me to my first game - mazogs on the sinclair zx81 . i was hooked ! we would often play games together -- he would play the game and i would sit beside him , with a pencil and graph paper , drawing the maps and guiding him . is there a part of the game you are particularly proud of ? rhianna : i 'm glad that we got to show a different side of a character that everyone thought they knew . one of the things that i love about the game , which has absolutely nothing to do with me , is the concept art , including the box art for the game -- it 's beautiful , but not sexualised , strong , but also characterful . it really typifies the direction we 're taking lara . alone and stranded : tomb raider explores lara croft 's origins and has received wide-spread critical acclaim . 6 . how is little miss geek helping girls be inspired to have a career in games design ? rhianna : a lot of young girls do n't realise how diverse the career opportunities are in games development . many think that you need elite math skills and a vast knowledge of all things tech to work in games , and have n't thought about avenues like design , producing , art , writing or composing . initiatives such as the ones started by little miss geek are essential for getting young girls engaged and excited about games design , narrative design and coding . giving them hands-on experiences with level editors and watching them create and build levels for themselves is very rewarding . their faces light up . suddenly they 've discovered a whole new world that 's out there for the taking . it 's empowering for them . little miss geek wants to inspire the next generation of young girls to become tech pioneers and to cause nationwide change from the ground up . for more information visit : www.littlemissgeek.org . follow us on twitter : @dailymailgames and on facebook : daily mail games .", "summary": " writer calls for more diverse spectrum of in-game heroes .   wanted to move lara away from ` overplayed sex symbol ' image .   views video-game industry as a way of 'em powering women ' "}
