{"text": "young parliamentary researchers last night claimed their parents would be ` horrified ' if they knew the lurid truth of what goes on at the ` palace of sexminster ' . one aide said there were rumours of mps and peers using date rape drugs on junior activists , or paying for abortions after getting their staff pregnant . others claimed former ministers had been accused of manhandling women on the commons terrace and that sex acts and drug-taking regularly took place in toilets . yesterday there were calls for an urgent overhaul of westminster 's late-night drinking culture to prevent more damaging sleaze scandals from engulfing parliament . the palace of westminster - or the ` palace of sexminster ' as it 's been dubbed after a string of scandals - is rife with rumours of mps acting inappropriately towards their young staff members . the comments come two days after nigel evans , the former deputy speaker , was unanimously cleared of a series of sexual assaults . the case shone a light on the drink-fuelled culture at westminster -- which has been labelled the ` palace of sexminster ' after a string of sexual harassment allegations . a study released at the end of the trial also found that a third of researchers said they had been subjected to harassment . the claims come just two days after former deputy speaker nigel evans was unanimously cleared at the end of his trial for a string of sexual offences . yesterday the tory researcher who gave evidence against mr evans decided to lift the lid on the reality of life in ` the westminster bubble ' . he said colleagues -- many of whom were straight out of university -- were often so desperate to progress in their careers that they did not report sexual assaults . the 35-year-old , who had claimed mr evans had put his hand down his trousers at a conservative party conference in 2003 but was brought to court despite insisting he was not a victim , added : ` i think an awful lot of parents of people who work in parliament would be horrified if they saw the reality of what life in the westminster bubble is like . ' the tory activist , who is married , added : ` parliament needs to get a grip on this alcohol-fuelled sleaze before it brews into something worse than the expenses scandal that destroys all trust in mps . there is a problem and the politicians need to act . otherwise a story will come out that starts an onslaught that makes the accusations we have heard in the last few weeks seem like small fry . ' he said politicians work long hours away from their families and are surrounded by ` impressionable straight-out-of-university ambitious people ' . ` it 's a recipe for an awful lot of borderline people to be pushed over the edge and unfortunately that gives all mps a bad name , ' he said . he did not know if rumours of mps using date rape drugs and paying for abortions were true , but said he heard allegations ` all of the time ' . ` most of these will be largely untrue , but there will be some reason why that rumour started in the first place , ' he added . ` i think the sleazy nature of mps hanging around with people who are just out of university , it does not look good . ` we 're now living in an age when everyone 's got a camera in their pocket . at some point someone is going to take a photo in the strangers ' bar of someone behaving in a way they should n't and it 's going to balloon and some very serious allegations will come forward , and by that point it will be too late and parliament will have to act . ' chief whip sir george young , left , wrote to mps asking them to sign up to a code of ethics regarding the treatment of staff , while the speaker , john bercow , right , has set up a helpline for staff . he is now calling for bars in parliament to have 9pm curfews for researchers . ` you 've got bars where people know each other , relatively cheap alcohol , and a lot of people who are up for a good gossip and like a bit of scandal , ' he added . ` a lot of people like that atmosphere , but it is clearly causing problems . ` some parliamentary staff do actively encourage mps to behave in a certain way , and the only reason mps behave in that way is because on some occasions that behaviour may have resulted in  success  . ' another man who made allegations about mr evans , who was unanimously cleared on all counts by a jury at preston crown court on thursday , said there was no proper way to deal with complaints . he told newsnight : ` the strange thing about parliament is that they make the laws but they do n't act like any other place of business . tory mp sir bob stewart argued there was no need for a voluntary code of conduct . ` researchers and mps ' staff do n't have an hr department . our bosses are technically self-employed and we 're all small businesses so even though we work in one big building together there was no mechanism to deal with this problem , and there still is n't . ' even last night there were rumours circulating parliament that a former minister , who until recently was married , was reported to party whips after making a pass at a straight male mp . two male researchers , now mps , also allegedly fought after one said his drink was spiked and woke to find that he was being raped by the other . conservative party chiefs yesterday released a code of conduct for mps . sir george young , the chief whip , wrote to mps to urge them to sign up to the code , which said staff should be treated with ` dignity , respect and courtesy ' and should be ` free from any form of discrimination , victimisation , harassment or bullying ' . they should also not have to endure ` unwelcome behaviour and inappropriate language ' . but it has been criticised for telling mps that grievances are ` entirely a matter for you to handle ' . one researcher told the mail : ` how is that going to work ? if you have a problem with your boss , you do n't exactly feel comfortable with telling them about it , particularly if your career is entirely in their hands . ' however , a tory source said staff would still be able to go to a ` pastoral care unit ' and would also be encouraged to speak to party whips . commons speaker john bercow has also set up a helpline for staff . tory mp sir bob stewart argued there was no need for a voluntary code of conduct and laughed it off , saying : ` i 've tried my best to behave . ' he told the bbc daily politics that boorish behaviour did not dominate the commons , adding that ` people act out of line in any profession ' . on thursday , a channel 4 news investigation named ` the palace of sexminster ' found nearly a quarter of researchers from all parties had witnessed or heard about sex harassment .", "summary": " palace of westminster has been dubbed ` palace of sexminster ' after a string of scandals .   rumours of mps acting inappropriately are rife , even accusations of using date rape drugs and paying for abortions after getting staff pregnant .   claims come two days after nigel evans was cleared of sexual assault .   study claims a third of westminster aides have witnesses harrassment .   there are calls for the drinking culture to be reined in .
