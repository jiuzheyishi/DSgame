{"text": "a u.s. health authority poster claiming ebola can be transmitted by droplets through the air has been removed from its website , prompting concerns the deadly virus can be caught through a sneeze . the poster , which caused alarm because it seems to go against medical advice that the virus can not be transmitted by air , said ebola could be contracted if someone came into contact with objects that had been sneezed on by people who were infected . the centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- poster said droplets , such as those from a sneeze , carried the virus and could remain infectious on surfaces for up to several hours . the cdc image which shows their warning that droplets from a sneeze could transmit ebola . debate about government-imposed quarantines for people exposed to the virus has grown over the past few weeks , as isolated cases are diagnosed in the u.s. and it continues to spread across west africa . so far , more than 4,900 people have been killed - the vast majority in liberia , sierra leone and guinea - in the deadliest outbreak of the virus on record . the cdc poster , now removed , stated : ` droplet spread happens when the germs traveling inside droplets that are coughed or sneezed from a sick person enter the eyes , nose or mouth of another person , ' the new york post reported . it warned someone could become infected should they accidentally touch the sneeze droplets and then touch their eyes , nose or mouth . today , the cdc internet page dedicated to the subject stated it was being updated . it read : ` the what 's the difference between infections spread through air or by droplets ? fact sheet is being updated and is currently unavailable . please visit cdc.gov / ebola for up-to-date information on ebola . ' medical experts have repeatedly stated the ebola virus is not transmittable by air . it is contracted when someone comes into contact with the body fluids , such as urine , saliva , sweat , feces , vomit , breast milk and semen , of a person who is infected . an image of the ebola virus , which has killed nearly 5,000 people in west africa and recently reached the u.s. . but experts have repeatedly warned of the frightening possibility the ebola virus could mutate and become airborne . although the risk of it doing so is thought to be low , experts can not discount it entirely . two weeks ago leading scientist lord robert winston warned the risk of ebola spreading could dramatically increase if it becomes airborne . in a house of lords debate , the fertility doctor demanded answers from the government about how closely they were monitoring the virus . lord winston said : ` we know that viruses mutate , we know that the ebola virus can mutate . ` we know perfectly well that it is not airborne at the moment , and we know that the pharyngeal and upper respiratory tract cells are unlikely to harbour the virus . ` however , can you assure us that people are looking at the risk of mutation of this virus so that we can make certain that its mode of transmission does not change ? ' and the chief of the un 's ebola mission , anthony banbury , also warned earlier this month that the virus could become airborne . he said aid workers were racing against time to control the epidemic in case it mutates in a ` nightmare scenario ' . health workers in liberia pictured suiting up to continue working around people who have caught the virus .", "summary": " cdc poster claimed ebola virus could be spread via contaminated droplets .   droplets could be spread by sneezing , and virus lives on surfaces for hours .   experts say ebola only transmitted by contact bodily fluids such as blood .   cdc pulled the poster from its website , says it is ` being updated ' "}
