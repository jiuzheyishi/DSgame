{"text": "the united nations sparked fury today after launching an unprecedented inquiry into britain 's treatment of the disabled . the un committee on the rights of persons with disabilities launched a formal probe into whether this country has committed ` grave or systemic violations ' of the rights of disabled people . tory mps tonight branded the investigation ` politically motivated ' and said britain 's record on help for disabled people was among the best in the world . scroll down for video . a spokesman for iain duncan smith 's work and pensions department said the uk spends # 50 billion a year on disabled people . the focus on britain for the latest inquiry raised eyebrows given the other countries represented on the committee . its members include uganda , kenya , thailand , and tunisia . the investigation is the latest in a series of interventions into british domestic policy by the united nations , which have provoked fury among ministers . earlier this year a group of un poverty ` ambassadors ' attacked government welfare reforms , and last year the un 's controversial brazilian housing ` rapporteur ' raquel rolnik , a former marxist dubbed the ` brazil nut ' , criticised cuts to housing benefit . tory mp michael ellis said : ` this politically motivated loony left decision brings the un organisation in to disrepute . ` at a time when there are grave international crises around the world and when in dozens of countries around the world there are no benefits available , this absurd decision is made to attack our country which rightly does more than almost any other to protect the rights of disadvantaged people from all walks of life . ' brazilian un poverty ambassador raquel rolnik criticised the british government 's ` bedroom tax ' earlier this year - sparking anger among tory mps . fellow conservative philip davies said : ` these people at the un are idiots , frankly . there 's no other way to describe them . ` this country has led the way in the support and rights that we give to disabled people -- such as through the disability discrimination act which was passed by a conservative government in 1995 . ` if the un drew up a list of countries in the world showing how much they gave to disabled people they would find the uk was the highest in the world . ` they are exposing the un for the completely useless organisation that it is . ' the investigation is officially confidential , but a former member of the committee confirmed its existence in a video posted on the internet . professor gabor gombos told a conference in galway , ireland : ` where the issue has been raised and the government did not really make effective actions to fix the situation ... it is a very high threshold thing , the violations should be grave and very systemic . ' the existence of the inquiry , which was reported by disability news service . the committee did not respond to requests by the mail for comment , but jorge araya , the committee 's secretary , told dns : ` inquiry proceedings ... of the optional protocol to the united nations convention on the rights of persons with disabilities , are confidential . ' miss rolnik sparked a furious reaction from work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith after she criticised the so-called ` bedroom tax ' . she also signed a letter from a group of poverty ` ambassadors ' criticising other welfare reforms designed to cut britain 's huge benefits bill and encourage unemployed people back in to work . another un inspector , south african feminist academic rashida manjoo , was crticised after she claimed britain had a culture of sexism worse than any other country in the world . the department for work and pensions also refused to comment on the inquiry , but pointed out the uk spends around # 50billion a year on disabled people . a spokesman said : ` all united nations inquiry processes are confidential . must . ` this government is committed to supporting disabled people and we continue to spend around # 50bn a year on disabled people and their services . ' for those aged between 16 and 64 , the disability living allowance -lrb- dla -rrb- - benefits given to disabled people to help them with daily activities and moving around - has now been replaced by the personal independence payment -lrb- pip -rrb- . unlike the previous payment , pip includes a face-to-face consultation with a heath worker to assess people 's ability at tasks such as washing and cooking , before scoring their abilities on a chart . this chart is then used to work out how much money they can receive , and regular check-ups are scheduled to ensure this is kept at the right level . in 2012 , there were over 3 million dla claimants in the uk , but the government estimates 600,000 fewer disabled people will qualify for pip by 2018 . the work capability assessment was also introduced for those claiming incapacity benefit , severe disablement allowance and income support on the grounds of illness or disability . this meant that almost two million people were assessed by health workers to see what sort of jobs they could perform and whether they were fit to work . those ruled unfit for work were then moved on to the new employment and support allowance and were given another exam , again using a points-based system , to decide how much support they qualified for .", "summary": " un committee on the rights of persons with disabilities has opened probe .   will check if there has been ` grave violations ' of rights of disabled people .   mps tonight branded the investigation ` politically motivated '   earlier this year a group of un ` ambassadors ' attacked uk welfare reforms .
