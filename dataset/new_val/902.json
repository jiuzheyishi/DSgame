65,750 between 1974 and 1980 . the trust invited representatives from pie and a group called paedophile action for liberation to a series of meetings in 1975 to discuss setting up a paedophile support group and publishing an information pamphlet about paedophilia . in 1977 the home office expressed ` some disquiet ' about the way in which the trust was carrying out its work , the report noted . in 1970 the albany trust funded the translation of the findings of a dutch government inquiry , known as the speijer report , which looked at lowering the age of consent for homosexuals . campaigner mary whitehouse alleged that pie obtained this english translation several years later and sold it for # 1 per copy . a second charity , release , which offered advice on issues including drugs , medical and housing problems , was given # 410,500 by the vsu between 1974 and 1984 via the princedale trust . in 1975 release moved to 1 elgin avenue in london . the same year release allowed pie to begin using the same address for correspondence . the home office report said it was ` impossible to determine ' whether vsu money given to the two charities was indirectly used to support pie 's work , although it noted no evidence was found to confirm that it did . a whitehall inquiry found ` clear evidence ' that # 476,250 was granted to the organisations while the home office was situated in its former location in petty france , westminster -lrb- above -rrb- . it also emerged that prosecutors decided in 1998 not to lay child abuse charges against liberal mp cyril smith -lrb- left -rrb- despite ruling they were likely to succeed and that former home secretary lord brittan -lrb- right -rrb- insisted allegations that he failed to deal properly with allegations of child abuse were completely without foundation . the report said the whistleblower 's account of seeing a home office document from about 1980 that listed a grant renewal of # 30,000 for pie was ` credible ' . but the review concluded that ` on the balance of probabilities ' no money was given to pie . simon danczuk , the labour mp for rochdale who exposed cyril smith 's abuse and led calls for a full inquiry into the alleged official cover-up of child abuse , said : ` this report raises as many questions as it answers about the home office 's use of public funds to support groups linked to the paedophile information exchange . ` this does little to end concerns about the home office 's handling of child sexual abuse allegations over many years . ` releasing the report on the same day that the home secretary announced a major public inquiry into these issues will make some people wonder whether there has been an attempt to bury its findings .
