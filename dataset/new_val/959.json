{"text": "arsenal must win the champions league this season , or their star man will surely want out . who knows what is going on in alexis sanchez 's mind but just put yourself in his boots for a second : what do you think is going on in his head when he takes a look at the premier league table ? during his little injury break i suspect he will be wondering whether he should be playing at a bigger club , a club capable of a genuine title challenge . alexis sanchez , pictured in action against brighton , may be wondering whether his future is at arsenal . the chile international has shined for the gunners so far this term , but the club are still outside the top four . he 's had the season of his life so far -- he 's been shining virtually every week for arsenal . yet when he looks at the table he sees that his team is not even in the top four . how will sanchez feel , having played so well , worked so hard , shown world-class quality , to see that those efforts have only managed to take arsenal to fifth in the table ? in the same way nobody really knows what was going on in diego costa 's mind last tuesday when he was putting his stamp on that capital one cup tie , i ca n't be sure what is going on in sanchez 's head . but i 'm guessing he will be feeling exasperated and frustrated , asking himself what he has to do to get this side challenging for the title . sanchez , pictured grabbing hold of team-mate mesut ozil , missed the 5-0 victory over aston villa on sunday . will sanchez be happy staying on the arsene wenger train where the destination is mediocrity central ? do n't get me wrong - i 'm certain arsenal will finish in the top four . and they 're still in the champions league where a kind draw could take them all the way to a final where anything can happen over 90 or 120 minutes . but if arsenal do n't win the champions league where will that leave sanchez ? will he be happy staying on the arsene wenger train -- destination mediocrity central , calling at low expectations junction and fourth place trophyville ? he 's bigger than that of course . he 's enjoying his football at arsenal , some might argue . just like he 'd enjoy his football at a club that wins big trophies . others will wonder how i can write this stuff after the gunners have just won 5-0 . it was against aston villa -- it 's standard behaviour for arsenal to batter weak teams more often than not . chuba akpom wins a penalty for arsenal after he is fouled by aston villa goalkeeper brad guzan . per mertesacker congratulates hector bellerin after the arsenal youngster scored his side 's fifth goal . theo walcott was also on target in the win for arsenal against a poor aston villa side at the emirates stadium . from the sidelines or sat in his living room sanchez would have heard the ` oles ' of the arsenal fans when their team was strolling to victory on sunday . he might think it 's brilliant from the fans ; or he might realise he 's at a club where standards and expectations are so low those fans are satisfied with a bit of keep ball when a terrible team comes to the emirates . quite what he made of the last 20 minutes of the game turning into a testimonial with everyone desperately passing to young chuba akpom hoping for him to score a goal is anyone 's guess . it 's all very sweet and nice from arsenal to look after a young player , but a bigger win was easily achievable , and would have landed the gunners in the top four . that would have been a huge statement . the elite challenge themselves -- they do n't settle for fourth-best , it 's not in their mentality . that 's why thierry henry left in the end . sanchez has an opportunity to do something this season not even henry did for arsenal -- lead the gunners ' charge to champions league success . if they do n't achieve that glory , are all arsenal fans confident their star man will want to stay ? and if arsenal do achieve european glory this season , will all 11 players get statues outside the emirates ? i do hope so .", "summary": " surely alexis sanchez will want out if arsenal do not triumph in europe ?   he has been the club 's star man , but gunners are not even in the top four .   arsenal should have beaten aston villa by a bigger margin ... but players were happy to turn the premier league clash into a testimonial .   sanchez would have heard the ` oles ' from the arsenal faithful at the end ... are expectations so low , they 're happy with keep-ball against a poor side ?
