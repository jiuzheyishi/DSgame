{"text": "i 've always been supportive of referees . of course you call the errors , but generally speaking i like to think i have an appreciation of the difficulty of the job referees do and that is reflected in my assessment of their performance . i do feel managers use referees as a way of deflecting blame away from themselves and their players and that a lot of players and bosses need to look in the mirror before looking at the referee . but this season , officials are making it more and more difficult for those of us who defend them from inevitable criticism . some of the errors made have been astonishingly bad , and have left me wondering two things : do they actually know the laws of the game ? and secondly , are they actually watching the game properly ? jose fonte went unpunished for this clear handball despite referee bobby madley having a clear view . newcastle 's emmanuel riviere protested to referee madley , who waved his appeals away immediately . despite riviere 's impassioned appeals to the official , newcastle were not awarded the penalty at st james ' i 'm not a fan of managers focusing on referees but i have a lot of sympathy with everton boss roberto martinez when he said this ahead of their monday night game with west bromwich albion : ` they -lrb- pgmol -rrb- accept there 's been an honest error made but there have been too many now . ` referees are part of the game and the error of the referee makes the game what it is . it 's tough to take when you 've got six or seven big calls which did n't go your way and scorelines could have changed . ' i still believe martinez needs to address his own shortcomings before he tries to think he knows what 's best for match officials , but he has a point nonetheless . everton have had some shocking decisions go against them this season -- notably at manchester city in the premier league defeat last month . everton manager roberto martinez has had his fair share of decisions going against him . so this weekend i decided to study four games at random to see how bad the situation was . in each game , there were decisions that were n't just questionable , they were downright terrible : . 1 . the inexplicable offside decision which robbed jan vertonghen and spurs of a goal against sunderland . it was high drama right at the end , so the fans were also robbed of a brilliant moment . if you 've seen the incident you 'll know how bad it is . the linesman remembered one important rule about needing two opponents between the ` attacker ' and the goal , but he forgot the even more basic law that you ca n't be offside in your own half . the referee chris foy was in the vicinity as well , but failed to overrule a ridiculous decision . this is a linesman and a referee either not knowing the laws of the game , or forgetting them during the 90 minutes . either way , it 's poor from both . replays clearly showed jan vertonghen was inside his own half as he ran clear to score a disallowed goal . the belgian 's celebrations were cut short when assistant stuart burt inexplicably flagged for offside . belgium defender vertonghen could n't believe his bad luck but tottenham still went on to win the match . 2 . jose fonte 's handball in the late stages of southampton 's victory at newcastle . referee bobby madley had a clear view from a good position , so what was he watching ? how could he possibly interpret that handball as anything other than a penalty ? 3 . bobby madley 's brother andy also took up a good position on a set-piece as nottingham forest threatened derby county . but despite staring straight at derby 's jake buxton grabbing hold of forest 's michail antonio and hauling him to the floor , madley decided not to award a penalty . he let play continue . what was he watching ? jose fonte went unpunished for this clear handball despite referee bobby madley having a clear view . newcastle 's emmanuel riviere protested to referee madley , who waves his appeals away . despite riviere 's impassioned appeals to the official , newcastle were not awarded the penalty . 4 . mike jones awarded handball against leicester 's wes morgan earlier this season at anfield when the ball clearly hit the defender 's face , so the official has found himself demoted to the championship where the nightmare continues -lrb- in fairness , he was faultless when reffing the fa cup tie between blyth spartans and birmingham earlier this month -rrb- . wes morgan was penalised even though the ball clearly hit his face as raheem sterling attacked for liverpool . on saturday , jones was at the dw stadium to control wigan 's 1-1 draw with blackburn . wigan 's james mcclean charged towards rovers ' marcus olsson , lunged in late after the ball had gone and took the defender off his feet . it was a horrible challenge , potential leg-breaker and understandably the blackburn players were livid . jones decided it was only worthy of a yellow card . the linesman was maybe more to blame -- he was right on top of the incident . it 's a clear red card , so why did n't jones give it ? to make matters worse , mcclean headed wigan 's equaliser later in the game . wigan 's james mcclean -lrb- pictured -rrb- charged towards blackburn 's marcus olsson but went unpunished . so why are these glaring errors happening more and more ? honest mistakes are fine , but these are the kind of blunders which if translated and applied to other jobs would get people sacked or killed . a lorry driver does n't look properly as he approaches a roundabout -- it 's potentially fatal . if i do n't know broadcasting law , i might say something i 'm not allowed to and i get sacked from talksport . so why are so many officials failing to do their jobs properly ? these are n't dishonest mistakes of course , but they fall way below the standard that should be set in a professional industry . my theory is this : goal-line technology has come in and been a success -lrb- expensive of course and it is n't used anywhere near as often as its advocates led us to believe it would be , but it 's been a positive -rrb- . the arrival of technology has changed the mindset of officials . i think subconsciously some referees and linesmen have ` downed tools ' and stopped doing their jobs properly , stopped concentrating , stopped watching the game closely . why ? because they want more technology to come in so they can wash their hands of any responsibility . they know they 'll still get paid as professional refs , but they also know there will be less pressure on them as individuals because they 'll be able to refer incidents to a ` video ref . ' back to basics please . ref it right , or ref off . vincent kompany reacts after mike dean blows his whistle to award a penalty to arsenal at the etihad . kompany was not happy with the decision by referee dean at the etihad as it gave arsenal a vital lead .", "summary": " premier league referees have been getting big decisions wrong lately .   do they know the laws of the game ? are they watching properly ?   mike dean awarded arsenal a controversial penalty against manchester city but questions have been asked as to whether he was even looking .   referees can often be used as a scapegoat by managers but the officials are doing themselves no favours .
