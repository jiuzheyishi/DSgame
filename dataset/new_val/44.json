{"text": "islamic state militants are raking in money at a remarkable rate , earning about $ 1 million a day from black market oil sales alone , a treasury department official said on thursday . david cohen , who leads the department 's effort to undermine the islamic state 's finances , said the extremists also get several million dollars a month from wealthy donors , extortion rackets and other criminal activities , such as robbing banks . in addition , he said the group has taken in at least $ 20 million in ransom payments this year from kidnappings . scroll down for video . david cohen , who leads the department 's effort to undermine the islamic state 's finances , said the extremists also get several million dollars a month from wealthy donors , extortion rackets and other criminal activities , such as robbing banks . ` with the important exception of some state-sponsored terrorist organizations , isis is probably the best-funded terrorist organization we have confronted , ' cohen , undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence , said in a speech at the carnegie endowment for international peace in washington . ` it has amassed wealth at an unprecedented pace . ' the group extracts oil from territory captured across syria and iraq , and sells it to smugglers . isis , led by iraqi abu bakr al-baghdadi , wants to create a caliphate , or islamic empire , in the middle east . it initially tried to oust syrian president bashar assad , but other groups , including al-qaida central command , turned against isis because of its brutality . unlike the core al-qaida terrorist network , isis gets only a small share of funding from deep-pocket donors and therefore does not depend primarily on moving money across international borders . captured oil field near baghdad : isis is extracting oil from territory captured across syria and iraq , and then selling it to smugglers , said cohen . instead , it obtains the vast majority of its revenues through local criminal and terrorist activities , cohen said . he acknowledged that the treasury 's tools are not particularly well-suited to combating extortion and local crime . ` they rob banks . they lay waste to thousands of years of civilization in iraq and syria by looting and selling antiquities , ' he said . ` they steal livestock and crops from farmers . and despicably , they sell abducted girls and women as sex slaves . ' in the iraqi city of mosul , islamic state terrorists are reportedly going door to door and business to business , demanding cash at gunpoint , he said . ' a grocery store owner who refused to pay was warned with a bomb outside his shop . others , who have not paid , have seen their relatives kidnapped . isis is receiving several million dollars a month from wealthy donors , extortion rackets and other criminal activities , such as robbing banks . ` we 've also seen reports that when customers make cash withdrawals from local banks where isis operates , isis has demanded as much as 10 percent of the value , ' cohen said . but oil is the biggest money-maker . ` it is difficult to get precise revenue estimates ... but we estimate that beginning in mid-june , isis has earned approximately $ 1 million a day from oil sales , ' cohen said . other estimates have ranged as high as $ 3 million a day . the treasury said isis is selling oil at substantially discounted prices to a variety of middlemen , including some from turkey , who then transport the oil to be resold . ` it also appears that some of the oil emanating from territory where isis operates has been sold to kurds in iraq , and then resold into turkey , ' he said . white house press secretary josh earnest , right , introduces treasury under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence david cohen to give a briefing about actions the treasury department is taking to combat financing for isis . cohen said the syrian government also has allegedly arranged to buy oil from isis . he noted that u.s-led airstrikes on the group 's oil refineries are threatening the militants ' supply networks , and that turkey and the kurdistan regional government - the official ruling body of the predominantly kurdish region of northern iraq - are working to prevent isis oil from crossing their borders . cohen acknowledged , however , that isis moves oil in illicit networks outside the formal economy , making it harder to track . ` but at some point , that oil is acquired by someone who operates in the legitimate economy and who makes use of the financial system . he has a bank account . his business may be financed , his trucks may be insured , his facilities may be licensed , ' he said . ` we not only can cut them off from the u.s. financial system and freeze their assets , but we can also make it very difficult for them to find a bank anywhere that will touch their money or process their transactions .
