{"text": "millions of pounds worth of footballing talent has been casually tossed aside after the premier league published their annual list of released players . william gallas , david bentley , florent malouda and andrey arshavin were among the high-profile casualties on a list of 154 players ruthlessly culled from their top-flight clubs . though the appearance on the list of the retired michael owen , paul scholes and jamie carragher did not come as a surprise , plenty of high-class , and well paid , players have been jettisoned . gone : yossi benayoun was one of eight players released by chelsea . competition : petr cech is the only goalkeeper in chelsea 's squad after ross turnbull 's and hilario 's exit . gallas was earning a weekly salary in the region of # 60,000 at tottenham and club-mate bentley -- who spurs paid an initial # 15m for in 2008 -- has also left after failing to impress during his five-year spell at white hart lane . youngster john bostock has also been let go by spurs after failing to make the grade . across in west london , malouda , who signed for chelsea for # 13m in 2007 , had been picking up # 80,000-a-week , despite being frozen out of the team and forced to train with the u21s . he did not play a single match for chelsea last season , though his former club lyon could provide him with a quick escape route back to france . yossi benayoun and goalkeepers hilario and ross turnbull are others among the eight chelsea players to be heading out of stamford bridge . arshavin , who became arsenal 's most expensive signing when he joined from zenit st petersburg for # 15m in 2008 , has also been discarded . arsenal had confirmed earlier in the week that the russian and fellow flops sebastien squillaci and denilson were to be released . the three are among 14 players to have been released by the north london club -- the most of any premier league team . shown the exit : david bentley -lrb- left -rrb- and william gallas -lrb- right -rrb- have both left tottenham . exit : filippo mancini was axed by manchester city while kolo toure has agreed a move to liverpool . manchester city released a clutch of players , including three signed at a cost of more than # 40m . striker roque santa cruz -lrb- # 18m -rrb- was loaned out to malaga last season , where he played under incoming city boss manuel pellegrini , but it seems the paraguayan does not figure in city 's ` holistic ' vision of the future . also released were defenders kolo toure -lrb- # 16m -rrb- and wayne bridge -lrb- # 10m -rrb- , though toure will be joining liverpool and bridge will link up with reading next season . and it seems that roberto is not the only mancini to have recently left the etihad after his son filippo , 22 , was also shown the exit . out the door : hungarian zoltan gera -lrb- right -rrb- has been given his marching orders by west brom . thrown out : rory delap -lrb- left -rrb- and jermaine pennant -lrb- right -rrb- have both been released by stoke . you could make a pretty good team of players released from their clubs ... goalkeeper : schwarzer -lrb- fulham -rrb- . defence : simpson -lrb- newcastle -rrb- , gallas -lrb- tottenham -rrb- , upson -lrb- stoke -rrb- , shorey -lrb- reading -rrb- . midfield : bentley -lrb- tottenham -rrb- , neville -lrb- everton -rrb- , gera -lrb- west brom -rrb- , arshavin -lrb- arsenal -rrb- . attack : di santo -lrb- wigan -rrb- , cole -lrb- west ham -rrb- . subs : pennant -lrb- stoke -rrb- , santa cruz -lrb- man city -rrb- , lichaj -lrb- a villa -rrb- , benayoun -lrb- chelsea -rrb- , bramble -lrb- sunderland -rrb- , diarra -lrb- fulham -rrb- , o'neil -lrb- west ham -rrb- . new stoke manager mark hughes has only . just started his new role at the britannia stadium , but he has already . lost a major weapon in his attacking arsenal after long-throw specialist . rory delap was released . other stoke players seeking new clubs were . jermaine pennant , dean whitehead and matthew upson . mark schwarzer 's five-year career at craven cottage is also over after the australian turned down fulham 's latest contract offer and was released , though the 40-year-old shot-stopper is bound to attract interest from other clubs , notably arsenal who have been repeatedly linked with him . west ham 's carlton cole and wigan 's franco di santo could also provide somebody with an effective cut-price strike partnership after both left their respective clubs . di santo is one of 11 wigan players to be ditched as they prepare for life in the championship , and qpr and reading have both dumped 10 and 11 players respectively as cost-cutting measures after their relegation from the top-flight . arsenal . arshavin , andrey . bihmoutine , samir . charles-cook ,
