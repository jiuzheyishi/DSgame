{"text": "videoed : former minister tim yeo was filmed appearing to boast that he had previously coached a paying client in private . a tory mp has complained about a government global-warming adviser 's undisclosed green interests -- despite the fact he himself is paid a fortune by eco-energy and transport firms . tim yeo , chairman of the energy and climate change select committee , has protested about lord deben remaining chairman of veolia water uk while also chairing the committee on climate change , an independent body that advises the government on the impact of climate change . mr yeo 's critics will argue his protest smacks of hypocrisy as he has been paid more than # 400,000 by three green companies since 2009 . lord deben , john selwyn gummer -- who as agriculture minister in 1990 tried to persuade his daughter cordelia to eat a hamburger during the bse crisis -- was required to undergo a ` confirmation hearing ' before yeo 's committee last september after being appointed chair of the climate change committee . at the time lord deben had stepped down from his job as chairman of forewinds , a consortium set up to build a hugely subsidised windfarm , but he remained chairman of veolia water uk . asked at the hearing whether this could be a conflict of interest , lord deben said he had resigned from all his energy business interests , adding : ` if you look at what it -lsb- veolia -rsb- does , it really has no connection at all . and if i thought it even had a remote connection , i would make that change -lsb- resign -rsb- . ' but , as this newspaper revealed in january , veolia has a thriving eco business connecting windfarms to the national grid . mr yeo has set out his protest in a letter to energy secretary mr davey . he wrote : ` the committee was given to understand that veolia was not an energy company , and that lord deben would not retain links with energy companies . . . but , as is clear from veolia 's website and annual report and accounts , the company has a significant role in the field of energy . ' mr yeo added : ` the lack of clarity on this specific point has caused ongoing media criticism . . . the reassurances you have given are not sufficient to effectively address the perception of conflict of interest in the public domain . ' mr yeo has been paid # 402,033.88 he is paid many thousands more . as a director of the channel tunnel company . the . ` chunnel ' contains a cable whose purpose is to keep britain 's lights on . using french power if our own supply becomes inadequate following the . shutdown of coal stations caused by green restrictions . lord . deben yesterday continued to insist he had ` no dealings whatsoever ' with the veolia division that dealt with energy . he added : ` since being . made aware of this activity , i have ensured that i will never be . involved , receive any papers , or participate in any way . ' fresh storm : as agriculture minister in 1990 lord deben , john selwyn gummer , tried to persuade his daughter cordelia to eat a hamburger during the bse crisis . energy and climate change secretary ed davey used a speech at the met office last week to mount an extraordinary and intemperate attack on newspapers such as this one , claiming we have published misleading ` destructive scepticism ' and ignoring the science on global warming . here our correspondent writes an open letter in reply : it is mr davey david rose says , who is being less than straight with the facts . dear ed . last week you made a speech which sounded uncomfortably as if you wanted to shut this newspaper up . you said that journalists like me , who have raised serious questions about global warming and energy policy , were ` selectively misreading the evidence ' and arguing that ` we can relax and burn all the dirty fuel we want ' . you claimed that instead of publishing ` the serious science ' , we were propagating ` destructive and loudly clamouring scepticism , born of vested interest . ' worse still , in your eyes , we have suggested that your policies as energy and climate change secretary are ` hopelessly misguided ' because we oppose the vast increases in ` renewable ' energy subsidies which you set out in your energy bill . outburst : energy and climate change secretary ed davey used a speech at the met office to mount an extraordinary and intemperate attack on newspapers . the mail on sunday was the only publication which you mentioned by name . so i hope you wo n't mind when i point out that much of your speech was highly misleading . it was a grade-a example of how those in power have become entrenched and wilfully blind to new evidence -- of how you seek to crush debate by attacking opponents by mischaracterising what we actually say . according to you , we ` reject outright that climate change is a result of human activity ' . you commented contemptuously : ` it 's the science , stupid ! ' after all , a recent survey found that 97 per cent of a sample of 12,000 climate science papers accept that human activity -- increased carbon dioxide emissions -- has contributed to global warming . how could we be so dumb as to ignore a consensus like that ? you , you said , are ` with the 97 per cent ' . well , mr davey , so am i , as are almost all the climate sceptics and so-called ` deniers ' i have ever spoken to . the point is : yes , human activity has warmed the planet , and will probably continue to do so . the far more difficult questions are how far and how fast is this likely to happen ? and here the scientific consensus is heading in one direction -- towards the view that the world is warming rather more slowly than was thought only a few years ago . as this newspaper first reported in october , world temperatures have failed to show any statistically significant increase since 1997 . according to you , this is a ` false summit ' , after which warming will again become rampant . but surely you must also know that this . unexpected ` pause ' was not predicted by most climate computer models . professor judith curry of the georgia technical institute testified at a . us congressional hearing that it is likely to last for at least another . ten years . if it does , climate alarmism -- all your talk of a ` massive . gamble with the planet our children will inherit ' -- is going to look , . well , stupid . load of hot air : professor myles allen , head of oxford university Â¿ s climate research network , has said that billions are being wasted on measures including windfarms in scotland . your mention of the mail on sunday came when you quoted an article two weeks ago by professor myles allen , head of oxford university 's climate research network . yes , prof allen did say that ` almost everyone agrees ' that emissions have to come down . but he went on to add that we are wasting billions on policies -- that 's your policies , mr davey -- which will never achieve this end . he says : ` 90 per cent of the measures adopted since the 1997 kyoto agreement to cut global emissions are a waste of time and money -- including windfarms in scotland , carbon taxes and byzantine carbon trading systems . ' in your speech , you implied that if we set ever more ambitious targets covering our own pitiful two per cent of world emissions , one day those much bigger economies will follow suit . oh really ? right now , china and india have about 800 coal power stations being built or on order . we need a proper debate about these issues , one which is n't fuelled by alarmism and which appreciates that your opponents have valid viewpoints , too . but all you have to offer is more of the same : bigger doses of policy prescriptions -- taxes , subsidies and the futile quest for a binding global agreement -- which have demonstrably failed . there is a cost for this . britain already has the highest inflation in energy prices in europe -lrb- which actually means the world -rrb- . yet everything you are doing will increase this further . perhaps you think that if you maintain the scaremongering at a shrill enough volume , you 'll get away with it . maybe in the short term you will . history , and the ballot box in 2015 , may not be as kind . yours sincerely . david .", "summary": " tim yeo has complained about lord deben 's undisclosed green interests .   mr yeo has been paid more than # 400,000 by three green companies .   lord deben is chairman of firm which connects windfarms to national grid .
