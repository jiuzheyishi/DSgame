{"text": "the poet 's tale : chaucer and the year that made the canterbury tales . by paul strohm . -lrb- profile books # 15.99 -rrb- . perhaps it is because contemporary life is intolerable that people are flocking back to the past . they really ca n't get enough of it , as the obsession with hilary mantel and tudor politics demonstrates -- though in my view , mark rylance and damian lewis are n't a patch on kenneth williams and sid james in carry on henry , which covered the same ground as wolf hall and more amusingly , too . ` has she been chaste ? ' -- ` all over normandy ' , etc. . when at last 16-century history begins to pall -- those lutes and galliards in a renaissance court ; the king 's matrimonial wrangles and the breach with the papacy -- my bet is we 'll crank backwards another couple of hundred years and become fascinated with all things medieval . the son of a wine merchant , chaucer grew up amidst the wharfs and warehouses lining the thames . in anticipation of the next trend , paul strohm has written a pungent book about the ` turbulence and change ' of the middle ages , when latin and norman french were mixing and merging to create the modern english language and hence the modern english identity . it was a picturesque period -- the tournaments and festivities , ` jousting and lance-play ' , the ` lavish consumption and frivolous display ' : edward iii spent millions on ribbons and taffeta embroidered with jewels . the fashion was for extravagant hats and ` outlandish coiffures ' , which make alexander mcqueen look like the salvation army . money came from the wool trade , ` the nation 's most important income source ' . the poet geoffrey chaucer worked as a controller in the wool customs and excise department , his job being to keep the accounts and collect tariffs and duties . the son of a wine merchant , chaucer grew up amidst the wharfs and warehouses lining the thames . he began his career in aristocratic service as ` a genteel and versatile kind of errand runner ' , known as a valet or esquire , before being promoted , as a ` literate ' civil servant , to ` the administrative bureaucracy of later medieval england ' . an unpromising background for an artist , you might think . but then , t. s. eliot worked in a bank and philip larkin was a librarian . strohm 's contention is that what chaucer later wrote about in the canterbury tales was his direct recollection of rollicking london life -- the ` socially mixed body of pilgrims ' telling their stories , the fables , adventures and bawdy romps , were a version of what he saw going on out of his window . this is where the book comes into its own , as a description of the city of london in the year 1374 , when chaucer first went up ` an awkward circular flight of stone stairs ' into his apartment in aldgate -- one of the many fortified gatehouses surrounding the capital , when it was encompassed by thick , stone walls . it is hard to imagine now , when london is a big splodge , but 700 years ago , westminster was a separate place from london proper , half-a-mile away along ` clogged footpaths ' . greenwich was a remote fishing village . hampstead and highgate were in the middle of deep countryside , with flocks of sheep . but , in case this starts to sound idyllic , strohm reminds us that next to chaucer 's aldgate was the open sewer known as houndsditch , named after the kennels on the bank of the thames maintained for hunting purposes . dead dogs were chucked in , along with the odd beggar , and ` it stank to high heaven ' . also adjacent was the ` extensive latrine ' maintained by holy trinity church for the clergy . add to this scene the felons ' and traitors ' heads rotting on spikes , and you realise a strong stomach was needed to survive in those germ-prone days . the noise was deafening . iron-wheeled carts rattled beneath chaucer 's window , as did drovers , water-carriers and wood-sellers , shouting and yelling . there were continuous processions of convicts and chanting monks , who belonged to the innumerable religious fraternities . meals were eaten at taverns or from stalls in the street , purchased directly from street-side ovens . no health and safety regulations back then . eating and drinking was supplemented by courtesans from ` the stews of southwark ' or ` unlicensed brothels ' of charing cross plying their trade . to such raucousness must be added the tolling and pealing of the parish bells , which began before dawn and ended only with the night curfew . many medieval legal cases involved trespass , disputes over boundaries and incursions on personal living space . this reflects the congestion of london -- the populace fighting for a little privacy beyond the teeming and insanitary 12 ft-wide streets . with privacy difficult to obtain -lrb- few could afford secluded chambers or an enclosed garden -rrb- , sex could be a bit of a free-for-all , especially after dark when lanterns were extinguished . ` racy incidents , ' says strohm , ` were part of the fodder of daily life . ' chaucer was always writing about bottoms being thrust out of windows , ladders conveniently being left next to open casements in readiness for a tryst , rumbles behind the arras , undone breeches around the ankles and so forth . democratic by temperament , he saw no difference between ` a cheating wife of high degree ... and a poor woman who engaged in the same conduct ' . both were wenches . oh , whatever happened to wenches ? i used to love a good wench , me . barbara windsor and diana dors were wenches . chaucer described a typical damsel approvingly as frike , or frisky . he himself did n't have much luck with the ladies , frike or otherwise . his wife , philippa , lived apart from him in lincoln , where she was a lady-in-waiting to edward iii 's 13-year-old queen . possibly owing to the enforced separation , chaucer in his poems does dwell on the ` mistakes , misapprehensions and woes ' of the marital state . the wife of bath , for example , has had numerous husbands -- and she 's an archetypal wench . she has a little gap between her top teeth , which was considered saucy . in 1386 , at the age of 43 , chaucer was sacked , along with the other controllers who 'd had their hands in the till . he left for kent -- rochester , sittingbourne and , of course , canterbury -- and he set down his classic saga , the ` cacophony of competing speakers ' , knights , yeomen , nuns , merchants , confidence tricksters . before the printing press , readers were of necessity ` few and private rather than numerous and far-flung ' . the manuscript fragments were assembled only after chaucer 's death -lrb- in 1400 -rrb- , copied and recopied by professional scribes -lrb- 55 manuscripts exist -rrb- and finally typeset in 1473 , when paper superseded parchment . chaucer was the first writer in vernacular english , rather than in latin . it 's not hard to follow -- for example , say ` nat worth a toord ' aloud and the meaning is plain . as strohm says , ` human emotions and objectives remain recognisable across time ' and , when the canterbury tales was filmed by pasolini in 1972 , it starred robin askwith of confessions of a window cleaner fame . he knew plenty about shooting up ladders , absent hubbies and the bums of wenches sticking out of windows and wardrobes .", "summary": " paul strohm writes about the ` turbulence and change ' of the middle ages .   chaucer grew up amidst the wharfs and warehouses lining the thames .   the book describes the city of london as it was in the year 1374 .
