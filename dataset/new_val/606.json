{"text": "genghis khan , pictured in this 1780 portrait by pierre duflos , expanded the mongol empire in the 13th century - a time of unusual wet and warm weather . scroll down for video . he was one of the most feared warriors in history , waging bloody war across asia and europe . but genghis khan 's 13th-century rampage may have never happened had it not been for a spell of good weather . the leader of the mongol armies created a vast empire that eventually stretched across china , india , russia and eastern europe . historians used to think his armies of nomadic horsemen were fleeing the bleak , cold and dry mongolian plains for warmer regions . but now scientists have discovered that the rise of the mongol empire coincided with a 14-year spell of weather that was the warmest and wettest for 1,000 years . the academics , from columbia university in new york , discovered the weather anomaly by studying the rings of ancient trees . they think the conditions created those needed for a boost in lush growth of grass , which would have fuelled the soldiers ' horses and fattened their livestock . the good weather lasted from 1211 to 1225 - the exact period when genghis khan and his armies rose to prominence . amy hessl , co-author of the study published in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences , said : ` the transition from extreme drought to extreme moisture right then strongly suggests that climate played a role in human events . ` it was n't the only thing , but it must have created the ideal conditions for a charismatic leader to emerge out of the chaos , develop an army and concentrate power . ` where it 's arid , unusual moisture creates unusual plant productivity , and that translates into horsepower . genghis was literally able to ride that wave . ' researchers analysed 17 trees found in the khangai mountains in mongolia , marked at a , to chart a yearly record of rainfall back to 658 ad . they claim that due to the warm and wet weather during genghis ' reign , there would have been an unusual increase in grass production , which would have fuelled a boom in livestock . statue of genghis khan in the tov province , mongolia . originally known as temujin of the borjigin , legend has it genghis was born holding a clot of blood in his hand . his father was khan , or emperor , of a small tribe but was murdered when temujin was still young . genghis conquered almost four times the lands of alexander the great . before khan rose to power the mongol tribes had been racked by disarray and internal warfare . in the early 1200s he united the tribes , creating a military state that invaded its neighbours and expanded , soon ruling most of what would become modern korea , china , russia , eastern europe , southeast asia , persia and india . khan made himself master of half the known world , and inspired mankind with a fear that lasted for generations . he was a prolific lover , fathering hundreds of children across his territories . some scientists think he has 16 million male descendants alive today . genghis khan was the founder and great khan of the mongol empire . in the early 1200s he united the . tribes , creating a military state that invaded its neighbours and . expanded , soon ruling most of what would become modern korea , china , . russia , eastern europe , southeast asia , persia and india . khan made himself master of half the known world , and inspired mankind with a fear that lasted for generations . he . was a prolific lover , fathering hundreds of children across his . territories . some scientists think he has 16 million male descendants . alive today . by the time he died in august 1227 , the mongol empire covered a vast part of central asia and china . originally known as temüjin of the borjigin , legend has it genghis was born holding a clot of blood in his hand . his father was khan , or emperor , of a small tribe but was murdered when temüjin was still young . the new tribal leader wanted nothing to do with temujin 's family , so with his mother and five other children , temüjin was cast out and left to die . in all , genghis conquered almost four times the lands of alexander the great . he is still revered in mongolia and in parts of china . the empire eventually fragmented , but the mongols ' vast geographic reach and their inventions survived . their ideas included an international postal system , organized agriculture research and a civil service based on merit . neil pederson , who co-wrote the paper , said : ` before fossil fuels , grass and ingenuity were the fuels for the mongols and the cultures around them . ` energy flows from the bottom of an ecosystem , up the ladder to human society . genghis khan was the founder and great khan of the mongol empire , pictured . after he united nomadic tribes in asia he founded the mongol empire and began invading the rest of the continent of eurasia . by the time he died in august 1227 , the mongol empire covered a vast part of central asia and china . ` even today , many people in mongolia live just like their ancestors did . ' the researchers said the trees , some of them more than 1,000 years old , gave them an indication of what the future could hold for the region , with drought and other extreme weather likely to become more common in central asia . ` this last big drought is an example of what may happen in the future , not just in mongolia but in a lot of inner asia , ' said mr pederson . ` the heat is a double whammy - even if rainfall does n't change , the landscape is going to get drier . ' other historical events that studies say were affected by climate include the disappearance of the maya , the expansion and fall of roman imperial power and the 13th-century collapse of south east asia 's angkor civilisation .", "summary": " researchers from west virginia analysed trees in the khangai mountains .   using tree-rings they were able to chart yearly rainfall back to 658 ad .   between 1211 and 1225 - the exact time of the mongols ' rise - central mongolia saw one of its wettest , and warmest , periods for 1,000 years .   researchers claim this weather caused an increase in grass production .   this in turn created a boom in yaks , cattle , sheep and other livestock .   this would have enabled khan to ` travel with a mobile meat supply ' "}
