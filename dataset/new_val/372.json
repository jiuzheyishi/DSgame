{"text": "prosecuted : ` mouse killer ' andre yankey arriving at court to face charges of animal cruelty for killing a mouse using a power tool to impress a girl . a sadistic teenager who tried to impress a girl with a homemade horror movie showing him butchering a mouse escaped jail today . andre yankey , 19 , called himself a ` mouse killer ' as he used a power tool to slice the rodent open and drill into its eye . the personal trainer said on camera the mouse would be ` terminated with the blade of doom ' as he tortured and eventually killed it . during the 90 second clip yankey boasted : ` this is what happens when a mouse comes into my house . ' but yankey landed himself in trouble by sending the film to a friend , who was so traumatised by what she saw that she called the rscpa . yankey appeared in the dock at westminster magistrates court today after he pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal on july 31 . ` the video shows mr yankey using a handheld grinder to purposely injure and torture a live mouse stuck to an adhesive trap , ' wendy gutteridge , for the rspca , told the court . ` mr yankey is seen brandishing a handheld dremel multi-tool , he faces the camera and explains how he is a mouse killer . ` he says : ` mice want to f ****** coming into my house , they get terminated with the blade of doom ' . ' yankey then cut open the mouse and drilled into its eyeball , causing blood to spurt out across the room , the court heard . ` the mouse is clearly still conscious and is frantically struggling to free itself , ' ms gutteridge added . ` mr yankey is clearly seen to be enjoying himself , saying ` grind that bitch , cut that bitch right open ' . ` after around one minute and 15 seconds , the mouse ceases to move any further . ' ms gutteridge said blood stains were found on the walls on yankey 's house , and his trainers were ruined during the killing . he was found out when he sent the video to a friend , virginie lambertucci , via social media whatsapp on january 28 this year . ms lambertucci was so repulsed with what she saw that she called the rspca and blocked yankey 's number in her phone , the court heard . ` she was so traumatised by the video she was unable to sleep , and sent the video to the rspca , ' ms gutteridge added . ` she was so distressed and sickened by the video that she told yankey not to contact her again . ' sentence : yankey avoided jail at westminster magistrates court , which heard he sliced up the mouse and drilled its eye . yankey was arrested on february 5 this year and admitted torturing the mouse when he first moved into his west london flat in 2010 . ` he said he felt like a complete fool , ' ms gutteridge added . ` he said he wanted to kill the mouse and conceded it would have caused pain and suffering . ` he said once he had killed the mouse , he threw it in the bin along with the glue mat and his trainers . ` he had a mouse problem when he moved in , and he hated mice . ' representing himself , yankey told the court that he filmed the clip when he was 16 and that he had sent it to ms lambertucci by mistake . ` when it happened i have to admit i was immature and silly at the time and when it got sent this year it was n't intended purposefully to the person i sent it to . ` it was a different file that i selected to send and it came up with this . ` i 've been affected a lot by this , especially since july 31 with newspaper reports which has had a worse effect on family and friends . ' in shock : the woman he sent the video of the mouse to -lrb- file picture -rrb- could not sleep , felt ill and then told the rspca about his cruelty . yankey was also given an animal welfare warning when arrested after his pet staffordshire bull terrier was found without food and a small corn snake was being kept in a tiny tank . the terrier has since been rehomed as yankey 's housing contract prevented him from keeping dogs in the property , the court heard . lead magistrate william hammond handed yankey a 12 week prison sentence suspended for 12 months and a two-year ban from owning animals . he also ordered the forfeiture of yankey 's mobile phone and sim card , and the forfeiture and destruction of the dremel multi-tool . ` as you are aware these type of offences are considered as very serious , ' mr hammond said . ` if you are to commit any offences within the next 12 months you will automatically go to prison for 12 weeks . ' yankey , of paddington , west london , was also ordered to pay a # 230 fine and complete 150 hours of community service .", "summary": " ` mouse killer ' andre yankey , 19 , sliced up the rodent and drilled its eye .   90-second clip was sent to a friend who he hoped would like it .   yankey bragged the mouse would be ` terminated with the blade of doom '   girl who saw it could not sleep and told the authorities of the cruelty .
