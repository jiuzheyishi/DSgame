{"text": "staff and visitors at google 's california campus were given a treat this week as the company took its driverless car prototype for a spin . the technology is still undergoing tests , and the firm has n't announced when exactly the vehicles will become an addition to public roads because engineers are still ironing out a number of issues . but , that has n't stopped the project 's director chris urmson and his team demonstrating its potential to fans in mountain view . staff and visitors at google 's california campus were given a treat this week as the company showed off its driverless car prototype -lrb- pictured -rrb- . the technology is still undergoing tests , and the firm has n't announced when the vehicles will become common place on our roads as engineers are still ironing out issues . mr urmson is also hopeful the cars will be roadworthy within the next five years . one of the features said to be delaying the car 's release is its inability to cope in heavy rain or snow . an insider told mit technology review that the current prototype cars are very reliant on maps to navigate and ca n't react like a human driver , dodging potholes and other hazards . the latest official figures from google revealed the cars have already driven themselves for more 700,000 miles -lrb- 1,126,540 km -rrb- , but they struggle to cope in snowy conditions and ca n't negotiate heavy rain . mr urmson said this is because the detection technology is not yet strong enough to separate certain objects from weather conditions . while the cars ' cameras can spot a traffic light changing , they can be confused by strong sunlight . they do n't distinguish between an empty plastic bag - which could be easily driven over - or a rock , so cars must drive around both . they also ca n't detect uncovered manholes or potholes . mr urmson said : ` i could construct a construction zone that could befuddle the car . ' this graphic reveals how google 's prototype driverless car looks and works . the car makes turns and reacts to vehicles and pedestrians based on computer programs that predict what others might do , and data from sensors including radar and cameras that read , in real-time , what other objects are actually doing . the prototype two-seater cars have buttons to autonomously begin and end the drive . the car makes turns and reacts to vehicles and pedestrians based on computer programs that predict what others might do , and data from sensors including radar and cameras that read , in real-time , what other objects are actually doing . the route might be set by typing a destination into a map or using spoken commands according to chris urmson , the leader of google 's self-driving car team . the car will be powered by electricity and could go about 100 miles -lrb- 160 km -rrb- before charging . its shape suggests a rounded-out volkswagen beetle - something that might move people around a corporate campus or congested downtown - with headlights and sensors arrayed to resemble a friendly face . the front of the vehicle has a soft foam-like material where a traditional bumper would be and a more flexible windscreen , in a bid to be safer for pedestrians . in these prototypes speed is restricted to 25mph -lrb- 40 km/h -rrb- and the ability to self-drive will depend on specifically designed google road maps tested on the company 's current fleet of vehicles . ultimately the vehicles will be faster and will be able to use google 's extended maps service . driving works by using gps technology to locate the vehicle 's exact position on an electronic map . a combination of radar , lasers and cameras sitting on top of the roof give the car a 360-degree ` view ' , with sensors linked to computer software able to ` see ' and identify people , cars , road signs and markings and traffic lights . the cars ` see ' pedestrians as moving blocks of pixels and know to stop , but unlike a cautious human driver , they could not spot a traffic policeman at the side of the road , waving for traffic to stop - which could lead to trouble . despite the cars being allowed on public roads , they need to prepare to set off in more detail than a human driver , because a precise map must be created of exactly where to go -- and a car can not deviate from its route . an area has to be mapped multiple times by a sensor vehicle to record details such as driveways , in order to make the cars ' routes . these details then need to be pored over metre-by metre by humans and computers , in a much more labour-intensive process than in needed to maker google maps . one of the features said to be delaying the car 's -lrb- pictured -rrb- release is its inability to cope in heavy rain or snow . an insider recently admitted that the current prototype cars are very reliant on maps to navigate and ca n't react like a human driver , dodging potholes and other hazards . they also struggle in poor weather conditions . despite best efforts , routes can lack details such as temporary traffic lights that have been installed , or if there are road works or potholes to avoid , which the car might drive over . in the us , driverless cars are only allowed on roads in certain states if someone sits in the driver 's seat . the california department of motor vehicles is expected to start granting licences to certain driverless cars and their human co-pilots as soon as this month . changes to the united nations convention on road traffic , which dates back to 1968 , are also afoot . it used to state : ` every driver shall at all times be able to control his vehicle or to guide his animals . ' an amendment agreed in may would allow a car to drive itself , as long as the system ` can be overridden or switched off by the driver ' . a driver must be present and able to take the wheel at any time . the convention covers european countries , mexico , chile , brazil and russia , although not the united states , japan or china . in addition , maps have only been made for a few thousand miles of road , so in order for the cars to roam the us , google would need to pour a vast amount of resources into mapping the rest of the vast country , down to the tiniest changing detail . the company is working on ironing out all these problems . for example , if a google car notes new lights and street signs , it sends a message to update the mapping software . google unveiled a compact version of its car without a steering wheel , but it will now have to re-introduce the wheel to comply with the california department of motor vehicles ' new regulations . despite all these set-backs , mr urmson said autonomous cars will ` happen more quickly than people think ' -- perhaps as soon as in five years ' time . last month , google was awarded 25 of the first 29 permits issued by the state of california to test driverless cars on public roads . each permit costs $ 150 for the first vehicle , plus $ 50 for each additional vehicle , and each one must be insured for up to $ 5 million . self-driving cars have been undergoing private tests for at least three years , but government legislation requires permits for them to be used on public roads . the first licence for an autonomous vehicle was issued by nevada in march 2012 to a toyota prius that google modified to include its driverless technology . google tests its cars virually -lrb- pictured -rrb- as well as on real roads . google 's cars have driven themselves over 700,000 miles -lrb- 1,126,540 km -rrb- - but there is still a long way to go to hone the technology . ` my test takes place in a car park at google 's sprawling mountain view campus -- known as the googleplex -- in the heart of silicon valley , california . ` my vehicle is ` summoned ' via a mobile phone . google 's vision is that customers will share a driverless car which will be ordered via an app . ` the car will pick you up , take you where you want to go and then can go off and do errands like pick up your dry-cleaning , freeing you to do other things , ' project director christ urmson said . i step inside and sink into soft hermes orange leather seats . it is surprisingly spacious , uncluttered by the normal ` car ' things like pedals , a steering wheel and handbrake . ` instead there are two buttons -- green for go and red for stop . caroline graham , mail on sunday la correspondent , is shown in google 's driverless car at the tech giant 's mountain view campus during a test drive last month . there is an oblong flatscreen in front of me which shows the time , date , temperature and a computer-generated image of the road ahead . beneath the high-tech screen is a storage bay for luggage . ' i hit the go button and take off . the electric engine purrs into life , taking me to a top speed of 25mph -lrb- 40km/h -rrb- . ` the car skilfully navigates sharp turns and potential hazards of parked cars and pedestrians who wander in and out of the roadway . ` it ` senses ' corners and slows down automatically before speeding up into a straight . the sensation is surreal . ` stationary vehicles and pedestrians show up on the screen as ` box ' shapes . ` at one point we accelerate down a straight when mr urmson suddenly steps out in front of the car ... and it automatically slams on the breaks and comes to a controlled halt . ` it 's eerie , impressive and utterly captivating . ` after a few minutes it all starts to feel normal . as the car drives itself i open a computer and answer email . i become oblivious to the outside world . i answer my phone and do some work . i feel perfectly safe . ` then i hit the stop button and my journey into the future comes to a gentle halt . ' caroline graham , mail on sunday la correspondent .", "summary": " car was shown off to staff and visitors at google 's california campus .   prototype is undergoing tests , and the firm has n't announced a release date .   the delay is partly blamed on the cars ' inability to drive in poor weather .   current prototype is very reliant on maps and ca n't react like a human .   cars are n't driven in the rain or snow as detection technology ca n't distinguish between droplets or flakes and obstacles on the road .
