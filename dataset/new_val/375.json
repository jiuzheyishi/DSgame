' kennedy , . 30 , said the fact that bergdahl has been repatriated ` is an . unambiguously positive development ' , adding that he shares the . community 's ` relief ' that bergdahl will be reunited with his family . but . he said : ` i do , however , think it is incumbent upon members of this . community to come to terms with the fact that , while one town will soon . be reunited with a native son , there are six other towns scattered . across this country that never will be . ' kennedy is referring to the six soldiers later killed in paktika . province , afghanistan believed to be in connection with attempts to . rescue bergdahl . no party : hop porter park in hailey , idaho , where the ` bowe is back ' celebration of bowe bergdahl 's release , now canceled , was scheduled for june 28 , 2014 . never forgotten : a plaque marks four trees that have been planted at hop porter park in hailey , idaho , to commemorate each anniversary of bowe bergdahl 's captivity . safe return : the four trees in the forefront have been planted at hop porter park in hailey , idaho , to mark each year since sgt. bowe bergdahl 's capture . children 's playground : the trees planted to commemorate the capture of sgt. bowe bergdahl stand in front of a play zone for children in hailey , idaho . the pros : ` past celebrations have focused on bringing this soldier home . regardless of the character of the men and women who choose to serve , we do not leave our soldiers behind , ' said the town 's mayor fritz haemmerle . and the cons : army platoon leader jonathan kennedy -lrb- fourth from left -rrb- says , ` until he is cleared of the charges against him , this man deserves no applause ' he added : ` until he is cleared of the charges against him , this man deserves no applause . for now , the only appropriate response is silence . ' mr kennedy served in the us army as a platoon commander from 2009-2013 , during which he was posted to south korea . he is now an executive at a recruiting firm in new york . in response to kennedy 's email mayor haemmerle replied : ` past celebrations have focused on bringing this soldier home . regardless of the character of the men and women who choose to serve , we do not leave our soldiers behind . ` you have to remember that bowe bergdahl 's family also are a part of our community . i have known bob for thirty years . ` from my standpoint , our celebration will focus on bowe bergdahl 's release and the relief of his family and those who live here . ` again , from my standpoint , any celebration exists separate and apart from any objective inquiry on how bergdahl was captured . ' sign of the times : bowe is back , but not everyone wants to welcome him . kennedy feared that an annual event called ` bring bowe back ' that was scheduled for june 28 would now be the venue for the welcome celebration . the event was quickly renamed by locals as ` bowe is back ' . ` it is going to be bowe 's official welcome-home party even if he 's not quite home yet ,  organizer stefanie o'neill said on the weekend before it was canceled . grammy award winner carole king was on tap to sing and bergdahl 's parents bob and jani were due to talk at the event at hop potter park in hailey . the event , which normally attracts 10-15 ,000 people , was include a motorcycle ride from twin falls , to hailey idaho and a . 5k walk . bergdahl , 28 , had been held prisoner by the taliban since june 30 , 2009 . he was handed over to u.s. special forces by the taliban in exchange for the release of five afghan detainees held by the united states . in hailey , a town of 7,000 people , residents have hung yellow ribbons along main street . signs have been taped up in windows saying , ` bowe is free at last ! ' at zaney 's river street cafe , where bergdahl used to work as a barista , a sign that hung in the window for years read ` get bowe back ' . now , it is accompanied with two more signs that read , ` welcome home , bowe ! ' and ` our prayers have been answered !
