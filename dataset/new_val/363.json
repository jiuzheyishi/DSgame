{"text": "migrant parents care more about their children 's education than those from white working-class backgrounds , ofsted 's chief said yesterday . sir michael wilshaw attacked the mothers and fathers who failed to support their youngsters with homework and reading after school . pupils from migrant , black and asian families were getting more backing at home -- and it is helping them outperform their white classmates , he said . sir michael told the bbc 's today programme : ` family is important and we need to send a message out to parents that they need to support their children . sir . michael wilshaw , a former head teacher , suggested immigrant families . cared more about their children 's education than white working class . brits . there are parts of our communities -- . particularly people from immigrant groups , ethnic minority groups , where . their children are doing fantastically well because their parents . support them . ' former head teacher sir michael has previously called for parents to be fined for not helping children with their homework . reiterating the demand yesterday , he said : ` if parents do n't support their children and do badly there should be sanctions . ' i think it 's important that families and parents support the school . ' his comments tally with a recent commons ' education select committee report warning that the under-achievement of white working-class pupils is ` quite staggeringly low ' . research last year by the centre for social justice revealed that in 2012 , only 26 per cent of poor white british boys gained five a * to c grades at gcse including english and maths . but 40 per cent of black boys achieved the same result , against a country-wide figure of 63 per cent . and earlier this week an immigrant mother wrote in the mail how asian values could prevent indigenous british children performing badly by understanding how learning can pave the way to a better life . later yesterday , at the festival of education at wellington college , berkshire , sir michael warned that thousands of pupils were being let down by the ` baleful legacy ' of trendy teaching methods and poor discipline at ` bog standard ' comprehensives . the pervasiveness of 1960s and 70s teaching methods meant state secondaries were associated with ` mediocrity , laxity and failure ' , he said . its fallout could be seen in the toleration of poor behaviour , the ` disdain ' for competitive sports and the ` half-hearted pursuit ' of high academic standards . singling out the once-fashionable concept of ` individualised learning ' -- the belief that criticism and adult supervision stifle youthful creativity -- he said : ` its legacy still lingers in some schools today : academic rigour is undervalued ; basic literacy and numeracy are neglected ; subject specialism is relegated in favour of cross-curricula muddle . ' weak head teachers who remain resistant to academic rigour and the importance of tests were also attacked . sir michael insisted that good leadership was essential in ` the battle against tired ideologies and harmful classroom practices ' . head teachers must insist that the curriculum is ` academically robust ' and confront parents who refuse to take responsibility for their children , such as flouting uniform rules . he now wants to ` reclaim the comprehensive ideal ' , insisting that it is the only approach to ` address the educational needs of the entire country ' . he added : ` phrases such as  behaviour management  are still bandied around as if a child 's conduct is something to be negotiated . it smacks of compromise and containment . it undermines authority . '", "summary": " sir michael wilshaw says bad parents should be fined to raise standards .   says immigrant families and ethnic minorities outperforming white britons .   suggests this is because white working-class parents do n't care as much .   ofsted chief also calls on state comprehensives to copy elite private schools .
