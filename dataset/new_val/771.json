{"text": "a germ-killing robot designed to rid a room of dangerous viruses in minutes is being used to keep hospitals ebola-free . called ` little moe ' , the robot works by damaging viral dna using pulses of ultraviolet light . it is currently being used in 250 hospitals and health facilities across the us , including a dallas hospital where a patient with the first case of ebola diagnosed in america is being treated . scroll down for video . san antonia-based xenex has designed a robot called little moe -lrb- pictured -rrb- that can kill viruses . it works by using pulses of xenon light to disinfect surfaces in five minutes . blasts of light are sent out in a 10ft -lrb- three metre -rrb- radius every 1.5 seconds . this can remove ebola from surfaces in a room in just two minutes . little moe was created by san antonia-based company xenex . the robot rolls around on four wheels and uses xenon , a non-toxic gas , to create the ultraviolet rays needed to destroy viruses . ebola emerged in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in sudan and near the ebola river in the democratic republic of congo . there are several strains , which vary in how dangerous they are to humans , but death rates have reached as high as 90 per cent . in the current outbreak it is just over 50 per cent . the virus is introduced into humans through direct contact with the blood , organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals including fruit bats , which are eaten as a delicacy . symptoms include fever , intense weakness , muscle pain , headache and sore throat followed by vomiting , diarrhoea , rash , impaired kidney and liver function , and in some cases , both internal and external bleeding . people are infectious as long as their blood and bodily fluids contain the virus and the incubation period can range between two and 21 days . source : world health organisation . it blasts 1.5 pulses per second up to ten feet -lrb- three metres -rrb- in every direction to kill viruses including ebola . light that is 25,000 times bright than sunlight is created in each flash . the robot was first made available in 2010 and each unit costs # 65,000 -lrb- $ 104,000 -rrb- . ` our robot ensures the room is safe for the next patient by destroying germs on high-touch surfaces , and in hard to clean nooks and crannies , ' a spokesperson for xenex said . ebola , however , is actually easier to kill than other infectious diseases such as superbugs that mutate and become immune to disinfection . it takes just two minutes for the robot to destroy ebola on a surface , while other viruses can be eradicated in five minutes . such technology , using uv rays to sterilise a room , has been around for decades , but little moe speeds up the process by using xenon in place of mercury . by comparison , a mercury-based uv machine takes up to an hour to disinfect a room . ` our mission has always been to eliminate the pathogens that cause the infections that impact the health and lives of millions of patients and their families , and ebola is no different , ' xenex said in a statement . little moe costs # 65,000 -lrb- $ 104,000 -rrb- and is already being used in 250 hospitals across the us to stop the spread of ebola . the robot rolls around on four wheels and uses xenon , a non-toxic gas , to create the ultraviolet rays needed to destroy viruses . ebola emerged in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in sudan and near the ebola river in the democratic republic of congo . there are several strains , which vary in how dangerous they are to humans , but death rates have reached as high as 90 per cent . in the current outbreak it is just over 50 per cent . the virus is introduced into humans through direct contact with the blood , organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals including fruit bats , which are eaten as a delicacy . symptoms include fever , intense weakness , muscle pain , headache and sore throat followed by vomiting , diarrhoea , rash , impaired kidney and liver function , and in some cases , both internal and external bleeding . people are infectious as long as their blood and bodily fluids contain the virus and the incubation period can range between two and 21 days . the ebola virus -lrb- transmission electron micrograph image shown -rrb- spreads between humans through direct contact with blood , organs or other bodily fluids of infected people . although the disease has no cure , modern medical treatment and quick isolation help hugely to bring the death toll down .", "summary": " san antonia-based xenex has designed a robot that can kill viruses .   it works by using pulses of xenon light to disinfect surfaces in five minutes .   blasts of light are sent out in a 10ft -lrb- three metre -rrb- radius every 1.5 seconds .   this can remove ebola from surfaces in a room in just two minutes .   called ` little moe ' the robot costs #
