{"text": "england bought themselves time with their win against scotland to ponder whether they have the best batting combination to make a world cup impact . the protracted nature of this tournament means england , with one match in the next 14 days , can carefully consider if they should finally let alex hales loose when they meet sri lanka on sunday . england on tuesday returned to wellington , scene of their criminal defeat by new zealand , where the immediate world cup future of gary ballance will be very much at the top of their agenda in the coming days . alex hales - who has yet to appear at this world cup - hits out during training in wellington last week . the brilliance of moeen ali in the 119-run win over the scots papered over the cracks in the england batting line-up that were epitomised by ballance . england 's decision to bring ballance in at the last minute ahead of their world cup opener against australia has yet to be justified , with the yorkshireman looking out of form in scoring 10 in each of the three matches . that means england must decide whether they should resist more changes and give ballance another chance to show he can be as effective in one-day cricket as he was in the test game last summer or introduce the dynamism of hales . gary ballance trudges off after another poor innings comes to an end against scotland . moeen ali has been england 's standout batsman so far after his hundred against scotland . hales in an intriguing one . his twenty20 form appeared to guarantee a proper chance in 50-over cricket but india exposed limitations in his technique last summer that led to england preferring moeen at the top of the order . there have also been concerns about his discipline and attitude but mark ramprakash , the england batting coach , made a point of praising hales ' maturity when he said last week that the notts batsman was ` knocking hard on the door . ' the question is , if england do not trust hales enough to give him a chance now , presumably at three with james taylor continuing at six , then there is little point in him being here and they should have brought a different spare batsman . hales watches on from behind the stumps as ballance lets fly during training in wellington . england could , of course , go back to ravi bopara and give themselves an extra bowling option too but they seem to have lost all faith in his bowling while believing his batting in the tri-series did not warrant a place here now . it seemed illogical for england to change a settled line-up at the 11th hour before this world cup but , three games in , they need to have a good hard look at hales in the nets over the next four days and not be afraid to make a switch again .", "summary": " england have lost two of their opening three world cup matches .   gary ballance came in to the team late but has struggled at no 3 .   powerful opener alex hales could be given chance against sri lanka .
