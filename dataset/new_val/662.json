' travel photographer austin mann told mailonline he used an iphone 6 to take otherworldly panoramic photos of an icelandic glacier . he said it was ` surreal ' seeing the artwork blown up in the firm 's soho store in new york . he originally began taking pictures as a way to help review apple products for a website . he said the larger screen was a major change . ` it 's so nice to shoot with a big screen - it 's almost like the old medium format cameras , ' he said . mann , who recalls mowing lawns for a summer as a 7th grader to save up for his first , bright green imac in 1998 , says his use of an iphone and high-end cameras is ` split pretty even ' when it comes to professional work . ` in the photography industry especially , when you are getting started you are always seeking gear , ` if i could only get this $ 1,000 lens ,  he said . using just an iphone to take great photos encourages people to ` shift away from focusing on gear and equipment . ' austin mann told mailonline he was driving along the icelandic coast when a bank of fog lifted to reveal the biggest glacier he had ever seen . to reach it and get the shot , mann left all his gear in the car , put his iphone 6 plus in his pocket , and climbed down a steep rock face to capture the photo in panorama mode . he then used the vscocam app to edit the image in the car on his way back to a hotel . apple commissioned the work of 12 artists at various stages of their career to create works meant to inspire . showcasing the people who use its technology - in this case , painters , photographers , filmmakers and other visual artists -- is a shift for a company long focused on making its products front and center . the artwork , done on ios devices and macs using various apps , is displayed on apple 's website as part of an ad campaign called ` start something new . ' and the cupertino , california-based company is replacing all product signage in its retail stores with the artwork . just as technology has transformed the way we work and interact with one another , it has also changed the way we create . jules julien used idraw on an imac to create the modern interpretation on emoji . jimmy chin , a professional photographer , used and iphone 6 and pixelmator app to capture these stunning mountain scenes . for painter roz hall , that 's meant shifting away from the canvases and acrylic paint he started out using in art school to an iphone app called brushes . after not painting for many years , hall in 2010 read about a group of artists who started using their iphones and sometimes ipads , which had just come out . ' i had an iphone at home and i downloaded the brushes app , ' he says . ` that was a wonderful , simple application . ' it was also challenging . when he painted on a canvas , he painted life-size works . painting on a 3.5 inch-screen was an entirely different thing . ` what i liked about it was that there was no setup , ' hall says . with all the prep work that comes with traditional painting , he says , ` by the time you have everything out the moment has -lrb- often -rrb- passed . ' roz hall used the app procreate to paint with his fingers on the ipad . brazilian artist marcelo gomes shot handfuls of colorful paper from different angles with an iphone 6 plus . he slowly moved the camera as a painter might move a brush , while using the slow shutter ! app to lengthen the exposure time . hall , whose website lists exhibitions in cities from san francisco to new york to shanghai , says he has not painted traditionally for many years . and he prefers painting on the ipad to using a traditional computer . using the app procreate to paint with his fingers on the ipad , ` you do n't feel like you are fighting a computer to create your art . ` you feel connected to the artwork , ' he says . ` when i first used an ipad , it made me think of cave paintings , or when a child first paints using their finger . ' while some artists may look at digital painting as ` cheating ' -- after all , you can delete mistaken brush strokes -- hall , who lives in britain , thinks it actually makes artists more daring . ` if you spent 50 pounds -lrb- $ 75 -rrb- on canvas and another 50 pounds on paint , at some point you are going to get careful . you do n't want to waste what you spent , ' he says . for apple 's display , hall used procreate to paint portraits of people he encountered at the university where he lectures . alistair taylor-young took photos of rainy cityscapes from behind a sheet of glasswith the iphone 6 for apple 's project . ` crystal mosaic ' uses the phone 's own camera app to bring drops of rain on glass into focus , showing ordinary scenes through a different perspective . chad riley used the burst mode funtion of the ipad air 2 to capture the swimmer . they include a bearded , mustached young man with bright yellow glasses and an intense stare , and a woman in a floppy black hat lost in thought . alistair taylor-young , whose photography career spans two decades and has shot for fashion icons such as armani and fendi and magazines ranging from conde nast traveler to french vogue , took photos of rainy cityscapes with the iphone 6 for apple 's project . ` crystal mosaic ' uses the phone 's own camera app to bring drops of rain on glass into focus , showing ordinary scenes through a different perspective . jingyao guo used idraw on an imac to create this image of chinese new year . she also used the photo booth app to capture her own facial expressions , which were then transposed onto the figures in the artwork . taylor-young bought an iphone in 2007 , when they first came out . having worked with polaroid cameras early in his career , he found the quality of the original iphone 's camera very similar . ` it was quite soft and the colors were muted and distorted , ' he says . ` the moment i picked up the phone and started taking pictures , it reminded me of photography in its infancy . ` you could n't focus , change exposure . ` you just saw something and took a photo . ' the artist known only as nomoco used an ipad air 2 and the brushes 3 app , painting with her fingers . photographs from photographer christian weber are on display on the wall of an apple store in new york , as seen through a glass staircase . the artist used an iphone 6 and the vsco app to create them . the quality of phone cameras has certainly improved in the last several years . but more importantly , the ease of use and always-in-hand nature of a smartphone camera has in many ways democratized photography , encouraging anyone to make a photo diary of daily moments , not just special events or trips . ` digital has n't made any nicer pictures , ' taylor-young says . ` but they have opened up the world to people who would have not necessarily thought of taking pictures , or sharing them .
