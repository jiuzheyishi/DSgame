{"text": "it 's been one of the most highly anticipated pc games of 2013 , yet with huge server issues following its launch in the us -- the release of simcity in the uk was overshadowed by its crippling servers . credit where it 's due , however ; maxis have made a very good game . for those if you who have n't been exposed to previous simcity titles -- these series of games focus on city building as the player assumes the role of city major and all the responsibilities that come with it from harvesting resources , ensuring your ` sims ' have enough power and water to live , garbage is cleared , sewage is removed and that your city does n't descend into a crime-filled , arson-loving metropolis . and it 's in the control of all these aspects that the real fun is had . beautiful world : there is no escaping the fact that simcity is a wonderful-looking game . when players first start the game they will be required to access one of a number of servers -lrb- a lot more now than on the first day of launch -rrb- . one of the strange things about simcity is that each server is standalone ; meaning if you start a city of one server and then have to or want to access another server , your city will not move with you . players will then be taken through the tutorial that runs you through the key foundations of running a city . this gives simcity players of all experiences a good outline on how to begin running their own cities . potential mayors learn of city specialisation ; where you can focus on the production of oil , coal , tourism , casinos and trade . city specialisation is all part of maxis ' aim of bringing a more social aspect to simcity unlike previous titles . players can choose to start their own region or pick a zone within another players ' region -- encouraging play with friends . each zone has its own resources , some with high quantities of water , oil or coal allowing for one friend to focus on the production of one resource and sharing it amongst neighbours whilst another friend does the same . this is one great asset of simcity ; playing in the same region as friends or other players allows for more focussed city building , not to mention great works that multiple players can team up to research and build . each great works ;
