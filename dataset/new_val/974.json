' i own an electrical contracting company and employ two tradesmen and two apprentices in turn creating jobs , skills and a contribution to our economy and welfare system . ` we claim no benefits whatsoever , no child support , no family tax credits or others alike . ` we pay our taxes and nhs stamp regularly and work hard but for some reason , the home office have deemed us to be unsuitable to live here in the uk and have attempted to deport my wife whilst pregnant to a country where she no longer has any support , no job , no home and no family .
