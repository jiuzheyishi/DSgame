{"text": "carrying a guitar can increase the chances of you getting a date by a third , according to a study by researchers from the university of south brittany . the study found that women were 31 % more likely to give their number to a man carrying a guitar - double the amount of people who would give their number to the same man when he was empty-handed . but this technique only works if your a man , women are not seen any more or less attractive if they carry a musical instrument . according to a study by french researchers in brittany , men who carry guitars are seen as more attractive than sporty-looking men . carrying an instrument can boost your chances of getting a date by 31 % . researchers mary cowan from the university of stirling , and anthony little filmed 40 psychology students - half men and half women - explaining which two items they 'd take to a desert island and why , choosing from chocolate , hairspray or a plastic bag . even though they had n't been told about humour , 19 of the 40 students tried to be funny in their responses . the next 11 students were played audio recordings of these 19 participants and asked to rate them for funniness , and for the attractiveness . the magazine revealed that ' a key result is that attractive actors were judged to be funnier . ' it added ` men who were considered funnier also tended to be considered more attractive for both short and long term relationships but especially short term . ' the study was led by professor nicolas gueguen , a researcher in behavioural sciences at the university . gueguen hired a 20-year-old man to approach 300 women aged between 18 and 22 in a shopping centre in brittany . the man told each girl that they were ` really pretty ' and asked for her phone number so they could arrange a date . for the first 100 women he was holding a sports bag . for the next 100 women he approached them holding a guitar case . and for the final 100 women , the man asked them for their number without anything in his hands . when the actor was carrying the guitar case , 31 % of the women gave them his number . when he was carrying nothing , 14 % of the women gave them his number . the biggest turn off for the women was when he was carrying the sports bag , which had a success rate of only 9 % . according to research from the university of . south brittany , women are 31 % likely to give a man their phone number . when he 's carrying a guitar . the biggest turn off for women is men . carrying sports bags . english singer and musician david bowie topped the list of the 20 sexiest male musicians of all time , according to la weekly . the 66-year-old has been married twice . his current wife is somalian fashion model iman abdulmajid . according to guitar world , the top ten songs which all budding musicians must learn if they want to impress a woman are : . 1 . more than words - extreme . 2 . crash - dave matthews band . 3 . melissa - allman brothers band . 4 . just like heaven - the cure . 5 . name - goo goo dolls . 6 . wonderful tonight - eric clapton . 7 . you and me - lifehouse . 8 . baby i love your way - peter frampton . 9 . your body is a wonderland - john mayer . 10 . babe , i 'm gon na leave you - led zeppelin . gueguen 's findings mirror those from a study carried out by the university of tel aviv and ben gurion university last year . in the israeli study , 100 single women were sent facebook friend requests with a message that said : ' i like your photo ' . half of the respondents were sent a request by a man seen strumming a guitar in his profile picture . the other half were sent a request from the same person , but this time he was empty handed . only five -lrb- 10 % -rrb- of the 50 women accepted the request , or replied to the message sent by the empty-handed man . yet 28 % accepted the request , or replied to the message sent by the man holding a guitar . the french researchers attribute these findings to the fact that playing a musical instrument is a sign that the man is intelligent , can learn , or is willing to learn , new skills and has independent hobbies . they believe there may also be a link between how musicans are portrayed in the media , and that holding a guitar is a sign of wealth and status . the team from the university of south brittany also wanted to test whether the same theory was true when it came to female musicians . gueguen 's team repeated the israeli study , but used females to send the friend requests . he found there was no difference in the response rate of the men she sent requests to whether she was holding a guitar or not . this suggests that its only women who consider playing an instrument to be an attractive trait .", "summary": " women are 31 % more likely to give their number to a man carrying a guitar .   sporty-looking men were the least popular during the french study getting numbers in only 9 % of cases .
