' sir peter dismissed suggestions there had been a conspiracy to cover up abuse by establishment figures . sir peter , who said he had always gone out of his way to help whistleblowers , said he backed the idea of a wide-ranging inquiry into claims that senior figures were involved in child sex abuse , provided it did not interfere with police investigations . but he dismissed suggestions that there had been a major conspiracy to cover up abuse by establishment figures . he said successive governments did not take seriously enough the activities of groups like the notorious paedophile information exchange , ` partly because people could n't believe it , partly because there may have been one or two senior people in the police or some other forms of public life ' . but he added : ` the idea that there could be an organised group that could stop things happening is , i think , imagination . ` if i tried to organise a conspiracy on something i knew a lot about i think it would fall apart in two or three days . if this were an organised conspiracy there would be much more there .
