{"text": "smoking in a car carrying children will become a criminal offence after mps last night backed a ban in the commons by a large majority . in an historic vote , tory and lib dem mps backed plans to make it illegal to light up in a car in england , punishable by a # 60 fine or points on a motorist 's licence . it came after prime minister david cameron the ' time has come ' for a ban , brushing aside claims from his lib dem deputy nick clegg who branded the ban illiberal and unenforceable . mps have overwhelmingly backed a bill which will make smoking in cars containing children illegal by next year . the new law will apply to anyone carrying children in a car , not just parents . mps voted by 376 votes to 107 , majority 269 , in favour of an amendment to the children and families bill which gives the health secretary power to impose a ban . it is expected to come into effect before the election , most likely in april next year . the move was first introduced in the house of lords by the labour party , and coalition parties were given a free vote which means they can vote with their conscience and not the party line . during 90 minutes of debate in the commons supporters of the legislation insisted it was vital to protect children from the dangers of second hand smoke . tory health minister jane ellison said the success of the new law would be measured not by the number of fines issues but ' by the reduction in exposure to second-hand smoke ' . labour 's shadow health minister luciana berger labour mp luciana berger proposed the ban , arguing that laws governing seat belts and smoking in public places were criticised as unenforceable but had been very effective . she said last night : ` this is a great victory for child health which will benefit hundreds of thousands of young people across our country . it is a matter of child protection , not adult choice . ' deputy prime minister nick clegg -lrb- pictured visiting burrowbridge in somerset this morning -rrb- branded the law unenforceable and illiberal . mr clegg said the police could not be expected to enforce a ban on smoking in cars , likening it to controlling what children eat or watch on tv . but opponents said it was further evidence if the 'n anny state ' seeking to interfere in the private lives of drivers . tory . mp anne main condemned the ' illiberal , nonsensical legislation ' adding : . ' i fundamentally believe we should not be making bad , unenforceable . law . ' fellow conservative , shipley mp , philip davies said the law was ' yet another in a long line of triumphs for the nanny state ' . he . accused miss berger of representing the 's mug , patronising excesses of . new labour who think that the only reason they have come into parliament . is to ban everybody else from all the things that they do n't happen to . like themselves ' . just hours before tonight 's vote mr cameron gave the ban is support . lib dem chief secretary to the treasury said he would back the ban , putting him at odds with nick clegg . london mayor boris johnson said the ` bossyboots brigade ' were right to want to ban smoking in cars carrying children . three . years ago the prime minister said he was ` not sure whether it is . possible to legislate in that area ' and called for a ` change in . attitudes ' . earlier today lib dem health minister norman lamb said he hoped the ban would be law before the 2015 general election . but today downing street made clear that while mr cameron . understands the ' concerns ' that some have expressed , he believes that . ' the time for this kind of approach has come ' . however , mr cameron is spending 24 hours touring flood-hit communities in the south west so missed the vote . among . tories , health secretary jeremy hunt , transport secretary patrick . mcloughlin and education secretary michael give were among senior . ministers supporting a ban . london mayor boris johnson appealed to . fellow tories to accept that the ` bossyboots brigade ' he so often rails . against were right in this case . ' these kids can not protest , and very . often the smoker in the vehicle lacks the will to stub it out , ' he . wrote in the daily telegraph . ' this law would give that smoker that . extra legal imperative to obey their conscience and do the right thing . ' ahead of the vote senior tories including eric pickles and kenneth clarke voiced doubts about it . among . lib dems , mr clegg - who is a smoker - said that ` as an old-fashioned . liberal ' he believed that ` laws and legislation are not always the . solution ' . he said it was wrong to ` subcontract responsible parenting . to the state ' and likened it to the police going ` into people 's homes . and saying  turn the televisions off ' . however , lib dem chief secretary to the treasury danny alexander and lib dem health minister norman lamb backed the ban . ken clarke , the cigar-smoking minister without portfolio , said police would not spend their time checking if people were lighting up in cars . split : health secretary jeremy hunt said he . would back the ban , but lib . dem business secretary vince cable committed to voting against it . health secretary jeremy hunt is to back a ban , after previously warning it was not the state 's tole to dictate what people do in private . nick clegg , . the cigarette-smoking deputy prime minister : ` a family speeding along . the m4 and mum or dad are smoking , how on earth are you going to . properly enforce that ?

' communities secretary eric pickles : ` my initial intention is to vote against it . we should make things criminal if we feel that they are enforceable . ' public health minister jane ellison : ` we are not persuaded that legislation is the right way forward on that matter .
