{"text": "manchester united 's new kit contract has led to serious repercussions for andy murray , the england cricket team and rugby 's british and irish lions . all three have lost backing from adidas because of their # 750million investment in supplying united shirts from next season . adidas were not prepared to renew their shirt agreement with murray because of the increased cost , while the england cricket partnership has been greatly downgraded and might end early . and the german company have announced they will be ending their 18-year association with the lions -- despite replica shirts selling so well . manchester united 's adidas deal will begin next season , ending their association with nike . andy murray has already had his ties to adidas cut - the scot is now with american firm under armour . the massive price of winning the united deal from arch-rivals nike has meant adidas have had to re-evaluate the importance of other properties , with their funding focused on the core activities of football , fitness and running . american firm under armour , with whom murray signed when adidas did not meet his numbers , are also favourites to take over the lions contract for the next tour to new zealand in 2017 . the millennium stadium has always put on the best pre-match show in the six nations . but their impressive laser display last friday night can not be emulated by england rugby 2015 as it will be only dusk when the world cup opening ceremony finishes at twickenham around 7.30 pm on september 18 . instead they will utilise the pitch itself in way that does n't jeopardize the playing surface when england take on fiji half-an-hour later . the atmosphere at the millennium stadium was crackling with the pre-match pyrotechnics before the match . you ca n't get away with anything on social media , even if a tweet is more than two years old . a screen grab of foul-mouthed bbc rugby co-commentator brain moore 's response from january 2013 -- after being told by an astute armchair rugby viewer that he turns the sound off because of moore -- was retweeted hundreds of times during england 's win in cardiff on friday . the loveable moore -lrb- above -rrb- wrote : ` use the red button for the alternative commentary , you thick t *** . ' bbc would n't comment . brian moore - former england international - was caught out as twitter users retweeted an old comment . the signs are pointing to the premier league getting # 4billion from their seven tv packages , which are all expected to go to a second round of bidding today . sky , bt and the discovery channel are thought to be competing , with bein sport a possible contender as well . but the way first picks for games involving the top clubs have been contained within the four packages that sky are hell-bent on retaining might be the subject of contention . however , the premier league say they have spread the picks more equitably in the latest tender . blatter 's africa grovel . there was a clear subtext to sepp blatter accusing western media of dramatising the serious crowd violence that interrupted the africa cup of nations semi-final between ghana and equatorial guinea . blatter said : ` when something bad happens in europe , they say it 's an error . when something happens in africa , they begin talking about corruption . ' it 's safe to infer that blatter knows he will not get the uefa vote in may 's presidential election and instead wants to shore up support from africa by currying favour at every opportunity . sepp blatter -lrb- right -rrb- , pictured presenting the afcon 2015 trophy to ivory coast 's yaya toure on sunday . meanwhile , german newspaper der spiegel has alleged that lawyers acting for blatter removed some critical passages from governance committee chairman mark pieth 's report into fifa structures . before pieth 's findings were made public last year they were sent to marco villiger , fifa 's director of legal affairs , to ` check the facts ' . but villager 's 37 comments also asked for word changes and deletions regarding blatter 's conduct that were agreed by pieth , whose report shows the president in a remarkably good light . fifa say it is normal procedure . even when jose mourinho is back fulfilling his media obligations he likes to stir the mix . so he told bbc sport after chelsea 's win at aston villa that he likes them because they ` do not ask for players to be banned ' -- a clear reference to sky after the diego costa stamping incidents . mourinho was a sky ambassador when he called their coverage ` special ' . now he 's a well-remunerated bt representative .", "summary": " adidas have not renewed their shirt agreement with andy murray .   the england cricket team and the british and irish lions will also both lose adidas backing after manchester united 's # 750million backing .   rugby commentator brian moore was caught out by an old tweet , in which he swore at a user commenting on his broadcasting .   sepp blatter is trying to shore up support from africa by currying favour .
