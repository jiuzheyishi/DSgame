{"text": "even though she was 19 and he was 45 , sultry lauren bacall and gritty humphrey bogart were meant for each other . but they were meant for others too . throughout their marriage bogie carried on an affair with a mexican starlet turned secretary . and bacall - known as betty to their pals - fell madly in love with frank sinatra and began a steamy relationship with him while bogie was on his death bed with throat cancer . bacall , who died at her home in los angeles on tuesday of a stroke , fell in with a fast crowd when she wed bogart . ` i knew everybody because i was married to bogie , and that 25-year difference was the most fantastic thing for me to have in my life , ' she said . the most famous actors , writers , artists were now in her inner circle because of they sought out her husband . scroll down for video . ring a ding ding : lauren bacall began her tumultuous affair with frank sinatra when humphrey bogart was dying of cancer . they went public with their romance after bogie died . threesome : did bogie know that his wife was destined to sleep with his close friend ? bacall says that bogie knew how much she loved to spend time with sinatra - and that sinatra was in love with her . bogie and bacall formed a group they called the holmby hills rat pack -- a branch of the famed las vegas tribe , named after the neighborhood bordering beverly hills and bel air . it was a tight inner circle of stars dedicated to drinking , laughing and partying into the wee hours . sinatra was pack master ; judy garland , first vice-president ; sid luft , judy 's husband , the cage master ; superagent irving ` swifty ' lazar was recording secretary ; novelist nathaniel benchley , historian ; and bacall , den mother . they were constantly together . once , after a new year 's party in palm springs , bacall , known as ` betty ' , wanted she and bogie to stay and hang out with frank , since the blue-eyed crooner did not have a woman with him that night . bogie insisted they go home and told her , ' you must always remember we have a life of our own that has nothing to do with frank . he chose to live the way he 's living -- alone . it 's too bad if he 's lonely , but that 's his choice . we have our road to travel , never forget that -- we ca n't live his life ' , writes biographer kitty kelley . when bogie learned he had throat cancer in february 1956 , the diagnosis , surgery and radiation came too late and one of hollywood 's biggest stars was told he had less than a year to live . sinatra , came to visit him frequently , kept him laughing by recounting the practical jokes going on with the other rat pack members . out and about : betty and frank were seen together at restaurants , premieres , dinner parties and weekends in palm springs . she was deeply in love and wanted to marry him . ` it was n't easy for him , ' kelley quotes bacall . ` i do n't think he could bear to see bogie that way or bear to face the possibility of his death . yet he cheered bogie up when he was with him -- made him laugh -- kept the ring-a-ding act in high gear for him ' . sinatra worshipped bogart but there was also something brewing between the singer and bacall . they were falling in love while bogie was dying of cancer . by october , eight months later , to celebrate bacall 's thirty-second birthday , frank sent a chartered plane to los angeles to fly some of their closest friends to the sands in vegas where he was playing at the time . bogie chose to stay in los angeles and spend it with his son . ` he was somewhat jealous of frank ' , bacall admitted . ` partly because he knew i loved being with him , partly because he thought frank was in love with me , and partly because our physical life together , which had always ranked high , had less than flourished with his illness ' . ` this was the closest bacall ever came to admitting her passion for frank during the time that her husband was dying , ' writes kelley . ` it was no secret to any of us ' , said playwright ketti frings . ` everybody knew about betty and frank . we just hoped bogie would n't find out . that would have been more killing than throat cancer ' . when bogart died in january 1957 , frank was performing at the copa nightclub in new york . he cancelled his appearances but did not fly to the west coast for the funeral of the man he had adored . ` he pleaded laryngitis , but close friends suspected that he had developed a crippling case of ` the guilt germs ' . soon their love affair was out in the open and betty and frank were seen about town , at premieres , dinner parties and weekends in palm springs . smooth sailing : until bogart was diagnosed with lung cancer in february 1956 the couple were deliriously happy . bacall admitted that they had a great sex life until he got sick . mistress : verita bouvair thompson , who traveled with bogart as his personal secretary , bartender and hairdresser , held two of bogie 's secrets - he wore a toupee . she was his mistress for seventeen years and wrote about their love story in her 1982 book bogie and me . ` it seemed to everyone -- to his friends , to mine -- that we were crazy about each other , that we were a great pair ; that it would n't last ; that frank would never be able to remain constantly devoted , monogamous -- yet that maybe with me , he would ' , betty said . what followed was months of an ` erratic ' courtship with frank - wildly attentive one minute and distant the next . he did n't want any woman telling him what to do and bacall admitted she was n't one to mildly suggest anything . she was deeply in love with the crooner and wanted to marry him . on the evening of march 11 , 1958 , fourteen months after her husband 's death , frank proposed . they celebrated by going to the imperial gardens restaurant on sunset boulevard with agent and friend , swifty lazar . when a young girl approached the table asking for autographs , sinatra urged her to sign ` betty sinatra ' . he was off to a gig in miami the next day and bacall went to the theatre with lazar where a newspaper columnist asked her about an impending marriage . she admitted the truth and by the next morning , the world knew when the morning paper 's early edition headlines read : sinatra to marry bacall . that was the death knell for the relationship . sinatra was livid when she phoned him in miami . when he finally returned her call days later , he said he was besieged with reporters and could n't leave his hotel room . that was the last time bacall heard from sinatra . ` he did n't speak to her again for six years , and then only in rage ' . when asked about the marriage , his only reply was ` marriage ? what for ? just so i 'd have to go home earlier every night ? nuts ! ' when actress ava gardner , sinatra 's first wife , called him from spain , he told her , ` jesus . i was never going to marry that pushy female ' . bacall 's response to the too-brief engagement was to call him ` a s *** ' and suggest she was so insecure at the time it was pathetic . for years , bacall never escaped the perception of the great love affair between her and humphrey bogart even when she married her second husband , jason robards . bust up : when betty spilled the beans that the crooner had proposed to a newspaper and it splashed a headline on the front page , sinatra was incensed . they split soon after and frank did n't speak to bacall for six years . she also never escaped the revelation that bogart had a mistress throughout their marriage . verita bouvair thompson , who traveled with bogart as his personal secretary , bartender and hairdresser , held two of bogie 's secrets -- he wore a toupee and she was his mistress for seventeen years . the mexican starlet met bogart at an after party for casablanca in 1942 , two years before he met bacall . thompson had established herself in hollywood as an expert on toupees , preparing hairpieces for george raft , ray milland and gary cooper -- as well as bogart . bogie did n't like to dance , but honey , we danced the night away and from that day on we were lovers ' , she stated . ` it 's hard for people to accept that bogie and bacall myth was n't really what it was ' , according to dean shapiro , a writer and thompson 's boyfriend . ` they were supposed to be this great hollywood couple , but bogie was carrying on with verita on the side . they did a lot of crazy things together ' . bacall had a secret of her own when she came to hollywood . she was a nice jewish girl but concealed it . ` there was anti-semitism in hollywood and i was terribly frightened . i was nineteen and was n't exactly swimming in self confidence . it 's one area of my life i am not proud of ' . when she fell in love with bogart , she made sure he knew but then he was the last man on earth who would have cared . bacall lived her life out at a luxurious , cavernous apartment on a high floor of the dakota , the grand residential building overlooking central park on manhattan 's upper west side where john lennon was living when he was shot down by david chapman in 1980 . she often ventured out always wearing all black , a black shirt , black pants and black orthopedic shoes -- always accompanied by her ` friend ' , her aluminum walker with tennis balls on its feet.still outspoken and feisty in her final years . after bacall 's marriage to jason robards broke down because of his drinking , she was linked with james garner , the ruggedly handsome star of rockford files , during his second separation from his wife in 1979 . garner died just a month before bacall .", "summary": " lauren bacall , humphrey bogart and frank sinatra were close pals , part of the ` holmby hills rat pack '   bacall knew bogie was jealous of frank , ` partly because he knew i loved being with him , partly because .   he thought frank was in love with me '   they began an affair when bogie was stricken with cancer , and ` came out ' as a couple after he died .   ` it seemed to everyone that we were crazy about each other ... that it would n't last ; that frank would never be able to be ... monogamous '   frank proposed at a restaurant on sunset boulevard , then dumped her like a hot potato .
