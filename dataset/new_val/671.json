' i also played in the europa league and when you arrive back on friday it is not the best way to prepare . manuel pellegrini says liverpool 's europa league exploits gives man city an advantage for sunday 's clash . dejan lovren missed the decisive penalty kick as liverpool were knocked out of the europa league . ` you can not prepare the game because you finish on thursday night and you must play on sunday , the players need at least 48 hours to recover .
