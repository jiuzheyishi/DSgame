' i accept reform is not easy . but there has to be a smarter and more compassionate way of differentiating between those that can not work and those that do not want to work . ' i am in favour of welfare reform but trying to bulldoze through changes in a reckless and insensitive way is not the right way to go about it .

' jobseeker 's allowance claimants are expected to actively look for employment and attend an assessment after 13 weeks out of work . if the claimants are struggling with their search , they should develop skills and experience to help them find work , and are expected to ` work for their benefits ' , even if it means working for free . otherwise , their benefits might stop . however , it may be possible to get hardship payments whilst their jobseeker 's allowance is stopped . claimants should ask their jobcentre to find out .", "summary": " sheila holt , who is bipolar , lost her income support and ` became terrified '   she was sectioned under the mental health act and suffered heart attack .   then received letter from government-contracted healthcare firm atos .   father says back-to-work scheme is ` unfair ' to those with mental illness .   case has now been taken up by labour 's rochdale mp simon danczuk .
