{"text": "the organisers of the newly-formed european rugby champions cup -- formerly the heineken cup -- have promised to deliver more money for england 's aviva premiership clubs and a more attractive competition for fans . the popular tournament came perilously close to folding last season following a bitter dispute over the distribution of revenue as english clubs refused to continue under terms they saw as being grossly unfair . wasps , saracens , northampton , bath , leicester , harlequins and sale will take part in new tournament . the tournament was saved following a carefully negotiated settlement between broadcasters bt sport and sky . bruce craig - one of the executive directors of the newly slimmed down competition which begins a week on friday -- insists the new deal will see more revenue for england 's top clubs . ` after 19 years we have now reached a position where the clubs are in control of their financial future , ' he said . ` we have increased the television money -lrb- with bt sport -rrb- by 60 per cent to around # 17.4 million over four years . that 's a significant uplift on the turnover of last year 's competition . ' teams from england , france , ireland , italy , scotland and wales will contest european rugby champions cup . there is a new business model with five prospective sponsorship slots and craig believes it is a matter of time before more big-name companies join heineken in backing the tournament . he added : ` it 's a complicated position because the tv rights were n't in place . they are now . there 's been a lot of interest from a lot of big multi-national companies . we are very confident of bringing in more partners over the next 12 months . ' tournament organisers are also pushing for an end-of-season clash between the winners of the ercc and the southern hemisphere 's super rugby competition . ` if we get the approval for it we 're not very far away , ' said aviva premiership boss mark mccafferty . craig doyle of bt sport -lrb- left -rrb- and alex payne of sky sports rugby at the media launch of tournament . ` it 's always a calendar issue . personally i do n't think we 're that far off because the public want to see us . the unanswered question at club and provincial level is ` who is top dog in the world ? ' meanwhile , bath expect it will take rugby-league convert sam burgess at least a fortnight before he is given the all-clear to fly back to england from australia following surgery on a double facial fracture sustained in sunday 's nrl grand final . burgess is not expected to play for bath before christmas . bath boss mike ford said : ` he 's come out of surgery . it 's good , it 's gone well . they 're just sitting around figuring out when he can travel . it 's a minimum of two weeks . just the return to training and taking contact , we have n't got that date yet .
