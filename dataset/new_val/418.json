' i opened my eyes and could n't see my brother , but i saw a train in front of me with the door open and for some reason i thought he was on board , ' he said . ' i ran over and jumped on the train just as the doors closed and pulled out of the station , and it was only then that i realised he was n't there . i think you could say that split-second decision changed my life forever .

' he followed the person just a few yards around a corner , to where three ladies stood at the entrance to a house . one of them was his mother , fatima . ' i looked at the second one and i thought , ` there 's something about you ' - and it took me a few seconds but i decrypted what she used to looked like , ' he said . ` she looked so much shorter than i remembered when i was a four-year-old child . ` but she walked forward , and i walked forward , and my emotions and tears and the chemical in my brain , you know , it was like a nuclear fusion .
