{"text": "harry redknapp called it , when he said arsenal were his dark horses for the champions league . praise from an unlikely source given he was manager of their bitter rivals tottenham less than three years ago . recent history would suggest redknapp is wrong - they have exited the competition at the last-16 stage in their previous four seasons - but arsenal appear poised to amount a serious assault on one of the few trophies to elude manager arsene wenger during his 18 years at the club . arsenal players celebrate during the 2-1 win against crystal palace at selhurst park on saturday . arsene wenger 's side appear to be mounting a serious challenge for the champions league this season . alexis sanchez celebrates arsenal 's victory over crystal palace in his underwear with his team-mates . getting into their stride . like a nervous-yet-primed 100m sprinter , arsenal have uncurled from their delayed push out of the starting blocks and are starting to open out and power towards the finish line . perfect timing for a champions league charge . they have won 10 of their last 12 matches in all competitions and are on a run of nine straight home wins , which began back in november . hitting form has coincided with olivier giroud netting eight in his past 11 games , taking some of the pressure off free-scoring alexis sanchez . french striker olivier giroud has scored eight goals in his past 11 games for the gunners . dat guy welbz . back in february 2013 , sir alex ferguson surprised many when he included danny welbeck , facing a difficult second season after breaking into the manchester united first team and up until that point have only scored once , to face real madrid at the bernabeu in the first leg of their knockout double header . welbeck responded brilliantly . he upstaged wayne rooney after scoring early on from his team-mate 's corner in a 1-1 draw . ferguson said afterwards : ` they found it difficult to handle him . he was marvellous . he worked so hard . ' his work-rate , which often comes at the detriment to goals , should not be underestimated and could prove crucial in key champions league ties . danny welbeck -lrb- right -rrb- should not be underestimated and his work-rate could prove crucial in europe . luck of the draw . arsenal only finished runners-up in their group and could have faced atletico madrid , real madrid , monaco , bayern munich , barcelona or porto . the french ligue 1 side are arguably the easiest draw of the lot . liverpool , chelsea and manchester united have all demonstrated in previous years that a sprinkle of the magic stuff can help to win the competition . it takes monumental comebacks , penalty shootout victories or sometimes two goals deep into stoppage-time to win europe 's greatest club competition . drawing monaco could be the bit of luck arsenal need . drawing monaco and dimitar berbatov could be the bit of luck arsenal need to progress to the quarter-finals . coq-a-hoop . arsene wenger has been delighted with the emergence of defensive midfielder francis coquelin from exiled to exceptional . he appeared on his way out of the club until a spate of injuries forced wenger 's hand . coquelin has excelled , mopping up in front of the back four . arsenal have so many midfield options , but the problem is none of them want to defend and coquelin is the enforcer they were so badly lacking . he was offered a new contract in january , which he signed this month . ' i saw that he made huge improvements in training so i sent him on loan for match practice , ' wenger said . ` he took that challenge and he 's done very well . he is a long-term solution . ' francis coquelin -lrb- right -rrb- has been a revelation for arsenal in recent weeks and is seen as a long-term solution . injuries abating . fourteen players have missed chunks of this season with injuries this season . fourteen . that 's almost an entire starting xi and substitutes bench . and most of them have been first-team players . they 'll have to get a revolving door installed in the treatment room fairly soon if this continues . but key players are returning and the pressure is easing on the final run-in . alex oxlade-chamberlain , aaron ramsey and jack wilshere are all on their way back and theo walcott is playing again after a year out . they have also missed the likes of mesut ozil , giroud and laurent koscielny who are now back to full fitness . alex oxlade-chamberlain is back training again while theo walcott is playing after a year out through injury .", "summary": " arsenal have exited the champions league in last-16 in last four seasons .   harry redknapp said arsenal were ` dark horses ' for the tournament .   gunners have a good chance after being drawn against monaco .   olivier giroud has scored eight goals in his last 11 games for arsenal .   alex oxlade-chamberlain , jack wilshere and theo walcott returning .   danny welbeck 's work-rate could be crucial in final stages .   read : arsene wenger is not taking his former side monaco lightly .   click here for all the latest arsenal news .
