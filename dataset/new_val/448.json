{"text": "samantha lewthwaite -- the ` white widow ' being hunted in the wake of the nairobi mall massacre -- is secretly married to a former officer in the kenyan navy , a confidential scotland yard file on her reveals . the dossier throws new light on the shadowy world of the mother of four who converted to islam as a schoolgirl and is now the world 's most wanted woman . as well as being the suspected mastermind behind the westgate mall attack , which killed 67 people and left 71 missing and 200 injured , she is sought for earlier plots in her role as a major player in al qaeda 's somali offshoot , al shabaab . new union : samantha lewthwaite , pictured in a selfie from a personal computer found by police at the house she was renting in mombasa , is married to a kenyan former navy officer . muslim convert lewthwaite , 29 , widow of 7/7 suicide bomber jermaine lindsay , left britain for africa with her children in 2009 and has been on the run for 20 months . but a mail on sunday investigation can reveal that her current husband -- a man named abdi wahid who in his 40s -- has been free to travel as he wishes , and is currently in continental europe . wahid was arrested in 2011 when police discovered that his house in the coastal city of mombasa had been turned into a potential bomb factory by lewthwaite and her associates . he was never charged with any offence . exactly how much he knew of his wife 's clandestine activities is not clear but detectives now believe he could hold the key to unlocking her network of terror . it is not known exactly when their marriage took place , but lewthwaite had evidently left her old life in britain behind by then and was deeply involved with al shabaab . a grainy image taken from lewthwaite 's computer shows a man holding a baby , believed to be her youngest daughter surajah , which could be the child 's father . police say wahid is likely to have a better knowledge of lewthwaite 's travels and contacts and , most of all , her possible current whereabouts than anyone . his relationship with lewthwaite has baffled detectives , given his military background and because he once worked as a private security officer in afghanistan , guarding westerners against attack from the taliban . previously he has been described as lewthwaite 's ` landlord ' at one of two houses where she stayed in mombasa until she came to police attention in january 2012 . but the dossier leaves no room for doubt that lewthwaite is or was ` married to ' wahid , making his freedom to travel at will all the more surprising . it is believed he has another muslim wife in mombasa . lewthwaite 's two elder children , nine-year-old abdullah and ruqayyah , eight , both by lindsay , have the middle names shaheed and shahidah , respectively , which means ` martyr ' in the male and female form , according to the police data . it is not clear who fathered her two younger children , four-year-old abdur-rahman and surajah , three , though it is believed that at one stage lewthwaite was in a relationship with another british al shabaab recruit , hounslow-born habib saleh ghani , 28 . he is thought to have been killed earlier this month in somalia following a gunfight with a rival group . the police file , codenamed operation unigof , includes an ` association chart ' . at its centre are lewthwaite and british terror suspect jermaine grant , 30 , from newham , east london . he is a muslim convert who knew lewthwaite 's husband lindsay , and is currently on trial in mombasa on explosives charges . there are extensive details of all the mobile phone numbers linked with lewthwaite , along with calls she has made to a woman , described in a police file as her ` aunt ' , at an address in solihull , birmingham . last week the woman , who recently married , was on holiday and could not be contacted . exactly what her relationship is to irish-born lewthwaite , the daughter of a northern irish catholic mother and a british soldier , is unclear , but there is no suggestion she had anything to do with her activities . the police document suggests that lewthwaite may have called the ` aunt ' from kenya as many as 42 times -- the last four in november 2011 and january 2012 , shortly before she went on the run . all the calls went to voicemail . the yard file was compiled in the days following lewthwaite 's narrow escape from police in 2011 , a story that can now be revealed fully for the first time . the first arrest in the chain of events came in december 2011 when grant was detained with another man at the mombasa house owned by abdi wahis , a few miles from the house lewthwaite was living in . at grant 's place , police found ingredients needed to make a bomb -- hydrogen peroxide and ammonium nitrate , as well as batteries and electrical switches . a kenyan police source told the mail on sunday that after being held in a cell without food for three days , grant finally talked . he told the officers that they should be talking to his ` boss ' -- a white woman -- and supplied addresses , including the property where lewthwaite was staying . sharing the other house with lewthwaite was nassim salim , 27 , the widow of mussa hussein abdi , an al qaeda agent killed in mogadishu in 2011 . yet when officers raided the house , lewthwaite convinced them that she was a south african named natalie faye webb . she had a bogus passport , obtained by using another woman 's birth certificate . mujahideen mum : an image of lewthwaite , who has named two of her children for the arab word for ` martyr ' , seen with a baby , believed to be her youngest child . a bag of money with thousands of pounds worth of assorted foreign currencies was also found at the house , but even that was n't suspicious enough to persuade the police to bring her in . instead , they took a copy of the passport and left . when they updated scotland yard , one of the london detectives realised that the woman posing as natalie webb was lewthwaite . the kenyans returned to the house the next day , but she had gone . before her escape she had tried to destroy her laptop by smashing it , but a few days later a metropolitan police unit was able to retrieve vital data from it . among photographs on the laptop was one of her holding a bain another photograph an unidentified man -- possibly the father -- is seen holding the baby . also found was an exercise book in which lewthwaite had begun writing a book , based on interviews with fellow ` mujahideen ' . she related how she had asked her elder children what they wanted to be when they grew up and both answered ` holy warriors ' . further investigations showed that lewthwaite had entered kenya from tanzania on february 26 , 2011 , and that in 2010 and 2011 she had spent several months in johannesburg working as an it specialist at a halal meat factory , posing as natalie webb . the real natalie webb is a nurse who emigrated from south africa to essex . the last recorded use of the false passport was in february 2011 , before it was cancelled -- the month that lewthwaite entered kenya . l samantha lewthwaite 's mother , christine allen , is desperate to see her grandchildren , her extended family have said . her plea came through jermaine lindsay 's mother , maryam mcleod ismaiyl , who told the
