' the mp said such people were not welcome in the conservative party and insisted he was glad they had been driven out by ukip . ` in many ways ukip have done us an enormous favour because they 're cleansing people from the tory party that had these kinds of views , which is great because i do n't want people who have those kinds of views in my party . so good luck to them , really , ' mr halfon told political magazine the house . his incendiary attack on nigel . farage 's party , in the run-up to the european elections in may , prompted . an angry reaction from ukip and will divide opinion on the conservative . benches . the tory . leadership has fought shy of making direct attacks on ukip since david . cameron prompted a backlash by dismissing the party 's representatives as . ` fruitcakes , loonies and closet racists ' in 2006 . party strategists . warned that such remarks risked backfiring and playing into ukip hands . but . some senior tories now appear to have decided to confront the party , . which says it is on course to top the polls in elections to the european . parliament on may 22 , more aggressively . defence . minister anna soubry launched a blistering attack on mr farage when the . pair recently appeared on the bbc 's question time , accusing him of . putting ` fear in people 's hearts ' by scaremongering about immigration . one . tory minister said many in the party had been ` appalled ' by a recent . ratcheting up of ukip rhetoric , particularly at its spring conference . last weekend . mr farage used the gathering in torquay to express his . alarm at hearing foreign languages spoken when he travelled by train . but . the ukip leader attacked mr halfon for directing ` hysterical slurs ' at . ukip and its members and said he intended to step up campaigning in his . constituency of harlow . last year in the county council elections , ukip scored between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of the votes cast in the seat . mr farage said : ` mr halfon 's . hysterical slurs are the result of a growing tory terror of ukip 's . rising popularity all over the country . ` because . i believe in taking politics and the big arguments directly to the . people , ukip will now be having a national action day in harlow . let the . voters of harlow hear what we have got to say . i know that many of them . are already flocking to our side . ` as . we approach the next general election , we will also consider whether to . add harlow to our target seat list given the positive response of . people in the town to our message . ' mr halfon said ukip members were either comedy characters like the party 's former mep godfrey bloom , -lrb- left -rrb- or had more extreme views , such as ukip immigration spokesman gerard batten -lrb- right -rrb- , who believes that british muslims should sign a special code of conduct rejecting violence . ukip euro election candidate patrick . o'flynn said : ` ukip is the only party that believes in standing up for . ordinary people by supporting border controls , whilst mr halfon 's party . continues to back uncontrolled mass immigration from the eu with no . volume control and no quality control either . ` mr . halfon 's idea that a party led by david cameron and george osborne will . ever appeal to ordinary working families is deluded . but it is a shame . to see him resort to gutter politics in a desperate bid to save his seat . at next year 's general election .
