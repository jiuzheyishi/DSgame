{"text": "blow : alex salmond , the snp leader , whose claims scotland would not have to apply to join groups such as the eu are sounding increasingly unlikely -lrb- file picture -rrb- . if scotland voted for independence it could have to re-apply to a whole host of international organisations including the eu and the world bank , laywers said . it would also have to renegotiate 14,000 international treaties , according to legal advice commissioned by whitehall . the report is a huge blow to alex salmond , the snp leader , whose claims scotland would not have to apply to join groups such as the eu are sounding increasingly unlikely . the legal advice concludes that scotland would become a ` new state ' while the remaining united kingdom would be considered a ` continuing state ' . so if scotland seceded , only the rest of the uk would continue to have the same rights , obligations and powers under international law . the uk is a party to 14,000 treaties and is a member of groups such as the un , the eu , nato , interpol and the international monetary fund . the 57-page report , written by professors james crawford and alan boyle , raises the prospect that scotland will have to apply to re-join many of these if it votes for independence in a referendum next year . david cameron said : ` those glorious olympics last summer reminded us just what we were capable of when we pull together : scottish , english , welsh , northern irish , all in the same boat -- sometimes literally . if you told many people watching those olympics around the world that we were going to erect barriers between our people , they 'd probably be baffled . put simply : britain works . britain works well . why break it ? ' addressing matters of the ` heart and head ' , mr cameron said britain has built up ` world-renowned ' institutions such as the nhs and bbc , and ` fought for freedom in two world wars , leaving ` unbreakable bonds ' . he said : ' i have no time for those who say there is no way scotland could go it alone . ' i know first-hand the contribution scotland and scots make to britain 's success - so for me there 's no question about whether scotland could be an independent nation . ` the real question is whether it should - whether scotland is stronger , safer , richer and fairer within our united kingdom or outside it . ' scotland 's deputy first minister , nicola sturgeon , said mr cameron had simply reminded people that ` he heads a government that scotland did n't vote for and that independence is the only way to ensure that scotland always gets the government it votes for ' . a report from the first minister 's council of economic advisers suggested scotland should retain sterling as currency in the event of independence . holding on to the pound would also benefit the rest of the uk as a key trading partner , the report concludes . professor crawford , of cambridge university , is an australian state counsel , similar to a qc . professor boyle is an expert on international disputes . their opinion was requested last year by the foreign and cabinet offices in london and the advocate general office in edinburgh . agreement : if scotland gained independence , following a referendum agreed by alex salmond and david cameron last year , scotland would have to renegotiate 14,000 international treaties .", "summary": " scotland would have to re-apply to organisations including eu .   remainder of uk would continue to have same international powers .   report is ` huge blow ' to alex salmond .
