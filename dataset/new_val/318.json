{"text": "if a male-only social network was launched that let men rate their former conquests in terms of attractiveness and sexual ability , it probably would n't go down very well . but somehow , a female-only equivalent is ok . luluvise.com , which went live yesterday , is a social network , described as ` sex and the city marries facebook ' - and it bans boys . latest internet craze ? entrepreneur alexandra chong has set up luluvise.com , a social network that is just for women . it connects through your facebook . profile - although does not let any of your facebook friends know that you have connected . ` luluvise uses facebook to make registration easier . we do not post to walls or make luluvise information public anywhere or to other facebook users , ' creator alexandra chong explained . once you 've logged on you can see what other women have . said about your potential love interests . the site does serve other functions too - you can use it to send messages , photos or polls to groups of female bffs -lrb- ` best friends forever ' -rrb- . but that is only likely to take off if people flock to the ` wikidate database ' . rate after dating : the site 's most interesting - and controversial - feature lets women secretly rate their past conquests . harsh ? luluvise lets you describe your first kiss with a former squeeze as ` slobber city ' - or amazing . this is internet dating 2.0 - in that the first men that pop up are the ones who are already your friends on facebook . but they will never know that you have rated them , and neither will anyone else . some of the ratings do seem a little harsh . particularly the ones that invite you to rate your first kiss as ` slobber city ' , or to summarise your sex life as ` all i could could think was ...  is he into girls ?  . ' but getting an insight into your male friends ' romantic lives - even if you have no interest in bagging them at all - is bound to be popular . not fair ? men can not even see their ratings - unless they create a fake facebook profile in which they pretend to be a woman . the website , set up by canadian entrepreneur alexandra chong , 30 , in london , is already all over twitter . cosmopolitan uk tweeted : ` if carrie bradshaw had signed up to #luluvise , it would 've saved her a lot of heartache ! ' men are unsurprisingly hankering to join . more than 500 boys have already submitted their . emails to get access to the site , but instead received an email reading : ` hey dude , you 're a dude . ' circle of friends : the site also lets you set up a network of ` bffs ' who you can collectively ask questions , send messages and send photos . it is possible for men to get around the ban and see what women are saying about them - with a little dedication . they need to set up a fake facebook profile as a woman , and make friends with themselves on that social network . then , when they log onto luluvise , their own ratings will pop straight up . but they will not be able to see private conversations . however , luluvise has set up a series of strict rules in the backend technology that should prevent any fake facebook accounts from accessing the site . the site 's first 1,000 legitimate users came from across the globe , with 69 countries represented on the platform . the majority were split across the us , uk and canada .", "summary": " luluvise connects though facebook .   database of doom - discover how a guy has been rated .
