{"text": "dear west ham fans , . in my very first column of the season , i wrote that i feared for your team . i was worried that the inconsistencies of the previous campaign , the quality of the performances and the value of the summer signings meant you would flirt with relegation and i predicted you would finish fourth from bottom . after all the stick i got over the years at upton park i find it very hard to apologise to any west ham fan but , i am happy to admit just this once , that i was wrong about your team . hitting form : west ham 's run of four wins in february saved them from relegation . by sunday night west ham will still be in the premier league and comfortably clear of the relegation zone . i could not see that happening at the start of the season . the club and sam allardyce have proved me wrong . even though his imminent sacking may not come as a surprise , it shows a disappointing lack of loyalty from the west ham board . what kind of message does it send to a prospective new manager when you ditch a man who has achieved everything asked of him ? at times the football has not been pretty but allardyce masterminded three big wins over tottenham and a crucial 0-0 draw at chelsea . that result sent west ham on a four-match winning streak -- their first in seven years -- and was the run that saved their season and kept them up . it is admirable allardyce got the chance to see things through , especially with other clubs sacking managers for fun -- the bottom three have had seven between them this season -- and he has managed in a bullish manner throughout . on his way : sam allardyce is understood to be nearing an exit from upton park . they have survived quite comfortably in the end , but there have been problems . andy carroll , who allardyce signed for record money , has scored only twice and his injury saga was a real concern . the away form has barely improved since last season , either . but sam is a troubleshooter , the kind of man clubs turn to for a quick fix . now west ham 's problem of survival has been solved , the fans and the club are ready for a change . allardyce will feel aggrieved he lost his job over the brand of football rather than results , but all is not lost . tony pulis was sacked by stoke in similar circumstances but has evolved and enhanced his reputation with crystal palace . if this is the end for sam , he can easily do the same thing at another top club . west ham fans are purists and want their team to play with flair , but we have not seen that for a few generations and any transition will not happen overnight . out ! west ham fans let their frustration out on the manager after defeat to west brom . the team are set up for matt jarvis and stewart downing to find carroll with crosses . the new boss will have to make the most of the players he has , making tweaks to the way they play rather having a radical overhaul . for all the desire to play more attractive football , sacking allardyce is a huge gamble . the club will want to be a premier league side when they move into the olympic stadium in 2016 and sam could have provided that stability . he achieved all that was asked and usually in business if you meet your objectives , you keep your job . but for west ham fans football is an entertainment business and they do not feel entertained . it is not a decision that will be taken lightly , but when allardyce was booed by his own fans , it was the beginning of the end . it was never an easy relationship but now it 's up to the board to find a new man who fits the bill . fresh new start : a new manager could drive west ham up the league next season . in the spotlight : yaya toure , age 30 , manchester city . he may not be the most original pick for spotlight but when yaya toure said he did not receive enough recognition earlier this season , i could not agree more . there is a lot of talk at the moment about the development of young english players but any youngster will only take inspiration from what toure is doing on and off the pitch . he is one of the most humble people i 've met in football , he is a team player first and foremost and his individual ability is unquestioned . underrated : yaya toure has not received the praise he deserves after another superb season . it is rare to find a player who so perfectly mixes pace , power and technique . he can finish like a forward and defend like a centre half , as he proved for barcelona in the 2009 champions league final . if city are struggling to score on sunday , it will probably be yaya who pops up with a winner . if he keeps it up i might say he is better than my old team-mate patrick vieira . but he 's still got some work to do to match the fantastic frenchman .", "summary": " the club and sam allardyce have proved me wrong , it shows a disappointing lack of loyalty to sack sam allardyce .   by sunday night west ham will be comfortably clear from relegation .   the football has not always been pretty , but he masterminded huge wins .   yaya toure does not get the recognition he deserves in the premier league .
