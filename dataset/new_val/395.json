' the archbishop is the head of the worldwide anglican communion , which has nearly 80million worshippers and is highly influential in countries in africa and asia where the confrontation between islam and christianity is often violent . celebration : but gay marriage poses a danger to anglicans in countries such as south sudan and pakistan , mr welby said . one caller on the phone-in show was former tory mp ann widdecombe , who left the church of england for the roman catholic church in 1993 after the cofe chose to ordain women as priests . miss widdecombe suggested to the archbishop that his ` heart has just sunk ' after hearing her voice . she said she left the cofe partly because it ` never seems to know what it thinks about anything ' . he replied : ` i think i 'm right , you think i 'm wrong . we differ .
