{"text": "john carver insists boardroom intervention did not play a part in the u-turn which has seen cancer-survivor jonas gutierrez return to newcastle 's first-team squad . the head coach said last week that the 31-year-old was not ready to play barclays premier league football having been given the all-clear from testicular for the second time in november . gutierrez responded to those comments by declaring earlier this week that it was down to the club 's board -- owner mike ashley and managing director lee charnley -- as to whether he played again . jonas gutierrez -lrb- right -rrb- will return to the newcastle first team again after overcoming testicular cancer . john carver revealed on thursday that the winger will be involved when aston villa visit st james ' park . the winger 's situation is complicated by a clause in his contract -- which expires in the summer -- stating that eight appearances this season triggers a one-year extension . newcastle allowed him to return to argentina earlier this month for talks with former club velez sarsfield , only for those to break down at the last minute . but now the magpies say gutierrez is fit enough to rejoin the senior set-up and will take his place on the bench for the first time in 15 months when they entertain aston villa on saturday . ` i know all the rumours have been out there about whether it 's mike or lee 's decision , but let me tell you , and let me put the record straight , i 've had no conversations with either of them about jonas , because i 'm the one who picks the team , ' said carver when pressed on gutierrez 's claims . ` i will be the one who decides if he is ready for it , and he is ready to go on the bench now . ` he was just assuming that -lrb- the board were responsible -rrb- . i do n't know why he said what he did but we 've had the conversation now and i 've put the record straight . gutierrez in training with newcastle on thursday in preparation for their weekend match with aston villa . newcastle 's manager insisted the board have no say when it comes to picking the team . ` he obviously thinks that they 're making the decision , but it 's me , it 's my decision and it was a decision based on football alone . ' politics aside , gutierrez will be afforded an emotional welcome should he emerge from the bench . and carver believes his presence can lift a team whose season is in danger of petering out . ` listen , i 'm telling you now , when we announce the team at the weekend and our fans hear that jonas is on the bench , can you imagine the feeling in the stadium ? ' he said . ` there is going to be a feel-good factor . ' carver added : ` to actually come back and play in the premier league again would be magnificent . he 's had a hard fight . gutierrez , pictured here in august 2013 , has not played for newcastle since the 2013-14 season . carver takes a training session ahead of the visit of tim sherwood 's aston villa on saturday . ` when i first saw him -lrb- in december -rrb- i was really concerned , but i suppose that 's natural because he has come from a serious illness . ` over the weeks he has got fitter and stronger . yesterday , more than any other , i have seen the old jonas gutierrez , and that was the first time i 've seen that . ' gutierrez will almost certainly be released by united at the end of the season , seven years after signing from real mallorca . but carver has not closed the door on a new deal . ` he 's been fighting his illness and also fighting for his career . in those terms it 's an important time for him , ' he said . ` how long has he got left ? three months ? so every opportunity he gets he 'll want to prove a point . whether that is to us about getting a new contract , or whether it 's to go somewhere else . ` that determination could be what drives him forward , but it could also help us .
