{"text": "young people who keep their hearts healthy may be less likely to suffer alzheimer 's in later life , say researchers . they found those with healthier levels of blood pressure , blood sugar and cholesterol in their 20s had better brain function 25 years later . people with small signs of deteriorating heart health when young were less likely to score well in cognitive tests in middle-age . an elderly woman suffering from alzheimer 's disease , in a residential home specialising in the care of people with dementia -lrb- file picture -rrb- . study author dr kristine yaffe , a neuropsychiatrist , epidemiologist and professor at the university of california-san francisco , said : ` it 's amazing that as a young adult , mildly elevated cardiovascular risks seem to matter for your brain health later in life . ` we 're not talking about old age issues , but lifelong issues . ' there are 800,000 people living with dementia in the uk - a figure expected to rise to a million by 2021 . the report is one of the first comprehensive long-term studies looking at the effect of key risk factors for heart disease and stroke on brain function . altogether 3,330 18 to 30-year-olds had their blood pressure , fasting blood sugar and cholesterol levels checked every two to five years . researchers analysed each person 's cumulative cardiovascular health over 25 years . at the end of the study , published in the journal circulation , the participants took three tests measuring memory , thinking speed and mental flexibility . researchers found those with healthier levels of blood pressure , blood sugar and cholesterol in their 20s had better brain function 25 years later . those with blood pressure , blood sugar and cholesterol levels slightly higher than recommended guidelines when they were young , had lower scores in cognitive function tests in their 40s and 50s . the average differences found , although small , were considered statistically significant by the researchers . elevated blood pressure , blood sugar and cholesterol are three major risk factors for atherosclerosis , the slow narrowing of arteries caused by a build-up of plaque in the artery walls leading to the brain and heart . dr yaffe said the narrowing of the arteries leading to and in the brain was the most likely explanation for the link between cardiovascular health and cognitive function . she said : ` our study is hopeful , because it tells us we could maybe make a dent in the risks of alzheimer 's and other forms of dementia by emphasising the importance of controlling risk factors among younger people . ' previous research suggests that eating a mediterranean diet can help prevent memory loss and may stave off alzheimer 's . the diet rich in plant foods and fish , and low intake of red meat , appears to improve vascular function , the flexibility of cells lining the walls of blood vessels , which help keep arteries supplying heart and brain healthy . dr simon ridley , head of research at alzheimer 's research uk , said : ` there is mounting evidence to suggest that keeping healthy when we are younger may help preserve memory and thinking skills in later life . ` previous research has shown that high blood pressure , high blood sugar and raised cholesterol may all be linked to an increased risk of dementia . ` while there 's currently no certain way to prevent dementia , evidence suggests that eating a healthy diet , doing regular exercise , not smoking , not drinking too much and keeping blood pressure in check could help reduce the risk of the condition . ` research to build a more detailed picture of the risk factors for dementia is vital , as the better we understand these factors , the more able we will be to take action to lower our risk . ` if we could delay the onset of alzheimer 's , the most common cause of dementia , by five years , we could halve the number of people living with the disease - that means investment in research is crucial . '", "summary": " study is one of the first long-term studies into alzheimer 's .   it checked 3,330 18 to 30-year-olds every two to five years .   there are 800,000 people living with dementia in the uk .
