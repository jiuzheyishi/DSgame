{"text": "` tactical ' : policies announced by david cameron have been criticised as ill-thought-out and not up to the task of combating terrorism . david cameron 's anti-terror plans came under fresh attack yesterday amid claims he proposed the crackdown to shift attention from the embarrassment of a tory mp defecting to ukip . in a major commons statement on monday , he vowed to introduce measures to bar british fanatics fighting in iraq and syria from re-entering the uk , either by stripping them of their passports or stopping them boarding flights back home . but critics suggested mr cameron had ratcheted up the rhetoric to try to ` bury bad news ' after tory backbencher douglas carswell stunned westminster by defecting to ukip last week . labour mp ian austin , a member of the home affairs select committee , said : ` david cameron used the most apocalyptic language to tell us that we faced a generational struggle against the threat of jihadists to britain . ` i agree with him . tackling extremists and extremism to prevent british people becoming terrorists at home and abroad is a huge priority . ` but the measures he announced were a damp squib . they did not amount to much more than tough talking . it looks very much like he was playing politics with security to deflect attention from the problems he is having within his own party . ' in a further blow to downing street , the independent reviewer of terror laws warned there would be ` significant difficulties ' in stopping british-born suspects re-entering the country . it also emerged another proposal , to force terror suspects living in the uk to be relocated away from other militants , might be blocked by deputy prime minister nick clegg , the liberal democrat leader . the criticism increased the sense of disarray surrounding the ` targeted ' package of proposals unveiled by mr cameron . a senior tory criticised downing street for briefing ill-thought out terror policies . he said : ` they do n't think ,  let 's get a serious set of policies that may solve the problem .  they think ,  let 's brief something that will get rid of this problem for the next 72 hours .  it is tactical media management , nothing else . ' david anderson qc , the counter-terrorism watchdog , said there were ` legal difficulties ' with stopping british-born citizens who had been fighting abroad from returning to the uk , as rendering them stateless would breach international law . do n't look at this : cameron 's announcement have been derided as an attempt to deflect attention from the defection of tory mp douglass carswell -lrb- pictured left with nigel farage -rrb- to ukip . the prime minister also wants to force airlines to hand over advanced passenger information to the security services or be banned from landing planes in the uk . mr anderson said : ` the whole concept of citizenship is about the right of abode ... if you 're going to suspend that , even on a temporary basis , i think you run into some legal difficulties . ` where does the person go ? do they go back to syria for a bit more jihad ? do they go and find a beach somewhere in turkey ? ` the trouble with this game of pass the parcel , whether it comes to terrorists or other criminals , is that if other people 's terrorists or criminals find their way to great britain , they too could say ,  well we wash our hands of these people , we 're not going to let them back , they 're your problem  .", "summary": " david cameron made major statement to the commons on fighting terror .   but he was accused of attempting to ` bury bad news ' of tory defection .   douglas carswell switched to ukip last week , triggering by-election .
