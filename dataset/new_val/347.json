{"text": "on wednesday it was the typically press shy huma abedin who made the headlines instead of her husband , disgraced former congressman anthony weiner . first , she and weiner appeared in a people magazine spread where she declared that she is proud to be married to her husband even after the twitter sexting scandal that forced him to resign his position as a democratic representative for part of the queens borough in new york . then she was a hot topic among republican politicians , with some - like michele bachmann - deriding her with claims that her family has connections to egypt 's muslim brotherhood , and others - like john mccain - coming to her defense . scroll down for video . calling her out : though john mccain -lrb- right -rrb- never mentioned her explicitly , he gave a seven-minute speech slamming a letter that michele bachmann -lrb- left -rrb- wrote deriding one of hillary clinton 's top aides . former presidential candidate senator mccain spoke passionately about ms abedin 's years of dedicated public service in her role as secretary of state hillary clinton 's top advisor , and denounced the senseless character attacks that were made by some of his more conservative party members . trusted : bachmann says ms abedin 's position is highly sensitive and she could abuse it , effectively because of falsified rumors about her muslim family 's connections . ` huma represents what is best about america : the daughter of immigrants , who has risen to the highest levels of our government on the basis of her substantial personal merit and her abiding commitment to the american ideals that she embodies so fully . ' mccain said in his speech on the senate floor . ' i am proud to know huma , and to call her my friend . ' bachmann , who rose to national prominence during her failed bid for position of this year 's republican presidential candidate , alleged that ms abedin 's deceased father , mother , and brother are connected to the muslim brotherhood , the controversial political opposition group who often works against american interest in arab states . touting her role on the house intelligence committee , representative bachmann wrote a letter - which was co-signed by four other congressmen - alleging that given ms abedin 's highly-sensitive position in ms clinton 's staff , she is effectively a national security threat due to her fictitious connections to the brotherhood . in the letter , which was sent to the deputy inspector general of the state department and the director of national intelligence among others , mrs bachmann and her co-signers gave no traces of evidence of their findings . mr mccain made a clear attack on the statements , drawing on his own personal experience having been the victim of false rumors during his multiple presidential campaigns , and having his heroism questioned in spite of his strong military record which included many years as a prisoner during the vietnam war . stay at home dad : weiner has been taking care of his new son jordan while his wife huma abedin continues her high-powered job at hillary clinton 's top aide . well connected : ms abedin has stood quietly by her husband anthony weiner in the wake of his sexting scandal last year that lead to his resignation . he said that he knows the pain that is cause ` when a person 's character , reputation and patriotism are attacked . ' ` when anyone , not least a member of congress , launches specious and degrading attacks against fellow americans on the basis of nothing more than fear of who they are and ignorance of what they stand for , it defames the spirit of our nation , and we all grow poorer because of it , ' he said . ` to say that the accusations made in both documents are not substantiated by the evidence they offer is to be overly polite and diplomatic about it . ` the letter in the report offer not one instance of an action , a decision or a public position that huma has taken while at the state department or as a member of then-senator clinton 's staff that would lend credence to the charge that she is promoting anti-american activities within our government . ' in the shadows : a then-pregnant abedin -lrb- left in both shots -rrb- was the one to hand clinton her blackberry when the news came through that muammar gaddafi had been killed . defender : john mccain dismissed the letter about abedin as reckless and said that he was honored to call her a friend . mrs clinton 's staff clearly appreciated the bi-lateral support that he showed in renouncing the move . mrs clinton 's spokesman philippe reines dismissed the accusations , calling them ` nothing but vicious and disgusting lies , and anyone who traffics in them should be ashamed of themselves . i would hope that hearing the remarkable statement from someone of senator mccain 's stature gives her -lrb- bachmann -rrb- pause in doing so any further . ' in response , mrs bachmann said that her words were being twisted and that the point of her letters was ` to outline the serious national security concerns i had and ask for answers to questions regarding the muslim brotherhood and other radical group 's access to top obama administration officials .
