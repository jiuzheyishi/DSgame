{"text": "when opportunity knocked les ferdinand paid attention . from non-league southall to the england team and most recently to a desk in his office behind which he sits in his designer knitwear while queens park rangers train . he 'd rather be out on the grass , he explains , but this interview is keeping him indoors and , when the director of football picks a route through the mud to pose for a photograph , the temptation for some is too much to resist . ` f *** ing hell les , we 've only won one game , ' yells joey barton , from the midst of a nearby finishing drill , his verbal arrows more accurate than anything from his feet , as usual . les ferdinand believes english kids are made to look mediocre but he thinks they just need an opportunity . the former england international wants to bring the stan bowles spirit back to loftus road . the other players titter and ferdinand laughs along . the mood is relaxed ahead of saturday 's game at hull city where chris ramsey tries to build on victory at sunderland , the first away points of a difficult campaign , before they fly to dubai for a training break . ` in a short space of time , there 's been a positive turn , ' smiles ferdinand . ` the reaction has been great . we want to be a premier league side . we know the figures . we also know the first year up is the hardest . our focus is on staying in this division and everyone to a man is confident of doing it . ' survival is vital with financial fair play penalties hanging over qpr if they slide into the football league and a large part of ferdinand 's role is to set down principles to keep the club within its means based around growing their own players . ferdinand says qpr 's premier league survival is vital for the club and he 's confident they can do just that . ferdinand explains : ` in this country , we 'll buy someone from abroad for # 20m who has been playing professional football for years and we all go : ` give him a year to 18 months to settle in ' . ` yet we 'll take someone out of the development squad who has never played any senior football in his life and if he 's not a world-beater within two games everyone 's saying : ` well , he 's no good is he ' . ` why not afford the kid the same opportunity ? it 's incredible . we 're making english players and english coaches appear mediocre and they 're not . they 're more than that , given the opportunity . ' he speaks from experience and with qpr in his blood . hayes signed him from nearby southall for # 5,000 and sold him a few months later to queen 's park rangers for an initial # 15,000 , plus another # 15,000 based on appearances and a 10 per cent sell-on which turned out to be # 600,000 . born in paddington and raised in ladbroke grove , he walked by loftus road every day on his way to christopher wren school , now phoenix high school in shepherd 's bush . ferdinand signed for qpr from non-league hayes and established himself as one of the best in the league . the former england international thinks youngsters should be allowed to settle like the foreign imports . ' i was n't a qpr fan but they were the only team i saw play live when i was a kid , ' said ferdinand . ` my cousin 's husband brought me to a game against leicester when i was 11 and phil parkes saved a penalty . ` the thing i was most impressed about was that he played in goal with bare hands . i stood behind the goal thinking : ` woah , this geezer 's got no gloves on , man ' and i ended up playing in goal at school for three years because of that . ` with players like stan bowles and rodney marsh , they were always associated with entertaining football . terry venables went in and got them promoted and the plastic pitch was in full swing when i joined . there was none of this 3g and 4g , there were no ` g 's involved at all . ' the former england striker revealed he used to play in goal as a youngster after watching phil parkes . he lost 4-1 at coventry , but cyrille regis left a big impression . ` he 'd come from non-league like me , ' said ferdinand . ` he looked so massive and strong and had this aura . i was thinking : how do i get to that ? ' his second appearance was worse -- a 7-1 defeat at sheffield wednesday -- before he returned from a year on loan at besiktas to established himself in a team managed by gerry francis . they were the top london club in 1993 , finishing fifth in the inaugural premier league . ` qpr went out and bought well from the lower divisions and made players better , ' said ferdinand . ` players came through the ranks , like kevin gallen , bradley allen and danny dichio . people moaned that we sold our best players , but we could n't compete for multi-million pound players . ' i came when it was acceptable for qpr to go and spend # 30,000 on a non-league player but clubs have stopped doing it . the demands are such that if you 're not spending # 10million on players in every transfer window , you 're not competing and lack ambition . his goalscoring record at qpr was impressive after 80 goals in just 163 appearances for the london club . newcastle united signed him from qpr for # 6million and he was extremely prolific at st james ' park . ` it 's about educating . we were n't buying players for # 3million back then . we were selling for that money and for a club like qpr this has to be the avenue . ' years of boardroom instability and managerial chaos seem to have left the club with an identity crisis which ferdinand will address with the backing of owner tony fernandes . ' i will look at the long-term future of the club , ' said the director of football . ` and we will make sure it works . my job is not to sign players . it 's to work with all areas of management to improve the club . ' at the heart is youth development and opening pathways to the first-team . ` i 'm not saying our first-team is going to be full of 21-year-olds , ' he said . ` you need experienced heads . when i came here i had the likes of ray wilkins and nigel spackman to help me . gerry francis and ferdinand after his move to tottenham hotspur from newcastle in 1998 . ` but we need to attract youngsters here by giving them the opportunity in the first-team . that has to be our selling point . with respect , if you go to chelsea and some of the bigger clubs , you 're not getting a chance to play in the first-team unless you 're the most exceptional of the exceptional . ' ferdinand and ramsey were previously employed at tottenham as part of a coaching team responsible for nurturing harry kane , andros townsend , ryan mason and nabil bentaleb . ` all of a sudden the conveyer belt has started , ' he said , and the desire to strengthen the same spurs connection at loftus road prompted ferdinand to recommend tim sherwood for the job when harry redknapp quit . tim sherwood -lrb- centre -rrb- was recommended for the hoops post by ferdinand , but he opted for aston villa . ` it is my remit is to bring people in who will progress the club , ' said ferdinand . ` we 'd done well at tottenham and i know what he does . we 're good friends but i ca n't afford to bring someone in here because he 's my mate . ` he 's a very good manager but he opted for villa before we really had a chance to sit down and talk and the way things happened we had to act quickly . anyone coming in from outside was going to be a gamble . ` and , as the owner has said , the job is chris 's to lose . i know what he 's capable of . he 's been doing it forever , but he 's never had the opportunity . ' this is chris ramsey 's first managerial position and has the tough task of saving qpr from relegation .", "summary": " les ferdinand wants the stan bowles spirit back to queens park rangers .   the former player is a firm believer in the development of english players .   the 48-year-old started his career at the bottom of the footballing pyramid .   the ex-hoops , newcastle and spurs star is determined to keep qpr up .   ferdinand recommended his ` good friend ' tim sherwood for the qpr job before he became the new boss of fellow strugglers aston villa .   click here for all the latest queens park rangers news .
