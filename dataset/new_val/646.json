{"text": "mike catt is just the man to evaluate the hype around jonathan joseph and the comparisons being made with jeremy guscott , as the long span of his career meant he played with both centres . after england 's man of the moment touched down twice at twickenham on saturday , following a try-scoring contribution to the victory in cardiff , the ` new guscott ' tag was being applied with more conviction than ever . catt , the national team 's attacking skills coach , worked with joseph during his transition from playing to coaching at london irish , so he has been aware of his potential for several years . jonathan joseph scored two tries for england against italy and has earned comparisons with jeremy guscott . mike catt -lrb- left -rrb- played with guscott and now works with joseph due to his england coaching role . guscott -lrb- left -rrb- charges through ireland 's defence to score a try for england at twickenham . asked about the comparisons with his former bath and england accomplice , catt said : ` i made them four years ago but he 's a different player . jerry was more of a swerving outside centre , when there 's a big hole in the 13 channel . ` there are n't many holes any more , so jj 's footwork and his ability to slip out of tackles , like you saw -lrb- on saturday -rrb- and last week , is phenomenal . that 's the x factor you need to win games . you know you need the x factor like that to be able to break defences down . ` but jerry got 70-odd caps so we 'll see how many jj gets . he 's got a lot more tries to get , to be fair to guscott . but three from eight caps is not bad . it 's brilliant to see , it 's refreshing . ' there were many satisfying aspects of england 's six-try demolition of italy which maintained the fine start to their rbs 6 nations crusade and a few glaring problems to address . but as the capacity crowd dispersed there was no doubt about the primary subject for excited discussion . joseph is creating a buzz . he has been the form centre in the country this season and now his stellar form has transferred seamlessly to the test arena . his tries on saturday came after he had been shunted out to the wing as part of a reshuffle caused by the early loss of mike brown . the 23-year-old 's first try , from turnover ball near halfway , featured a glorious side-step and a turbo-charged burst clear of the covering defenders . his second strike was expertly crafted by george ford 's delayed pass to send him hurtling through a gap . joseph -lrb- lower -rrb- crossed the line twice for england against italy and has three tries in eight appearances . jospeh -lrb- centre -rrb- celebrates with luther burrell -lrb- left -rrb- in england 's six nations victory against italy . england attacking skills coach catt -lrb- left -rrb- was a world cup winner in the 2003 tournament in australia . catt is delighted to see confirmation of the promise he saw years ago as joseph shows there is a place in the modern international game for subtle attacking qualities amid the thunder of heavy cavalry . ` everybody thinks international rugby is all about size but players who play against jonathan joseph do n't want to defend him because he 's lethal , ' he said . ` he 's a hard man to stop . he has incredible feet . ` he 's very hard to break down if you get the ball to him early , and that 's where george -lrb- ford -rrb- has been phenomenal . george gives him early ball and then he 's able to see what 's in front of him . he just plants guys down and gets round them . he 's never tackled behind the gain line . he always makes an extra two or three metres and that 's crucial when it comes to attack , especially in the 13 channel . ' joseph 's exploits from the flank against italy will give the england coaches cause to consider him as a wing option if they ever have their full midfield contingent fit . but he is making a powerful case for a long run in his preferred position at outside centre . the no 13 shirt was seemingly only made to measure for manu tuilagi but the leicester wrecking ball faces a battle to regain his place when he returns from injury . ` going into a world cup you 've got to have four centres , ' said catt , a member of the victorious 2003 england team . ` having guys like manu who can break down a defence in a different way to how jj does is what you want . you 've got a good balance there -- and competition . ` for manu to get his place back you 're going to have to see some fireworks . let 's see how it carries on going . it 's just great to have a consistency again between a centre partnership . we 'll see how they develop . i 'm sure they will . ' catt said there will have to be ` fireworks ' from manu tuilagi -lrb- centre -rrb- to regain his place in the england side . catt also praised the impressive performances of george ford in england 's six nations campaign so far . england coach stuart lancaster will want to see his side combat the sluggish start made against italy . england were far too strong for italy but lancaster 's tempered reaction to the victory told its own tale of shortcomings which must be addressed . a repeat of saturday 's sluggish start will be far harder to recover from against ireland in dublin in 13 days ' time when the championship 's two unbeaten teams collide . of the six english tries , the first by billy vunipola owed much to a generous interpretation of the footage by the tmo . joseph 's finishes were sublime , while ben youngs was alert enough to pounce with a quick tap penalty from close range when the visitors ' defence had switched off . the other scorers were the recalled danny cipriani and nick easter , which went some way to justifying their return to the test fold . captain chris robshaw had a titanic influence as usual -- topping the tackle charts as always with 18 , while his harlequins skipper joe marler built on his superb autumn campaign with another imposing display . in the second row , george kruis again belied his inexperience with a forceful contribution and no 8 vunipola ran amok as the game wore on . england captain chris robshaw -lrb- right -rrb- made the most tackles in the game with italy and had a huge influence . danny cipriani -lrb- right -rrb- scored a try against italy to help justify his return to the england test fold . jonny may -lrb- second left -rrb- created cipriani 's try but also squandered a three-on-one overlap in the first half . but lancaster was rightly concerned by a dip in defensive intensity which allowed the italians to score three tries . in attacking terms , jonny may created cipriani 's try but lacked composure when he squandered a three-on-one overlap just before half-time . such fundamental lapses are not critical in a one-sided encounter but they could be fatal in a world cup knock-out match . still , clear room for improvement from a winning position is probably the management 's ultimate scenario at this juncture .", "summary": " jonathan joseph crossed the line twice in england 's 47-17 win over italy .   his six nations performances have drawn comparisons to jeremy guscott .   but england coach mike catt believes joseph possesses different skills .
