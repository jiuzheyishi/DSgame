{"text": "as the brutal drug war which has claimed over 80,000 lives still rages , one anonymous blogger has been providing mexicans with something they ca n't get elsewhere - an inside view of their country 's debilitating narcotics battle . with over three million hits a week and over 120,000 followers on twitter , blog del narco is renowned for its fearless coverage at a time when mainstream media are feeling pressure and are frightened away by the nation 's deadly cartels . the identity of the courageous reporter , who lives under the constant and real fear of a violent and gruesome death , has long been a mystery , as many postings include graphic imagery and depict crime scenes accessible only to military or the police . an anonymous , twentysomething blogger is giving mexicans what they ca n't get elsewhere 多 an inside view of their country 's raging drug war . writing what no one else dares to : the fearless blogger refuses to bow to the violent threats from the cartel . however , a new investigation by the houston observer has revealed that , in fact , the author is a young , single woman in her twenties , with no children and only a deep love of her country and the belief that her blog helps draw back the veil on her nations vicious fight against drug barons . ' i do n't think people ever imagined it was a woman doing this , ' said the blogger to rory carroll who works for the british newspaper the guardian in los angeles . ` who am i ? i 'm in my mid-20s , i live in northern mexico , i 'm a journalist . i 'm a woman , i 'm single , i have no children . and i love mexico . ' this marks the first time that the blogger , who decided to use the pseudonym lucy , has spoken to the press . in the past she has used a male colleague who helps her with the technical side to engage with short email conversations with reporters . speaking through an anonymous intermediary , lucy told the guardian that she uses her blog to keep her compatriots informed of what is really going on between the cartels , the police , the military and the public . ` i 'm in love with my culture , with my country , despite all that 's going on . because we 're not all bad . we 're not all narcos . we 're not all corrupt . we 're not all murderers . we are well educated , even if many -lrb- foreign -rrb- people think otherwise . ' the undifferentiated content suggests that all sides are using the blog -- . drug gangs to project their power , law enforcement to show that it too . can play rough , and the public to learn about incidents that the . mainstream media are forced to ignore or play down . operating from behind a thick curtain of computer security , blog del narco is mexico 's go-to internet site at a time when mainstream media are feeling pressure and threats to stay away from the story . many postings , including warnings and a beheading , appear to come directly from drug traffickers . others depict crime scenes accessible only to military or police . since the blog was launched in 2010 , lucy has lived in constant fear of being captured and killed by the cartels , who are infuriated by her insistence of depicting the true horrors of the drug war which has been estimated to have displaced over a million people across mexico . she brings up the sad example of a couple who were found hanging from a bridge in the mexican border city of neuvo laredo after being disemboweled and mutilated by their attackers . lucy revealed to the guardian that the couple were her erstwhile colleagues on the website . ` they used to send us photographs . that was very hard , very painful . ' the motive for the gruesome attack was to explicitly warn her not to criticize mexican drug cartels on the internet . next to the battered bodies was a sign reading : ` this is going to happen to all those posting funny things on the internet , you better -lrb- expletive -rrb- pay attention . i 'm about to get you . ' the woman , thought to be in her 20s , was tied to the bridge from her feet and hands as her body dangled topless with her innards protruding . the undifferentiated content suggests that all sides are using the blog 多 drug gangs to project their power , law enforcement to show that it too can play rough . the violence has made mexico one of the world 's most dangerous countries for journalists , which explains why blog del narco cloaks itself so heavily in anonymity . the man 's body , also believed to be in his early 20s , was hanging from just his hands . however , despite living with the all-too real threat of assassination , lucy has now produced a book , ` dying for the truth : undercover insider mexico 's violent drug war ' . it highlights her first year operating the blog during a year in which almost 20,000 people lost their lives . over the past three years , lucy has had to move home every month to live in basements , running scared from cartel members so powerful they hold corrupt politicians in their pockets . indeed , the website comes under constant cyber-attack from members of the government who want to shut down the gruesome but truthful site . drawing their material from members of the public , those who she knows and even drug gangs , lucy told the guardian that only her close family know that she is the author behind the infamous blog . the mainstream mexican media frequently attacks the site , calling it free publicity for the wealthy cartels . in at least one case blog del narco may have led to a major arrest 多 of a prison warden after a video posting detailed her alleged system of setting inmates free at night to carry out killings for a drug cartel . in the past the blog has provided . links to facebook pages of alleged traffickers and their children , . weapons , cars and lavish parties , as well as photos of mexican pop music . stars at a birthday party for an alleged drug dealer 's teenage daughter . in the border state of coahuila , across from texas . ` the girl wrote to me and told me , in a threatening way , to take down her photos , ' said her male colleague to the associated press in 2010 . ` but as long as i do n't hear from her father , i wo n't take them down .
