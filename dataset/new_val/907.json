{"text": "mistake : former home secretary says the 2004 decision was ` well-intentioned ' but ` messed up ' jack straw has admitted that throwing open britain 's borders to eastern european migrants was a ` spectacular mistake ' . the former home secretary said labour 's 2004 decision to hand immediate working rights to poles and migrants from other new eu states was a ` well-intentioned policy we messed up ' . his comments emerged on the same day as his successor as home secretary , david blunkett , warned that the influx of roma migrants into britain risked causing riots . mr blunkett 's comments reinforced the significance of mr straw 's admission about labour 's failure to anticipate the scale of migration when eight former soviet bloc nations became eu members , and britain -- almost alone in europe -- allowed the free movement of workers between countries . at the time , the government predicted up to 13,000 migrants would come to britain each year . the actual total over nearly a decade was more than a million . virtually every other eu state , apart from ireland and sweden , kept their jobs markets closed for the seven years permitted . in an article for his local paper , the lancashire telegraph , mr straw -- who is mp for blackburn -- admitted the forecasts were ` worthless ' . and he accepted the ` social dislocation ' which can be caused when ` large numbers of people from abroad settle in a particular area ' . mr straw said : ` one spectacular mistake in which i participated -lrb- not alone -rrb- was in lifting the transitional restrictions on the eastern european states like poland and hungary which joined the eu in mid-2004 . ` other existing eu members , notably france and germany , decided to stick to the general rule which prevented migrants from these new states from working until 2011 . ` but we thought that it would be good for britain if these folk could come and work here from 2004 . not alone : mr straw 's successor david blunkett -lrb- left -rrb- has also spoken out about problems caused by immigration , warning that roma migrants could cause riots . ukip leader nigel farage -lrb- right -rrb- applauded him . it is estimated that more than 700,000 people from romania could try to find work and settle in britain . ` thorough research by the home office . suggested that the impact of this benevolence would in any event be .  relatively small , at between 5,000 and 13,000 immigrants per year up to . 2010  . events proved these forecasts worthless . ` net migration reached close to a quarter of a million at its peak in 2010 . lots of red faces , mine included . ' also critical : last year ed miliband said labour 's policy left communities ` struggling to cope ' his comments are the furthest any senior labour figure has gone in accepting the party made serious errors in immigration policy during its time in power . mr blunkett told the bbc that roma groups from slovakia who had settled in a district of sheffield were behaving like they were living in a ` downtrodden village or woodland ' where there were no toilets or litter collections . they were dumping rubbish on the streets , loitering late at night and causing ` friction ' with residents , he added . the tensions have prompted existing residents of the page hall area to set up street patrols to try to combat the anti-social behaviour . since 2004 , several hundred roma families have settled in the area , many with eight children or more . mr blunkett said : ` we have got to change the behaviour and the culture of the incoming roma community -- because there 's going to be an explosion otherwise . ` we have got to be tough and robust in saying to people ,  you are not living in a downtrodden village or woodland  -- because many of them do n't live in areas where there are toilets or refuse collection facilities . ' mr blunkett said the ` understandable tensions ' between different groups could lead to a repeat of the 2001 riots in oldham and bradford . ` if everything exploded , if things went wrong , the community would obviously be devastated . we saw this in bradford , burnley and oldham all those years ago when i first became home secretary . ' back track : mr straw wrote in his local newspaper that the decision was made based on data showing 5,000 to 13,000 migrants a year would come to britain . ` events proved these forecasts worthless ' . tough : support for the labour party hit a three-year low in 2004 following the immigration announcement . mr blunkett 's comments were welcomed by ukip leader nigel farage , who said they reinforced the need for a re-think over the dropping of similar border controls with romania and bulgaria on january 1 next year . immigration campaigners have predicted the arrival of up to 50,000 people a year as a result of ending the transitional controls over nationals from the two countries . romania has one of the largest roma populations in europe , with an estimated two million living there . last year ed miliband was criticised for dropping an admission that labour 's policy had left communities across britain ` struggling to cope ' . in advance of a speech in december , his spin doctors suggested he would admit that the party 's failures on immigration had damaged britain and increased community tensions . ` the home office suggested the impact would be relatively small ... between 5,000 and 13,000 migrants a years . events proved these forecasts worthless ' - jack straw in his local newspaper . he had been expected to say : ` we did too little to tackle the realities of segregation in communities that were struggling to cope . ' but the admission was dropped in favour of a vague acknowledgment that the party had made ` mistakes ' . mr straw 's comments will prompt further calls for labour to apologise for its failure on immigration . mr farage said : ` mr blunkett should be admired for the courage he has shown by speaking so plainly . ` the fact that he is talking of the significant difficulties with the roma population already in his constituency should be taken seriously by the likes of cameron , clegg and miliband . ` my question is if they wo n't listen to the dangers of opening the door to romania and bulgaria next year when ukip speak out on it , will they listen to david blunkett ? ' a recent salford university study suggested britain 's population of roma -- estimated at 200,000 -- is one of the largest in western europe .", "summary": " former home secretary said the party 's 2004 decision to hand immediate working rights to migrants from other eu states was a mistake .   admission in his local paper is furthest any labour minister has gone .   his successor david blunkett also warned roma migrants could cause riots .   government had predicted influx of 13,000 a year - 1m came in a decade .
