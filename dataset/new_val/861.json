{"text": "beaming : ruth wright , 48 , was able to avoid a hysterectomy thanks to mr-guided focused ultrasound surgery . a revolutionary no-knife procedure is being used to treat fibroids -- and it could save thousands of women from a hysterectomy . it uses a high-energy , focused ultrasound beam to heat and destroy the fibroid without the need for invasive surgery and anaesthetic -- resulting in a far shorter recovery time . the beam is guided through continuous magnetic resonance imaging -lrb- mri -rrb- that allows the surgical team to see inside the body . ` this is a revolutionary procedure , ' says consultant interventional radiologist dr paul crowe , who offers the treatment at spire parkway hospital in birmingham . he has treated 15 cases so far in collaboration with consultant gynaecologist shirin irani . ` as well as needing no general anaesthetic , it is non-invasive . recovery is faster and there are few risks of complication or side effects . ' fibroids are common tumours on the wall of the uterus and are usually benign . ` about 25 per cent of women of child-bearing age have them , and up to 40 per cent in later life , ' says dr crowe . ` although some women have no idea they even have them , a substantial number need treatment . ' treatment is recommended if the fibroids cause symptoms , which can include heavy bleeding , pressure on the bladder or bowel -- meaning increased urination , bloating or constipation -- or fertility problems . ` there is an association with early miscarriage , or in later pregnancy there may be a problem with space , ' says dr crowe . ` it 's not known why they cause heavy bleeding but they grow in response to oestrogen . ' most treatments involve surgery , with many women having a hysterectomy -- removal of the uterus . half the 50,000 hysterectomies done on the nhs every year are fibroid-related . this operation can take two hours under general anaesthetic , requires a hospital stay and patients can take eight weeks to recover . company director ruth wright , 48 , was advised to have a hysterectomy when she developed fibroids . she had been suffering heavy bleeding . ` some days i could n't leave the bathroom , ' she says . ` it was a nightmare . i was dragging myself to work every day , through the school run and supper , and could n't ride my beloved horses for more than ten minutes without being exhausted . ' after several months , her doctor found she was anaemic and prescribed depo-provera , a progesterone contraceptive injection that often stops periods altogether . when that did n't work , ruth had a scan . ` the radiologist said i had fibroids so large it was as if i was carrying an 18-week foetus , ' she recalls . how it is done : msgfus uses a high-energy , focused ultrasound beam to heat and destroy the fibroid without the need for invasive surgery and anaesthetic . the gynaecologist recommended a hysterectomy . ` i was convinced there must be another solution . i could n't bear more time away from work and my family . i went home and sat at my laptop -- when i found the new procedure it seemed ideal . ' the mr-guided focused ultrasound surgery -lrb- mrgfus -rrb- can be done in a few hours under light sedation . symptoms start to diminish immediately . the nhs was happy to consider funding mrgfus for ruth , but she could n't face waiting so had it privately . after light sedation , the patient lies very still on the stomach in an mri scanner with the fibroid directly over the ultrasound . the surgical team plot and guide the treatment from a control room using the mri console . ` it was n't the most fun four hours , ' says ruth . ` but i was n't in any pain . you have to stay completely still but the main problem is feeling chilly and a bit bored . every now and again the ultrasound beam bounces off the pelvis and you feel discomfort . but i had a button to press if this happened , and the second i did so they moved the beam . i went home and had an excellent night 's sleep with just a couple of painkillers . ' two days later the bleeding had eased significantly , and continued to tail off over the following weeks . consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist clive spence-jones says : ` the science is excellent , with good clinical trials , and could be fantastic in certain situations . though fibroids have to be on the front of the uterus with no bowel in between and ca n't be too large . the procedure is likely to become popular . ' dr crowe adds : ` occasionally there may be some redness , minor pain , skin burns or bruising . these usually resolve within ten days . ' the treated fibroids will not grow back but there is a small risk of new ones growing . ` i went in on the thursday and was back at work on monday , ' says ruth . ` my life has been changed .
