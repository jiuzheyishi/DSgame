{"text": "the word schmeat -- a form of meat produced synthetically from biological tissue -- made it on to the shortlist for the oxford dictionaries ' word of the year . the word is rarely used , but its very inclusion in the shortlist reflects the long-term significance of the events that occurred in london in august , when the world 's first lab-grown hamburger -- developed by a team at maastricht university in the netherlands -- was cooked and served . it 's a vital development , because current meat production methods are not sustainable and meeting global demand is becoming become increasingly difficult . the united nations ' food and agriculture organisation estimates that demand for meat will increase by more than two-thirds over the next 40 years . burgers could soon be both healthy and sustainable produced , according to dr emma davies , a food scientist . the dutch scientists responsible for the first schmeat predict ` cultured ' meats -lrb- ones grown artificially -rrb- could be commercially available within 10 to 20 years . ` with the current technology , we can make the meat at a reasonable price and that will only come down as we improve the production process , ' says lead scientist professor mark post . ` there are still a few technical hurdles , but they require just work and time , and the outcome is reasonably predictable . ' although the team say synthetic meat is biologically the same , it will need to replicate its appearance closely to tempt doubters . cultured beef is currently white , and coloured using beetroot . professor post 's team are now working on cultivating fat tissue and increasing levels of the pigment myoglobin , which gives meat its colour . this would offer a more authentic flavour and appearance . but beef patties are n't the only part of our diet to attract the attention of food scientists . in the future , every aspect of a burger -- from the bun to the relish -- could be modified to make it more sustainable . what 's more , it could even become something of a health food . the science is tantalisingly close to delivering , but any new gm foods would have to overcome a raft of regulations , particularly in europe . in london in august , the world 's first lab-grown hamburger -lrb- pictured -rrb- - which was developed by a team at maastricht university in the netherlands - was cooked and served . health-boosting purple tomatoes . a team from the john innes centre in norwich , uk , has engineered tomatoes using genes from the snapdragon flower to give an extra helping of pigments called anthocyanins . these have an anti-inflammatory effect in the body . in tests , the tomatoes slowed the progression of soft-tissue carcinoma in cancer-prone mice . the tomatoes and juice will not be available commercially until regulatory approval , which could be as soon as two years in north america , says lead researcher professor cathie martin . cultured beef . muscle stem cells from cattle have been cultured in a nutrient broth by researchers at maastricht university in the netherlands , and then mixed with collagen so they formed strips of muscle tissue -- the main component of meat . these were then ` bulked up ' with electrical stimulation , before being minced up and shaped into a patty . a total of 20,000 muscle strips are needed to create just one burger . dr davies says creating lab grown meat -lrb- pictured -rrb- is a vital development because current meat production methods are not sustainable and meeting global demand is becoming become increasingly difficult . diabetes-treating lettuce . dr henry daniell , a molecular biologist at the university of pennsylvania , works on delivering drugs using plants . he has created lettuces genetically engineered to express a protein that stimulates the pancreas to produce insulin . tests on mice given freeze-dried ` super lettuce ' have shown promising results . allergy-free milk . milk allergies are often caused by a protein called beta-lactoglobulin -lrb- blg -rrb- , which is not present in human milk . a new zealand team has used genetic engineering to create a cow that produces blg-free milk . they are currently creating more cows with the same genetics using reproductive technologies analogous to human ivf treatment . the article is featured in this month 's edition of science uncovered magazine . reinforced bread . in 2012 , scientists from the uk , germany and the u.s. deciphered wheat 's complex genetic code , identifying about 96,000 genes . the work paves the way to breeding wheat varieties with higher yields , more disease resistance , and increased ability to cope with drought and other climate-related stresses . creepy-crawly cuisine is coming . insects are highly nutritious and heading to a dinner plate near you . the idea of eating tangles of muscle from a petri dish may be unpalatable to some . even less appealing , however , may be the idea of devouring insects , deep-fried or otherwise . yet in restaurants from london to sydney , insects are proving quite a hit with a niche audience keen to eat delights such as grasshoppers , locusts , crickets and scorpions -lrb- heat-treated , of course , to remove the toxins -rrb- . insects actually form part of the traditional diets of at least two billion people worldwide , according to the food and agriculture organisation -lrb- fao -rrb- of the united nations . there 's no escaping the fact that they are good for you . a recent fao report points to the benefits of eating insects . they are high in fat , protein , fibre , and key minerals and vitamins , from iron and calcium to b vitamins and vitamin e. crucially , insects have a negligible impact on the environment . they are cold-blooded and very efficient at converting feed to protein , not using energy to maintain their body temperature . they can also be fed on organic waste . so-called mini livestock also offer ` livelihood opportunities ' , says a recent fao report on edible insects , meaning they could also be an ethical choice . this article is featured in this month 's edition of science uncovered magazine .", "summary": " purple tomatoes with anti-inflammatory properties have been developed , says dr emma davies , writing in the magazine science uncovered .   they can slow the development of some cancerous tumours .   there is now lettuce that boosts the body 's production of insulin .   insects , which are very nutritious , are increasingly popular in restaurants .
