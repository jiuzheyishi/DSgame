{"text": "` it 's too easy for arsenal -- monaco are like mannequins ' . the words of gary neville at 7.50 pm . less than two hours later it was arsenal looking like the dummies , beaten 3-1 by an average -- yet impressive on the night -- monaco side . in 90 minutes , arsene wenger 's team had managed to perform a distressing demonstration of every flaw and criticism which has been aimed at them in the past five years . here , sportsmail takes a closer look at the shortcomings which leave the gunners on the brink of a last-16 exit in the champions league for the fifth season running . arsene wenger -lrb- centre -rrb- slumps into his seat while watching monaco humiliate his arsenal team . laurent koscielny , alex oxlade-chamberlain and mesut ozil looked dejected after the injury-time goal . let 's start at the back , as per usual ... per mertesacker is a world cup winner , right ? he was , of course , afforded a little bit of a world cup hangover when he struggled for form at the start of the campaign . it 's now looking more like he 's been on a season-long bender . the german is a liability . blameless for the first goal which deflected into the back of the net via his torso from geoffrey kondogbia 's shot ? not likely . it was a half-hearted attempt to close the france midfielder and it was no surprise to see his limp body serve as a detour en route to goal . for the second he inexplicably chose to try and win possession some 60 yards from his own goal . it was a baffling decision and arsenal paid the price as dimitar berbatov -- yes , the player last season in fulham 's reserves -- climaxed a swift breakaway made possible by mertesacker 's absence . his face in the moments after that tie-changing concession told its own story , a pained expression of regret and wondering -- wondering , no doubt , just where his career is headed . after this , you 'd say he is n't long for north london . german central defender per mertesacker had one of his worst nights in aa arsenal shirt . captain mertesacker -lrb- with goalkeeper david ospina in the background -rrb- had an awful night against monaco . per 's kos-tly comrade ... laurent koscielny should not escape censure , either . the centre back was nowhere to be seen as monaco broke and netted the tie-clinching third . moments earlier he 'd been outdone on halfway , his lame attempt to tackle more in keeping with a team chasing an irreversible deficit , and not one trailing by a goal with the second leg still to come . that will ultimately prove costly . koscielny -lrb- centre -rrb- should not escape blame after an erratic display alongside mertesacker . midfield matters ... in the space of 24 hours we have seen two of the premier league 's top sides line up with a central-midfield quartet consisting of james milner , fernando , francis coquelin and santi cazorla . is that really the best we 've got to offer ? arsenal were out-fought and out-thought by the brilliant kondogbia and cunning joao moutinho . now that is a midfield pairing . geoffrey kondogbia celebrates after scoring the first monaco goal in north london . the excellent kondogbia out-muscles santi cazorla - a theme to continue throughout the 90 minutes . arsenal , on the other hand , were operating with the in-form -- but out of position -- cazorla in a deeper role in which he looked entirely uncomfortable , while coquelin , do not forget , was a reserve until one impressive performance at manchester city cemented his place in the side . when are arsenal going to sign a midfielder who marries pace and power , craft and graft -- like , for example , a certain kondogbia ? wizard of oz ? he certainly vanished ... at # 42million , mesut ozil was bought for nights like this . instead , what we witnessed -- when he did bother to seize responsibility -- was another wishy-washy display , lacking in urgency and invention and slowed down by too many touches . he 's had too many chances now . mesut ozil failed to unlock monaco all night , despite being afforded plenty of the ball . ozil has flattered to deceive since his # 42million move from real madrid 18 months ago . french misconnection ... moments after olivier giroud blazed over the crossbar from point-blank range , a graphic appeared on television screens -- attempts 6 , on target 0 . giroud just does not boast the clinical mindset of a master marksman . ask yourself this -- would he have scored those chances at home to the likes of a newcastle ? or even championship opposition in the fa cup ? answer : yes . for he did , bagging braces and accepting plaudits against both the magpies and middlesbrough of late . amplify the pressure , however , and he crumbles . top strikers , the ones who make the difference -- like luis suarez the previous evening - thrive in such surrounds . much-heralded good-looks maybe , but giroud 's finishing was ugly against monaco . he is another who simply is n't good enough for where arsenal want to be , presuming that is further than the last-16 of the champions league . olivier giroud had a dismal night in front of goal and bore the brunt of frustration from the stands . the french striker -lrb- here heading over the bar -rrb- missed a host of chances on wednesday night . giroud somehow conspires to fire wide from close range as arsenal struggled to convert their chances . highbury the library ? a library ? arsenal 's old home was a cauldron of noise compared with the hushed acceptance of the emirates . there are groans , yes , but where is the energy and excitement which would accompany a european night at the likes of anfield or , say , white hart lane ? no guts , no glory ... they say you 've got to earn the right to play -- which roughly translated in sunday-morning speak means ` win your battles first ' . monaco were stronger , quicker and hungrier than arsenal in every department and were , as a result , deserving winners . their last two goals were classy and incisive breakaways . but they had earned the right to do that . arsenal , meanwhile , earned nothing but a costly continental lesson . again . arsenal 's supporters failed to rouse their side out of its slumber on a disappointing night . former tottenham striker dimitar berbatov took delight in silencing the boos and scoring for monaco . danny welbeck looks disconsolate after possession runs away from him in the second half . so who is to blame ? poor arsene wenger , he 's going to need a shop full of those arsenal puffer jackets to protect him from the battering he 's going to take if they fail to reverse the deficit in monaco . but this is his team , he did n't inherit it . he is , of course , hampered by injuries . but he should n't accommodate injury-prone players if that is repeatedly offered as an excuse . it is a team lacking in key areas -- namely goalkeeper , defence , midfield and attack . against monaco , each of those was brutally exposed , and so was wenger . wenger must take the ultimate blame , given this is his side and they are lacking in key areas . giroud holds his head with arsenal staring at an exit from the competition .", "summary": " arsenal lost 3-1 at home against monaco in the champions league .   the defeat leaves the gunners staring at another last 16 exit .   arsene wenger got his tactics all wrong and mesut ozil was poor .   per mertesacker and olivier giroud both badly struggled .   read : wenger 's big pop-up night spoiled by monaco humiliation .   click here for all the latest arsenal news .
