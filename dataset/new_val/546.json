opening period of the game . france were unfortunate not to be level at half-time after lopez shanked another penalty just before the break . his half-back partner and club team-mate , morgan parra , takes the kicks for clermont but the scrum-half too was off target when he took over the duties . they attacked the welsh line through wesley fofana , but again left empty handed after play was called back for crossing . wales fell foul of the law soon after when alun-wyn jones failed to roll away from the tackle and france drew level with lopez 's kick . when france collapsed a driving maul , halfpenny was able to edge his team back in front with the kick . then north , becoming the youngest ever player to reach 50 caps , broke through the defence and rhys webb was allowed to snipe down the side of the breakdown . biggar scores after seeing off the close attentions of brice dulin to help keep wales ' championship hopes alive with a vital victory . biggar -lrb- second left -rrb- is
