{"text": "i was at old trafford on saturday to see manchester united comfortably beat leicester city 3-1 and one of the standout players was luke shaw . it occurred to me that this guy has every chance of going on to be a manchester united legend over the next 15 to 20 years . but could he end up being united 's best ever left back , overtaking denis irwin , much loved by united die-hards , much underrated outside of the club ? that 's a tough ask given the amount of success irwin enjoyed - he remains united 's second most decorated player behind ryan giggs . he was a rare breed , as sound defensively as he was going forward , and i see both those qualities in shaw . luke shaw was one for manchester united 's best players in their 3-1 victory against leicester city . the england international was full of running on saturday ... now he needs a long-term run of fitness . denis irwin is united 's greatest left back , pictured here celebrating a goal against middlesbrough in 1999 . it 's hard to believe he is still only a teenager . but at just 19 he has the time to play more games than the 529 irwin appeared in , and even more than the 602 made by another celebrated united full back , gary neville . there are just two things missing from shaw 's game right now , and one of them -- a long-term consistent run of fitness -- could hold him back for club and country . shaw heard louis van gaal 's public criticism of his fitness levels earlier in the season and admitted the united manager was right . on saturday shaw played the full 90 minutes , and gave an energetic display up and down the left flank no problem . he seems to have learned his lesson , after declaring he needed to achieve a far greater level of fitness at united than he had at southampton . but he has picked up a few niggling injuries this season , keeping him out of action on three occasions . it could just be bad luck of course , but he 'll be keen to cut those spells on the sidelines down . shaw , pictured in action in manchester united 's fa cup draw at cambridge in january . irwin pictured celebrating with gary neville after united beat barcelona in the 1999 champions league final . irwin played more than 500 games for united , and was a favourite among the club 's supporters . physically he 's on the way to being a beast , and his ability is obvious . some have questioned his defensive strength -- he makes mistakes like all defenders , but not a significantly high number of errors , his tackling generally looks effective , and his reading of opponents seems sound . the other area lacking in his game is goals . in 79 first-team appearances with southampton and united , he has yet to register a goal , and from what i 've seen he 's not even looked like scoring . goals are not shaw 's priority of course , and he should n't be judged as a good or bad player based on the amount of goals he scores . but irwin weighed in with a few , endearing him still more to the old trafford faithful . i like shaw a lot , and i suspect united fans already realise they have a quality player on their hands . if he applies himself , and stays fit , he 's set to be united 's left back -- and probably england 's left back -- for many years to come . it 's not easy becoming a manchester united legend , but shaw has that opportunity right in front of him .", "summary": " luke shaw was one of man united 's standout players against leicester .   he has every chance of going on to be legend for the old trafford club .   could he end up being united 's best left back and overtaking denis irwin ?   goals are not shaw 's priority but irwin weighed in with a few at united .   click here for all the latest manchester united news .
