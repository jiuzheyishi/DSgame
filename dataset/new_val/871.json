{"text": "the national trust may be best known for country estates and cream teas , but the trust 's new exhibition will take place in a council flat in east london . in 1967 the balfron tower , in poplar , was completed and for two months the following year its architect , erno goldfinger , lived in apartment 130 to prove how desirable his new building was . now , as part of a display on brutalist architecture , the national trust has restored the flat to its original 1960s style , and is inviting the public to look around . as part of an exhibition on brutalist architecture , the national trust has given flat 130 at the top of balfron tower in east london a 1960s makeover and will be opening it up to the public from october 1 . the tower was completed in 1967 , and the following year it 's designer , erno goldfinger , moved into flat 130 in an attempt to demonstrate the appeal of high-rise living . a spokesman for the trust said : ` balfron tower , along with its younger sister trellick tower , is a testament to a particular moment in time when a vision of a utopian post-war britain coincided with brutalism -- an architectural movement that changed the landscape of our urban environment . ` this was intended to be a heroic architecture that sought to offer the best of design to the masses and to free people from the slum housing and poor conditions still prevalent in 1960s britain . ' designer wayne hemingway and his daughter tilly scoured market stalls , auctions and ebay in order to give the flat and authentic 1960s look . everything , from the lps stacked on shelves , to the beatles bed cover , and posters of twiggy in the teenage bedroom is from the period . for smaller items , such as the bottle of aftershave and can of gillette in the bathroom , the pair were forced to raid the land of lost content museum , in shropshire . goldfinger was born in hungary but emigrated to paris after the fall of the austro-hungarian empire , and moved to britain in 1934 after marrying ursula blackwell , heiress to the crosse and blackwell food company fortune . goldfinger -lrb- left -rrb- , a hungarian communist , moved to britain in 1934 . he designed the headquarters of the british communist party , before building the balfron tower and its sister building , the trellick tower . james bond author ian fleming so hated goldfinger that the writer named one of his villains after him . designer wayne hemingway and his daughter tilly scoured auctions , markets and ebay to give the flat an authentic sixties feel . everything from the furniture , to the wallpaper , and even the board games , is from the period . a supporter of communism , he spent his years before the second world war living in highgate , and after the conflict began designing buildings for the likes of the daily worker newspaper and the british communist party . for goldfinger , who was so despised by james bond author ian fleming that the writer adopted his name for a villain in his books , high rise living was the future of britain in the sixties . he saw building upwards as a way to keep more green space open for people to enjoy at ground level , a mission he shared with the founder of the national trust , octavia hill . he also saw high rise towers as a way to solve the chronic lack of housing in post-second world war britain , and move the poor out of slums and into better quality apartments . the balfron was his first experiment with tower blocks , having built several terraced homes in hampstead , north west london , including his own house at 2 williow road , which the national trust also looks after . it was the design of this property that first drew the anger of fleming , after he opposed the demoluition of several cottages to make way for it . goldfinger saw high-rise living as a way to provide low-cost housing to the poor and solve the chronic lack of homes in post-war britain , while also keeping green space . for smaller items , such as records , a bottle of aftershave and a can of gillette , the designers also raided the land of lost content museum , in shropshire . the block would later be used as a blueprint the blueprint for its sister building , the trellick tower in west london , and sparked a wave of copy-cat buildings across the country . however , while apartments in the trellick tower now sell for upwards of # 500,000 , balfron became known for violence , crime and poverty . balfron itself is in the process of being renovated , with current residents being housed elsewhere until the building is finished . council tenants who want to move back in will be allowed to do so , while those who want to leave will be rehomed , and their flats sold off to private investors . the apartments currently sell for # 155,000 . the balfron tower pop-up exhibition will run for two weeks , beginning on october 1 . ticketsare available here . while balfron tower sparked a wave of copy-cat social housing across the country , as an experiment in high-rise living it ultimately proved a failure , becoming synonymous with poverty , crime and violence .", "summary": " erno goldfinger designed balfron tower in east london and lived in flat 130 on the top floor for two months in 1968 .   now the national trust has given it a 1960s makeover and will open it to the public as part of a brutalist exhibition .   balfron tower was the architect 's first tower block and inspired sister building , the trellick tower , in west london .   goldfinger saw high rises as a way to end the housing shortage in post-war britain while preserving green spaces .
