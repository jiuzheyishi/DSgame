{"text": "the culprit who sparked a murder scare after leaving ' a trail of blood ' along a jetty that was visible on google maps was today revealed to be a wet dog called rama . the ` blood ' seen in the image was in fact a trail of water left by the dog after it went for a swim . rama 's hounding down has ended days of guesswork as to whether a crime scene had been captured by aerial photos . the mystery aerial shot : this image showing what appeared to be a grisly crime scene in a park in the city of almere , netherlands , sparked days of speculation as to what it could really be . the satellite shot from google maps had sparked online speculation that a vicious crime may have taken place and gone undetected in the dutch city of almere . first posted on reddit , it shows what looks like a trail of blood apparently leading on to a waterside jetty jutting into a lake in beatrixpark , in the heart of the city . at the end of the trail it appears as though two people are standing over a dead body , preparing to throw it into the water . but investigations carried out by fans of the popular social news site revealed that the ` crime scene ' was in fact nothing of the sort . eagle-eyed internet sleuths used a little-known technique to zoom right into the image to reveal that it was in fact a soggy dog which had left what looked like the bloody trail . and now the dog 's owner has come forward to tell of her surprise when she realised the picture , which went viral online , in fact showed her and a friend out playing catch with her dog , rama . ` when i saw the picture i realised ,  it 's my dog  . he loves the water , ' she told the sun . ` he jumps off the end of the jetty , swims around to the bridge and runs down to the edge again . ` it 's hilarious that everyone thought it was murder . but it 's great he 's now world famous . ' detailed analysis : once one reddit user revealed how fellow laptop sleuths could zoom in more closely to the image posted by ncav , they began annotating the image to attempt to prove the wet dog theory . even more detailed analysis : another reddit user posted this image which attempted to explain what was going on in the ambiguous-looking scene in even greater detail . the city of almere where the bizarre google maps image was captured is holland 's newest city and . home to more than 193,000 people . the first homes were only completed in 1976 . the . image was originally posted on april 12 by a reddit user named ncav , . with the caption : ' a murder near my house on google maps , link in . comments . ' inside the comments attached to the post , the user added that he and his friend had told the police about the apparent crime . further commenters then sought to debunk the murder hypothesis . the investigation really took off when redditor xythrowawayy shared a little-known trick which allowed fellow users to zoom in further than anyone had previously managed . it . involved grabbing the url usually used to share the map via email or . social media and changing the number at the very end of the link from 22 . to 23 . ` if google maps has imagery at that higher zoom level , it will show it to you , ' added xythrowawayy . new builds : the city of almere where the google maps image was captured is the netherlands ' newest city and home to more than 193,000 people . the first homes were only completed in 1976 . but it was bennyboy1337 who was the first to work out that what the image shows is in fact a dog which has left a wet trail along the jetty 's wooden deck , and not a body surrounded by blood . ` looks like a dog got out of the water and shook itself dry , then walked off the dock while dripping water , the wet wood looks much darker in colour , ' wrote bennyboy1337 . ` you can clearly see where the dog shook , walked off the deck , then walked back to his owner on a separate lighter coloured path on the bottom . ' two users on the site then annotated the zoomed-in image to point out more details that appeared to confirm the wet-dog theory . a third then zoomed out a little to point out that there were other people walking right past the supposed bloody crime scene , while another used google maps distance measuring tool to estimate that the ` body ' is just 3.5 ft long . ` this is either a dog or a midget murder , ' quipped penguinpoop4 .", "summary": " image posted to reddit last week sparked online murder investigation .   but sharp-eyed internet sleuths zoomed in to reveal the truth .   rama 's owner says : ` it 's hilarious that everyone thought it was murder ' "}
