{"text": "criticism : nhs chief executive sir david nicholson has said that hospitals are ` very bad places ' for elderly people . hospitals are ` very bad places ' for elderly people , according to the head of the nhs . sir david nicholson said they were not the right place to care for ` old , frail people ' , and called for community care to be expanded to accommodate the growing elderly population . he compared modern treatment of the elderly to the ` national scandals ' of the sixties and seventies caused by treating mental health patients in large asylums . ` if you think about the average general hospital now , something like 40 per cent of the patients will have some form of dementia , ' sir david told the independent . ` they -lsb- hospitals -rsb- are very bad places for old , frail people . we need to find alternatives . ' he added : ` the nature of our patients is changing -- and changing rapidly . you are getting a larger and larger group of frail , elderly patients who are confused . ' sir david , who is currently the nhs 's chief executive , was speaking for the first time since his appointment as head of the health service 's commissioning board . the new body will take over responsibility for all nhs services in england from the department of health in april . his warning comes after a series of scandals involving substandard care of the elderly , including at stafford hospital , where up to 1,200 patients may have died unnecessarily . he said : ` i would compare it with where we got to with the big asylums . if you remember what happened in the 1960s and 1970s , there was a whole series of national scandals about care of mentally ill patients . ` the response was not just to say that the nurses who looked after these patients needed to be more caring , but actually there was something about the way we treated these patients and the model of care that needed to change . ' sir david 's plans to revolutionise elderly care , particularly for dementia patients , include treating common conditions locally and using funds to keep patients out of hospital . creating community-based treatment centres , managing long-term conditions and preventing falls would be key to future care of the elderly , he said . such expansion of community services could lead to hospital closures , with services concentrated in larger , specialist centres . in december , prince charles spoke about the ` crisis in caring ' in britain , warning that modern medicine and technology were putting the ` human touch ' at risk . he said he was ` sure that there is much more that can be done to foster and enhance those age-old qualities of human kindness and compassion ' . weeks earlier , health secretary jeremy hunt had said there was a ` kind of normalisation of cruelty ' in the worst hospitals . sir david -- who will be in charge of an annual budget of # 93billion , but seek more than # 20billion of savings -- said the commissioning board would not be afraid to challenge ministers over financing . ` very bad places ' : sir david nicholson said that hospitals are not the right place to care for ` old , frail people ' and called community care to be expanded to cope with a growing elderly population -lrb- file picture -rrb- . he said it would also tell the public how much money the nhs needs to achieve goals such as keeping waiting lists down and improving life expectancy . ` we will be saying ,  if that 's the amount of money which is available , these are the sorts of things we will be able to deliver and these are the sorts of things that we ca n't  , ' he said . ` that 's a big change . we will be saying ,  if you do this , this is what we think the implications will be  .
