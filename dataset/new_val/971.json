{"text": "a fisherman from new zealand was left baffled when he caught this see-through shrimp-like creature swimming near the surface of the ocean . stewart fraser was fishing with sons conaugh and finn 43 miles north off the north island 's karikari peninsula when he spotted the translucent ` shrimp ' floating near the top of the water . mr fraser said : ' i was in two minds whether to haul it in , but curiosity got the better of me and i decided to take a closer look . this translucent shrimp-like creature was caught swimming near the surface of the ocean off new zealand . baffled : fisherman stewart fraser holding the see-through shrimp . ` it felt scaly and was quite firm , almost jelly like , and you could n't see anything inside aside from this orange little blob inside it . the photo baffled mr fraser and all of his fisherman friends , who are still none more the wise as to what the creature could have been . one theory to explain the mysterious fish is that it could be a salpa maggiore - a kind of marine invertebrate . salps , as they are more commonly known , are found in both equatorial and cold seas , so the waters around new zealand 's karikari peninsula would be more than suitable for the translucent sea creature . they are spotted swimming alone just as often as they are seen in long , string-like colonies , and move by pumping water through their gelatinous bodies . as a harmless creature that feeds only on plankton , a salp 's see-through body is believed to be designed to avoid it being spotted by predators when floating near the surface . one remarkable species survival technique is the ability to create a clone of itself when food is abundant , which then grow at the fastest rate of any multicellular creature . mr fraser said : ` we have no idea what it could have been but it was quite something and i 'd never seen anything like it before . ' however , deborah cracknell , research lead from the national marine aquarium in plymouth , told mailonline she believes the creature is a salpa maggiore -lrb- salpa maxima -rrb- . paul cox , director of conservation and communication at the national marine aquarium , said : ` little is known about these salps , however , they are often found in colder seas , with the most abundant concentration found in the southern ocean . ` the salp is barrel-shaped and moves by contracting , pumping water through its gelatinous body . ` it strains the water through its internal feeding filters , feeding on phytoplankton from the upper sunlit layer of the ocean . ` they have an interesting life-cycle with alternate generations existing as solitary individuals or groups forming long chains . ` in common with other defenceless animals that occupy open water - jellies and hydroids for example - the translucence presumably provides some protection from predation . being see-through is a pretty good camouflage in water . ' mr fraser , was fishing with sons conaugh and finn 70kms north of the karikari peninsula when he spotted the mysterious shrimp .", "summary": " stewart fraser was fishing 43 miles north off the karikari peninsula .   he plucked the bizarre creature from the water and took a photo .   it has baffled mr fraser and all of his fisherman friends .   but aquarium tells mailonline the creature is called a salpa maggiore .
