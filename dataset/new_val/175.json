{"text": "a man infected with a sars-like illness has become the first person in britain to die from the virus . the 39-year-old , who died in the intensive care unit at birmingham 's queen elizabeth hospital , caught the illness from his father , who had become infected while travelling in pakistan and the middle east . so far there have only been four confirmed cases of the illness in britain and 12 anywhere in the world , with six deaths . scroll down for video . coronaviruses are a large family of viruses known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- . the illness , known as novel . coronavirus , causes a cough , breathing difficulties and fever which can . lead to pneumonia and kidney failure . it is from the same virus family as sars , which claimed 900 lives worldwide in 2002 and 2003 . but scientists say novel coronavirus is nowhere near as dangerous as it has difficulty spreading between humans . the man who died on sunday was suffering from a long-term condition which made him more susceptible . his father is still being treated at a hospital in manchester . and another member of the same family who also caught the virus is being treated at the hospital in birmingham . separately , a 49-year-old man infected in qatar in september is also in hospital . scientists think the illness may be spread via bat droppings or through water droplets from coughs and sneezes . three people have died in saudi arabia and two in jordan . a hospital statement released today said : ` the patient was already an outpatient at . queen elizabeth hospital birmingham -lrb- qehb -rrb- , undergoing treatment for a long-term , complex unrelated health . condition . ` the patient was immuno-compromised and is believed to have . contracted the virus from a relative who is being treated for the . condition in a manchester hospital . ` qehb is working closely with the health protection agency which is . currently following up other household members and contacts of this . case . professor john watson , head of the . respiratory diseases department at the hpa , said : ` this case is a family . member who was in close personal contact with the earlier case and who . may have been at greater risk of acquiring an infection because of their . underlying health condition . ` to date , evidence of person-to-person transmission has been limited . although this case provides strong evidence for person to person . transmission , the risk of infection in most circumstances is still . considered to be very low . ' infected patients have presented with serious respiratory illness with fever , cough , shortness of breath and breathing difficulties . the lining of the lung , or epithelium , represents an important first barrier against respiratory viruses . a statement issued this afternoon history of foreign travel , suggesting that transmission had occurred in . britain . a hpa spokesman said : ` one person has . sadly died . this patient had an underlying condition that may have made . them more susceptible to respiratory infections . ` the first patient in this cluster , who had recent travel history to saudi arabia and pakistan , is still receiving treatment . ` the third case , who had a mild illness , has recovered . ' today , experts suggested the virus could potentially be treated by targeting the immune system . the coronavirus -lrb- ncov -rrb- belongs to the same family as the coronavirus sars , which surfaced in china more than a decade ago and infected 8,000 people worldwide , killing around one in 10 of them . it 's thought the virus can penetrate the lining of the passageways in the lung and evade the immune system as easily as a cold virus can . the research also reveals that the virus is susceptible to treatment with interferons , components of the immune system that have been used successfully to treat other viral diseases , opening a possible mode of treatment in the event of a large-scale outbreak . now scientists at the institute of immunobiology at kantonal hospital in switzerland , have tested how well the virus could infect . and multiply in the entryways to the human lung using cultured cells manipulated to mimic the airway lining . the lining of the lung , or epithelium , represents an important first barrier against respiratory viruses . but , said co-author dr volker thiel , this part of the body does not put up a big fight against ncov . he and his colleagues found that human airway epithelial cells are highly susceptible to ncov infection and that the virus is able to multiply at a faster initial rate than the sars virus . he said : ` surprisingly , this coronavirus grows very efficiently on human epithelial cells . ' the researchers asked themselves whether boosting this weak immune response might diminish the virus ' ability to infect airway epithelial cells . they found that pre-treating the cells with proteins that are released in response to infection , significantly reduced the number of infected cells . but he added : ` we do n't know whether the cases we observe are the tip of the iceberg , or whether many more people are infected without showing severe symptoms . ' the findings were published in the online journal mbio .", "summary": " the patient , who was being treated at the queen elizabeth hospital birmingham , died on sunday .   was a relative of patient being treated in manchester after bringing back coronavirus from middle east .   hospital says patient was already receiving treatment for long-term , complex health condition .
