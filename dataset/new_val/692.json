{"text": "his fist-pumping ` ronny roar ' celebration has become a big noise in recent weeks , but the celtic manager admits he would like to hear his defenders turn up the volume as they prepare to face inter milan in the san siro this week . the sight of ronny deila making his way to the club 's support and whipping the fans into a ferment has added colour to the scottish football season but , while the boss may ooze flamboyant charisma , he admits his team is short of like-minded rabble-rousers . out with the warrior-like presence of his captain scott brown and , when he is in the team , the ebullience of on-loan striker john guidetti , deila admits his team lacks natural leaders , the sort of men who use words to spark their colleagues into action . rory deila has called for more discipline from his team following their 3-3 draw with inter milan . the silent treatment may suffice when facing the routine premiership opposition but , step up a level or two to the europea league , and the norwegian reckons he could be doing with a lot more communication among his defenders . his two full-backs , adam matthews and emilio izaguirre , may like to attack with a certain flamboyance but are among the most reticent footballers you could ever meet . at 19 , jason denayer has the makings of a quality centre-half but has yet to find his voice . even virgil van dijk , a man not short on belief in his own abilities , has had to be coaxed out of his shell by the club 's coaching staff . goalkeeper craig gordon , meanwhile , asserts his authority by exuding a zen-like calm . two rare errors from gordon may offer a partial explanation for the first-leg 3-3 scoreline from three nights ago but deila would also like the men in front of him to assert themselves better . he knows his team must score at least once in italy to have any hope of progressing to the last 16 but a clean sheet would do just as much to help . the portents are not good -- celtic have shipped an eye-watering 23 goals in 13 european matches this season and the prospects of finding a way to plug all the gaps between now and thursday appear slim . celtic striker john guidetti scored injury-time goal to secure an improbable draw against inter milan . that wo n't stop deila trying . organisation will be key on the nerazzurri 's home patch and that 's likely to be a central theme in training this week . ' i think we can keep a clean sheet but we have to cut out the easy mistakes and improve the communication in the team , especially at the back , ' said deila . ` everything is possible . it will be a great achievement if we go through and beat them in milan , but the players have to talk more . ' i think they need matches like this , that 's important . our central defenders are both young and very talented and there 's a lot of attention on them when they play these games . they have to deal with that . ` there are 20 clubs coming to watch them . so it 's mentally tough , especially for young players . ` we have to bring it out of them . we have broony who talks with the players around him but it 's very important to get experience into that central spine of the team . it 's also something to look for when we 're bringing in players -- a leadership style . ` craig speaks a lot with his body -- he 's very calm and reads situations very well but he could also be more vocal . virgil has stepped up in that way , he 's much better than he has been , but he 's still young . so to have an experienced central defender could be a good thing . ' having held on to van dijk in the face of interest from english clubs , including southampton and sunderland , it seems likely that celtic will cash in on the dutch international hopeful at the end of the season . guidetti connected with liam henderson 's pass with a left-footed finish to score against the italian giants . deila has repeatedly gone on record with his desire to extend denayer 's loan transfer from manchester city into a second season but the belgian has been less willing to talk up the chances of another year at parkhead . if deila does indeed find himself in the market for a centre-half with an old head and an active tongue , it wo n't be through choice . ` if i had to choose , i would not bring anybody in , ' he insisted . ` i 'd stick with the two i have because they have the future in front of them . ' that deila is talking about communication is instructive . six months ago , the norwegian had the more fundamental issue of fitness on his mind as his players struggled to adopt the high-tempo pressing game he had deployed at his previous club stromsgodset . in the first leg against inter , deila 's team was unrecognisable from the group that laboured against legia warsaw and , to a lesser extent , maribor in the champions league qualifiers . ` we looked fit , ' he agreed . ` we kept at inter for 90 minutes , pushed them backwards and could keep them under pressure for good periods . ` we were not able to do that six months ago . ' i think we saw that against legia warsaw -- the team could n't cope with it and lost the game big time . so we are taking steps all the time , showing that everything is possible . ` we scored three goals against an italian team , a roberto mancini team , so it 's a good performance . the sad part is we gave away two easy goals . ` we have to defend more in italy but also we have to vary our pressure . the key is to stay compact for 90 minutes because you know they have players who can exploit your mistakes quickly . ' although inter have been displaying shaky form domestically , the concession of three goals in glasgow on thursday was an anomaly -- in the previous eight european ties played this season , mancini 's defence had been breached only twice . leigh griffiths -lrb- left -rrb- and gary mackay-steven congratulate stuart armstrong after celtic 's second goal . the thrust of matthews down the right flank was instrumental in unsettling inter , with the full-back showing drive and then composure to square the ball for stuart armstrong and kick-start the comeback from 2-0 down . armstrong and his old dundee united pal gary mackay-steven were both excellent on their home debuts for the club and they have added extra pace to the mix . ' i think we have a lot of speed in the team now and players who can do something , ' said deila . ` the relationships in the side are better , so we create things from the sides . ' the end of the match brought deila on to the pitch but there was to be none of his trademark theatrics , just a few waves of gratitude at the part played by the crowd on a memorable night . while accepting that a 0-0 scoreline might statistically have given his team a better chance in the return leg , you suspect he would n't have changed a thing about the emotionally-charged match that ended on the crescendo caused by guidetti 's stoppage-time equaliser . ` for me , football is about entertainment , we have to entertain the fans and also get results , ' he added . ` the celtic fans are intelligent , they have seen so much football and they know what they like . ` they were happy because we gave everything and also because we tried to create and attack . ` you have to believe in a style but i 'm not doing this for romance , i 'm doing this to get results and i believe we can do it .
