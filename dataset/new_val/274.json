' she admits it was a difficult period in her life . ` i was badly bullied at school for being posh . i went to private school in south london until i was 11 , but when my father died , my mother could n't afford to keep me there so i went to the local comprehensive in wandsworth . ` i did horse riding and dance classes at italia conti . i did n't fit in . as a result , i was desperate to be loved .
