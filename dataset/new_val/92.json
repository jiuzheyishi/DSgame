{"text": "ryan giggs insists manchester united 's commitment to youth development remains strong . the recent sale of academy graduate danny welbeck and the heavy spending of the summer transfer window have suggested priorities could be changing at old trafford . united have a proud record of having at least one homegrown player in every matchday squad since 1937 - a statistic that could now be under threat following welbeck 's departure . ryan giggs claimed that manchester united and louis van gaal are committed to youth development . but giggs - himself one of united 's greatest youth products - denies that is the case . giggs , who is now assistant manager under new boss louis van gaal , said : ` the club will never change . the history of the club is to play exciting football , always give youngsters a chance , keep to the traditions of the club . ` okay danny has left , which is obviously disappointing because you never want to see a homegrown player leave , but this is a manager who gave seedorf his chance , kluivert his chance , iniesta his chance , xavi , thomas muller - he has got a track record of giving youngsters a chance . ` tyler blackett has played every game this season . underneath -lrb- robin -rrb- van persie and -lrb- wayne -rrb- rooney you have got -lrb- adnan -rrb- januzaj , james wilson . academy graduate tyler blackett has played in every single manchester united game this season . ` players will leave but we have got to make sure young players come through because united fans demand it . i want to see young players come through . ` that has been -lrb- the case -rrb- right through the history of manchester united and we never want to lose that . ' united spent more than # 150million over the summer in a major squad rebuild following the disappointments of last season , when they finished seventh in the barclays premier league and failed to qualify for europe . among the high-profile new arrivals are british record # 60m signing angel di maria and monaco star radamel falcao , on loan . van gaal gave opportunities to the likes of iniesta , xavi and thomas muller when they were young . another former youth star , nicky butt , who now has a coaching role with the united under-21 side , accepts the club had to play catch-up . butt , speaking alongside giggs at the soccerex global convention in manchester , said : ' i think all clubs are changing . ' i think man utd was probably one of the last outstanding ones that had the connection between youth and the first team - to be fair to liverpool now they are doing that very well - but we are still trying to do that . manchester united sold danny welbeck to arsenal for # 16m , despite the north london club being rivals . ` the danny thing is just something that has come at a certain time in the club 's history . ` danny was n't playing in the position he wanted to play in , the club now only has so many games , we 're not in europe . ' i think it is a case of being fair to the player and fair to the club , with someone with danny 's ability who has international credentials and wants his england place . ` it is not a case of giving up on youngsters , giving up on the academy . ` it is a case of getting the club back to where it needs to be . that is the first priority , to get back to winning ways .
