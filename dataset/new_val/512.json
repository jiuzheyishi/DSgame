{"text": "blow : canadian environment minister peter kent announced his country was withdrawing from the kyoto protocol last night . canada has abandoned the kyoto protocol on climate change as it bids to protect the third largest oil reserves in the world . environment minister peter kent said canada was invoking the legal right to withdraw and would be saving the country $ 14billion in penalties for not achieving its kyoto targets . the conservative government is reluctant to hurt canada 's booming oil sands sector - which holds more than 170 billion barrels - with daily production expected to more than double by 2025 . canada becomes the first nation to formally renounce the protocol , although japan and russia have also indicated they would not accept new kyoto commitments after the protocol expires at the end of 2012 . mr kent said : ` the kyoto protocol does not cover the world 's largest two emitters - the u.s. and china - and therefore can not work . ` it 's now clear that kyoto is not the path forward to a global solution to climate change . if anything it 's an impediment . ` to meet the targets under kyoto for 2012 would be the equivalent of either removing every car , truck , atv , tractor , ambulance , police car and vehicle of every kind from canadian roads or closing down the entire farming and agriculture sector and cutting heat to every home , office , hospital , factory and building in canada . ' currently , canada produces 1.5 million barrels from the oil sands a day . only saudi arabia and venezuela have more reserves . critics say the enormous amount of energy and water needed in the extraction process increases greenhouse gas emissions , meaning canada will only be more likely to fall foul of the carbon dioxide targets in the future . there is also the possibility that further global warming could make it easier to extract the oil in hard-to-access areas where the arctic conditions make it difficult to drill or strip out . target : the protocol required 37 countries to commit to reducing their greenhouse gas output to 1990 levels by the end of next year -lrb- file picture -rrb- . mr kent 's announcement comes a day after marathon climate talks finished in the south african city of durban . negotiators from nearly 200 countries agreed on a deal that sets the world on a path to sign a new climate treaty by 2015 to replace the kyoto protocol , which expires at the end of next year . canada 's previous liberal government signed the accord , but current prime minister stephen harper 's conservative government has never accepted it . the accord requires countries to give a year 's notice to withdraw . much heralded : then prime minister jean chretien received a standing ovation after the protocol was ratified in 2002 . kyoto did not include the u.s. or china . the kyoto protocol was signed in 1997 in japan and ratified by most major countries except the u.s. and china . it only came into force in february , 2005 . it committed 37 industrialised nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to below 1990 levels and provided financial help to developing countries to accomplish the task . although canada ratified the accord , it was not on track to meet its targets as emissions climbed while the economy expanded . the protocol will continue to be in effect until the end of 2012 , despite canada quitting . while many city authorities in canada approved the decision , others accused the government of destabilising future action on global warming . greenpeace canada spokesman mike hudema said in a written statement the harper government ` has imposed a death sentence on many of the world 's most vulnerable populations by pulling out of kyoto ' . he added : ` this is a further signal that the harper government is more concerned about protecting polluters than people . ' new democratic party environment critic megan leslie said the costs for canada to say in koyoto were ` absolutely made up ' . she told cbcnews : ` what this is really about is the fact that our government is abdicating its international obligations . ` it 's like we 're the kid who 's failing the class so we have to drop it before that happens . '", "summary": " canada becomes first nation to renounce protocol against global warming .   country was not on track to meet greenhouse gas targets and faced $ 14bn in penalties .   kyoto protocol expires at the end of 2012 and new treaty is expected to be drawn up by 2015 .   agreement signed in 1997 did not include u.s. or china .   critics accuse government of ` abdicating international obligations ' "}
