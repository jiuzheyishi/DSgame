{"text": "spot the difference : police have spent more than # 50,000 on cardboard cut-outs like this one -lrb- right -rrb- . police have spent more than # 50,000 on cardboard cut-outs of themselves - despite most forces admitting they do not know if they stop crime . the two-dimensional crime fighters are supposed to deter shoplifters and petrol thieves who think they are real pcs from a distance . but some have become victims of crime themselves after being stolen by pranksters or vandalised . now mailonline can reveal forces have bought more than 750 of the replicas - at the same time as axing more than 10,000 frontline officers . the total was questioned by the police federation , which said more cash should be spent on real pcs . the taxpayers ' alliance campaign group added : ` this seems to be a gimmick . ' obtained under the freedom of information act , the figures show almost half of britain 's police forces have invested in the cut-outs since 2008 , when they first made headlines . a total of 21 forces said # 53,940 had been spent on 782 cardboard cut-outs . most were used for crime prevention along with a small number used as promotional materials . the cost was borne almost entirely by police , with a small amount in some cases contributed by council-led safety partnerships . but there were huge differences in the amount paid by each force - and therefore the value of money to the taxpayer . one police force paid 10 times more for each cardboard policeman than another force 200 miles away . what 's all this then ? the cardboard pcs are supposed to deter shoplifters - but prove confusing for some . gwent police spent by far the most , splashing out # 13,260 on just 52 cut-outs at # 255 each . by comparison the average cost of a . carboard crime-fighter was a much more modest # 69 - and south yorkshire . police paid just # 25 for each of theirs . meanwhile , only three of the 21 forces could provide mailonline with any figures to suggest the cut-outs stop crime . alongside local figures , south yorkshire police cited ` national research ' which claimed cut-outs reduced crime by 35 per cent , but this was not quoted by any other force . nottinghamshire relied on informal feedback which claimed they reduced crime by up to 40 per cent , while hertfordshire saw shoplifting drop 8.6 per cent ` as part of a wider campaign ' . 1 . gwent : # 13,260 for 52 cut-outs -lrb- # 255 each -rrb- . 2 . derbyshire : # 11,280 for 112 -lrb- # 100 each -rrb- . 3 . south yorks : # 6,000 for 240 -lrb- # 25 each -rrb- . 4 . norfolk : # 5,330 for 52 cut-outs -lrb- # 102 each -rrb- . 5 . humberside : # 2,745 for 48 -lrb- # 57 each -rrb- . source : foi requests by mailonline . they were not universally loved , however . earlier this year a man who dragged one of the effigies onto a petrol station forecourt and kicked it to pieces in full view of cctv was fined # 90 . police tracked down the 23-year-old after the bizarre attack at a tesco petrol station in pitsea , essex , after tracing his car numberplate . the incident was embarrassing for essex police , which reintroduced the cardboard policemen despite withdrawing a trial of them four years earlier after saying they did not reduce crime . campaigners have criticised the cost of the effigies , which were bought amid swingeing cuts to police forces . in september 2008 , england and wales . had more than 142,000 officers . now there are fewer than 132,000 , a cut . of 7.4 per cent . frontline numbers are down by almost 11 per cent since . their peak in september 2009 . falling flat : the cut-outs were scrapped in essex -lrb- pictured -rrb- but were then reintroduced - with one being trashed . responding to the figures , police federation chairman steve white said : ` since the 2010 general election , the police service in england and wales has lost around 16,000 officers and the anticipated reduction in the policing budget in 2015/16 will inevitably lead to a further falls . 2008 : # 11,735 . 2009 : # 4,556 . 2010 : # 4,434 . 2011 : # 3,865 . 2012 : # 13,875 . 2013 : # 7,237 . year unknown : # 8,237,78 . ` this drop in officer numbers is having a negative impact on the service that the police can deliver . we urge forces to ensure they use all the funds at their disposal to keep officer numbers as high as possible . ' andy silvester , campaign manager for . the taxpayers ' alliance , added : ` until it 's shown that these actually . work , this seems to be a gimmick that will take money away from . essential front-line services . ` the . public want the thin blue line to be made of police officers , not . cardboard . no cut-out , to my knowledge , has ever slapped handcuffs on a . criminal . ' in gwent police , the cut-outs were bought from the mwl print group in nearby pontypool between and 2011 and 2013 , and were sent into areas with a high shoplifting rate . the high cost was signed off by detective superintendent ian roberts and his successor dci richard williams insisted the force had sought multiple quotes - but ` the chosen supplier produced a far more robust model being mounted on wood which is still in use ' . he added : ` we have had considerable success in dealing with shoplifting since the cut outs were introduced . on the beat : police federation chairman steve white said funds should be focused on frontline officers . ` we have them deployed at larger stores , and garages throughout the force area . levels of shoplifting continue to fall in gwent . the trend began in october 2011 and , compared to our most similar forces , gwent experienced the second lowest level of shoplifting per 1000 residents in the past 12 months and we remain committed to using every technique available to prevent this crime . ` the replicas , which have also been introduced into other force areas , are by no means a replacement for real police officers . they are simply another tool in the fight against crime . ` the replicas will remind potential thieves that real police officers are regularly in and around the shops as part of their normal patrols , and the initiative is another way for police and partners to work together . ' the association of chief police officers said it was up to individual forces to decide what they buy . national policing lead for procurement lee tribe said : ` there are no national guidelines for the procurement of  cut-outs  of officers . this is a matter for each force and will be budgeted for on a force-by-force basis . ` their use will be determined locally which may include such activities as publicity and recruitment . '", "summary": " almost half of britain 's forces have invested in the replicas since 2008 .   they are designed to deter shoplifters and drivers not paying for petrol .   gwent police spent # 13,000 - 10 times more per cutout than another force .   but only three forces have compiled figures on whether they are effective .   police federation said cash must focus on frontline pcs facing huge cuts .
