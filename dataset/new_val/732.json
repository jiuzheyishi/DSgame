{"text": "two in five young women in london have experienced sexual harassment in public spaces in the last year . forty-one per cent of women aged 18 to 34 said they had encountered unwanted contact or attention in the capital , such as wolf-whistling , sexual comments , staring or exposure , according to a yougov poll . campaigners have called for more research into the problem , which they say leaves women across the country feeling threatened and uncomfortable . intimidating : two in five young women said they had experienced attention such as wolf-whistling and sexual comments . the research compiled by the end violence against women coalition found that 21 per cent of women of all ages had experienced unwanted sexual attention and 4 per cent of all women had been subjected to unwanted sexual touching . the survey also asked female londoners about their experiences while on public transport , and found 31 per cent of women aged 18 to 24 received unwanted sexual attention . fourteen per cent of women of all ages said they encountered unwanted sexual attention , while one in 20 experienced unwanted sexual touching . some claimed they had been harassed while onlookers did nothing to help them . one victim , music photographer rosie wadey , 20 , said she had been sexually assaulted three times since moving to london . she said each incident had begun with her being harassed in the street . describing the most recent assault , which happened in liverpool street station , she said that a man had approached her at about 11.30 pm as she used a cash point . ` he followed me and would not stop talking to me , ' she told the independent . ` by that point , i had made it perfectly clear that i did not want to talk to him . ` he put his arm around me . he asked me things like ,  do you have a boyfriend ?  ,  want to come back to my house ?  . i got more and more aggressive , and this person is not taking the message . ` it got to the point where he put his hand on my head and pulled me by my hair , and i screamed at him . ' sarah green , 36 , said being harassed was a ` common experience ' for her , particularly while cycling in the capital . ` it can be quite seasonal , ' she said . ` it 's worse when the weather is better . ` it 's a minority of people who behave in this way , but they probably do it again and again . victims : rosie wadey , left , and vicky simister , right , have both been subjected to sexual harassment in public . ` you 'll have someone in the passenger seat , waiting at the lights , just calling out offensive stuff . ' ms green described an occasion when she was followed by two men in a white van while cycling in bermondsey . ` they said something to me that was quite rude and that day i had had enough , ' she said . women told the yougov survey that they felt threatened by men approaching them and giving them unwanted sexual attention . here are some of the comments from respondents : . ' i feel safer on public transport than i do walking around , but i have still experienced several nasty incidents of sexual harassment on the tube where i have been forced to change carriage or leave the train a stop early to avoid harassment from men . ' ` feel unsafe at night if i am alone and travelling home . i often move carriages on the tube to feel safer or change buses . ' ` have had some issues when travelling on the top deck of a bus , especially at night , so do n't feel safe up there . safer to sit nearer the driver . ' ` some people will say it 's trivial or even a bit flattering , but women will tell you it 's not because , if you tell them to stop it , the situation can escalate quite quickly . ` we were on a main road and , after i turned on to a minor road , they followed me for three streets at speed . ' i had to pick up my speed and race away . they were shouting all sorts of offensive things at me - four-letter words - and it was really threatening . ' ms green said motorists would shout negative comments about her appearance , as well as positive , and that experience could also be intimidating . ` sometimes it 's men telling you that you 're fat or that you 're ugly and that you need to sort yourself out , ' she said . ` now i pity these men , but when i was younger i felt threatened and it determined how i felt about myself . ' the coalition commissioned the survey to highlight the everyday impact of sexual harassment and how it makes women feel unsafe . it said 45,000 incidents of domestic violence and 3,000 rapes were reported to police in london last year . another victim of sexual harassment , vicky simister , 27 , decided to found a campaign group , the uk anti street harassment campaign , after she was attacked by a group of men at manor house underground station in north london in 2010 . she said : ' i was walking along the street when a group of men in a car pulled up alongside me . ` it was dark and they started trying to talk to me and making comments about my appearance . ` they slowed down and followed me as i walked to the tube station , which took about 15 minutes . ' i was really wound up and frustrated and i told them to leave me alone . pursued : cyclist sarah green was followed by two men who made lewd comments to her . ` they followed me into the station and pinned me against the wall . i had to be helped by members of the public . ' ms simister said of the survey results : ` in order to address this , local councils and the police need to convey a strong message that this behaviour will not be tolerated by perpetrators . ` it is important to note that this is not a london-only problem , and a national survey needs to happen to understand the extent of the problem . ` we hope that london can lead the way in addressing this issue - particularly in light of the impending olympics and international perceptions of our nations attitude to women 's safety . ' ms simister decided to set up her campaign group after she was attacked by a group of men at manor house underground station in north london . coalition co-chairman professor liz kelly said : ` our survey shows that sexual harassment in london is extremely common . ` some survey respondents also said that this behaviour makes them feel uncomfortable and unsafe and makes them change their behaviour and decisions about when and where to travel . ` despite this high prevalence and impact however , public sexual harassment is a form of abuse which generally goes unchallenged , creating an unsafe and unequal environment for women . ` we need investment in public campaigns on transport and elsewhere saying this behaviour is unacceptable , and training for transport staff and police about how to respond to it . ' women who responded to the survey described having to change carriage or leave a stop early after experiencing harassment on the train or tube , while others said they avoided sitting on the top decks of buses . raising awareness : professor liz kelly called for more investment in campaigns on public transport . the coalition said research was lacking into the scale of the problem in the uk , but some international studies appear to show that as many as four in five women have experienced sexual harassment . it has sent its findings to transport for london and urged the body to begin a campaign making the public aware that sexual harassment can be a crime and is unacceptable . it is also calling for more training for police and transport staff to deal with reports of sexual harassment . bryony beynon , co-director of hollaback london , a campaign aimed at ending street harassment , said : ` these statistics are just the tip of the iceberg . ` from unwanted sleazy comments to violent sexual assault , street harassment is an epidemic in london . ` our website gets thousands of hits a month from women looking for support , reassurance and a chance to speak out about their often horrifying daily experiences . ` whether 13 or 70 years old , time and time again they ask  what did i do to deserve this ?  ` wider social change through community education as well as more robust enforcement of the laws designed to protect women in public is desperately needed . ` until then , men who harass need to wake up to the damage this behaviour is having on a daily basis .
