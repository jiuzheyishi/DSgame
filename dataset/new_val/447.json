{"text": "the number of poor people in america is 3 million higher than the official count , encompassing 1 in 6 residents due to out-of-pocket medical costs and work-related expenses , according to a revised census measure released wednesday . the new measure is aimed at providing a fuller picture of poverty , but does not replace the official government numbers . put in place two years ago by the obama administration , it generally is considered more reliable by social scientists because it factors in living expenses as well as the effects of government aid , such as food stamps and tax credits . administration officials have declined to say whether the new measure eventually could replace the official poverty formula , which is used to allocate federal dollars to states and localities and to determine eligibility for safety-net programs , such as medicaid . congress would have to agree to adopt the new measure , which generally would result in a higher poverty rate from year to year and thus higher government payouts for aid programs . based on the revised formula , the number of poor people in 2012 was 49.7 million , or 16 percent . that exceeds the record 46.5 million , or 15 percent , that was officially reported in september . one of 49.7 million : a homeless woman sits on a street in chicago . new census survey says the official rate of poverty in america is astronomically higher than what is officially recorded . statistics : the new census report details the factors stopping people from getting out of poverty as well as the ones causing them to fall into it . the latest numbers come as more working-age adults picked up low-wage jobs in the slowly improving economy but still struggled to pay living expenses . americans 65 and older had the largest increases in poverty under the revised formula , from 9.1 percent to 14.8 percent , because of medical expenses such as medicare premiums , deductibles and other costs not accounted for in the official rate . there also were increases for hispanics and asian-americans , partly due to lower participation among immigrants and non-english speakers in government aid programs such as housing aid and food stamps . african-americans and children , helped by government benefits , had declines in poverty compared with the official rate . ` this is a real incongruity , when 1 in 6 people face economic insecurity here in the richest country in the world , ' said joseph stiglitz , a columbia university economist and former chairman of the white house council of economic advisers , who has argued for more government action to alleviate income inequality . ` when so many citizens are worse off year after year , with food insecurity and health care insecurity , there 's no way you can say that 's a successful economy . ' last week , more than 47 million americans who receive food stamps saw their benefits go down , while congress began negotiations on further cuts of up to $ 4 billion annually to the program . elijah brooks , 6 , -lrb- left -rrb- and sister elisha brooks , 4 , -lrb- right -rrb- help their parents on an assembly line of food for the needy at the orange county food bank in garden grove , california . new figures say the state has the highest level of poor people . among states , california had the highest share of poor people , hurt in part by high housing costs and large numbers of immigrants , followed by the district of columbia , nevada and florida . under the official poverty rate , more rural states were more likely to be at the top of list , led by mississippi , louisiana and new mexico . some other findings were : . - food stamps helped lift about 5 million people above the poverty line . without such aid , the overall poverty rate would increase from 16 percent to 17.6 percent . - working-age adults ages 18-64 saw an increase in poverty from 13.7 percent based on the official calculation to 15.5 percent , due mostly to commuting and child care costs . - child poverty declined from 22.3 percent to 18 percent under the new measure . under both measures , children still remained the age group most likely to be living in poverty . - by race , hispanics and asians saw higher rates of poverty , 27.8 percent and 16.7 percent respectively , compared with rates of 25.8 percent and 11.8 percent under the official formula . in contrast , african-americans saw a modest decrease , from 27.3 percent to 25.8 percent based on the revised numbers . among non-hispanic whites , poverty rose from 9.8 percent to 10.7 percent . ` the primary reason that poverty remains so high is that the benefits of a growing economy are no longer being shared by all workers as they were in the quarter-century following the end of world war ii , ' said sheldon danziger , a university of michigan economist . making it work : a street dweller uses the power outlet of a vending machine to use his laptop outside a supermarket . a new study says that 1 in 6 americans are poor . ` given current economic conditions , poverty will not be substantially reduced unless government does more to help the working poor and those who are willing to work but can not find jobs . we must also expand the reach of our safety-net programs . ' economists long have criticized the official poverty rate as inadequate . based on a half-century-old government formula , the official rate continues to assume the average family spends one-third of its income on food . those costs have declined to a much smaller share , more like one-seventh . in reaction to some of the criticism , the obama administration in 2010 asked the census bureau to develop a new poverty measure , based partly on recommendations made by the national academy of sciences . the goal is to help lawmakers better gauge the effectiveness of anti-poverty programs . for instance , the new measure finds that if it were n't for social security payments , the poverty rate would rise to 54.7 percent for people 65 and older and 24.5 percent for all age groups . refundable tax credits such as the earned income tax credit helped lift 9 million people above the poverty line . without the credits , child poverty would rise from 18 percent to 24.7 percent .", "summary": " last government census recorded the number of poor people across the country as 46.5 million .   new figures say the real number is a record-breaking 49.7 million .   results come as congress continues to negotiate further cuts of up to $ 4 billion annually for the food stamp program .   california , district of columbia , nevada and florida earmarked as having the highest shares of poor people per state .   official list , however , says more rural states have higher poverty levels , lead by mississippi , louisiana and new mexico .
