{"text": "a british man is now claiming scotland 's proudest creation : whisky . entrepreneur daniel szor will soon begin creating whisky - more than 500 miles from one of the homelands of whisky - glenmorangie . entrepreneur daniel szor , 51 , plans to produce ultra-premium , small batch single malt whisky from his plant in the cotswolds . by 2017 , visitors to the area could be enjoying a glass of cotswolds single malt - for the price of # 44.95 per bottle . by then , mr szor aims to have his first run of 5,000 ` single estate ' bottles ready . yet three years before the launch , he is already taking orders of the whisky . mr szor is renovating two cotswolds stone buildings at stourton , near shipston , in warkwickshire to equip as the distillery , tasting rooms and offices . he has also imported a scotsman to help him with the job - master distiller harry cockburn and a wood and ageing consultant , jim swan , has also been brought on board . as well as whisky , the distillery will also make dry gin and a range of brandies and liqueurs made from local fruits and berries . by september this year , mr szor hopes to begin producing his first bottles and in the summer of 2015 gin from the distillery will go on sale . the distillery will also create a rye whisky called traitor 's ford rye after a local landmark associated with the english civil war . mr szor said : ` we are excited to be creating an adventurous new landmark for the region and for english whisky . ' the idea was born out of a passion for single malt . ' i was very much charmed by the scottish and their production . ' i really did n't want to sit behind a desk any more so i thought to myself ` what else can i do ? ' ' i just happened to be looking out of the window at our cotswolds house and i saw a beautiful field full of barley and thought i could distil that , ' he said . and all of the ingredients used in the distillery will be from the cotswolds . the businessman bought his first cast of the spirit in 2002 , at the newly reopened bruichladdich distillery on islay . over time , daniel , who is originally from new york , watched a number of whisky distilleries open , and grow from strength to strength , inspiring him to start his own operation . the label on the bottles will read : ` established 2013 , single malt whisky ' . each bottle will be decorated with a pheasant . a new home for whisky : the cotswolds . mr szor is pictured here in front of the stone buildings in stourton , warwickshire . soon , bottles of cotswolds single malt will begin being released from behind these doors . he plans to use locally sourced ingredients in his production , and has already pre-purchased 20 tonnes of barely from a nearby farm . cotswolds water will also feature as one of the main ingredients , and bottles of both single-malt and gin will be finished off with speciality water bought in from blenheim , oxfordshire . but although scotland is the country behind whisky , mr szor said he does not find its reputation for the drink intimidating , instead , he plans to follow the scottish lead . mr szor aims to have his first 5,000 bottles of costwolds single malt ready by 2017 . the distillery will also make dry gin and a range of brandies and liqueurs made from local fruits and berries . from the warwickshire site , he hopes to produce around 120,000 bottles of whisky a year . he said : ' i never forget for a day what good quality drinks are being made just a couple of hundred miles north of us . ` what we put out in a year will be what the medium scottish firms put out in a day or two . ` we are looking to build a reputation regionally , to us scotland is not intimidating , it is a road to follow . ' i see a lot of people who want to go off and do their own thing , but i 'm in this to make a product , i need to be able to sell my second bottle as well as my first . ' the szor family is funding the project alongside the cotswolds distillery founders circle - which is offering interested investors an opportunity to take part . scottish version of the spirit is spelled without an ` e ' the irish version takes an ` e ' the spirit is distilled and made with cereals , yeast and water . comes from the gaelic ` uisge beatha ' , or ` usquebaugh ' , meaning ` water of life ' since 2007 , legally , scotch single malt whisky must be produced in scotland . term single malt scotch whisky can only be used for a scotch whisky distilled at a single distillery . from 2012 , by law , bottles labelled single malt scotch wisky can only be produced in scotland . whisky . does not mature , no matter how long it is kept for . for example , a . 10-year-old whisky does not become a 50-year-old whisky if kept for 50 . years . different grains can be used for the spirit : barley , rye , corn , maize . the process : first the whisky is malted , which means sugar is extracted from barley and turned into alcohol using yeast . next , the malt is ground and hot water is added . the product is distilled - which means that the liquid is heated to the correct temperature . with whisky the process usually happens twice . liquid is then stored and matured in oak casks . the whisky is then blended and bottled . hundreds of miles away in fife , another unlikely entrepreneur has had a bright idea : to create the first bottle of scottish wine . in september , in upper largo , some 40 miles from edinburgh , weather dependant , scotland 's first grapes will be harvested . meanwhile in fife : christopher trotter will soon be selling bottles of chateau largo from grapes grown some 30 miles from edinburgh . by summer 2015 , christopher trotter , the man behind the scottish wine , will be enjoying a bottle of chateau largo - created off the a197 . chateau largo will be a medium dry white wine - with a similar taste to chardonnay or riesling . the project of bringing wine to scotland began with a throwaway comment when a friend of mr trotter 's said that if climate change continued , fife would be the same temperature as the loire valley within 20 years . thanks to another friend who supported the project financially , mr trotter was able to bring 100 vines from ryedale in north yorkshire to scotland . he is growing three grape varieties : solaris , siegerrebe and rondo - all of which originate from germany . the grapes were chosen because they can all be harvested in september before temperatures drop . the plot is a six acre site , with a south-facing slope overlooking the north sea , where , mr trotter says the sunshine is ` fantastic ' . last july the average temperature in fife was 21.4 degrees . this morning however , the temperature is just 7 degrees and the humidity is 76 per cent . but according to mr trotter the plot 's location is key to the wine 's success - there are no hills blocking the sun and drainage to get rid of the rain . mr trotter has high hopes for the british wine industry . if the wine is a success , he hopes to attract an investor who will help finance planting 5,000 vineyards and produce 15,000 bottles of wine a year .", "summary": " daniel szor will distil cotswolds single malt in stourton , warwickshire .   has imported a master distiller from scotland and a wood consultant to help .   was looking at the barley in his garden and thought ' i could distill that '   spring water from oxfordshire will be used to add a local touch .   hopes to produce 120,000 bottles a year with # 44.95 pricetag .   ` to us scotland is not intimidating , it is a road to follow , ' he says .
