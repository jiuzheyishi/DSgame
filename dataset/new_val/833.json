{"text": "gps handing out antibiotics to placate demanding patients is leading to a rise in resistant superbugs that could send medicine ` back to the dark ages ' family doctors are needlessly doling out antibiotics to ` placate ' patients , an influential group of mps warns today . the practice of gps using the drugs ` simply to achieve a placebo effect ' is fuelling a growth in antibiotic resistance , according to a report by the commons science and technology committee . the mail reported last week how the country 's chief medical officer , dame sally davies , said that patients pressing gps for antibiotics were part of the problem . she also said she will die from a routine infection if she undergoes a hip replacement operation 20 years from now . another expert said gps were issuing the drugs to up to 90 per cent of the patients they see with distressing symptoms -- whether or not they would be any use . the problem is so serious that david cameron last week said superbugs ' resistance to antibiotics could send medicine ` back to the dark ages ' . now he is being urged by the committee to back his words with ` decisive and urgent action ' before it is too late to stem a tide of infections that can not be treated . the mps ' report says : ` for too long , antibiotics have been used as if they were a bottomless pit of cure-all miracle treatments . ` antibiotics are ineffective against viruses and other diseases that are not caused by bacteria and the unnecessary prescription of antibiotics has contributed to the acceleration of antibiotic resistance . ' the committee warned in particular of gps using antibiotics as a placebo to make patients think they are getting effective treatments , even when the drugs have no medical impact . andrew miller , chairman of the committee which has completed a seven-month inquiry , said : ` antibiotic resistance can not be entirely prevented , but it is a problem made worse by inappropriate use and poor stewardship of antibiotics in healthcare and farming . about 35 Â¿ million prescriptions for antibiotics are are given out a year by gps in england . the number has risen 30 per cent since 2000 as 5,000 people a year die from resistant bacteria . ` we heard concerns , for instance , that antibiotics are often prescribed by gps simply to achieve a placebo effect or placate patients with distressing symptoms . ` in farming , meanwhile , we suspect that antibiotics may be routinely used on healthy animals . ' dr michael moore of the royal college of general practitioners told the committee that gps were issuing antibiotics to up to nine out of ten patients , the report says . antibiotics , designed to fight bacteria , are routinely given to treat viral infections such as colds and flu . while patients may leave the surgery happy , the prescription will do little to fight their illness . about 35 million prescriptions for antibiotics are dispensed every year by gps in england . the number has risen 30 per cent since 2000 , according to nhs figures . meanwhile 5,000 people die from antibiotic-resistant infections in england every year . the nhs has brought down rates of two of the most serious superbugs -- mrsa and c.difficile -- through a huge awareness campaign and improved hygiene in hospitals . but new threats have emerged to replace them , including e.coli , cases of which increased 30 per cent between 2005 and 2009 . increased cleanlines in hospitals has brought rates of mrsa -lrb- pictured -rrb- and c.difficile infection down but new strains have emerged to replace them , such as e.coli . the committee report says : ` we found . it difficult to understand how the government has failed to act . decisively to address the issue of inappropriate prescription of . antibiotics . ' dame sally . has asked the government to put antibiotic resistance on the national . risk register , ranking it alongside a large-scale terrorist attack . she has warned that without action we may return to a ` 19th-century environment ' in which routine operations are potentially deadly . she told the committee : ` when i need a new hip in 20 years , i will die of a routine infection because we have run out of antibiotics . ' mr cameron announced last week that jim o'neill , former chief economist at goldman sachs , will lead an international group of experts aiming to spur drug development . but mr miller said : ` publishing strategies and announcing reviews is not the same as dealing with the problem . ` what we really need from government right now is decisive and urgent action to prevent antibiotics from being given to people and animals who do not need them . ' the committee says greater public awareness is needed to ease pressure on gps to dish out the drugs .", "summary": " mps warn doctors are handing out too many prescriptions for antibiotics .   family doctors giving out medicine unnecessarily to placate patients .   over-use is leading to rise in superbug strains resistant to antibiotics .   david cameron warned bugs could send medicine ` back to the dark ages ' "}
