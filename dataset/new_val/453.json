' george osborne , outside number 11 before the budget in march this year , has tried to claim credit for increasing the personal allowance . but the lib dems say the policy would not have been introduced without them . he added : ` we 've delivered the largest programme of tax cuts for a generation over the last four years , despite all of the other financial pressures . ` these manifesto commitments will mean nothing less than a generational shift to a fairer tax system that rewards work and helps working people . ` that 's the way to build a stronger economy and a fairer society and ensure that everyone has the opportunity to get on in life .
