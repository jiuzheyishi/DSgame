{"text": "arsenal are staring at a fifth-straight champions league last 16 exit following their 3-1 first leg defeat at home to monaco on wednesday night - a defeat which has brought a dark cloud over the gunners ' season . with that in mind , sportsmail have arsenal fan lewis potton of 90min . com to tell us what he makes of the situation . let 's see what he had to say . after the drubbing arsenal received at the hands of monaco on wednesday , the mood among fans is probably as low as it could be . it was not just the manner of the defeat that has hurt gunners fans , but the false promise that came before it . after the 2-0 victory over manchester city last month , it looked as if arsenal had finally learned how to handle the big occasion , a view shared by most fans i 've spoken to . however , wednesday night showed just how naive and frail this team can be on their day . if we 'd have come into the game on the back of defeats and poor form , as we did against bayern in 2013 , then the result may have been less humiliating . however , sitting third in the league and with some encouraging performances since christmas , it was a different scenario altogether and made the whole experience all the more galling to watch . arsene wenger found it painful viewing as his arsenal side capitulated 3-1 at home to monaco on wednesday . dimitar berbatov rolled back the years with a glorious finish as monaco scored three away goals . arsenal players look dejected during the match as they now face a daunting second leg comeback attempt . losing 3-1 at home hands the team an enormous task for the second-leg in france . a task i do n't see this side capable of completing at this moment in time . there were so many shocking displays across the pitch on wednesday night that it will take something truly historic for arsenal to progress to the next stage . according to infostrada sports , arsenal have a 1.5 per cent chance of qualifying for the quarter-finals , and to be honest , that sounds spot on . let 's examine how monaco have played in europe this season . they conceded one goal in six matches in the group stage and were only breached last night by a top class alex oxlade-chamberlain strike . if that is the calibre of goal needed for arsenal to win in france , then 1.5 per cent looks generous . compact and excellent on the break , monaco were set up perfectly . their 3-1 lead for the return leg also suits them . arsenal will have to attack with numbers and will leave themselves open to the same counter-attacks we saw at the emirates . optimists will point to arsenal 's experiences against bayern in 2013 ; where we similarly lost 3-1 at home , before narrowly going out on away goals after a 2-0 win in munich . the game in monaco is a world away from that tie . monaco wo n't open up because they are playing at home , like bayern did . boss leonardo jardim will have them playing the same system . tight , compact and defensively sound . alex oxlade-chamberlain gave the gunners hope when he made the score 2-1 late on before monaco 's third . what to say about the manager . most of us love arsene wenger , but he had the wrong idea straight from selecting his team for this game . when will he learn that picking cazorla and ozil in a midfield three is not feasible in europe ? rosicky should have started alongside coquelin in midfield , at least giving some sort of base from which to play . some arsenal fans like to get on ozil 's back because of his style of play , but it 's like wenger is putting a square peg in a round hole . he is n't the sort of player who will track back and battle for you and everyone knows that . monreal has also played well of late and it was surprising that wenger suddenly thrust gibbs into the left back slot . presumably because he is better going forward . it screamed as though wenger and arsenal wanted to put the game to bed at home and have an easy away game , which is ridiculous . as a club , we should know by now that the champions league is never that simple . another season , another disappointment in europe for arsenal . mesut ozil and santi cazorla should n't have started together in midfield for arsenal on wednesday night . for more fan views or to join the conversation visit www.90min.com .", "summary": " arsenal lost 3-1 at home to monaco in their champions league last 16 tie .   arsene wenger should n't have started both santi cazorla and mesut ozil .   wenger should have dropped one for tomas rosicky in midfield .   it was a surprise too that nacho monreal was replaced by kieran gibbs .   read : arsenal fans vent fury on twitter after champions league loss .   click here for all the latest arsenal news .
