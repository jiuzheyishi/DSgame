{"text": "jake baynes resigned amid claims that the party had been ` infiltrated by the glastonbury occult ' a ukip parliamentary candidate has resigned amid claims the party has been infiltrated by ` occultists ' . teacher jake baynes was due to stand in next year 's general election , but has stood down amid a row over a ` continuous campaign ' to oust him as the candidate . and his allies have pointed the finger at two ` oddball ' party members who run an ` angelic healing group ' in the somerset town of glastonbury . they say the pair are responsible for stirring up trouble at the local party branch in wells . the members in question , glen and colleen tucker , practise ` alternative healing ' and work , according to their website , ` hand in hand with the angelic realms ... and galactic beings ' . they have been described as ` oddballs ' belonging to ` the glastonbury occult crowd ' by one of mr baynes 's allies . graham livings , who has also resigned from his post as branch manager , said of the tuckers : ` they put on these weekend retreats where they guarantee the angels will be present . they are oddballs . the public can be very wary of that sort of thing . ukip has a prescribed list which states that no one who has been a member of the bnp or the english defence league should be a member . ` but when they sat down and wrote out the prescribed list , they would n't have thought to put occultists down . ` i 'm nervous about the occult and many people i know who 've seen that these people are involved in ukip have said ,  well , i 'm not voting ukip with them in position  . these people say that they take angelic guidance and defer in all things to st michael the archangel -- and at the same time we 're experiencing such vitriol and bile from them . ' mr baynes , 40 , won 1,711 votes in 2010 and may have helped liberal democrat tessa munt win the wells seat , which she took with a majority of just 800 over tory david heathcoat-amory . he was re-selected as ukip 's wells candidate in april . but soon afterwards he claims he became the victim of a vendetta by the tuckers . they say mr baynes is simply ` not up to the job ' and deny having any vendetta . nigel farage , ukip 's leader with jake baynes who was due to stand in next year 's general election . in return , his supporters say the tuckers are just the kind of ` fruitcakes and loonies ' which have dogged ukip 's attempts to be seen as a serious party . resigning on tuesday evening , mr baynes explained : ` there has been a continuous campaign by people who , for some reason did n't want me selected , to work their very hardest to oust me . ` it 's got so bad that i really want to get out of it -- i do n't want to get involved in politics again . ` i 've realised politics is a very ugly , dirty business , and i want nothing more to do with it . ' referring to the owners of the angelic guidance and healing centre in glastonbury , a town said to have ` mystic ' properties , he said : ` glastonbury has many different quirky things about it , and that 's what makes it unique i love that . ` but i do n't think it has a place in politics , especially when you are in conversation with the archangel . i do n't think i have experienced any of their -lsb- the tucker 's -rsb- angelic healing in my career and the campaign they have against me . ' mr tucker stood unsuccessfully as a ukip candidate in the county council elections a couple of years ago , while mrs tucker is the ukip somerset treasurer . he said of mr livings : ` he accused us of being part of the occult , which is ridiculous . ` what we do here has nothing to do with our involvement in ukip . we 're stalwarts of the community in glastonbury . ' ` he is confused , if he thinks it is an occult he really does n't understand what we do . we are spiritual people .
