{"text": "the archbishop of canterbury has criticised energy companies for imposing huge price rises that will hammer struggling families . justin welby said power giants had a ` massive ' moral duty beyond squeezing customers for maximum profit , and challenged the firms to justify their huge increases in bills . the archbishop , himself a former oil executive , said he understood the anger over apparently ` inexplicable ' rises and called on the companies ` to behave with generosity and not merely to maximise opportunity ' . sympathy : archbishop of canterbury justin welby said he understood anger over ` inexplicable ' rises . he hit out after british gas announced a 9.2 per cent hike , despite parent company centrica recording a # 2.7 billion profit last year . other suppliers are expected to follow suit . speaking exclusively to the mail on sunday , britain 's most senior cleric said that rises which would add an average # 123 a year to bills were ` a huge moral issue ' for energy firms . archbishop welby 's comments will heap pressure on the government to get tougher on the industry . energy prices have become a major political issue , with labour accusing the government of failing to tackle ` rip-off ' companies , while ministers have said consumers should switch to better deals and even wear jumpers to keep warm . the archbishop called on energy companies to be ` conscious of their social obligations ' and said : ` the impact on people , particularly on low incomes , is going to be really severe in this , and the companies have to justify fully what they are doing . ` i do understand when people feel that this is inexplicable , and i can understand people being angry about it , because having spent years on a low income as a clergyman i know what it is like when your household budget is blown apart by a significant extra fuel bill and your anxiety levels become very high . that is the reality of it . ' price rise : profits at british gas rose 11 per cent last year . the issue of fuel prices has shot to the top of the political agenda since labour leader ed miliband promised to freeze bills for 20 months if he won the next election , a pledged branded a ` con ' by david cameron . shadow energy secretary caroline flint welcomed the archbishop 's comments , saying : ` the chorus of voices telling this government to act on spiralling energy bills is deafening . ' archbishop welby said the energy companies had a moral obligation to set prices fairly . he said : ` they have control because they sell something everyone has to buy . we have no choice about buying it . ` with that amount of power comes huge responsibility to serve society . it is not like some other sectors of business where people can walk away from you if they do n't want to buy your product and you are entitled to seek to maximise your profit . ` the social licence to operate of the energy companies is something they have to take very , very seriously indeed . ' archbishop welby added that he was concerned that fuel poverty was ` a very severe issue ... because real incomes are flat or declining and the cost of energy has gone up . it ties in with the food banks and the debt . they are all part of the reality of life for many people today . ' ` the chorus of voices telling this government to act on spiralling energy bills is deafening . ' - shadow energy secretary caroline flint . fuel poverty is defined as when ten per cent or more of a household 's disposable income is spent on adequate heating . following the archbishop 's comments , the mail on sunday discovered that the church of england itself invests heavily in energy firms . accounts show the church owns more than # 7 million worth of shares in centrica and about # 6 million in sse . the church says it uses its investments for ` active engagement ' with companies and their boards to exert a positive influence . british gas 's price rise announced last week follows an 8.2 per cent increase by sse . other ` big six ' suppliers are likely to follow . the hike dismayed campaigners , who said it was a ` big , nasty ' shock for families who would have to choose between eating and heating this winter . but the suppliers all say they have to put up bills in the face of rising costs . sse summed up the position , saying : ` we regret having to put our prices , but the cost of supplying energy is going up : buying it , delivering it to homes and the cost of government taxes all cost more than last year and are outside our direct control . ' archbishop welby , who worked for french firm elf aquitaine and london-based enterprise oil before becoming a vicar in coventry , said he did not have enough evidence to know if the suppliers were too quick to pass on wholesale rises , but slow to pass on price falls . profits at british gas rose 11 per cent last year to # 606 million , and managing director chris weston is expected to net # 2 million in share bonuses this year on top of a # 595,000 salary . archbishop welby pays the energy bills for his lambeth palace flat out of his annual # 74,000 stipend , but most clergy receive less than # 25,000 a year . ` wrong place ' : energy minister greg barker said some planners have been ` too insensitive ' ` can not be at any place at any price ' : minister greg barker . wind farms have scarred the british landscape and turned the public against the renewable energy agenda , an energy minister has conceded . greg barker made the admission as he promised that future projects would be located off-shore . ` we put certain projects in the wrong place , ' the energy and climate change minister said . ` some planners have been too insensitive to the impact on the landscape and it has turned public opinion against the wider renewable agenda . we are very clear about the need to limit the impact on the countryside and landscape . it is quite clear the expansion of the on-shore wind rush is over . ' mr barker 's comments come amid growing political tension over rising household energy bills and a week after it was revealed that a record number of on-shore wind farms have been approved for construction this year . between january and august , 188 were granted planning permission -- a 49 per cent increase on the same period in 2012 . as energy companies continue to lodge applications to take advantage of generous green subsidies , mr barker said britain was on course to meet a target that 20 per cent of electricity must come from sustainable sources by 2020 . but the minister added that he would write to every council , warning they must ban turbines from areas of outstanding natural beauty . he said : ` there 's enough wind projects in the system now so we do n't need to see any more on-shore expansion . the big area for expansion is off-shore , where there is scope for larger projects . ` with those projects in the system or under consideration in the planning process at the moment , it means we have enough to get to our 2020 targets . ` but it can not be at any place and at any price .
