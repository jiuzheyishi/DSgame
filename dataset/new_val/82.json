{"text": "when phil mickelson , five times a major winner , begins checking his green maps standing over a three foot putt , it is fair to assume he is feeling a little tense . even on the first morning of the first day , the ryder cup can do that to a guy . even a cool guy like mickelson . he stayed calm enough to drop it , though . and as it fell , paul mcginley 's marquee pairing went down the hole with it . rory mcilroy and sergio garcia , the world number one and number three , had no way back from there . mickelson saved his best for last , his birdie on the 18th giving america an unassailable and perfectly timed lead in the friday session . to be fair , it probably did n't need to be mickelson 's absolute best . the european did n't play well enough to provoke that . mickelson made his four via a bunker , but so abject was the performance of the european pair on the final hole that this was still plenty good enough . rory mcilroy and phil mickelson watch on during their fourballs encounter on friday morning . mcilroy did n't enjoy his best morning on the first day of the ryder cup at gleneagles . the world no 1 was unusually insipid when the european team were looking to him to lead from the front . video mcilroy saves point . neither mcilroy nor garcia made the green of gleneagles ultimate par five in the regulation three shots . at one stage garcia chipped from rough straight into a bunker . mcilroy was barely in contention , either . he had a dreadful first round , with the european team looking to him to set the standard . it was a close game , but one that europe certainly could have won . if mcilroy had delivered even an approximation of the game that has taken him to the pinnacle of golf 's rankings , it would have been too much for the opposing pair . instead , he was insipid , garcia inconsistent , and america cleaned up at the death . europe led by a hole coming away from the 15th , but keegan bradley eagled the 16th and mickelson won the last to give european captain mcginley plenty to consider at the turnaround . in medinah , last time out , 12 of the 28 matches went to the last hole , and europe collected nine and a half points from those games . here , two went the distance in the morning and europe gleaned half a point . to see mcilroy and garcia fall so dramatically was a particularly crushing blow . ` find mcilroy and break him , ' was the instruction of paul azinger , the last american captain to win the ryder cup . what impact this defeat was going to have remained to be seen , but it was certainly a positive start for tom watson 's stars and stripes . having got their noses in front late , nobody expected to see europe 's strongest pair crumble so spectacularly . mickelson shakes the hands of europe 's garcia and mcilroy after beating the pair . sergio garcia -lrb- left -rrb- and mcilroy leave the 18th green dejected after surrendering a point . the american keegan bradley celebrates with a victory punch after winning the 16th hole . not that mickelson and bradley are inferiors as a unit . at the end of the morning session , they were on the best run of any american duo at a ryder cup since larry nelson and lanny wadkins in 1979 . yet the golf played did not have to be that of a great partnership . indeed , anyone expecting a masterclass from players of such pedigree would have left this corner of perthshire sorely disappointed . far from an exhibition , this was something altogether earthier . a scrap , a dust-up , a bundle in the playground . the match fluctuated because the performances fluctuated , and wildly . mcilroy played the first home like the world number one , and the second like a club handicapper . find mcilroy , as azinger suggested ? it would have been hard because he spent so much time in unfamiliar surroundings : off to the left in heavy rough , short in greenside bunkers . nerves make the ryder cup special , but this better resembled a monthly medal , particularly on the long holes that professionals relish . the northern irishman coming up against mickelson was the blockbuster match-up of the opening day . the hole is a par five , but not one of the quartet took a shot off it . the tone had been set even earlier . ` on the tee , keegan bradley , ' said the official starter on the first . the resulting was fired a long way left . ` on the 18th tee , keegan bradley , ' said a jocular soul in the crowd . bradley -- identified by europe 's rabble rouser ian poulter as a kindred spirit in the opposing ranks -- rode a lot of comments like that . ` want tea with that slice ? ' crowed a voice on the fourth , as another tee shot set off along a wayward path . by the sixth -- and a hole down after garcia had chipped in from a bunker on four -- even the genial mickelson was getting tetchy . he snapped at a small party of television cameramen , who had taken a wrong turn and almost knocked him over as they tried frantically to retrace their steps along the fairway . on the eighth there was a row over whether bradley should get relief from a lousy lie . europe objected . ` is there some new rule i do n't know about ? ' asked mickelson , tartly . bradley 's caddie , steve hale , was also distinctly unamused . then again , he spent much of the morning at war with the world . spectators , rogue cameramen , shadows , everything seemed to be getting on his wick . keegan bradley -lrb- left -rrb- shakes hands with garcia with both mickelson and mcilroy watching on . what was getting on mcilroy 's wick was his game . it would n't come when he called it . he made precious few interventions worthy of his reputation . mcilroy won the 13th and 15th holes , to take the game from two down to all square , but on both occasions with straightforward pars to american bogeys . meanwhile , with all the players struggling to find form , there was n't even the predicted needle . in the phoney war that always precedes this event , mickelson had made a jibe about the legal battle beteen mcilroy and graeme mcdowell 's management company . would mcilroy give him the cold shoulder ? hardly . on the short buggy ride up to the ninth tee , the pair shared a buggy and mickelson put his arm around the shoulders of his young rival , laughing . mcilroy smiled back . they were both probably in need of consolation at that point . by the end , however , mcilroy was left to fend for himself .", "summary": " the ryder cup is underway on the pga centenary course at gleneagles .   phil mickelson and keegan bradley claim victory on the last against rory mcilroy and sergio garcia to put usa 2.5-1 .5 up .   the northern irishman was expected to lead from the front on the first day .
