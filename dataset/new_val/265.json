{"text": "the nhs is to spend # 250million to clear a massive backlog of knee , cataract and hip replacement operations . jeremy hunt will today announce that the injection of cash will help ensure no one waits more than a year for treatment -- unless it is clinically necessary . but the plan will also mean longer waiting times for tens of thousands of patients . surgeons : the nhs is to spend # 250million to clear a backlog of knee , cataract and hip replacement operations . the number of people on the nhs waiting list now stands at 3.1 million -- its highest for six years ; with almost 600 having waited for longer than 12 months . the health secretary will say the money will pay for up to 100,000 operations over the next few months in a bid to treat some of those who have waited the longest . officials admit that meeting the backlog will cause a short-term rise in the number of people waiting more than 18 weeks -- still the most important target for hospitals -- breaching a national pledge that 90 per cent of patients should be treated within this timescale . ministers say this short-term breach is necessary to clear the huge backlog in elective surgery , which they attribute to higher demand and an ageing society . it means an extra 100,000 people a month are being referred for treatment compared to 2010 , with hospitals performing an extra 2,000 operations a day . but labour will say that the new 12-month treatment pledge is merely a way to deflect attention from a failure to tackle growing waiting lists in the health service over the past four years . action should be targeted at all those on the waiting list -- not just the longest -- they say . in may 2010 , the month of the last election , some 20,662 patients had waited for 18 weeks or more . by may 2014 , this total had soared to 29,847 . the situation is so bad in some trusts that patients have been urged to pay privately if they want to be treated more quickly . the clinical commissioning group in southampton , for example , has imposed tough restrictions on cataract operations -- and has been named and shamed by the rnib . ` we need targets that help patients ' : jeremy hunt will announce that the injection of cash will help ensure no one waits more than a year for treatment . at the same time , the local trust -- southampton university hospitals -- allows people denied nhs treatment to pay for the service that would otherwise be provided free . its website offers ` a new option , between the traditional private sector and the nhs ' . mr hunt 's response is to target those waiting more than a year . in may 2014 , 574 people were in this position -- down from 18,458 four years previously . every person who has waited more than 52 weeks or is on the verge of doing so will have their case reviewed to see whether they should be fast-tracked . on a visit to royal surrey county hospital in guildford , the health secretary will say : ` no one -- except in exceptional circumstances -- should have to wait more than a year . ` -lsb- we need -rsb- targets that help patients get treatment when they need it -- not targets followed blindly with no regard for the impact on individuals . ` an nhs confident that -- in the end -- it will continue to meet the huge challenges ahead if it leaves room , amongst many loud , competing pressures , for the quietest but most important voice of all : that of the patient . ' liz kendall , a labour health spokeswoman , said : ` david cameron promised to protect patient care , but instead he has lost control of waiting times . ` the number of people waiting more than 18 weeks for their treatment has increased by 50 per cent since 2010 , and the cancer waiting time target has been missed for the first time ever . ` the tories have mismanaged the nhs -- and it 's patients who are paying the price . ' funded by the extra # 250million , the nhs will in the next few weeks carry out more than 100,000 treatments to people who have been waiting more than 18 weeks , of which 40,000 will be admitted to hospital . it will also conduct an immediate review of every person waiting over or close to 52 weeks . treating them will be a priority , unless there are strong clinical reasons for the delay or the patient chooses to wait longer . a department of health source said : ` because operations on longer waiters are often more complex and difficult , they take more time and resources . ` however , by the end of the year the nhs will start meeting the target again . '", "summary": " almost 600 nhs patients have waited more than a year for their operations .   the money will pay for as many as 100,000 operations in coming months .   labour calls it a ploy to distract attention from lengthening waiting lists .
