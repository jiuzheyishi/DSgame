{"text": "nasa is rushing to resolve a spacesuit problem that put the life of an astronaut in danger in 2013 ahead of three important spacewalks . two astronauts onboard the iss will venture outside the station in the suits in the coming days . but while the suits appear to be in working order , engineers are concerned about a recurring issue that led to the helmet flooding previously while an astronaut was in space . us space agency nasa is rushing to fix a spacesuit problem . it is related to a problem in 2013 that nearly drowned an astronaut . the issue is where the fan pump separator , party of the spacesuit 's temperature control system . if the pump failed , the astronauts would have to return to the iss -lrb- shown -rrb- . the issue is with a piece of equipment known as the fan pump separator , part of the spacesuit 's temperature control system . ` that is the same area of concern we had back in 2013 when we had the issue of the water in the helmet , ' said kenneth todd , iss operations and integration manager . the trio of upcoming spacewalks will install new docking stations for commercial cargo at the orbiting laboratory . construction of the iss began on 20 november 1998 . it supports a crew of up to six , with crews split into groups of three . the station orbits at a height of about 255 miles -lrb- 410km -rrb- . it has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds -lrb- 450,000 kg -rrb- and has living space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house . it completes an orbit of earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles -lrb- 27,600 km -rrb- per hour . it has now been in space for more than 5,900 days , during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of earth , and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years . nasa was alerted to the problem when astronauts were doing spacesuit maintenance in december and found that the fan pump in one suit did not speed up as expected . a new fan pump separator that was on board the space station was installed as a replacement ` and it has been working with no issues since that point , ' said mr todd . however , when nasa commander barry wilmore was scrubbing cooling loops on another us spacesuit on january 20 , he heard an ` abnormally loud fan pump separator , ' according to nasa 's blog of space station activities . ` we were doing the same kind of activity and encountered the same type of failure , ' mr todd told reporters . ` that got us thinking : what has changed ? what is happening ? ' a new spacesuit was shipped to the outpost and will be worn by mr wilmore during the spacewalks . the other spacesuit , with the replacement part , will be worn by fellow astronaut terry virts . its fan pump separator has shown some signs of corrosion , but it is working , todd said . ` the two suits we are going out with have operated every time we turned them on , ' he said . engineers believe that small amounts of water are building up in the bearings inside the fan pump separator each time the suit is powered up and powered down , leading to corrosion over time . the upcoming spacewalks will be performed by nasa astronauts barry wilmore -lrb- left -rrb- and terry virts -lrb- right -rrb- . the spacewalks are scheduled for 20 february , 24 february and 1 march , each beginning at around 12.10 pm gmt -lrb- 7.10 am est -rrb- and lasting about six hours . the issue is related to the water-in-helmet leak that nearly drowned italian astronaut luca parmitano during a spacewalk in july 2013 - he rushed back into the space station and quickly recovered - but is not expected to cause a similar gush of water , mr todd said . ` with the water in the helmet , that was a totally different root cause issue . that was an issue with port holes getting clogged up in the water separator , that was due to the water chemistry , ' he explained . ` that is not an issue here . what we are talking about is a failure of the pump to start up . that in itself is not a water-type of event . ' if the pump were to fail , the astronauts would have to end their spacewalk and return to the hatch . ` this is not a risk to the crew in terms of loss of life , ' said todd . the issue is related to the water-in-helmet leak that nearly drowned italian astronaut luca parmitano during a spacewalk in july 2013 - he rushed back into the space station and quickly recovered -lrb- shown here in this image from the iss -rrb- - but is not expected to cause a similar gush of water . a final decision about whether or not the spacewalks - known as extra-vehicular activities , or evas - can begin friday as planned depends on the outcome of further tests , and should be announced later today . ` all indicators are - based on all the data from the ground testing as well as the testing of the suits on orbit - is that we will work our way through this and these suits are going to be okay . but we have some open work left to do , ' said mr todd . the spacewalks are scheduled for 20 february , 24 february and 1 march , each beginning at around 12.10 pm gmt -lrb- 7.10 am est -rrb- and lasting about six hours . the astronauts will be preparing cables and communications gear for new docking ports at the space station . the ports will be used by future astronaut crews launched from cape canaveral , florida once the first commercial capsules are ready to fly people beginning in 2017 . boeing and spacex are in the process of completing their respective crew vehicles , which will restore the united states ' ability to send astronauts to low-earth orbit after the retirement of the space shuttle program in 2011 .", "summary": " us space agency nasa is rushing to fix a spacesuit problem .   it is related to a problem in 2013 that nearly drowned an astronaut .   the issue is where the fan pump separator , party of the spacesuit 's temperature control system .   if the pump failed , the astronauts would have to return to the iss .   three important spacewalks are scheduled to take place soon .   the spacewalks are scheduled for 20 february , 24 february and 1 march .   they are needed to install equipment for docking ports that will allow manned private spacecraft to dock with the space station in 2017 .
