{"text": "forty two shots at goal . that was the incredible total registered by brentford as they blew blackpool away . forty two . four of them went in and 14 of them were on target , including a hat-trick from jon toral . just why is it they are sacking mark warburton at the end of the season again ? still their soon-to-be-former manager kept alive chances of promotion to the premier league , having only guided them up from league one last season , with this obliteration . brentford striker jon toral jumps for joy after he completed his hat-trick in the 89th minute of the game . toral is congratulated by team-mate jonathan douglas after he opened the scoring for brentford . brentford : button , odubajo , dean , tarkowski , dallas , douglas -lrb- saunders 62 -rrb- , diagouraga , peleteiro ramallo -lrb- smith 66 -rrb- , pritchard , toral , gray -lrb- long 62 -rrb- . subs not used : craig , mccormack , bonham , yennaris . goals : toral 16 , 18 , 89 , gray 52 . blackpool : lewis , mcmahon , aldred -lrb- delfouneso 25 -rrb- , clarke , hall , dunne , perkins , rothwell , o'hara -lrb- oliver 39 -rrb- , davies -lrb- ferguson 53 -rrb- , madine . subs not used : parish , telford , cameron , o'dea . sent off : dunne . ref : andy d'urso . att : 8,765 . owner matthew benham claimed he had the long-term interests of the club at heart when he made the decision axe warburton after this campaign . he may live to rue that largely unpopular choice if warburton 's replacement fails to work the same miracles with this set of players . after 16 minutes of constant pressure they took the lead . a slick passing move - one of many - ended with jonathan douglas in plenty of space inside the box on the left and he could have shot himself but passed into jon toral to poke in . two minutes later and brentford were two ahead . this time they found space down the right and andre gray crossed deep to toral to head in completely free at the back post for his second of the night . blackpool 's first-half penalty area was heavily patched up with sand , but it made the seasiders no more at home as brentford poured forward with waves of attack . gray should have put brentford three ahead when he ran through on goal with time and space , but blackpool goalkeeper joe lewis was out quickly to block . brentford goalkeeper david button celebrates following toral 's opening strike at griffin park . brentford 's andre gray scores his side 's third goal of the night despite the attention of connor oliver . when blackpool 's charles dunne was shown a straight red card for a lunge on jota a minute before the break , it was hard to imagine a worse half of football for one side . predictably , seven minutes into the second half the home side went three ahead when gray saw a spectacular volley saved but collected the rebound and beat the keeper via the right post . alex pritchard had a vicious shot saved from inside the box on the right and gray had another go , turning a defender and getting a shot away which was again kept out . blackpool manager lee clark -lrb- right -rrb- shouts some orders on the sideline as his side suffer yet another loss . granted , blackpool are an embarrassment to the division , rock bottom and already 12 points adrift of safety . but no team , however much a gulf in class between the sides , should be so cut open in one match . as the game rolled on it became more like a training ground affair ; an attack versus defence drill . warburton threw on two more forwards - tommy smith and chris long - for shooting practice . but it was toral who completed the rout , and his treble , with a close-range finish in the 89th minute . deservedly , warburton 's name rang from the stands as the final whistle blew .", "summary": " jon toral grabs brace in space of three first-half minutes for brentford .   charles dunne was sent of for blackpool , who remain rooted to the bottom .   the spaniard , who is on loan from arsenal , completed his hat-trick in the 89th minute .   andre gray also netted for mark warburton 's side , who maintain an interest in the promotion push .
