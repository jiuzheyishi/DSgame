' the book was written by journalist and life-long arsenal fan amy lawrence . she tracked down and spoke to all members of the squad and management to talk about the unbeaten season . cole , who was still playing for chelsea at the time , turned down the chance to be interviewed for the book , and lawrence thought it was due to the manner of his controversial switch from north to west london . cole moved to chelsea from arsenal on transfer deadline day in 2006 . arsenal fans made mock # 20 notes to wave at cole when arsenal played chelsea as they accused him of moving for money . cole and arsenal fans never really made up following his departure in 2006 . cole was offered a new contract by arsenal on wages of # 55,000 per week , but in his own book , my defence , the left back said the offer left him ` trembling with anger ' as he had asked for # 60,000 per week and felt the club were not that keen on keeping him if they were prepared to haggle over # 5,000 . cole moved to chelsea on transfer deadline day with the blues offering a deal worth # 90,000-a-week and the move left a bad taste in the mouth for all concerned . manager arsene wenger described the whole cole saga as one of the regrets of his career . cole had been earmarked by patrick viera to replace him as arsenal captain and spend the whole of his career at the club . wenger says in the book that cole left due to a misunderstanding between his agent and the club . in an interview with www.the42.ie , lawrence said : ` when he left and went to chelsea , there was a lot of bad feeling on arsenal 's part and on his part . i do n't think he feels like he was treated well , and obviously arsenal do n't feel as if they were treated well . it was like a very messy divorce . ` you 'd like to think with a bit of time , he could look back on that period and be proud of it . i 'm not sure he 's ready to do that yet -- he certainly was n't ready while he was a chelsea player . ` perhaps in a few years ' time when his career is over and he has a bit more distance , maybe he can recognise what he achieved . i would n't be convinced it 'll happen , but certainly the players spoke fondly of him and had a lot of affection for him as a person as well as a player . but there 's obviously still a bit of a problem there .
