{"text": "it 's about . time we all started giving harry redknapp the credit he truly deserves . his reputation remains well and truly intact as one of the best . managers england has never had . let 's not underestimate the job he has . done at queens park rangers . a bunch of high-earning , under-performing players - a squad rotten to the core - has been shaken up and transformed into wembley winners in a short space of time . it reminds me of the incredible job redknapp did at spurs -- taking them from the relegation zone to the quarter-finals of the champions league in a flash . credit where it 's due : harry redknapp won promotion to the premier league with queens park rangers . huge difference : the former tottenham boss has transformed the dressing room atmosphere at loftus road . thump ! bobby zamora scored a late winner to sink derby county in the play-off final at wembley on saturday . when he took over , ryan nelsen - a . senior player redknapp considered the best at the club - came to him . saying he was leaving , and telling the boss he had ` no chance ' with the . qpr squad because it was ` the worst dressing room ' he had ever . witnessed . eighteen months ago qpr had a player who chose to pay a fine of two weeks ' wages - # 130,000 -- rather than sit on the bench for a premier league game . in january 2012 redknapp 's chairman signed a player for a huge transfer fee , put him on # 100,000 a week , only for the manager to then find out he was n't fit and was ` mentally fragile ' . just over a year ago redknapp had reason to believe an agent fed a ` story ' to a newspaper to whip up more trouble in the qpr camp . at the start of this season joey barton told his twitter followers he would not be playing for qpr in the championship . somehow redknapp turned this belligerent hate figure into a dedicated professional and a crucial part of their promotion picture . the critics tried to pin the blame for the huge rangers wage bill on redknapp , when clearly most of the players had been signed under different management . the harry-haters laughed as rangers flopped , and seized on their golden nuggets like : ` qpr 's wage bill is bigger than atletico madrid 's . ' redknapp did n't sanction the wages -- almost all the high-earners arrived before he did . and those on big money were awful flops who refused to perform and refused to move away from loftus road . that criticism of harry smacks of desperation , and yet i ca n't quite work out why people seem to be so anxious for redknapp to fail . his teams try to play decent football , and at bournemouth , portsmouth and spurs he achieved unprecedented success in the modern era . after a succession of players and agents were allowed to strip qpr of its money and its dignity , redknapp has restored pride in this terrific football club . redknapp . arrived to find a dressing room full of bad players with bad attitudes . on big money . that situation requires strong and clever management . the . fact that qpr now find themselves back in the premier league tells you . harry not only got the stinking , sinking ship cleaned out and floating . in calmer waters again , he 's also steered it in the right direction . if you 're not prepared to give harry redknapp credit for that then your dislike of him is personal , and a little bit strange . what 's the smirk for ? jose bosingwa was the epitome of everything that was wrong at qpr last season .", "summary": " former tottenham boss inherited high-earning squad .   ryan nelsen called it the ` worst dressing room ' he 's been involved in .   redknapp has turned the club around ahead of premier league adventure .
