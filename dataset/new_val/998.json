{"text": "men 's and women 's brains really are different . researchers say that if both sexes had access to the same levels of education , they 'd expect women to do best on tests of memory -- and men to excel at maths . the prediction comes after an analysis of how the sexes ' abilities varied across europe across time . more than 31,000 men and women aged 50-plus from 13 countries were put through three tests of brainpower . in northern europe , women in their 50s , 60s , 70s and 80s outperformed men in the memory test -lrb- file photo -rrb- . the test of numeracy involved being given five questions , such as working out how much a cut-price car would have cost when new , while the memory test involved trying to remember a list of ten words . the third test was of ` verbal fluency ' -- and involved naming as many different animals as possible in a minute . in northern europe , women in their 50s , 60s , 70s and 80s consistently outperformed the men in the memory test . however , in southern europe , where economic conditions were poorer for longer , the earliest born women did worse than the men . however , as education and living conditions improved , so did their performance and those born from around 1940 onwards beat their male counterparts . men came out top in the maths tests in all countries at all ages . the researchers said the patterns mean that if men and women had equal access to education , females should do better than men -lrb- file photo -rrb- . however , the gap narrowed as conditions improved , the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences reports . the researchers , from the international institute for applied systems analysis in austria , said that women may benefit more than men from improvements in lifestyle because they were at a greater disadvantage to begin with . they said the patterns mean that if men and women had equal access to education , females should do better than men . men should still to slightly better than maths -- and the sexes should do equally well in quick fire tests of vocabulary . it is thought the differing strengths can be explained by differences in the biology of the brain as well as in the way the sexes are treated by society .", "summary": " researchers say that if both sexes had access to same levels of education women would do best on memory -- and men at maths .   more than 31,000 men women aged 50-plus from 13 countries were put through three tests of brainpower .   in northern europe , women in their 50s , 60s , 70s and 80s outperformed men in memory test .
