{"text": "tory cabinet minister sajid javid was accused of hypocrisy last night after it emerged that a huge bonus he received as a # 3 million-a-year city banker was channelled through a tax haven . mr javid , 45 , was promoted to culture secretary earlier this month from his berth as a treasury minister , where he was highly critical of city tax-avoidance schemes . but an investigation by the mail on sunday has established that when he was a high-flying executive at deutsche bank , mr javid was among a group of senior staff who were paid bonuses worth at least # 50,000 each through shares in a cayman islands company -- to lower the company 's total tax bill . bonus row : culture secretary sajid javid with his wife laura . accountants said the scheme would have allowed both the bank and its staff to make tax savings . bank insiders said the scheme was intended to benefit staff rather than the bank . mr javid , a protege of chancellor george osborne who has been tipped as a future tory leader , was promoted to the position of culture secretary following the resignation of maria miller over her expenses . during his 18-month tenure at the treasury , mr javid spearheaded the government 's drive to stamp out tax-dodging , declaring that the treasury was ` closing down all avenues for tax avoidance , whether it is companies or individuals ' . ` we have to be very strong on tax avoidance and britain is leading the way , ' he said . he joined deutsche in 2000 , rising to become managing director in 2004 , before relocating to singapore as its head of private equity business . he left the bank in 2009 during the global financial crisis , and won the safe tory seat of bromsgrove in the following year 's general election . under the plan , top bankers at deutsche were approached in late 2003 asking if they wanted to have their bonuses paid through a cayman islands company . around 300 staff returned an application form volunteering to take part . the scheme enabled staff to receive more of their bonuses than they would have done if paid in cash , court papers reveal . if a banker was due to receive a bonus of # 100,000 , after tax the amount received would fall to # 60,000 -- the remainder would have been paid as tax at 40 per cent tax . on top of that the bank would have to pay # 12,000 for national insurance contributions . under the deutsche scheme , the bank could put in # 100,000 , the banker would receive # 100,000 , and no ni payments were due . the system exploited a loophole in tax rules that meant if bankers were paid in special shares -- called ` restricted securities ' -- no tax was due . instead of taking all their bonus in cash , bankers were given the option to take part of it in shares in a cayman islands company called dark blue investments , set up by another investment bank , investec . the shares could not be sold for at least two months . when they were sold , bankers would have had to pay capital gains tax -- amounting to just 10 per cent if the shares were held for two years or more . but no other tax was payable by the individuals . bankers who volunteered for the scheme could take a maximum of 90 per cent of their total bonus in shares . some of the bonuses were worth over # 2 million . hmrc has not pursued any individuals in the case , but instead is demanding # 49 million from deutsche in income tax and ni it claims the bank should have paid on to the taxman . this month deutsche won the right to appeal against an initial decision in favour of hmrc . the bank said it was ` pleased ' with the appeal court 's decision but declined to comment further . top bankers at deutsche were approached in late 2003 asking if they wanted to have their bonuses paid in the form of ` restricted ' shares in a cayman islands-based company . javid was one of 300 who returned an application form volunteering to take part . according to the rules in place at the time , the shares attracted only a 10 per cent capital gains tax bill rather than income tax and national insurance contributions . at the height of his career at deutsche , mr javid was earning an estimated # 3 million a year , of which a substantial proportion was in the form of bonuses . he would have to have been paid a minimum of # 50,000 in bonuses in 2003 to take part in the cayman islands tax scheme . two years ago , a tax tribunal ruled that the ` carefully planned ' # 50 million scheme was invalid because deutsche effectively controlled the offshore firm , and ordered the bank to repay the money to her majesty 's revenue and customs . deutsche appealed against the ruling and the case is still going through the courts . last night , labour 's shadow treasury minister cathy jamieson said : ` sajid javid claimed when he was at the treasury to be very focused on tax avoidance . now we learn there are accusations that he himself signed up for a scheme whereby bonuses were paid through questionable arrangements whilst a senior banker at deutsche bank . ` the public facing a cost of living crisis wo n't take kindly to any double standards . ` sajid javid needs to make absolutely clear what he knew about this scheme , what his reasons for agreeing to be involved were and whether he himself or his employer profited from the arrangements in respect of his own bonuses . ' mr javid -- the son of a pakistani bus driver who grew up with his parents and four siblings in a two-bedroom flat , but who now lives with his wife laura and four children in a # 4 million home in fulham , west london -- is the first asian secretary of state . his electorally powerful rags-to-riches story , and his closeness to mr osborne , have combined to turn him into the fastest-rising political talent in the conservative party . a spokesman for mr javid said : ` this is a matter between deutsche bank and hmrc . sajid was paid with all tax deducted already . ` sajid did not personally receive any tax advantage whatsoever from these arrangements .
