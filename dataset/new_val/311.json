{"text": "justice secretary chris grayling said the government is keen to have a ` serious discussion ' about ` revenge pornography ' ministers are seriously considering a change to the law to protect women from ex-partners who publish explicit pictures of them on the internet . chris grayling , the justice secretary , told mps yesterday that the government was looking to take ` appropriate action ' to tackle so-called ` revenge porn ' , which he described as a ` big problem in our society ' . mr grayling was speaking after a question in the commons by maria miller , the former culture secretary , who is campaigning for action on revenge porn . two weeks ago mr grayling told the mail that it ` was only right that we look at ways ' that existing sexual offences laws could be amended to outlaw it . there are about 30 websites in the uk used by ex-boyfriends and husbands to post intimate pictures of former lovers , but there is no specific law against the practice . women usually find the images are impossible to completely remove from the internet , as they are often reproduced on other websites within minutes . tory mp mrs miller said a law to ban revenge porn was urgently needed in the uk . she added : ` this is a form of sexual violence against women . what i want to do is make sure we have the right legal protection in place for these women . ' the ministry of justice is now looking at how that could be addressed . mr grayling said the government was ` very open ' to having a ` serious discussion ' about the practice with a view to ` taking appropriate action ' when parliament returns from its summer recess . the justice secretary said the uploading of sexually explicit media to the internet without the consent of the subject is becoming a bigger problem in britain . former culture secretary maria miller called for a change in the law to tackle the ` appalling practice ' he said the criminal justice and courts bill could be the vehicle for any change . during justice questions in the commons , mr grayling told mrs miller : ` you have done a very important job in raising this issue . it 's clearly becoming a bigger problem . ` what i 'd say to you today is the government is very open to having a serious discussion about this with a view to taking appropriate action in the autumn if we can identify the best way of doing so . ' mrs miller had asked : ` posting revenge pornography on the internet is an appalling crime . ` do you agree that the law needs to change to ensure that perpetrators are properly punished and that perhaps the criminal justice and courts bill , currently in the lords , could provide the government an opportunity to do just that ?
