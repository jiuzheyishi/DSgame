{"text": "researchers are rushing to develop a pin-prick test for ebola that could cut life-saving days off the amount of time it takes to confirm cases of the deadly virus . scientists say developing a test for ebola that gives an instant result could be vital is stopping the march of the disease , which has killed more than 4,000 people in west africa so far and is spreading . scientists at tulane university in louisiana are working in conjunction with the viral haemorragic fever consortium in sierra leone on a simple pin-prick test to provide an instant ebola diagnosis . scroll down for video . nurses at ebola treatment centres like this one in monrovia , liberia , could use a rapid diagnostic test that identifies the killer disease in minutes rather than days . airports around the world are introducing thermometer tests to determine whether passengers have symptoms of ebola , such as fever . but the temperature tests do not determine whether a passenger is carrying the deadly disease . dr robert garry , professor of microbiology at tulane , said early diagnosis of the disease is vital when it comes to preventing its spread . under current protocols it can take three days for a blood sample to be tested in a lab which can increase the risk of a patient transmitting ebola to other people . in addition to reducing the wait time for results , the system under development uses a simple pin-prick device that dramatically reduces the chance of healthcare workers suffering needle-stick injuries associated with traditional long syringes . ` everyone has their shoulder to the wheel to get this done , ' dr garry told nola.com . he said his team has been working around the clock to increase the accuracy of the test which is designed to identify the specific proteins associated with the disease . the research is being backed by $ 2.9 million grant . the new system is undergoing a series of tests to determine its accuracy . once his team is convinced the test works , dr garry said it was hoped the us food and drug administration will fast-track authorisation so the test can be deployed at airports and in the field . a rapid system of identifying ebola could help stop the spread of the deadly virus . researchers hope the fda will fast-track their diagnosis test so it can be deployed as quickly as possible . dr garry said he has lost six of his colleagues battling the disease and wants the new test ready as quickly as possible . he said ebola 's arrival in the united states will create a greater urgency for action . liberian man thomas eric duncan in a texas hospital on october 8 after bringing the virus to the united states from africa . nina pham , a nurse who treated duncan , has been confirmed as the second ebola infection in the united states . dr garry said : ' i think it 's pretty clear to people here that we ca n't allow that situation to spiral and spiral and spiral out of control . we 're one people -- we ca n't say it 's happening in one part of the planet and not here . ' the world health organisation says 4,033 confirmed , probable or suspected ebola deaths have now been recorded .", "summary": " researchers have received a $ 2.9 million grant to develop a rapid ebola test .   the pin-prick field test will diagnose the killer disease in a matter of minutes .   scientists claim an early diagnosis will help medics counter ebola 's spread .
