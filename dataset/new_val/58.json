{"text": "dangerous : bright starts ` start your senses ' zebra toy has been withdrawn from sale . thousands of baby toys are being recalled from uk stores and homes because they include a colour dye that is considered a cancer risk . the ` start your senses zebra ' is sold as an educational toy on the basis that it ` helps develop baby 's senses of sight , hearing , and touch ' . it has been available from leading retailers including tesco , asda , mothercare and amazon , which have all issued a product recall and advised parents to return or destroy it . the product includes a teether , mirror , rattle , crinkle paper and ribbons , while the highly coloured toy is designed to be attached to buggies and cots . however , it has emerged that the award winning product sold under the bright starts brand contains a colour including the chemical 4-aminoazobenzine , also known as aniline yellow . it is a yellow dye used in computer printers , insecticides , paint and varnishes , however it is toxic and a cancer risk with the result it is prohibited from products that might be chewed by babies . in 1981 , a criminal gang in spain sold huge quantities of olive oil containing the chemical in a catastrophic food fraud that left 20,000 sick and 400 dead . a warning poster in asda and other supermarkets advises parents to ` stop using this product immediately ' . it adds : ` if you have a bright starts ` start your senses zebra ' with the code ` q ' followed by a four digit number , please stop using it and destroy immediately . ' a scientist at leeds-based company green chemicals , which develops products using safer chemicals , was not surprised the product was recalled . technical director , dr jamie hawkes , said : ` overall , as the international agency for research on cancer has classified this as a group 2 carcinogen - it suggests that it is possible to be carcinogenic to humans via ingestion or contact with skin . ` in the case of this toy , the dye will probably be pretty well fixed into the fibres . therefore any exposure to unfixed dyestuff and hence a carcinogen would be small -- although any exposure is a risk that most people would not want to take . ' at risk : babies could have been infected with the yellow dye , which killed 400 in spain in 1981 . supermarkets including asda warned parents : ` please stop using it and destroy it immediately ' the website recalluk issues alerts and information on products that have been recalled because they may be dangerous . it warned that it will be difficult to get all the toys back . spokesman , barry mulcahy , said : ` the purpose of a product recall is to remove known safety issues from products that have been sold to consumers . ` many recalls have a success rate of only 10-20per cent , meaning that 80-90per cent of products , with known safety issues , remain in consumers ' homes years after the recalls were launched . ` the consequences of these failures are many more fires , injuries and deaths than would be the case if the recalls had been successful . ` the biggest challenge facing most recalls is that manufacturers often do not know who owns their products . this is a serious issue as the most effective communication tactic used by manufacturers is to write to the owners of affected products . ' the firm behind the brand and toy is kids ii , an american company which describes itself as the world 's fastest growing baby product companies with global sales of 22.8 milllion products . parents were advised to contact the uk office of the company , kids ii uk ltd , which is based in luton , bedfordshire , for a refund .", "summary": " it features a toxic yellow dye which killed 400 people in spain in 1981 .   asda warned parent customers to ` stop using it and destroy it immediately ' "}
