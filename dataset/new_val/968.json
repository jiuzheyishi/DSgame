' the explosion of 3d printing and the continued expansion of the games market means that there is an increasing demand for 3d scanning products that capture high resolution 3d data , according to stuart mead , the head of fuel3d inc . experts say the scanner could kickstart the popularity of home 3d printers . ` right now , a large obstacle to 3d printing adoption is the difficulty in producing the digital 3d models required , ' said roger chang , ceo , pirate 3d , a 3d printing firm . when you take a picture on a conventional 3d mobile phone or digital camera you are using a technique known as stereoscopic imaging.this uses two camera viewpoints , one for each eye , to display a ` 3d ' image on a stereoscopic screen that gives the impression of depth.in contrast , the core technology behind fuel3d fuses geometric and photometric stereo 3d capture - producing both the shape and exact colour.this raw capability provides the opportunity for an object to be captured in true 3d geometry and full color for any other non-medical applications . ` a high quality affordable scanner will really change the 3d printing game and fuel3d 's 3d scanner looks set to put 3d modelling capability into everyone 's hands . ' the technology behind fuel3d was originally developed within oxford university and was , at first , developed for medical imaging applications . ` with fuel3d , we plan to adapt a technology that has already been proven in the medical sector to deliver a new 3d scanning option to professionals and consumers with a passion for 3d creativity , ' said james paterson , who developed the scanner . ` the unique technology that we have developed allows us to offer what is literally a point-and-shoot approach to capturing both 3d data and colour , and we are confident that no one else in the world is able to offer this kind of solution at the price that we can achieve . ' the above sequence shows a selection of prototypes and concepts that have led to the fuel3d scanner . experts say the scanner could kickstart the popularity of home 3d printers .", "summary": " fuel3d scanner captures anything from a flower 's petals to contours on skin .   the # 650 scanner can .   create 3d replicas of the product using a 3d printer .
