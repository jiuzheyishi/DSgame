{"text": "researchers have claimed earth is 60 million years older than previously thought . our planet was believed to have formed approximately 100 million years after the solar system started to take shape 4.6 billion years ago , but scientists now say it was actually closer to just 40 million years . they came to the conclusion by analysing ancient gases in quartz , which showed astronomers had underestimated the timing of the impact that formed the moon - and in turn the age of earth . scientists know earth was born from a disk of dust and gas about 4.6 billion years ago -lrb- artist 's illustration shown -rrb- , but the exact timing of this is unknown . new research suggests it may have occurred just 40 million years after the solar system formed , 60 million years older than initially thought . the research was presented by geochemists from the university of lorraine in nancy , france to the goldschmidt geochemistry conference in sacramento , california . many researchers believe the moon formed after earth was hit by a planet the size of mars billions of years ago . this is called the giant impact hypothesis . the hypothesis claims the moon is . debris left over following an indirect collision between our planet and . an astronomical body approximately 4.5 billion years ago . the . colliding body is sometimes called theia , after the mythical greek . titan who was the mother of selene , the goddess of the moon . they discovered an isotopic signal that indicates previous age estimates for both the earth and the moon need to be revised . calculating exact dates that far back , however , is no mean feat . looking back into ` deep time ' it becomes more difficult to put a date on early earth events . in part , this is because there is little ` classical geology ' dating from the time of the formation of the earth , such as an absence of rock layers from that era . so geochemists rely on other methods to estimate early earth events . one of the standard techniques is measuring the changes in the proportions of different gases -lrb- isotopes -rrb- which survive from the early earth - but even this only gives an estimate . ` it 's not possible to give an exact date for the formation of the earth , ' said dr guillaume avice of the university of lorraine . ` the oldest rocks of the solar system have been dated to 4,568 million years ago - so earth is younger than that . ` what this work does is show earth is older than we thought - by around 60 million years . ' the new findings were made by studying xenon gas that had been trapped in quartz crystals -lrb- stock image shown -rrb- in south africa and australia . the findings showed that the giant imapct that is thought to have created the moon must have happened about 60 million years earlier , meaning earth is also similarly older . the study resets the clock for the . collision between earth 's ancestor and a planet-sized object that led to . the formation of the moon . the scientists analysed xenon gas found in quartz from south africa and australia which had been dated to 3.4 and 2.7 billion years respectively . the gas sealed in this mineral is preserved like a time capsule - allowing comparisons of the current isotopic ratios of xenon with those that existed billions of years ago . recalibrating dating techniques using the ancient gas allowed them to refine the estimate of when earth began to form . this allowed them to calculate the moon-forming impact is around 60 million years older than had been thought - give or take 20 million years . earth and the moon are pictured here by the galileo spacecraft on 16 december 1992 . after the planet was struck by a mars-sized object , debris surrounded earth and eventually became the moon , which is tidally locked to our planet , meaning the same face always points our way . ` the composition of the gases we are looking at changes according to the conditions they are found in - which of course depend on the major events in earth 's history , ' continued dr avice . ` the gas sealed in these quartz samples has been handed down to us in a sort of time capsule . ` we are using standard methods to compute the age of earth but having access to these ancient samples gives us new data and allows us to refine the measurement . ` the xenon gas signals allow us to calculate when the atmosphere was being formed , which was probably at the time earth collided with a planet-sized body leading to the formation of the moon . ` our results mean that both earth and the moon are older than we had thought . ' previously the time of formation of the earth 's atmosphere had been estimated at around 100 million years after the solar system formation . as the atmosphere would not have survived the moon-forming impact this revision puts the age up to 40 million years after the solar sytem formation - so around 60 million years older than previously thought . co-researcher dr bernard marty said : ` this might seem a small difference - but it 's important . ` these differences set time boundaries on how the planets evolved - especially through the major collisions in deep time which shaped the solar system . '", "summary": " researchers in france have revealed what they claim to be earth 's new age .   findings are based on analysis of ancient gas in south africa and australia .   study suggests the giant impact that formed the moon happened earlier than first thought .   it had been thought earth formed 100 million years after the solar system .   but now it is believed our planet formed just 40 million years after .
