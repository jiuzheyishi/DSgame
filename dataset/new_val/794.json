{"text": "a 22-year-old dutch woman 's ear turned black after she was bitten by a mediterranean recluse spider in italy . a dutch woman 's ear turned black after she was bitten by a poisonous spider in italy . part of the 22-year-old 's ear was liquefied by the mediterranean recluse spider 's venom and the skin and cartilage died . the woman 's experience is thought to be the first evidence that recluse spider venom can destroy cartilage . the patient 's health problems began when she woke up with a painful ear one morning , livescience reports . her ear swelled up so , unaware she had been bitten by a spider , she visited a local hospital where she was given antihistamine . despite this treatment , the swelling and pain failed to subside . by the time she returned to the netherlands , part of her ear had turned back indicating the cells had died . the woman sought medical help and doctors realised she had been bitten by a mediterranean recluse spider as the creature 's venom is known to kill skin . however , dr marieke van wijk , a plastic surgeon involved in the patient 's care , explained this was the first time doctors had seen the spiders ' venom destroy cartilage as well as skin . the spiders ' venom kills cells using a complex mixture of chemicals which break down proteins and there is no drug treatment that is known to be effective . as a result , dr van wijk and her colleagues were forced to remove the dead tissue from the woman 's ear and then rebuild it using cartilage from her ribs . the mediterranean recluse spider originated in the mediterranean region of north africa and europe but it is now widely distributed . it has poisonous venom but is thought only to bite when forced into contact with people - for example , if trapped in clothes or bedding . in rare cases , the spiders ' bites can be fatal as they can cause kidney failure . the spider 's venom liquefied part of the woman 's ear and caused some of the skin and cartilage to die . the dead tissue had to be cut away -lrb- left -rrb- and then the ear had to be rebuilt using cartilage from her ribs -lrb- right -rrb- . normally , bites cause a red patch to develop on the skin which leaves a slow-healing , open wound and exposed muscle . it can take up to two months for the wound to heal and it often leaves a sunken scar . dr van wijk told livescience that the spiders are ` not that dangerous ' and that she ` would n't take precautions ' to avoid a bite . the case was reported in the journal of plastic , reconstructive and aesthetic surgery .", "summary": " the dutch woman , 22 , was bitten by a mediterranean recluse spider in italy .   part of her ear was liquefied by the venom and the skin and cartilage died .   this is the first evidence the spiders ' venom can destroy cartilage .   the dead tissue had to be cut away before her ear could be rebuilt .
