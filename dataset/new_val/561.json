{"text": "it was after jos buttler 's incendiary 121 off 74 balls in the lord 's one-day international against sri lanka in may that alastair cook announced his limited-overs wicketkeeper was ` not ready ' for test cricket . self-effacingly , buttler agreed . but after more mishaps with the gloves yesterday from matt prior , attitudes might have changed . the 32-year-old prior is a warhorse of 78 tests , well-liked by colleagues and with a proud record as a counter-attacking no 7 . under pressure : doubts have been cast on matt prior 's position as england 's no 1 wicketkeeper after a number of missed catches in the first test with india at trent bridge . beaten : a shot from india 's cheteshwar pujara finds its way past the dive of prior on day four of the first test at trent bridge . the competition : there have been calls for jos buttler -lrb- left -rrb- , england 's short form wicketkeeper , to replace prior in the team . after being dropped for the last two tests of the australian debacle , he was recalled against sri lanka at lord 's and responded with a punchy 86 . named england 's cricketer of the year in may 2013 , prior had apparently refound his zest . since then , though , things have threatened to unravel . it 's hard to be over-critical of his batting : he alone held on during england 's first-innings collapse against sri lanka at headingley , and on friday here in nottingham he fell victim to a dismal piece of umpiring from kumar dharmasena . but his glovework is another matter . the alarm bells began to ring at headingley , where prior dropped kumar sangakkara on 27 shortly after lunch on a chaotic first day . the catch was so straightforward that liam plunkett was halfway through a celebratory leap when prior allowed the ball , which he did n't realise had been pinned to his chest by his gloves , to plop to earth . disappointed : prior could only make five runs in england 's innings , which was rescued by an unlikely last wicket stand between joe root and james anderson . appealed : india wicketkeeper mahendra singh dhoni successfully pleads the wicket of prior off the bowling of bhuvneshwar kumar . heroic : james anderson set a world record on saturday as he and joe root formed a final wicket partnership of 198 to rescue england on the fourth day of the first test with india at trent bridge in nottingham . if there was a touch of misfortune about that , then his wicketkeeping in this test has done little to quell fears the achilles trouble which limited him to one early-season championship match for sussex is not evidence of irreversible wear and tear . even ahead of this game , buttler was called up as cover because prior was experiencing tightness in his right thigh . prior allayed fears with a smart catch to his left to see off india opener shikhar dhawan on wednesday morning , but has since missed three chances low to his right : ms dhoni was dropped on 50 on the second morning , and on saturday afternoon he twice failed to lay a glove on chances offered by murali vijay . whether buttler would have snaffled them may no longer be the point . he is 23 , full of drive and invention , and is averaging 40 for struggling lancashire . he is just the sort of cricketer , in other words , who might fit neatly into the template of a brave new era .", "summary": " prior 's glovework is becoming a cause for concern , with several missed chances against india .   his batting remains beyond reproach , though he only made five in england 's innings at trent bridge .   jos buttler , england one-day wicketkeeper , is waiting for his test chance .
