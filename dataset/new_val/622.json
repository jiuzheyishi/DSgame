' david cameron replaced a succession of older male ministers with up-and-coming tory women in an attempt to make his top team more representative of the population . although former tv host miss mcvey was arguably the star turn in downing street , one of the biggest winners was liz truss , who entered the cabinet as environment secretary at the age of 38 , making her the youngest female cabinet minister of all time . the ice-cool mother-of-two , increasingly tipped as a potential future tory leader , replaced owen paterson , who clashed angrily with the prime minister as he was sacked after criticism of his handling of the horsemeat scandal , a cull of badgers and the winter floods . the other major promotion was handed to nicky morgan , promoted from no 3 at the treasury to replace michael gove as education secretary . the prime minister declared his new team ` reflected modern britain ' , but faced a backlash from some of the tory old guard who accused him of culling middle-aged male ministers regardless of their merits . former tv host miss mcvey was hailed the star turn in downing street yesterday after her glamorous turn before photographers . liz truss : the new environment secretary is very patriotic in a red , white and blue ensemble consisting of a snake-skin navy dress and red jacket oddly finished with black patent shoes . miss truss , 38 , mp for south west norfolk and the former junior education and children minister , looked bright and sensible but a little bit too eighties air hostess . penny mordaunt : the minister for planning and coastal communities was alone in braving the no-jacket look - after all she was brave enough to appear on tv in a swimsuit on splash ! this rather tight , bright , purple dress - the # 115 ` viola ' by lk bennett - makes the most of 41-year-old miss mordaunt 's figure . but who knows what 's with the mp for portsmouth north 's wrinkly nude shoes and big bag ? the new leader of the house of lords is to have her salary topped up by the tory party after it emerged she was to be paid less than her male predecessor , lord hill . tina stowell was announced as the new lords leader , but there was embarrassment as downing street confirmed that she would be paid # 78,891 a year , compared to # 101,038 for lord hill . after labour criticism , tory sources said it had been decided to boost lady stowell 's salary using party funds . there was particular anger that not one existing woman minister was axed in mr cameron 's biggest clear-out since becoming party leader . mps had expected helen grant , the sports minister , who has made a series of gaffes , to be dismissed , and there were question marks over the future of foreign office minister baroness warsi after she poked fun at the prime minister 's eton schooling . ` what do you have to do as a woman to get sacked by cameron ? ' asked one ousted minister . ` no matter how hopeless or how provocative you are , you wo n't get sacked because he has to meet his quotas . ' another senior tory complained : ` this really is the worst form of tokenistic gesture politics . merit is out of the window . ' the number of tory women attending . cabinet rose to eight out of 27 , just short of mr cameron 's target of a . third of his ministers being women . the new women join home secretary theresa . may , international development secretary justine greening and northern . ireland secretary theresa villiers . nicky morgan : morgan , 41 , mp for loughborough , and now education secretary as well as minister for women and equalities , chose a wintry , belted black dress , low nude pumps and a brown jacket with three-quarter-length sleeves that looks like half of another suit . at least she looks as if she 's going to the office . priti patel : treasury minister priti patel , 42 , must be the first person in that post to wear giant polka dots - her dress , from high street favourite wallis , costs # 45 - though that navy jacket looks like ken clarke was its last owner and those sensible shoes could have been worn by baroness thatcher . the mp for witham 's bag is the more fashion-forward # 595 ` hepburn ' by aspinal of london . the new leader of the lords , baroness stowell , and miss mcvey have been promoted to join baroness warsi in also attending meetings without being full cabinet ministers . in an indication of mr cameron 's keenness to highlight the influx of tory women , a succession of female mps was photographed outside no 10 , though some were taking up more junior roles than men whose promotions were announced on twitter . there were new ministerial jobs for anna . soubry , priti patel , claire perry , amber rudd and penny mordaunt , who . famously took part in itv 's celebrity diving programme splash ! therese . coffey was made a government whip . amber rudd : the new energy department minister looks both contemporary and work-appropriate in her straight-to-work navy suit , white top and bold necklace - although the trousers are a little tight . the 50-year-old mp for hastings and rye , a former whip , chose a # 695 anya hindmarch tote that seems to have the kitchen sink crammed into it . the red nails and i-mean-business glasses in her hand are a nice touch . anna soubry : elevated from under-secretary of state at health to the same role at the mod , soubry , 57 , always has the air of a mrs thatcher tribute , fake posh voice , tough manner and everything - and here she is edging towards the helmet hair and forbidding jackets of the iron lady , modernised by a lower-cut blouse , trousers and a high heeled # 375 loafer by tod 's . the mp for broxtowe 's bag looks big enough to conceal a few missiles . labour 's shadow women and equalities minister gloria de piero said : ` the tories have spent the last few days briefing that this would be the reshuffle which fixed david cameron 's  women problem  but it 's turning into a damp squib . ` it 's clear the tories still wo n't match the 44 per cent of labour 's shadow cabinet under ed miliband . ' veteran cabinet minister ken clarke , who quit the government after four decades at the top of tory politics , expressed support for all-women shortlists as a way to further increase the number of women representing the party . the former tory chancellor said the party . was ` going too slowly ' in its efforts to boost the number of female . candidates , adding : ` i would be in favour of all-women shortlists , which . i did n't used to be . ' claire perry : promoted from assistant whip to junior transport minister , claire perry , 50 , hit the high road in similar wedge shoes to esther mcvey and a smart navy dress , topped off by a ` statement ' necklace and a bold teal jacket that looked about two sizes too big for the mp for devizes . lady stowell : the 47-year-old was the queen 's baroness in waiting and joins the cabinet as leader of the lords and chancellor of the duchy of lancaster , but she 's a bit mother-of-the-bride in this outfit by precis petite . the line is sold in debenhams where the dress is # 129 and the jacket # 159 . cheryl gillan , who was welsh secretary in mr cameron 's first cabinet , said : ` do n't forget the prime minister only has 49 women out of all his troops to pick from . he has a finite pool from which to choose . ` i think he has picked some very good people who have been here for four years and therefore have got some good political experience under their belts . ` i wish all of those women well -- not just the ones that have gone in but also the ones that have been doing very , very good jobs for this government .
