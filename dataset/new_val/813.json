{"text": "sixty per cent of the public believe immigration has damaged britain , a major poll revealed last night . the study , commissioned by former tory treasurer lord ashcroft , reveals widespread concern about the scale of immigration and its impact on jobs and public services . just one person in six -lrb- 17 per cent -rrb- believes that the advantages of immigration have outweighed the disadvantages . ineffective : a government initiative to reduce immigration that was deemed unlikely to work . many of the 20,000 people polled also reported direct experience of losing out to immigrants in the competition for a job or public services such as housing . overall , it was identified as the second most important issue facing britain after the state of the economy . lord ashcroft said the study revealed deep concerns about immigration , coupled with scepticism that any of the political parties would deal with the problem . ` many feel that over the past 15 years immigration has been allowed to happen on a scale we can not cope with , and without public consent being sought or given , ' he said . ` politicians underestimated the size of the challenge , lost control of the situation , refused for too long to acknowledge that any problems might result , and are now struggling but failing to cope . ` most -lsb- of the public -rsb- do not feel there is any strategy for dealing with the number of migrants and their successful integration into british society , or for managing the effects on housing , infrastructure , jobs , the nhs , schools or the benefits system . ' more than three-quarters of people -lrb- 77 per cent -rrb- said they supported a ` drastic ' reduction in immigration , saying it would make it easier for british people to find jobs and reduce the pressure on public services . the controversial vans have been passing through ealing , barking and dagenham , hounslow , redbridge , brent and barnet . pictured - one of the billboards in southall , west london . more than one-third -lrb- 36 per cent -rrb- said that they or a family member had found it harder to get work because of competition from immigrants , and almost a quarter -lrb- 24 per cent -rrb- said they or a family member had lost out to immigrants in the queue for council housing or other public services . women were more hostile to immigration , with just 14 per cent saying immigration had been a good thing , compared to 21 per cent of men . and there were clear differences between supporters of the political parties . some 62 per cent of tory voters thought immigration had damaged britain , compared to 48 per cent of labour voters and 39 per cent of lib dems . ninety-one per cent of ukip voters said immigration was damaging britain . the poll also identified differences in class attitudes towards immigration . david cameron has pledged to cut net migration Â¿ the difference between numbers entering and leaving britain . middle-aged working-class voters were far more concerned about the issue , with 90 per cent saying it was one of the biggest challenges facing the country . by contrast , graduates working in the public sector were likely to be far more positive about immigration , with 80 per cent saying it had benefited britain . but the poll also revealed some more nuanced attitudes towards immigration . some 83 per cent said they or a family member had been treated by nhs staff from overseas , and 49 per cent said immigrants were willing to do jobs that british workers do not want to do , with 38 per cent saying they also worked harder than their british counterparts . the poll also revealed deep public scepticism about the willingness of the government to deal with the problems produced by immigration . a controversial home office poster campaign warning illegal immigrants to ` go home or face arrest ' was supported by 79 per cent of people , but only 17 per cent think it will work while just 37 per cent of people think illegal immigrants already in the country are ever likely to face deportation . david cameron has pledged to cut net migration -- the difference between numbers entering and leaving britain -- to under 100,000 from non-eu countries by the time of the next general election in 2015 . but , alarmingly for the prime minister , the study shows most people are not aware of government initiatives to bring about this reduction . the poll found that 76 per cent of people supported an annual cap on non-eu immigration but only 34 per cent knew it had taken place . there was also widespread support for other initiatives , such as cracking down on bogus colleges that grant places to immigrants pretending to be students , toughening requirements for immigrants to speak english and making it harder for people to bring in spouses from outside europe , but in each case a majority of people was unaware that action had already been taken .", "summary": " the study was commissioned by former tory treasurer lord ashcroft .   just one in six believe advantages of immigration outweigh the disadvantages .
