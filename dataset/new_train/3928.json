{"text": "britain was left out in the cold . yesterday as eu leaders signed a controversial treaty which critics . say could herald the dawn of a two-tier europe . furious tory mps last night argued . britain would be pushed to the margins of european decision-making and . renewed their calls for a referendum on whether we should now leave the . eu . german chancellor angela merkel . described the new fiscal compact -- a desperate attempt to save the . single currency -- as a ` great leap ' and a ` milestone ' towards stability . and political union . closer than ever : french president nicolas sarkozy , right , and german chancellor angela merkel yesterday . under the treaty , eurozone countries . will scrutinise each other 's budgets and the european court of justice . will be able to fine them if they fail to stick to the rules . but the new treaty 's credibility was . already under threat last night after both spain and the netherlands . admitted they will miss targets for reducing their deficits . britain and the czech republic were . the only two eu countries who refused to sign the agreement during a 15 . minute ceremony in brussels yesterday . bitter pill to swallow : but prime minister david cameron insisted britain 's voice had been heard at the eu . the event was presided over by herman van rompuy , who had earlier been re-appointed unopposed as european president . david cameron vetoed plans to change the eu treaties to enforce greater budgetary discipline during a summit in december . european president herman van rompuy has been handed another two years in power without an election . mr van rompuy , 64 , who had no rivals for the post , received the backing of all eu leaders including david cameron . the belgian politician will remain as european council supremo until 2014 . mr van rompuy was virtually unknown on the world stage when he was appointed as the council 's first president in 2009 . since then , he has presided over the eurozone crisis . the belgian enjoys a # 250,000 salary which is almost double that of mr cameron . he triggered outrage on the eve of his second term this week by claiming national parliaments are now eu institutions . he said : ` decisions by one national parliament -- be it in germany or ireland , in slovakia or portugal -- are watched all over europe . ` maybe not formally speaking , but at least politically speaking , all national parliaments have become , in a way , european institutions . ' the treaty for stability , . co-ordination and governance was drawn up to prevent the 17 eurozone . states running up huge debts like those which sparked the greek , irish . and portuguese bailouts . but tory mp bill cash said : ` we now . have two europes , both built on sand . it is essential that we have a . referendum in this country so that the people can have their say . ` the whole treaty is a vain attempt to sacrifice practicality and democracy on the altar of ideology . ` the new treaty is the triumph of expediency over the law . ' tory mp douglas carswell added : . ` these european leaders have gone ahead with this arrangement despite . britain 's veto and we are powerless to stop it . ` first of all we were promised a . referendum , then we were told there was a veto . the lesson we have . learned from all of this is we can not trust the eu mandarin elite . sixty . million people in this country have been had . ' earlier , mrs merkel hailed the fiscal compact as ` a milestone in the history of the european union ' . she said : ` i think it 's a strong . signal that we have learned from the crisis and understood the signals . and that we are banking on the future of a politically united europe . ' in a speech at the signing ceremony , . herman van rompuy said : ` this stronger self-constraint by each and every . one of you as regards debts and deficits is important in itself . ` it helps prevent a repetition of the . sovereign debt crisis . it will thus also reinforce trust among member . states , which is politically important as well . ' speaking the same language : french president nicolas sarkozy , left , chats with european commission president jose manuel barroso , center , and german chancellor angela merkel . president of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , said it was a strong political statement for the eu . ` in the eyes of the world what is at stake is the very credibility of the euro area and of europe as a whole , ' he said . but the plight of debt-riddled spain and the netherlands cast a shadow over proceedings . spanish pm mariano rajoy said his country 's budget deficit would be 5.8 per cent of gdp this year -- about # 12.5 billion more than the 4.4 per cent agreed with brussels . a minority of two : david cameron and his czech counterpart petr necas , pictured outside downing street , were the only two eu leaders not to sign up to the new fiscal pact designed to impose stronger financial discipline on the eurozone . with the netherlands -- one of the few aaa-rated countries left in the eurozone -- also struggling to hit budget targets , the credibility of the new deal was already under threat . the fiscal compact will now go before national parliaments and , in the case of the irish republic , a referendum . to take effect , the pact must be ratified by 12 eurozone states . demands : prime minister david did eventually get his voice heard . david cameron yesterday claimed a minor victory after he forced eu leaders to accept british plans to cut red tape and boost growth . the prime minister admitted he had been left ` frustrated ' when his calls for deregulating some professional services and helping small businesseses were initially ignored . mr cameron , whose proposals were set out in a letter backed by 11 other countries , revealed he had been forced to ` bang the table ' to get his ` voice heard ' . however nicholas sarkozy claimed the pm only drafted the letter to prevent britain being ` left behind ' . he said : ` what a tribute this is to europe , to send europe such a lovely letter . ` usually if you write a letter signed by other friends , you are either announcing that you are leaving or saying you love someone . ` i take mr cameron 's letter , after his decision not to join this latest treaty , as a sign that he does n't want to get left behind .
