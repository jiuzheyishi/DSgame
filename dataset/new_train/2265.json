{"text": "london seamus heaney , the poet whose deeply felt descriptions of rural life in ireland managed to carry larger echoes of the island 's violent sectarian split , died friday at the age of 74 , his publisher said . heaney died in dublin , ireland , after a short illness , the publishing house faber & faber announced on behalf of his family . one of the most widely read poets of the past hundred years , heaney carried the long lineage of irish authorship into an era of violence that marked ireland for much of the later twentieth century .  we are blessed to call seamus heaney our own and thankful for the gift of him in our national life ,  irish prime minister enda kenny said friday .  he belongs with joyce , yeats , shaw and beckett in the pantheon of our greatest literary exponents .  heaney joined three of those writers -- william butler yeats , george bernard shaw , and samuel beckett -- as a recipient of the nobel literature prize . the 1995 citation noted heaney 's  works of lyrical beauty and ethical depth , which exalt everyday miracles and the living past  as a reason for bestowing the honor on a fourth irishman . born in 1939 on a farm in country londonderry , in northern ireland , heaney 's work , which relied heavily on personal observations , evoked the island 's rural heritage at close range . the eldest of nine children , heaney -- a catholic -- described his father to an interviewer in 1994 as a  creature of the archaic world  who  would have been entirely at home in a gaelic hill-fort .  in  follower ,  from the collection  death of a naturalist ,  heaney recalled being brought up around country farmers , like his father , whom he idealized -- but who later in life came to represent a bygone era : . i wanted to grow up and plough , . to close one eye , stiffen my arm . all i ever did was follow . in his broad shadow round the farm . i was a nuisance , tripping , falling , . yapping always . but today . it is my father who keeps stumbling . behind me , and will not go away . the family spoke english , not irish , and heaney described in interviews living in a home without many books . he attended a boarding school in derry beginning at age 12 and studied for an english literature degree at queen 's university in belfast . derry -- ruled by protestants , despite a majority catholic population -- would eventually become the center of northern ireland 's decades-long period of sectarian violence . heaney moved in 1972 to dublin , where he wrote poems that reflected the struggle navigating between the irish nationalist movement , which he supported , and an allegiance to his birthplace in the british-ruled north . after  death of a naturalist ,  heaney 's reputation began to grow , and he eventually became the rare poet to achieve both critical acclaim and popular appeal . his collections featured a range of themes , from lighthearted love verses to deeply personal meditations on ireland 's troubles . his collection  north  was released in 1975 , one of the bloodiest years of ireland 's sectarian conflict . in it , heaney mined the roots of irish division , often offering a grim assessment of a nation facing constant misfortune .  coherent miseries , a bite and sup , / we hug our little destiny again ,  he wrote in  whatever you say say nothing .  decades after  north  was published , heaney characterized himself as a poet writing from his own experience rather than a political agenda .  what matters is the shape-making impulse , the emergence and convergence of an excitement into a wholeness ,  he said .  i do n't think i 'm a political poet with political themes and a specifically political understanding of the world .  but he nonetheless held a lasting place within the history of ireland 's struggle for peace , offering his deeply personal view of the troubles to a worldwide audience .  his mind , heart , and his uniquely irish gift for language made him our finest poet of the rhythms of ordinary lives and a powerful voice for peace . and he was a good and true friend ,  bill and hillary clinton , the former u.s. president and first lady , wrote in a statement friday . as president , bill clinton helped broker the 1999 good friday agreement that established northern ireland 's system of government . later in life , heaney turned to producing new translations of well-known works of anglo-saxon literature , including a well-received version of  beowulf .  he worked as a professor of poetry at oxford university for five years beginning in 1989 , and held various posts at harvard university for more than two decades . heaney is survived by his wife , marie , and three children . people we 've lost in 2013 . cnn 's bharati naik contributed to this
