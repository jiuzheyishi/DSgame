{"text": "in the movie  back to the future ,  the year is 1955 when marty mcfly introduces the song  johnny b. goode  to a high school dance . that was three years before this tune was actually written , but mcfly knows it well because he 's from the future . it would stand to reason that in real life , time travelers from a future era -- or who had at least visited the future -- might give themselves away by mentioning events that have n't yet occurred . they might even do so online . i mean , you 'd obviously take to social media to broadcast your foreknowledge of world events , right ? scientists at michigan technological university wanted to see if they could catch any such slips by residents of the future . so robert nemiroff , professor of physics , and graduate student teresa wilson conducted a whimsical study in hopes of identifying accurate predictions of future events . they are presenting their study at the american astronomical society meeting on monday . the online platform that allowed them to look most comprehensively for prescient posts was twitter , because the social network does n't allow back-dating . facebook users can alter timestamps on posts , and the popular search engines google and bing were not as helpful as twitter in looking for  prescient information ,  the authors found . study authors focused on two major search terms they believe will have lasting significance for years to come : comet ison and pope francis . they looked for mentions of these from january 2006 to september 2013 . before the identification of comet ison in 2012 , there were no mentions that the researchers could find of this icy space rock . similarly , before jorge bergoglio took on his papal name in 2013 , the phrase  pope francis  did not appear in the researchers ' search results , except for one person 's blog , which appears to have been speculating -- not remembering something from the future . it appears that no one posted about his or her neighbor or acquaintance declaring the name pope francis early , either .  it 's not proof , but it 's an indication to me that it 's not possible ,  nemiroff said , referring to time travel . there are , of course , several reasons why this technique might not detect any time travelers . nemiroff and wilson may have missed them by using the wrong search terms . temporal adventurers might avoid posting to social media altogether , or even using the internet , for fear of being found out . or , you know , it might be physically impossible to travel to the past .  it 's the largest database ever searched for that kind of information . it -lrb- evidence of time travel -rrb- might have been there ,  nemiroff said . the idea for the study came about in discussions during poker games with his students , he said . do n't worry , that 's not all they 're doing ; nemiroff studies other more substantial topics such as gamma-ray bursts , and helped create nasa 's astronomy picture of the day website . others have tried in the past to lure time travelers into exposing themselves , nemiroff and wilson note in their paper . a convention for time travelers was held in may 2005 by then-graduate student amal dorai at mit , but no one living among us from the future showed up , although the event attracted 450 guests , according to nature . renowned physicist stephen hawking , similarly , said in a july 2012 interview that he had thrown a party for time travelers , sending out invitations after the party occurred . sadly , no one came . similarly , no one answered the study authors ' calls to tweet on or before august 2013 using the hashtags #icanchangethepast2 or #icannotchangethepast2 , indicating whether the time travelers believed they could alter history . sean carroll , a physicist at california institute of technology who was not involved in the study , said physicists who have studied the question of time travel into the past -- taking into account einstein 's theory of general relativity -- have concluded that we can imagine time travel , but it 's probably not possible in real life .  we do n't have an airtight proof , but at the very least it would involve manipulating astrophysically significant amounts of matter and energy in unheard-of ways ,  he said in an e-mail .  and even if you built a ` time machine , ' it would let travelers from the future go back to the moment you built it , but you would n't ever be able to visit any moments before you built it . since we do n't think anyone has built one already , i think we 're safe from time travelers for the time being .  still , carroll said , nemiroff 's paper represents a fun , clever idea .  to be clear , there was essentially zero reason to believe that they were going to find any evidence for time travelers , but since it did n't exactly cost a lot of money to perform the study i 'm all in favor of it ,  carroll said . so , if you are from the future and reading this , you secret is probably still safe -- for now .", "summary": " new study uses twitter to look for predictions of the future .   research found no prescient mentions of comet ison or pope francis .   physicists say time travel is probably not possible .
