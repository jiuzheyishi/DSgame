{"text": "the pentagon is considering under what circumstances it will recommend president barack obama authorize the use of a missile-equipped drone to kill the leader of islamic state in iraq and syria , abu bakr al-baghdadi , cnn has learned . any such mission to kill al-baghdadi would have to be approved by obama , according to several defense officials cnn has spoken to at length . all of the officials have direct knowledge of the intelligence gathering efforts in iraq , but declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the information .  he is a person of great interest to us ,  one defense official told cnn . if the u.s. military were to recommend a drone strike against al-baghdadi , there would have to be specific and detailed intelligence showing his location at the moment of a strike and intelligence to assure that civilians would not be at risk . in order to launch a kill mission , the u.s. has to demonstrate the target poses a threat to the u.s. al-baghdadi 's isis organization does threaten the u.s. embassy and u.s. citizens in iraq , according to u.s. officials . it is also possible the u.s. could turn the information over to the iraq government for it to conduct a capture or kill mission against the isis leader on its own . another point of consideration would be the impact of a u.s. strike on the situation in iraq and whether the u.s. would be seen by sunnis as siding with the shiite-led government . al-baghdadi already has a $ 10 million bounty on his head from the u.s. government 's reward for justice program , which offers multi-million dollar rewards for information leading to the capture of certain high value terrorists around the world . last week , al-baghdadi made a very public appearance at a prominent mosque in northern iraq . eyewitnesses said he drove up to the mosque in a large convoy and remained surrounded by civilians . but u.s. officials said capturing al-baghdadi would be difficult because the u.s. military does not have combat troops on the ground in either iraq or syria , where al-baghdadi and isis are known to operate . in addition , any covert capture mission by u.s. special forces or law enforcement inside iraq could be seen as violating iraq 's sovereignty , though such a mission remains possible . that means al-baghdadi is essentially on a u.s.  kill list  even though such a list in syria and iraq has never been openly acknowledged . under u.s. policy , lethal drone attacks are generally authorized when there is no reasonable possibility of capturing a suspect . the possibility comes as part of the u.s. military effort to gather intelligence on so-called  high value targets  in iraq and continues to collect intelligence for targeting airstrikes in iraq . the targets fall into three categories , the officials said . they include information for striking  high value targets  like al-baghdadi ; protection of key infrastructure such as the haditha dam ; and blunting major isis offensives against baghdad . airstrikes by either drones or manned aircraft would have to be approved by the president . there are also electronic intercepts being conducted , according to one u.s. official . in recent days the u.s. military has again increased its reconnaissance missions over iraq from the 30 missions a day it was conducting .  it 's up around 50 right now . and it 's stayed there for a good many days ,  according to rear adm. john kirby , pentagon press secretary . who is the isis ? u.s. official : ` no reason to doubt ' video 's authenticity of al-baghdadi .", "summary": " pentagon considering when to recommend authorizing drone strike agains isis leader .   any mission to kill isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi would need obama 's approval .   al-baghdadi has $ 10 million bounty on his head through reward for justice program .
