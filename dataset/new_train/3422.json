' mr wiper said he had to watch his step as he made his way up the hillside . he said : ` it felt pretty dangerous . every time i stepped on a new rung of the ladder in the tunnel i could picture it breaking .

' mr wiper spent two hours inside the labyrinth taking detailed photos of mr pujiula 's work although sadly did not meet the man himself . mr wiper said : ' i did n't see him but apparently he is there most of the time continuing to build . it 's not advertised as a tourist attraction , but i 've been told he is happy for people to come and visit . ' two bizarre and rusted sculptures sit at the bottom of a stairwell , and right , one of the labyrinth 's tall wooden towers built next to a cabin . several metal sculptures overlook a pool of rainwater ; mr pujiula defiantly built a new structure alongside a government planned motorway and continues to expand his creation . the interior of one of the various wooden cabins , and right , a colossal wooden tower amidst the catalonia forest . a look inside the supports of a wooden tower , which must have taken an age to construct and reshape and bend the sticks . the structure was originally one and a half kilometers long but was dismantled in 2002 after the spanish government , who had frequently voiced their objection to the labyrinth , demolished it to provide space for a motorway . mr pujiula defiantly built a new structure alongside the motorway and continues to expand his creation while butting heads with the spanish authorities . mr wiper said : ` the motorway runs parallel to the structure so it 's probably not as peaceful as it once was . i 'm not sure why he decided to rebuild but i got the impression it is something he has to do . ' i love his attitude . when someone is obsessed by an idea and they are n't going to let anything get in their way .
