' i do n't want any money . i want my daughter . ' the show depicts todd as the man with everything money can buy and a picture perfect family to boot : his ex-pageant queen wife , julie , his beautiful blonde-haired children lindsie , 25 , chase , 18 , savannah , 16 and grayson , 8 , his adorable grandchild two-year-old chloe and lovable matriarch nanny faye , 70 . a changed man : klye with his new wife lexi and their dog milo . he is adamant that his problems are in the past and angry at his father 's continued depiction of him . kyle blasted chrisley 's ` fairy-tale ' existence as a sham , dismissed the show as a fake and described his father as bankrupt , toxic and a snake who has shut him out of his own child 's life . but in an exclusive interview with mailonline last month , kyle blasted chrisley 's ` fairy-tale ' existence as a sham , dismissed the show as a fake and described his father as bankrupt , toxic and a snake who has shut him out of his own child 's life . he also claimed he had turned his life around , saying : ` my dad showed no interest in chloe at all until the show and until it was pointed out that having a mixed race child and getting her and all that would be good for his demographic . ` he did n't want to see her before then . he said he wanted nothing to do with her . ` this show has been nothing but bad for me . at this point he 's ruined me and he 's ruined the other three kids he 's had who are spoiled . tension : kyle blasted chrisley 's ` fairy-tale ' existence as a sham , dismissed the show as a fake and described his father as bankrupt , toxic and a snake who has shut him out of his own child 's life . ` but i 'm not taking a chance on him ruining my daughter . i 'm not taking a chance on him being part of my daughter 's life and with todd chrisley everything is extreme - it 's all or nothing . so it has to be nothing . ` we 're fighting this through court and i think that in two to three months we should have chloe with us . ' chloe , he said , was the product of a one-night stand with her mother , and the two did not have any sort of longer term relationship . house of horrors : teresa terry , who was married to chrisley and is kyle 's mother says she was a battered wife . at the beginning of last year it was reported that he had attacked angela , threatened her with a knife and attempted to kidnap the child . he vehemently denies the allegations which did not result in any charges being brought . angela is not a presence in her daughter 's life anymore he claims . kyle does not know for sure what arrangement she and chrisley came to when he and kyle fought for custody . according to kyle she got a second hand toyota prius , with 200,000 miles on the clock but he is not clear what she gave up in exchange . he said , ' i was on drugs at the time -lsb- she was conceived -rsb- . i was on meth . at my worst i would do it all day every day . it was my life . ' in an episode showing the family 's father 's day preparations , chrisley 's children posed for a photograph - all but kyle who was not there and was barely mentioned . when he was mentioned , it was by chrisely who explained , ` my eldest son kyle has had some difficulty in his life which is unfortunately as a result of kyle doing drugs . we still struggle with this . we 've been dealing with this since 2009 . ` does it bother me now as much as it did then ? yes it does bother me . how do you deal with that ? ' he added , ` kyle is not interacting with his family on a daily basis so right now chloe has to be with us . ` it 's heart-breaking and it 's compounded now that we have a granddaughter . ' speaking from the neat apartment in chamblee , atlanta , that he shares with lexi , kyle admitted that his past was checkered with drug and drink problems . he has , he said , ` been in and out of rehab probably 20 times in my life . ' but was adamant that his problems were in the past and angry at his father 's continued depiction of him as a user , unfit to be a parent . he said , ' i have been clean now for more than a year . i 've taken tests . every one is clean - urine which is instant and hair follicle which goes back six months . ' but for kyle , his father 's refusal to acknowledge just how far his eldest son has come , is all about control and the complex emotional and legal ties that binds them together and stand between him and custody of chloe . bride : todd 's first wife teresa terry says she knows how dark the reality behind chrisley knows best really is . teresa was 19 and todd was 21 when she became pregnant with daughter lindsie and the couple married . behind the smiles : teresa terry and todd hold daughter lindsie and son kyle . he explained , ` five years ago he took out a legal guardianship on me . and five years ago i do believe that if he would n't have got it i would probably be in the ground by now because i was that bad on drugs . ' i was 130lbs - i 'm 180lbs today - i looked like i was starving . i could have died plenty times . ' but , he continued , ` at that same time i do n't see how any sort of judge could have signed off on the guardianship that he got . ` at 18 it should have been a medical guardianship so if they see me on drugs or relapsing or having mental health issues you can intervene and send me to a treatment facility . ` but no , he got a guardianship and every box you can mark he marked it . ca n't sign a legal document , ca n't contract to get married , ca n't do this , ca n't do that . and so i have monitored custody of chloe but he can do what he likes really . i see her for 30 or 40 minutes with everyone there . interviewed : the full talk with angela johnson can be read in this issue of life & style . ` he puts a curfew on that she has to be back by 6 o'clock . or he just ups and goes to california with her . the picture kyle paints of his father is a very different one from the ultimately caring , if overbearing , patriarch on screen . but it is not a world away from the one shared by his mother , teresa terry , 43 , when she broke her silence of 20 years and spoke to mailonline . she is another figure from chrisley 's life who did n't really fit with in the court of chrisley and was airbrushed out of history when the family was introduced to the public in season one . she is mother to both lindsie and kyle . teresa 's seven-year marriage to chrisley ended in an acrimonious divorce which saw her bring a domestic violence case against chrisley . in court documents his ex-wife accused him of ` waging a campaign of mental and physical abuse ' against her . he was accused of stripping her naked and ` battering her ' with a closed fist . and when she left him she claimed he hired a detective to track her down with her new lover , now husband of many years , and left her ` fearing for her life .
