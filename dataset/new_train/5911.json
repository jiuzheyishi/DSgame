{"text": "afghanistan has suffered more than most as a country after decades of war and civil unrest . with the country now appearing on a more stable footing politically , the same can not be said of its once flourishing silk trade which it was so proud of . cheaper , foreign imports are threatening generations of silkmaking families , as well as there being a decreasing lack of support for silkworm farmers . dying trade ? an afghan handles cocoons at a silk factory in herat competition from cheaper synthetic silk from china and pakistan has put the industry at great risk . proud : an afghan man shows raw silk ready to be woven into fabric - but the question is can it flourish in a day and age of cheaper imports ? tradition : skills which have been passed down through the generations of families in herat are at serious risk of being lost in time . ` in the past , our handicrafts were very valuable , and businesspeople and wealth customers used to go to those who were producing silk handkerchiefs , shawls and turbans , ' said mohammad hussain , speaking to the institute of war and peace reporting , 75 , his body bent after more than half a century as a silk weaver . ` owning silk products was then a sign of nobility , but now the good customers are gone , along with our high wages . ' cheaper , synthetic silk is being bought as an alternative , but as with any material which is cheaper to produce and buy , the quality is also lessened . career path : this young boy may have to re-evaluate whether it is a safe option to work in the silk industry . sad : in herat , once an important stop on the famous silk route , a few famlies are struggling to keep a once-splendid silk industry alive . show of support : an afghan woman buys raw silk to be woven into fabric in a market place in herat - supporting the local industry . a pure , silk scarf might cost around 400 afghanis -lrb- # 5 -rrb- , whereas a synthetic version which could be imported from nearby pakistan or china would only cost 150 afghanis -lrb- # 2 -rrb- . the major products of herat silk weaving industries include shawls , scarves , turbans and other silken fabrics . speaking to the pahjwok afghan news , ghulam sakhi , 75 , who learned the trade from his father when he was 10 said : ` thirty years ago there were 1,000 silk weaving looms in herat city , all of which were using pure silk , but now most of the weavers use synthetic silk . ' i learned weaving from my father when i was 10 and for the past 65 years i have never used synthetic silk . ' he has been weaving ever since and only with natural fibres . the price of natural threads has . doubled , and a once thriving stop on the ` silk road ' now faces its . biggest challenge yet , not only to keep family tradition going , but to . also make a profitable business out of it . one kilogram of pure silk costs more . than 3,000 afghanis while synthetic pakistani silk can be bought for 420 . afghanis per kilogram . however , . if the afghan government stepped in and offered a fairer deal to . support the silkworm farmers and weavers , the industry could compete . with its synthetic opposite . ` silk . weaving is a halal craft and it reveals the native art of herat . province ' , said abas azami , head of silkworm producers and silk weavers , . to the pahjwok . ` the government should not let this art vanish , ' azami said . a long stretch : a map showing the traditional ` silk road ' or ` silk route ; ' however with the growth of free trade , a country 's individual industry is threatened . worrying : the herat region of northern afghanistan has historically been the centre of silk production , textiles , and a burgeoning garment industry .", "summary": " herat , to the west of kabul , was once an important stop on the silk road - but now their once-proud industry faces a serious threat .   cheaper , imported , synthetic fibre could see afghan silkmakers as well as silkworm farmers out of business .   a synthetic scarf will cost half as much as a genuine silk product .   workers call on the government to step in and secure the future of the historic and family-orientated trade .
