{"text": "a new batch of australian anti-drinking videos encouraging young people to hold back on the booze is actually doing more harm than good , experts warn . the drinkwise videos form part of a new anti-booze campaign designed to detract young people from hitting the bottle . the online ads , posted to youtube , feature a man in a suit promoting drinking as a classy social activity only to be enjoyed in moderation . drunks are portrayed as ` dickheads ' and the message that drinking ruins reputations , is an unattractive social norm and inhibits men 's appeal to the opposite sex is a recurring theme throughout . scroll down for video . encouraging : health experts believe the anti-drinking campaign could have a positive affect on alcohol sales , doing more harm than good . appealing to young adults : one advertisement encourages university students to make a judgement call to determine whether taking out a loan is worth the the high price of alcohol . it is implied that sober men are more appealing to mothers , and this is a reason why men should n't get drunk . the mostly minute-long ` classy as f *** ' videos attempt to offer tips on how to be an ` experienced ' drinker rather than an ` amateur . ' one video even implies sober men have a better chance of sleeping with older women . ` there 's a place for mothers , ' the narrator says , before cutting to a scene of two mothers propped up in bed alongside the man in the suave suit . more ... are these the most precocious 11-year-olds in britain ? benefits cheats . gay marriage . absent fathers . the young stars of a new tv show with an opinion on everything . living advertisement : how japan 's sleeping street drunks have been turned into human billboards for alcohol awareness campaign . but the sleek , black and white animated ads may be having the opposite affect of their good intentions . results of a university study show that young people actually felt the urge to drink after viewing one of the ` how to drink properly ' advertisements . the downsides of drinking are not as unappealing as the videos aim to make out . researchers say one in particular is encouraging young people 's drinking habits . the campaign ceo has defended the videos saying they are hitting the mark with their intended audience . professor simone pettigrew , who co-authored a letter published in the medical journal of australia , said : ` what drinkwise is touting as being helpful is just reinforcing their sales . ' what 's worse , she said , is that the videos are online and are likely to be watched by children . the study by prof simone pettigrew and her team at curtin university in perth , western australia showed about two thirds of the 40 people who viewed the ad said the animation format appealed to them , as did the humour and swearing . she said while the video 's message of discouraging people from drinking too much is helpful , it fails to inform people how much ` too much ' actually is . ` the video fails to tell them more than four drinks is binge drinking , ' prof pettigrew said . ` they think 10 beers is ok . ' but drinkwise ceo john scott said the campaign was achieving its aims . ` we are weeks into a three-year campaign , but we are confident we have hit the right mark , ' he said . he said a drinkwise study of more than 750 young people had changed their behaviour after seeing the video . ` it shows the campaign is doing the right things . we are speaking to young people for the first time in a language in which they can start to understand the moderation message . ' in one of the advertisements offering anti-drinking tips , the narrator says people should consider against forking out on a loan to pay for more shots at the bar . there 's a right way : the ads send a message to people that drinking too much ruins reputations . sober men are much more appealing to women .", "summary": " australian anti-drinking videos ` have the opposite affect of their intentions '   videos imply sober men have better odds of sleeping with mothers .   study showed young adults had an urge to drink after watching one ad .   campaign ceo backs ads , says moderation drinking message working .
