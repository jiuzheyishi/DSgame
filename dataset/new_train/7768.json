{"text": "this family of fluffy monkeys may look pretty bad-tempered , but appearances can be deceptive . bez and ksaka the colobus monkeys are actually pictured below celebrating the arrival of their son alan , the second ever of their species to be born at cotswold wildlife park in oxfordshire . young alan , who had white fur when he was born three months ago , is now slowly growing black fur to resemble his parents . when alan the colobus monkey was born at cotswold wildlife park in oxfordshire he had white fur . look at me now : at three months old , baby alan has started to develop the contrasting fur of his parents . and while he will probably end up looking as miserable as they do , for now he looks rather happy with his new look . native to africa , colobus monkeys are actually extremely sociable , despite the colouration of their fur giving them an unhappy look . with the arrival of the new sunnier weather , alan has been enjoying bouncing around his enclosure with his sibling , christopher , and the rest of his family group . park curator jamie craig said : ` the group now has two playful infants to keep an eye on as they make the most of the warm spring weather . ` all adults take a role in babysitting and luckily , kasaka is a very patient dad . ' the newest born was named after employee alan price , who has worked at cotswold wildlife park since 1997 and says colobus monkeys are his favourite species . alan as a new-born colobus monkey clung to his mother , and had white fur which is all now turning black . he is bigger now , but he still enjoys a cuddle from mum in his enclosure at cotswold wildlife park . they live in family groups comprising . one male , several females , and their offspring , and female colobus . monkeys usually announce that they are ready to mate by tongue smacking . with females giving birth to a single offspring approximately every 20 months , ksaka has got his work cut out for him . in the wild , males leave their birth groups before they are fully mature , either by choice or by force , and live alone or in small bachelor groups . some will eventually take over a harem of their own . each group has its own territory in the tree canopy that is well defined and defended . the word ` colobus ' is derived from the greek ` kolobus ' , meaning ` mutilated one ' . it refers to their thumb , which is little more than a short stub . the colobus monkeys are extremely sociable and live in large family groups comprising a male , the females he mates with , and their offspring . you 're never too old for a cuddle : despite being the grand old age of three months , alan like a hug with his mother . the monkeys run on all fours along familiar routes through branches , and take turns sleeping at night so that one member of the troop is always awake and watching for predators . males defend their group and territory from others with roars , tongue-clicks , chases , and an unusual stiff-legged display .", "summary": " colobus monkey alan has shed white fur and is going dark like his parents .   he is the second baby colobus born at cotswold wildlife park in burford .
