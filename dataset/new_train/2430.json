{"text": "the democratic party 's vote thursday for the  nuclear option  was a move to deprive the minority party in the senate of a procedure it has abused to block president barack obama 's judicial nominees and other appointees . before , a single republican could unilaterally and without any reason block a nominee from receiving a simple up-and-down vote on the senate floor . the  nuclear option ,  an overblown term for changing senate rules to enable judicial and executive nominees to be confirmed with just 51 votes instead of 60 , will put an end to using that procedure -- the filibuster -- to block appointees . republicans have been gumming up the works of our government , both because they ideologically favor the dysfunction of government and because they want to fundamentally undermine the president at every step . and so during obama 's five years in office , republicans in the senate have confirmed just one nominee to the court of appeals in washington , often regarded as the nation 's second highest court after the supreme court . meanwhile , republicans have blocked three appointees to the court and held up countless other nominations to other important posts . there had been a concern that if democrats went nuclear , nothing would stop republicans from employing equally restrictive procedures should democrats be the minority party in the senate again . and yet , to anyone watching washington today , is there any question that republicans have abandoned any sense of bipartisan decorum and are solely functioning as anti-government , anti-obama bullies ? if republicans repeatedly resort to such childish thuggery when they 're the minority party , it 's hard to imagine them behaving much better if they 're put in charge . if democrats did n't flip the nuclear switch now to allow appointments to go through , republicans will surely flip it later . at least if democrats do it first , they get to finally vote on some critical nominees and move the governance and sanctity of our nation forward . in a statement , republican senate minority leader mitch mcconnell had said that attacking obamacare is a priority over voting to fill key vacancies in the nation 's courts . sadly , republicans in congress are making a mockery of their constitutional obligations while turning the hallowed halls of our government into nothing more than a playground for their ideological circus . sometimes that circus is so absurd it hurts . for instance , republicans have repeatedly tried to blame the financial crisis on fannie mae and freddie mac rather than -- for instance -- the deliberate scamming of big banks that are now paying massive settlements for their wrongdoing . and yet that topsy-turvy reasoning aside , republicans are blocking the nomination of rep. mel watt to lead the federal housing finance authority , deliberately maintaining a vacancy in the position charged with regulating and monitoring fannie and freddie . the constitution lays out the senate 's responsibility in this regard as clearly secondary to , not equal with , the president 's authority : .  -lsb- the president -rsb- shall have power , by and with the advice and consent of the senate , to make treaties , provided two thirds of the senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the supreme court , and all other officers of the united states , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law .  advice and consent . not block and redirect and hold up and try to impose the will of the senate 's minority party on the nominations and actions of the president . and so democrats have finally had enough with a republican party that seems determined to pitch a temper tantrum about everything obama does , no matter that he won two elections and his policies are widely popular with voters . after all , even though the president 's approval ratings took a hit , his numbers at 39 % are still  sky high  compared with those of congress , which has a 9 % approval rating according to a recent gallup poll . that 's the lowest approval rating since gallup has collected such data . moreover , while such low numbers overall likely reflect voter frustration with the partisan squabble of unproductive government , polls show that voters consistently blame republicans far more than democrats for this dynamic , whether for causing the government shutdown or deliberately sabotaging economic progress to hurt the president 's image .  nuclear option  is a loaded term . proponents of the measure call it the  constitutional option  in so far as it is constitutional and it would finally hold senate republicans ' feet to the fire to perform their constitutional duty . that indeed seems a more accurate description and one that reminds us all that it was republicans ' own reckless and destructive behavior that brought us to this point in the first place . the opinions in this commentary are solely those of sally kohn .", "summary": " with  nuclear option ,  judicial nominees can be confirmed with a simple majority vote .   sally kohn : this will keep gop from using a procedure to block president 's appointments .   kohn : gop made government virtually dysfunctional , blocked obama at every turn .   this will hold republicans ' feet to the fire to do their constitutional duty , she says .
