' he added : ` for all his tough talk the reality is he is dodging his responsibility on banking reform . ` lending is falling , bonuses are rising and while ordinary families are suffering he is giving a tax cut to millionaires . ' average weekly bonuses payments in finance and business services were # 143 in april , up 64.4 per cent on the same time in 2012 and the highest level in records dating back to 2000 . labour leader ed miliband claimed ordinary families were suffering while tax was being cut for high earners . mr cameron took aim at labour 's record in power , blaming them for a failure to regulate . the . prime minister said : ` bankers bonuses were about a third of what they . were when he was in the treasury . they have been going down not up .

' i believe he will bring huge talent to a vital national effort . ' the row came as a major report . recommended that bosses of failed banks should face jail or lose the . right to claim bonuses for up to ten years for ` reckless misconduct ' . the . new criminal offence would make sure that top executives paid for their . ` shocking and widespread malpractice ' , the parliamentary commission on . banking standards said . not a . single british banker has been sent to prison since the financial crash . began in 2007 , but the proposed legislation would make sure they would . be ` on the hook ' in future , it added . as well as prison terms , errant . bankers would face heavy fines and bans from the financial services . industry , as well as curbs on bonuses and the threat of pensions being . cancelled . in the commons , mr cameron was pressed on whether he supported the recommendations on bonuses and criminal penalties . ` yes , i do support both of those measures ,  he said . ` obviously we need to take time to read this excellent report . ` but penalising , including criminal penalties against bankers who behave irresponsibly , i say yes . also , making sure that banks who are in receipt of taxpayers ' money that you can claw back ... bonuses , i say yes too .
