{"text": "a group of neurons at the base of the mid brain -- can change behaviour through activation of the brain 's reward system . ` previous studies had correlated increased activity in the primate vta with positive events experienced by the animal but could not prove that vta activity actually caused behavioural changes , ' said wim vanduffel of mgh , who co-authored the paper published in the journal current biology . ` studies in rodents have shown that artificially manipulating vta activity strongly influences behaviour and our work has bridged the gap between rodent and primate , ' he said . to investigate the direct impact of vta activation on primate behaviour , microelectrodes were implanted within the vtas of macaque monkeys . the research could one day revolutionise the way that human addicts are treated by enabling them to unlearn addiction , such as alcoholism -lrb- illustrated by a stock image -rrb- - although there is of course the sinister possibility of using mind control in humans too . scientists have shown that free will can be turned on and off in monkeys by using electrical stimulations . they artificially stimulated the monkeys ' ventral tegmental area -lrb- vta -rrb- -- a group of neurons at the base of the mid brain -- to change behaviour through activation of the brain 's reward system . in an experiment , animals freely chose to look at one of two pictures and by stimulating their vta , the scientists were able to force them to choose to look at one of them in particular . mri scans showed that stimulating the vta produced similar brain activity to when the animal received a reward of fruit juice . the scientists think that the research could one day be used to treat addictive behaviour in humans . in the first set of experiments , the animals were presented with a pair of images -- for example a star and a ball -- and could freely chose to look at one image or the other . their choice was measured by looking at their eye movement . after establishing each macaque monkey 's preference , based upon which image it looked at most frequently , mild stimulation was applied to the vta when the animal happened to look at the initially non-preferred image . soon the animal 's preference changed and it most frequently looked at what previously had been the less favoured image . when the vta stimulation was then applied to the initially preferred image , the monkeys soon changed their preference back to the original choice . in a second set of experiments , a monkey watched a 20-minute video , during which two images were randomly presented every 5 seconds . mind control : in the experiment , artificially stimulating a brain region believed to play a key role in learning , reward and motivation caused monkeys -lrb- stock image -rrb- to change which of two images they chose to look at - essentially , making decisions for them and controlling their mind . whenever an initially non-preferred image was presented , it was accompanied by mild vta stimulation . repetition of the preference test demonstrated that the animal 's choice was reversed . mri scans also revealed that stimulating the vta produced similar brain activity to when the animal received a reward of fruit juice . dr vanduffel explained : ` our study showed that the timing of vta stimulation is important -- when stimulation happens immediately after an action is performed , the monkey is more likely to perform that action -- and that it applies ` value ' to a particular stimulus and motivates future behaviour . ' ` other studies have implicated the vta in learning based on negative , as well as positive reinforcement , and a recent rodent study found that increasing vta activation can relieve depression , possibly by increasing motivated behaviour . ' while stimulation currently requires surgery to implant electrodes in the brain , non-invasive methods could be used to treat humans in the future , he told the times . ` once non-invasive methods -- light or ultrasound , for example -- can be applied with a sufficiently high level of precision , they could potentially be used for correcting defects in the reward system , such as addiction and learning difficulties . '", "summary": " scientists at massachusetts general hospital and the university of leuven , belgium , have shown free will can be turned on and off in macaque monkeys .   electrodes were used to stimulate the region of the animals ' brains that play a key role in learning , reward and motivation .   technique was used to force monkeys to choose certain images .   breakthrough could be used to help humans unlearn addictions .
