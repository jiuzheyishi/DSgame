{"text": "editor 's note : jeffrey a. miron is senior lecturer in economics at harvard university . jeffrey miron says the government ca n't assure affordable , high-quality care for all americans . cambridge , massachusetts government spending on health care is growing at an alarming rate . if recent trends continue , the two main government programs , medicaid and medicare , will increase from 6 percent of the nation 's gross domestic product now to about 15 percent by 2040 . this means that , without policy changes , the united states faces enormous budget deficits , substantially higher taxes , or huge cuts in non-health spending . no one wants higher deficits or taxes , and there is no consensus about cutting other spending . the only way to avoid some combination of these outcomes , however , is to reduce the growth rate of what we spend on health . the question , of course , is how ? in a report this month , the obama administration outlines its preferred approach . in a nutshell , the administration 's plan is to make health care delivery more efficient . indeed , the report suggests that improved efficiency can not only slow the growth of health expenditure but also fund government health insurance for the 46 million uninsured americans . increased efficiency in health care is indeed possible , but assuring  high quality , affordable care for every american ,  as the administration seeks to do , is not . here 's why . most health care is paid for by insurance . when people are insured they do not pay the full costs of the medical care they receive , so they demand the best and pay little attention to the expense . patients opt for surgery rather than medication or wait-and-see , even when the medical advantages are small . patients choose new , expensive medications rather than existing , cheaper generics in search of minor reductions in side effects . family members exhaust every life-saving intervention for an elderly relative , even when the prospects of significant life extension are minimal . doctors order excessive diagnostic tests , partially to avoid malpractice liability . if most people paid the full cost of their insurance , the incentives that insurance creates for excessive care would be modest . insurance companies would utilize co-pays , deductibles , coverage limitations , and other contractual features that discourage inefficient levels of care , and more generous policies would be more expensive , discouraging demand for such coverage . most people , however , do not pay the full cost of their health insurance . the poor and the elderly receive free or highly subsidized insurance via medicaid or medicare . much of the working-age population gets subsidized insurance because employer-paid health insurance premiums are not treated as taxable income . thus most insurance policies do not contain adequate incentives for patients and providers to balance costs and benefits in choosing the level of care . this absence of cost incentives is especially problematic -- paradoxically -- because of the technological progress that has occurred and will occur in medicine . these advances in health care are beneficial , but the new techniques are expensive . the implication is that patients and doctors constantly face the choice between high-cost , state-of-the-art care and moderate-cost , conventional care . if these decision makers face little financial penalty for choosing the best possible care , they will do so every time . thus subsidized-insurance combined with medical advancement means rapidly increasing expenditure . this suggests that to restrain government health spending , policy must reduce existing subsidies , not introduce new government insurance . inefficiencies in health care are a problem , but they persist because existing subsidies mean health care providers face limited incentives to control costs . a new government insurance program for the uninsured just makes things worse . in addition , this program will undoubtedly cost far more than initial estimates , as has occurred with medicare and medicaid . one way to reduce health insurance subsidies is to eliminate the tax-exemption for employer-paid health insurance premiums , while simultaneously lowering other taxes to hold revenue constant . this change in the structure of taxation would cause those now covered by employer plans to choose less generous packages and therefore make more efficient choices about health care . a second way to reduce subsidies is to gradually increase the age of eligibility for medicare from its current level of 65 , to 70 or more . this makes sense because of the improvements in life expectancy and health status of the elderly that have occurred over the past 40 years . a higher age of eligibility would reduce expenditure directly by shrinking the medicare beneficiary base , and indirectly by pushing more people to face the cost-control measures in private insurance plans . rolling back subsidies for health insurance is not pleasant medicine , but past improvements in health technology mean that even low-cost care is superior to the state-of-the-art a few decades ago . society must accept that we can not give everyone the best care all the time ; the attempt to do so will bankrupt the economy . as in other areas , societies must make tradeoffs about health , and that happens well only when governments subsidize less . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of jeffrey miron .", "summary": " jeffrey miron : government spending on health care is rising fast .   he says government ca n't afford to provide top quality care for all .   miron : health system provides no incentive for patients or providers to control costs .   he says taxing health benefits and raising retirement age would help .
