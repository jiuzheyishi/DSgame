' mrs shah , who has worked with afghan refugees in pakistan , said some wonderfully colourful words are in danger of being lost forever . around the world in 80 years aims to help children move away from texting and tweets and instead explore the spoken word . in the introduction , she says : ` let 's snatch begrumpled from the brink of obscurity ... we want to open our wink-a-peeps and champion their cause .
