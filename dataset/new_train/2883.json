{"text": "gourmet cuisine has long been a staple of business class and first-class menus . but a number of airlines are taking the in-flight meal to new heights by bringing chefs on board to serve up a fine dining experience in the sky -- scooping up culinary awards in the process . etihad airways has gone as far as to poach expert cooks from a number renowned michelin-starred restaurants since launching its  flying chef  service on long haul flights late last year . the concept has thus far proved a recipe for success , with the abu dhabi based airline winning the award for best first-class catering at the 2012 skytrax world airline awards earlier this month . but given the cramped kitchen conditions of the airplane galley and the complexities of cooking at altitude , is it really possible to rustle up meals worthy of the masterchefs whilst cruising at 35,000 feet ? according to werner kimmeringer , head of guest experience and catering at etihad airways , unequivocally , yes . see also : the world 's best airport restaurants .  we introduced chefs in our first class cabin so we could offer a five-star restaurant style of service ,  says kimmeringer .  our first-class guests receive unparalleled attention and choice -- for example , the opportunity of having their personal chef tailor-make dishes based on their individual tastes and preferences ,  he adds . kimmeringer highlights the  balik style smoked salmon  and  pan-seared scallops with a parmesan cheese sauce  as particular examples of the gastronomic complexity of the etihad first-class menu .  the chef can talk -lrb- to -rrb- and recommend food directly to our guests and make suggestions of what they might like on the menu ,  says kimmeringer .  he is able to personally adjust seasonings and recommend menu and beverage choices to each guest . they can also make changes to existing menu items ... changing sauces or taking out particular ingredients .  some industry experts , however , are less effusive about the possibilities of in-flight chef operations . according to gottfried menge , group director of culinary excellence at gate gourmet , an independent provider of airline catering services , there are a number of factors that restrict the cuisine chefs can produce whilst airborne .  because of the -lrb- safety -rrb- limitations on the aircraft there are no items like a frying pan where a chef is cooking and tossing things up in a different way ,  says menge . knives and other sharp implements are also not permitted aboard airplanes , tying chefs ' hands yet further . as a result , most food is still prepared on the ground before being reheated en-masse in a steam pressure oven whilst in the air , menge explains . the chef can then alter the ingredients slightly or add extra dressings to meet the individual tastes of passengers . on the whole , however , meals are prepared in much the same way as they always have been , he adds . see also : 85 years of airline food . menge says there are inherent challenges when it comes to preparing food at altitude .  the cabin pressure of being at 35,000 feet in the air means you lose about 10 % of your taste buds ,  he says .  therefore the food always has to be stronger or there will have to be a little bit more seasoning , which obviously alters the taste .  but michael braun of austrian airlines -- one of the first organizations to introduce a chef service aboard its flights -- is adamant that on-board chefs can bring benefits . he says that they can help deliver a superior level of customer service , strengthening the carrier 's brand image and differentiating them from competitors flying similar routes .  we do our best to make a flight with austrian a high-level experience , which is why we have one chef on board of every single long-haul flight ,  says braun .  the menus are ... refined ร ยก la minute by a chef who will pamper the palates of our guests on board . -lrb- this -rrb- service is highly valued by our customers ,  he adds . in spite of the many complexities of aerial cooking , menge agrees with braun that on-board chefs can still add value to the in-flight customer experience .  it 's much more interactive if the chef can come out and say hello to the passengers rather than the crew just handing out menus and then food ,  he says .  i think it makes a big difference if a chef with passion is on board to explain the food to customers , for the visual appeal it will also look much nicer .  this can really help the airline company go the extra mile in presentation and service ,  he concludes .", "summary": " airlines hiring chefs on planes to prepare meals for first and business class passengers .   etihad airways and austrian airlines won awards for their chefs at skytrax awards .   cooking on board a plane is fraught with taste and preparation challenges .
