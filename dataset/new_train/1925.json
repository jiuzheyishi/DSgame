{"text": "when jennifer devitt discovered she was pregnant with her second child in quick succession , she decided to take a preventative strike on her mummy tummy . ` i 'm a size eight and have always had a flat stomach , but when i had my first daughter i found it really difficult to get it back , ' says jennifer , 29 , a beauty therapist and mother to indie-may , 20 months , and holly , four months . ` my muscles were non-existent , everything stuck out and it was six months before i could wear a t-shirt because of my jelly belly . i felt really self-conscious and did n't even like looking in the mirror . ` i knew that with your second baby everything can really go haywire because your muscles are already weakened , so i started looking for something to help . ' the big squeeze : anna and her corset . to most women , that might be a gym membership , a sharp swerve away from the biscuit aisle in the supermarket or a brisk walk with the buggy each day . but , like a growing number of mothers , jennifer wanted results more quickly than that . shopping in mothercare , she chanced upon what she saw as a solution to her problems -- a belly bandit . this is a huge band of thick , strong elastic that 's worn around the midriff after pregnancy and promises to shrink the belly , waist and hips . it is also said to remind women to tighten their core muscles , to reduce swelling and stretch marks , and support the spine . similar compression garments are called the cinch , the squeem and the gowri wrap . the trend is huge in the u.s. and is becoming popular here , despite warnings that it can be damaging to women 's health . jennifer strapped herself into the belly bandit just three days after giving birth . ` i wore it day and night -- i was pretty determined . and it was so expensive , around # 70 , that i wanted to get my money 's worth , ' she says . ` i found it comfortable and even slept in it . my partner , wesley , did n't mind it . he knew i wanted to feel good in my clothes . ' jennifer , who lives in the home counties , says she was ` gobsmacked ' at the results . ` within two weeks i was a size ten and could wear a tight t-shirt . i really noticed the difference in my abdominal and pelvic-floor floor muscles , even though i was n't doing any exercise . ` it took me six weeks to get back to a size eight and a weight of eight stone . i never thought it would be so dramatic . ' anna shows off her unbelievably tiny waist which she achieved by wearing her compression girdle . initially worn to support her back after having a caesarean , anna still wears it if she wants to wear a certain dress to help cinch in her waist and yummy . belly-binding is rooted in ancient tradition . in japan , the middle east and south america , it is normal for women to wear a compressing wrap , corset or girdle to speed up their return to their pre-pregnancy size . its revival in the west has been fuelled by celebrity endorsements : the actress jessica alba credited her enviably tiny and toned post-baby body to wearing two corsets , one on top of the other , day and night , for three months . kourtney kardashian and minnie driver sang the praises of the belly bandit while angelina jolie and gwen stefani wore the cinch , a # 75 wrap available in upmarket maternity shops . while there 's no doubt shapewear can make lumps and bumps appear to vanish , some experts warn against squeezing your post - pregnancy body back into shape . some obstetricians in the u.s. say women are risking stress incontinence , digestion problems and weakened back muscles . nicky croft , a women 's health physiotherapist at the appi clinic in hampstead , north london , says : ` after giving birth , the uterus is still enlarged and the whole of the abdominal wall has lengthened and stretched throughout the pregnancy . ` this will return to normal , but it takes time . the evidence shows that the best way to reduce abdominal distension is breast-feeding and specific exercises to strengthen the abdominals during and after pregnancy . ` a belly-binder wo n't help you lose baby fat -- the only things to affect that are your metabolism and diet . if you bind the abdominal wall too tightly , you 're putting your pelvic floor under pressure , which could lead to urinary leakage . the pelvic floor has just been through a big stretch , so the last thing it wants is to be pressured . ' gwen stefani wore the cinch which is a # 75 wrap sold in upmarket maternity stores to help her return to her pre-baby shape after she had given birth . the other concern is that belly binders take over the job of the tummy muscles , meaning deeper , core muscles become lazy . ` if you give too much external support to the stomach , the abdominal and pelvic-floor muscles will be deterred from working as well , ' says croft . ` so , in the long term you might become reliant on wearing the wrap to keep yourself supported , rather than retraining your core muscles to do it . ' kathryn lister tried two belly binders following the birth of her daughter daisy . ` as i 'm 41 , i was aware my body could go south after i had a baby , ' says kathryn , who works in finance and is married to simon , 45 . ` the rest of me is fairly flabby , but my stomach has always been flat . so i really wanted to try to hold on to it . i was reading online mothers ' forums and saw all these mentions of belly binding . ` i remember reading about jessica alba doing it and that really stuck in my mind . i ended up buying the cinch and some squeem shapewear . ' two days after her daughter was born , kathryn strapped herself into the cinch , but struggled to get used to it . ` daisy was born on one of the hottest days of the year , so it was uncomfortable . it was also very obvious . if i was wearing anything other than a thick shirt or jumper you could see it under my clothes . ` it 's recommended to wear it for 18 hours a day , which seemed like madness . ` in the end , i had to take it off every time i wanted to feed daisy because i simply was n't comfortable sitting in it . ' after two weeks , kathryn decided to try the squeem , a girdle that runs from under the bra to the bikini line . ` this was even worse . it had hook and eye fastenings , so it took ages to put on and bits of you spill out . the fat has got to go somewhere , has n't it ? i looked like an overstuffed sausage . ' yet the internet is awash with ` miracle ' stories about women racing to get back into their pre-pregnancy clothes . mother-of-two anna blakey wore a compression girdle after her two pregnancies . angelina jolie , pictured left , wore the cinch to help return to her famously beautiful body shape while minnie driver , pictured right with her son , henry , wore another brand called the belly bandit . ` i 'm a small build , so i did n't put on much weight , but my muscles were weak and i was looking for something to support my back , ' says anna , 40 , a graphic designer who lives with her husband dominic , 45 , a sales director , and their children in south london . ` i loved the feeling of support and confidence it gave me and people were amazed when i was back in my size-ten jeans within two weeks of giving birth . ' when anna had her son , now three , she had to have an emergency caesarean . without discussing it with her midwife , she used a girdle designed for post c-section bellies , with side-fastening eyehooks . ` it sat smoothly over the scar and made all my clothes more comfortable . i think it also helped the scar to heal , in the same way that if you cut your finger you put pressure on it , ' she says . anna still occasionally wears her compression garment . ` i will put it on if i want to wear a certain dress . it helps cinch in my waist and tum . ' at 13 inches , ethel granger 's waist was the smallest ever recorded . she appeared on the cover of italian vogue . however , despite such reports , the belly-binding trend worries midwives , who feel women are under too much pressure to snap back into shape after pregnancy . janet fyle , who leads the royal college of midwives ' policy on obesity and maternal public health issues , says : ` it is far better to lose your pregnancy weight gradually , by eating healthily and taking gentle exercise , such as swimming , with your bawe 're at risk of making women feel guilty about their bodies . ' kathryn , who had suffered an abdominal split -- where the muscles do not reconnect properly after birth -- ditched the two different belly binders and saw a physiotherapist . ` she gave me some pilates and pelvic-floor exercises , which are helping . i just do n't think there 's a quick fix , ' she says . and like many new mothers , kathryn found that the arrival of her little girl signalled a change in her priorities . ` i have n't worried about my stomach as much as i thought i would , ' she says . ` daisy is my focus . all i cared about was being able to feed her , to cuddle her and feel her skin on mine . yes , my tummy is probably a bit squishy , but it 's all worth it for her .
