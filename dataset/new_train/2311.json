{"text": "washington in mid-october , political pundits wondered how house republicans could have put their sizable majority in jeopardy by forcing a government shutdown . polls showed republicans getting most of the blame for the shutdown and democrats taking a lead in generic match ups against gop congressional candidates . but those gains were quickly wiped away by the disastrous roll out of president barack obama 's signature health care law . within weeks , democrats were panicking that their support of obamacare could cost them their senate majority and risk losing more house seats . house democratic campaign chief rep. steve israel of new york shrugged off gop declarations that the new health care law 's failures spelled doom for democrats in the midterms , telling cnn in an interview ,  if republicans are going to run on rooting for failure , then so be it .  instead israel insists house republicans owned the shutdown and  2014 will not be referendum on the president , it 's a referendum on whether you want to elect a republican who will continue to do damage , it 's about a do-nothing or do-damage congress .  poll suggests obamacare could have cost obama second term . gop confident obamacare will continue to hurt democrats in midterms . republican rep. patrick mchenry , who heads the effort to recruit gop candidates to unseat democrats and expand the house gop majority , told cnn any blowback from the  brief moment  of shutdown in october will  melt away  but health care problems will persist .  the shutdown ended . obamacare will still be painful six months from now and a year from now ,  he said . house democrats need to pick up 17 gop congressional seats to win back the majority in the house of representatives . but they also need to protect a list of roughly two dozen incumbent democrats who represent red-leaning and purple districts . gop members say while obama is n't on the ballot , he remains a major factor in the midterms . the president 's record low poll numbers and questions about his credibility after failing to follow through on a key promise about his health care plan are causing a drag on democratic incumbents and challengers . some already compare this midterm and obamacare to the one that cost the republicans their house majority in 2006 , when then-president george w. bush faced questions about his handling of hurricane katrina and the unpopular iraq war pulled down his approval ratings .  president obama is very close to the low point of where president bush was ,  rep. greg walden , chair of national republican congressional committee , told reporters last week .  those of us who were here in those days remember how it felt going into the '06 election and it was n't good .  poll : voters split over democrats , republicans in 2014 . the house gop midterm playbook is a straightforward one -- highlight the problems with obamacare and its economic impact . walden says for now congressional republicans do n't need to supply an alternative health care plan of their own because the democratic-led senate and the white house would never consider a gop proposal . while a group of 39 house democrats sought to put distance between themselves and the president last week by backing a house gop bill that allows insurers to offer current health care policies for another year , house democratic leaders continue to stress obamacare will turn out to be a net positive for the party by next fall .  democrats stand tall in support of the affordable care act .  house democratic leader nancy pelosi said in an interview with nbc on sunday . pelosi defends obamacare claims , ca n't predict effect on dems in midterms . the democratic national committee distributed a memo this week using examples of gop candidates like mitt romney and virginia gubernatorial candidate ken cuccinelli who ran against obamacare and lost . the memo concluded ,  while republicans are campaigning to bring back a broken health care system , democrats will be campaigning on obamacare .  for those new democratic candidates who were n't in washington when obamacare was passed , israel says he advises new candidates to run as  problem-solvers , running on solutions .  and he points to internal polling across competitive districts that shows that voters prefer a candidate who wants to  fix and improve  obamacare rather than one who vows to  repeal and defund  the law 55 % -40 % . but a new abc/washington post poll out on tuesday found that four in 10 americans were more likely to oppose a candidate who backed the law , and only about one-fifth saying they are likely to vote for a politician who supports the law . mchenry points to house republican challengers who have personal experiences with the new health care law , saying they will work tirelessly to link democrats to it . stewart mills , who oversees 6,000 employees in his family 's business in northeastern minnesota , is a top gop recruit running against democratic rep rick nolan . he talks about his company 's health care costs and highlights his opposition to obamacare as a key reason for entering the race . republicans believe several candidates who narrowly lost to democrats in 2012 in competitive districts in arizona , north carolina , and utah will prevail in rematches in 2014 because this time house democrats wo n't have the help of a presidential ticket boosting turnout . house democrats say gop record of dysfunction will cost them seats . the focus now is squarely on obamacare , but democrats believe the political debate will move into better territory for them as attention returns to fiscal fights on capitol hill . the short-term deal to reopen the government created a mid-december target for congress to agree to a budget , and a january deadline for funding the government . the treasury 's borrowing authority runs out in mid-february . house dems cool down after obamacare meeting . the number two house democrat complained on tuesday that house budget conference chairman rep. paul ryan , r-wisconsin , and other congressional republicans were n't serious about budget negotiations , and warned the government could again be facing a shutdown .  paul ryan ought to lead , not follow his caucus down a road , which would lead to shutdown . that would be irresponsible and harmful and i hope he does n't do that ,  rep steny hoyer told reporters on tuesday . the democratic congressional campaign committee believes the shutdown was a recruiting bonanza for them , and helped contribute to some recent gop retirements . israel points to eight gop seats that were put in play directly because of the extended standoff . omaha city councilman pete festersen jumped in the race against nebraska gop rep. lee terry after terry said he needed his government paycheck to afford his home . on his campaign website , festersen positions himself as an outsider :  i am running for congress to help change a dysfunctional washington . the time has come for moderate minds and respectful leaders to work together .  democrats also say republicans ' lack of diversity and inability to reach out beyond their base -- a major factor in their national loss in 2012 -- will also hurt their chances to make inroads in democratic districts in 2014 .  the movement is underway and it takes time ,  mchenry admitted . but he pointed to gop candidate carl demaio in san diego , who is challenging democratic rep. scott peters . demaio is openly gay and backed by the house gop campaign arm . seven keys to the 2014 midterms .", "summary": " democratic gains brought on by shutdown wiped away by obamacare fiasco .   republicans believe shutdown fallout will fade , but obamacare problems will persist .   democrats believe sentiment will swing back to them in fiscal fights ahead with gop .
