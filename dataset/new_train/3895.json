{"text": "walking around sandals lasource is a strange experience . it 's not just the staff who are incredibly friendly , but guests , too . if i were to knock on my neighbours ' door and ask them to fetch me a mojito , i know they 'd happily oblige . a spare toothbrush ? coming right up . everyone at this newly-opened grenadian extravaganza seems blissfully , deliriously happy - from the british couple who excitedly tell me this is the tenth sandals resort they 've visited , to the young , amorous americans slurping neon cocktails , who want to know all about the village in hampshire where i was born . so my initial exploration of the 17-acre site becomes a lengthy process . grab a cocktail , pull up a seat : the sandals lasource resort is a pristine hideaway on the grenada shore . sandals lasource is a new addition to this lovely spot , a country which includes the main 120 square mile island and the smaller islands of carriacou and petite martinique . it 's an adults-only affair -lrb- no under-18s allowed -rrb- , one of 15 sandals resorts dotted around the caribbean . grenada is a ten-hour flight from london and the resort is a five-minute drive from the airport , on the south-western tip of the island , specifically a beautiful stretch of sand known as pink gin beach . for this reason , i 've packed my ear plugs , but not once do i hear an aircraft . there are 225 rooms and suites . some have pools on the balconies , and there are butler suites where assistants wearing earpieces and white gloves dance attendance . guests are given mobile phones with which they can contact their butlers , although i ca n't help but cringe when i overhear a portly , sunburnt american barking orders for beer from his sun-lounger . just glorious : grenada is home to some wonderful stretches of shoreline , including grand anse beach . i might not have a suite , but i 'm hardly roughing it . my room , in the seafront italian village area , has an imposing marble bath tub on the balcony and a glass wall dividing the bedroom from the shower so , if you wish , you can watch your other half scrub sand from their nether regions . waterskiing , kayaking , snorkelling and scuba trips all come gratis , and , for a small charge , there are excursions outside the resort . i opt for river tubing and spend the day floating lazily along a river lined by thick , jungle-like foliage , my progress impeded only by clusters of rocks which cause log jams . with a quick shove from our guides , we pop free like corks . halfway along , we enter a deep lagoon and take turns jumping off a ledge into the clear water . on the way back to the resort , we stop by grand anse beach , near the capital of st george 's . although one of the island 's most beautiful beaches , it 's surprisingly quiet , with just a few locals occupying the deckchairs . we have a quick look around the knick-knack-filled stalls then head to st george 's itself , home to the cruise ship terminal and a souvenir-filled shopping centre clearly aimed at passengers on a mad dash ashore . the spice market in st george 's square is a fragrant alternative , and the piles of nutmeg , cloves and lemongrass remind us why grenada is known as the spice island . capital concerns : what passes for urban life on grenada is lightly visible in the capital st george 's . the snorkelling trip i have booked the next day is cancelled due to bad weather , so i opt for an island tour . one of grenada 's darker periods was the coup-within-a-coup which resulted in the killing of prime minister maurice bishop on october 19 , 1983 . we visit the fort where he died . bishop was executed by the people 's revolutionary army of grenada , led by general hudson austin . on october 25 , u.s. marines invaded on the orders of president reagan . as we now know , he had to use all his charm to appease mrs thatcher , who , despite grenada being part of the commonwealth , was kept in the dark about the operation . u.s. forces took control of the island within three days . austin was arrested and an interim advisory council reinstated the 1974 constitution . elections were held in 1984 and herbert a. blaize became grenada 's new pm . today , the bullet holes that pockmark the walls of fort george are the only chilling reminder of this era . sandals is brilliant for people-watching because of its diverse clientele . some of the most interesting evenings are spent in the open-plan living room bar with its dance floor and themed music nights . the shameless dad-dancing and inappropriate grinding is truly something to behold . a guest tells me that sandals resorts bring out the romantic side in everyone , whether they 're 18 or 80 , but i ca n't help thinking that the free alcohol also plays a part . sandals guests refer to staff members as if they were old friends . the more hardcore fans wear their sandals t-shirts like badges of honour and swap tales of sandals reunions . settling in nicely : tamara enjoyed a splendid week on the sands of the sandals lasource resort . there are nine restaurants . i develop a penchant for eggs benedict at le jardinier , where i appear to be the only person not chasing down my breakfast with champagne . another favourite is butch 's chophouse , a steakhouse named after sandals ' chairman , jamaican-born gordon ` butch ' stewart , who happens to be dining there when i visit . he 's a jovial , grandfather-type figure who happily chats to star-struck devotees . in the afternoons , i offset the threat of obesity by visiting the gym -lrb- sandals guests party hard , but they work out hard , too ; even at 6am there are queues for the running machines -rrb- . when i 'm feeling less energetic , i sign up for a round of bocce ball -lrb- an italian boules-type game -rrb- and play board games at the swim-up bar . on my final day , i head to le jardinier and toast sandals lasource with a pre-9am glass of champers . seven nights all-inclusive at sandals lasource grenada -lrb- 0800 597 0002 , www.sandals.co.uk -rrb- costs from # 1,629 per person , staying in a south seas premium room . this price includes return flights and transfers .", "summary": " a ` hidden ' gem , grenada is one of the more southerly caribbean islands .   it lies close to trinidad and tobago , and the south american continent .   the adults-only
