{"text": "kanye west has been called many things , but these days the best description -- according to him -- is family man . the 36-year-old rapper appeared on kris jenner 's daytime talk show  kris  on friday to discuss his relationship with jenner 's daughter , kim kardashian , and their new addition , north . but if kanye was smart , he 'd hire jenner as part of his pr team . the reality tv momager , who has extended her family 's brand from e! to fox with this test run of her talk show , reiterated several times that the stone-faced and difficult kanye portrayed in the media is not the man she 's come to know . -lrb- kanye , after all , is now living in her home . -rrb- .  i 'm so excited that i 've gotten to know you like i have ,  jenner said .  there are a lot of things that people do n't know about you that are so interesting to me that i want other people to hear .  kanye spoke about the effect of the birth on his outlook .  to me it 's such a blessing , and i feel like it 's going to give me the stability that i need to really create and really do god 's work in the way i should ,  kanye , wearing a  what would jesus do  bracelet , told jenner .  someone to be accountable , someone to be responsible for . after i lost my mother there were times i felt like i would put my life at risk , i felt like sometimes i did n't have something to live for . now i have two really special people to live for , a whole family to live for . i want people , when they remember me and my family , their thought association to be someone who helped , someone who brought joy .  he did bring plenty of joy to jenner 's show , as she beamed while displaying north 's photo for the audience . north , who was born june 15 , has her mother 's eyes and father 's cheeks , according to jenner .  the thing i think about as a dad is just protection . that 's my only goal , to kanye said his goal is  to protect my daughter . that 's my instinct .   to give my daughter as many opportunities to just be a child . of course , a big thing that plagues us is this idea of the paparazzi chasing a 5-year-old around and screaming at them . ... you have enough things to deal with and to learn being a new parent and you add that on top of it , and it becomes really intense .  according to jenner , kanye 's been into his girlfriend for a long , long time , and would even use photoshop to draw himself into the yearly kardashian-jenner christmas card . -lrb- seriously -- jenner showed proof . -rrb- . although he could n't quite remember the first time he met kardashian , 32 , kanye did know it was love at first sight .  i 'm trying to remember if the first time we met was her being in the studio when she was brandy 's assistant , and i think she brought us in , like , something to drink ,  he said .  or it might 've been when i was doing brandy 's video and i remember asking my manager , ` who is that girl right there ? ' ... i was in love with her before i even got to talk to her .  kim , he said , was always someone he dreamed about being with , but more importantly , he feels that they 're  equally yoked .   being in the limelight , you have to have a match , or someone that 's equally yoked ,  he told jenner .  it 's difficult , because there 's people that you would date who would try to date you to maybe be more famous , or people who would want you to be less famous than you were , and just not accept who you are in life . and when i would be on the phone with her , even at my lowest moments , she 'd give me energy and remind me of who i was . and i needed that support at all times .  kanye knows that there are those who think he and the kardashian family would n't have much in common . but he 's trying to grow both spiritually --  i 'm a christian ,  he said ,  that 's what 's important to me , that i grow and walk and raise my family with christian values .   people feel that me and my girlfriend 's mother are of different brands in a way ,  he said .  but it 's not about any of us being at odds , it 's about us helping each other and improving each other . i might be one of the only guys in the world that knows how to pick out a pair of shoes for a girl , but i have improvements that i need to make as a human being ... the way that i talk to people , being too sharp with people , or being too edgy . as a creative guy , sometimes it 's hard for me to small talk . ... and that 's something that -lrb- the kardashian -rrb- family and kim are teaching me , helping me to be a better person .  given the negative press he 's had -- from that infamous mic-jacking at the 2009 mtv video music awards to more recent run-ins with the paparazzi -- does he have any regrets ? not exactly . while there are things he wishes he could change , he also believes that  everything happened for a reason , and i 've grown from it ,  he said .  i feel that i 'm very , very , very blessed , and with that comes great responsibility . with the way my parents raised me and the information that they gave me and this feeling that i have that i want to help , i think anything that could be considered a mistake will help me to make better decisions in the future .
