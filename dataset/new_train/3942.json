{"text": "guilty : roy hattersley 's pet buster -lrb- right -rrb- once killed a royal goose - but he says the new law has flaws . there are no bad dogs -- only bad owners . that was what i was brought up to believe . and i believe it still . and that is why i welcomed , with great enthusiasm , the government 's decision to introduce a new dangerous dogs act and replace the foolish attempt to identify bad dogs with a sensible policy of rooting out bad owners . the purpose of the new act -- which we should all applaud -- is to protect the public against dogs which are taught to fight and kill , dogs which are driven wild by neglect , dogs which are taught to intimidate and dogs which so lack training and discipline that they are completely out of control . but the bureaucrats of whitehall possess a remarkable ability to make even the most sensible policy seem ridiculous . under the law , which came into force this week , dog owners who simply let their animals growl at strangers or bark in gardens could be ordered to control their pets or face fines of up to # 2,500 . what 's more , whitehall has issued a 31-page ` manual ' entitled anti-social behaviour : control and welfare of dogs , which describes how the new act works and includes an incomprehensible ` flow chart ' . the truth is that the document shows every sign of having been written by a civil servant who has never owned a dog and , in consequence , has not the slightest idea about how dogs think and behave . of course , it was right to change the law in a way that made it possible to prosecute the owner of a dangerous dog , whether the animal attacks its victim on private property or the open road . and the manual , naturally , makes much of the need to protect postal workers . but neither the post office itself nor the postal workers ' union has improved its popularity and reputation by behaving as if every dog is a threat and the delivery of every letter is an act of conspicuous gallantry . indeed , the postman i know best is embarrassed by what he calls ` all this dog fuss ' and stopped me in the road to say so -- stroking my dog at the same time . but the real complaint against the manual is its promotion of so-called community protection orders -- a name which might have been taken straight out of george orwell 's 1984 . police , council officers and social housing landlords can now issue these notices that force an owner to take action , such as attending dog behavioural classes , keeping an animal on a lead , muzzling it or having it neutered . scroll down for video . roy -lrb- left -rrb- says some parts of the manual might have been taken straight out of george orwell 's 1984 . examples of the sort of canine behaviour from which the public must be protected , and for which the dog-owner must be punished , lead only to one conclusion : the vast majority of the country 's eight million dog owners are at risk daily of being slapped with a community protection order . for it seems that these orders were invented as part of a doomed attempt to stop dog behaving ... like dogs . i would certainly qualify for one . as readers with long memories will recall , 18 years ago , my then dog , buster , when he was young and reckless , killed one of the queen 's geese in london 's st james 's park . natural born killer ? buster would have been slapped with a penalty for killing a royal goose -lrb- pictured -rrb- . as for my current dog , he spends many a sunny afternoon in what he thinks of as his garden , barking at the dog on the other side of the hedge . that normal behaviour -- believe it or not -- is now classified as anti-social conduct ! i never thought i would complain of becoming a victim of the ` nanny state ' . not only are my neighbours sensible and civilised people . their dog barks back at mine . if ever we were both to be prosecuted , one of us would give the other a lift to the courthouse door and the case would undoubtedly collapse . under the new law , community protection orders are also to be issued when a dog 's behaviour is ` having a detrimental effect on the quality of life of those in the community ' . yet i fear that this law -- which has so little relationship with the real word -- is open to abuse by local busybodies . for , we are told , an order could simply be issued if a dog is ` showing signs of problematic behaviour , such as non-responsive to calls ' . we should disregard this nonsense about ` problematic behaviour ' as nothing more than civil service gobbledegook . but the idea that a dog which is ` non-responsive to calls ' imperils the stability of the community is simply crazy . most dogs come when they are called -- but not always the first or second time . whenever i walk in the hills behind my house , the shouts and whistles of impatient owners will echo off the bracken . yet my village remains peaceful and secure . the next time i take a walk , i shall examine the condition of the village green . for the new dangerous dogs manual is particularly severe on anyone who allows their dog to ` damage flower-beds and benches ' and i assume that publicly-owned grass , mowed at local residents ' expense , qualifies for similar protection . if i see any signs of canine carnage , i shall not take the manual 's advice and provide local officials with details of the destruction ` through photographic evidence and witness statements ' . you may think me lacking in public spirit . but i want to avoid the rest of the village seeing me collect the damning data and making the reasonable assumption that i have lost my senses . there are more examples of normal canine conduct which apparently must be stamped out . danger dogs : the law was meant to punish owners who force dogs such as staffies -lrb- pictured -rrb- to fight . readers of the manual are invited to imagine that neighbours of a dog-owning family ` are concerned at the distress and safety of their cats ' . they may have noticed that they are chased by the dogs and ` fear that their chasing is not playful ' . no doubt , they are right . for it is in a dog 's nature to chase cats , just as it is a cat 's nature to chase birds and , in turn , a bird 's nature to chase insects . in my experience , the cat almost always escapes . nor does it show any signs of distress . it sits in a tree or on a nearby wall -- a car bonnet will do -- and hisses defiance at its pursuer . and all the characters in the little dog-cat drama -- up to now without the assistance of the department for environment , food & rural affairs and the home office -- live happily ever after . but the example of the definition of ` bad behaviour ' which riles me most -- provoking anger rather than derision -- is ` a dog running loose in the park ' which approaches ` a group of young children ' or ` other dogs being walked on leads ' before it returns to its owner . to regard that as an offence is worse than ridiculous . dogs are pack animals and enjoy -- indeed need -- company . the other dogs almost certainly welcome their attention . and it is positively wicked -- wicked -- to encourage children to believe that a dog is something to fear . one of the blessings of my childhood was the lesson , gladly learned , that dogs are man 's natural friend . the child who has not learned that lesson is missing one of the joys of life . dogs should be , and often are , a delight to young and old . for thousands of sick , elderly and lonely people they provide comfort , consolation and companionship . the last thing they need is the nagging fear that if their dog chases a cat or barks too loudly , some officious individual from the local council will knock on their door and warn them to change its ways or face prosecution . of course , the bureaucrats will tell us : ` it wo n't work like that . ' but if that is so , why have the powers ` to work like that ' been created ? and why not abandon them here and now ? in the meantime , i am worried that thousands -- perhaps millions -- of dog-owners will feel , at best , uneasy about this foolish new dangerous dogs act . what 's more , the nation needs their support for the part of the legislation which really matters . it is imperative that we track down -- and rescue -- all those dogs which have been bred to fight . we must prosecute the men who strut around the streets with dogs which they treat as offensive weapons . bad owners -- not bad dogs -- are the proper target . but they have to be identified with common sense . otherwise the whole operation will be dismissed as nonsense .", "summary": " aim of dangerous dogs act is to protect public from pets taught to fight .   but it reads as though none of the civil servants own a dog themselves .   dog owners who let their pets growl at strangers could face # 2,500 fines .   and that 's by ex-mp roy hattersley - whose pet killed queen 's goose .
