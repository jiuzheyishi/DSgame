{"text": "new york the commuter train that jumped its tracks in the bronx was barreling into a curve at nearly three times the posted speed when it derailed , killing four passengers , federal safety officials said monday . preliminary data from the event recorders aboard the train clocked it at 82 mph as it approached the 30-mph curve , where the hudson and harlem rivers converge , national transportation safety board member earl weener told reporters . the data show the engineer cut the throttle and slammed on the brakes , but those moves came  very late in the game ,  weener said .  this is raw data off the event recorders , so it tells us what happened . it does n't tell us why it happened ,  weener said . investigators questioned the engineer , william rockefeller , and the rest of the train crew on monday . rockefeller told investigators he applied the brakes , but the train did n't slow down , according to a law enforcement official who was at the scene and is familiar with the investigation . but while the cause of the derailment has not yet been determined , investigators have seen no indication of brake problems , weener said . all seven coaches and the locomotive came off the tracks in the sunday morning crash on new york 's metro-north hudson line . in addition to the four dead , at least 67 more were hurt . three remained in critical condition monday night , and 16 others were still hospitalized , hospitals told cnn . the train 's recorded speed is not only far faster than the rated speed for the curve where the derailment occurred , it 's faster than the 70 mph posted for the section of track that led into the curve , weener said . the force of the crash ripped apart the rails and a section of the track bed , leaving chunks of concrete strewn about the scene . david schanoes , a former deputy chief of field operations for the metro-north line , said the data is  uncannily similar  to a july rail crash in spain that left 79 dead .  i would have to see all the data from the event recorder ,  schanoes told cnn 's erin burnett outfront .  but clearly , from what has been captured , the train was overspeeding , and the request for emergency brake application comes too late for the train to be able to negotiate the curvature .  weener said authorities will be looking at the engineer 's recent work history and will examine his mobile phone , which is now in the hands of authorities . in the spanish crash , a court found the engineer had been on the phone with railway staff when the train derailed . but a preliminary review has found no reason to believe rockefeller was using his phone at the time of sunday 's derailment , a senior law enforcement official familiar with the investigation told cnn . in a statement issued monday evening , new york gov. andrew cuomo said the data  makes clear that , as we suspected , extreme speed was a central cause of this crash .   the lives that were lost yesterday are a stark reminder that protecting the safety of all new yorkers must be our top priority ,  cuomo said .  when the investigation concludes , we will make sure that any responsible parties are held accountable . my thoughts and prayers continue to be with the families of the victims of yesterday 's crash .  the hudson line carried 15.9 million people last year . about 150 were aboard when the train derailed , authorities said . u.s. sen. chuck schumer said the speed report  sort of takes your breath away .   for a train to be going 82 mph around that curve is just a frightening thought ,  said schumer , d-new york , who appeared at a news conference with weener .  the fact that it was going 82 mph even in the 70-mph zones before the curve started raises so many questions and is scary .  schumer said the tracks appear to have been in good shape , and the preliminary indication is that signals were working properly --  but it 's premature to blame anyone or anything right now ,  he added . ` it was just smoke ' the train was about 10 miles short of its destination , manhattan 's grand central terminal , when it derailed on the approach to the spuyten duyvil station in the bronx . despite the high speed , surviving passenger amanda swanson said she felt the wreck in slow motion .  i was nodding off , and the thing that woke me up was my own equilibrium ,  swanson told cnn 's anderson cooper 360 .  i realized that my body was tilted very severely , and that woke me up -- and when i woke up and saw the entire cab of the train was tilted , i immediately woke up and realized that i was in the middle of a train crash .  the windows of the coaches broke out and then ,  gravel came flying up in our faces ,  said swanson , 26 , who was on her way to work at a midtown manhattan restaurant . she put her bag in front of her face to block the rubble as the car she was riding in flipped over and skidded to a stop with a thud .  i could n't see anything ,  she told cnn 's new day .  it was just smoke .  workers lifted the rail cars back onto the tracks on monday , and police determined no other bodies were trapped in the wreckage . beth barret , who sent photos to cnn 's ireport , called the scene  very surreal and very scary .   it was a scene straight out of a sci-fi movie ,  barret said . cameras may have caught deadly derailment . it 's not the first time a train jumped the tracks on that turn . a freight train derailed in the same curve in july , damaging about 1,500 feet of track , the metropolitan transit authority reported at the time . mary schiavo , a former inspector-general for the u.s. department of transportation , said investigators should take a close look at the sharp curve .  it has been there forever , but the fact that we 've had other accidents there means we have to look beyond just the fact that the train engineer said that brakes were not working ,  she said .  we have to see if there 's additional issues concerning that track .  weener said the agency would look into whether there was any connection between the july derailment and sunday 's crash , but both he and new york gov. andrew cuomo discounted the possibility .  the curve has been here for many , many years , right , and trains take the curve every day , 365 days a year ... we 've always had this configuration . we did n't have accidents ,  cuomo said sunday .  so there has to be another factor .  authorities also are looking for video that may have captured the derailment , safety board spokesman keith holloway said . railroad officials have said there were no video cameras aboard the train . weener said security cameras from a nearby bridge captured the train 's approach , but the image is small and obscured by a cloud of dust . video technicians in washington will try to recover some usable imagery from the recording , he told cnn 's  the situation room .  metro-north railroad inspects its tracks twice a week , spokeswoman marjorie anders said . the most recent inspection found the track was  ok for normal operations .  she said the train was n't equipped with positive train control -- a high-tech system designed to slow down or stop trains to prevent crashes caused by human error . anders said the railroad conducted routine drug and alcohol tests on crew members but has not released the results . rockefeller appeared coherent at the scene , and there was no indication he was intoxicated , said a high-ranking law enforcement official who is part of the investigation . anthony bottalico , general chairman of the union that represents rockefeller and the train 's conductors , said the crew members are also eager to find out what caused the crash and  make sure it does n't ever happen again .   hopefully over the next day or two , there will be some kind of idea or closure ,  he said . the victims . the mta identified those killed as donna l. smith , 54 , of newburgh , new york ; james g. lovell , 58 , of cold spring , new york ; james m. ferrari , 59 , of montrose , new york ; and so kisook ahn , 35 , of queens , new york . lovell did freelance audio and was headed into new york to work sunday morning , said dave merandy , a town council member in the hudson valley community of philipstown .  he loved his family and did what was necessary to keep things afloat with his family . he was a great man ,  merandy said . one of the survivors suffered a spinal cord injury that could leave him paralyzed from the neck down , said dr. david listman , director of the emergency department at st. barnabas hospital in the bronx . the man is the father of a 14-year-old boy who was released from the hospital sunday .  it 's hard to understand how they were sitting next to each other on the train , and the son walks away with minor bruises , and the father sustained such a severe injury ,  listman said . while patients with severe fractures could be released from the hospital monday , he said , they may require further treatment and mental health care after surviving the devastating accident .  for a lot of these people , the train was their way of commuting to work . i think a lot of these people are going to have to contend with getting back to normal life ,  he said .  i think that 's going to be very difficult for them .  train crash victim was ` pure goodness , ' widow says . cnn 's alexandra field reported from new york . cnn 's matt smith , holly yan and catherine e. shoichet reported from atlanta . cnn 's eden pontz , anneclaire stapleton , rene marsh , kate bolduan , wolf blitzer , polina marinova , lorenzo ferrigno , alexandra field , kristina sgueglia , jon auerbach , dana garrett , shimon prokupecz , mike m. ahlers and haley draznin contributed to this report .", "summary": " new :
