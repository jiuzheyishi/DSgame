' a post mortem revealed the tot had suffered an earlier abdominal injury that had started to heal around two weeks before his death . cassin dramatically left the dock in tears as the graphic details of levi 's injuries were pointed out on a diagram to jurors . piper , of handsworth wood , birmingham , and cassin , of chelmsley wood , birmingham , are also accused of neglect and causing or allowing the death of a child . cassin 's mother angela broke down in tears as she told the jury how her daughter had visited her the day before ` smiley happy ' levi died . she said : ` she -lrb- cassin -rrb- came round at about 9pm . i was in the living room , the telly was on and the children were in bed . ` danielle said that he had a stomach ache because he was vomiting . ` she was rushed . she did not stay for a long time . ` she had a screwed-up mattress cover with her . she asked me if it was stomach lining on it . ' i know it was from a cot . ' i said ` do n't be so stupid ' because i have never heard of anyone bringing up stomach lining before . ` levi had been sick . ` there was a patch of what looked like sick and a little blob of clear phlegm on the mattress . ' i just said ` make sure he drinks lots of liquid . there is a bug going around . ' ` the next i heard from her was about 5.30 am on the phone , saying he was dead .
