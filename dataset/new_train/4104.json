{"text": "phoenix a federal judge entered a plea of not guilty monday on behalf of jared lee loughner to three counts of attempted murder in the mass shooting that wounded u.s. rep. gabrielle giffords earlier this month . after entering the packed courtroom , loughner , 22 , showed the same smirk as he had in his mug shot . he appeared to chuckle to himself as he looked into an upper balcony area filled with spectators . he smiled occasionally during the 15-minute arraignment and remained silent . u.s. district court judge larry burns asked federal public defender judy clarke about loughner 's ability to comprehend the proceedings .  we are not raising that issue at this time ,  clarke told the judge . when the judge asked for plea from the defendant , clarke asked the judge to enter one on loughner 's behalf . loughner is charged with trying to kill giffords and two of her aides , ron barber and pamela simon . prosecutors have turned over hours of videos taken off loughner 's home computer to the defense . they also provided the defense with witness statements , attorneys said in court . clarke acknowledged she received two discs from the prosecution . the next court hearing is scheduled for march 9 and is expected to be held in tucson , not phoenix , at the request of prosecutors , who wanted to be closer to witnesses and victims . the defense said it had no problem with the request as long as his attorney knows where loughner will be held in tucson . monday 's arraignment was held in phoenix because the mass shooting occurred in tucson , in which six persons were killed and 13 more were wounded . among those killed was arizona 's chief federal judge , john roll of tucson , and all federal judges in arizona then recused themselves from loughner 's proceedings . monday 's hearing was presided over by burns , who 's from the u.s. district court for southern california , based in san diego . he was designated to head the case by the 9th circuit court . prosecutors said they might file a superseding indictment within the next 30 to 45 days . legal experts expect additional charges , including those for the murders of six people , to be filed against loughner , who is a tucson resident .  the grand jury investigation will continue ,  cnn senior legal analyst jeffrey toobin said last week .  there 's a long way to go in this case , and -lrb- the attempted murder -rrb- charges will be there . but i 'm certain more will be there as well .  meanwhile , in houston , giffords continued to show improvement in her rehabilitation from a gunshot wound to the head . she was loughner 's alleged main target on january 8 , when gunfire was sprayed in the safeway supermarket parking lot in tucson . critically wounded after being shot in the brain , she is in intensive care memorial hermann-texas medical center in houston . the amount of car traffic on the campus of texas medical center , a cluster of 42 university-affiliated schools , hospitals and clinics outside downtown , has doubled since giffords ' arrival friday , campus security chief fernando bertrand told cnn affiliate kprc . yet bertrand , who would n't detail any special security precautions beyond saying there was careful coordination with state and federal law enforcement agencies , said things thus far have gone smoothly . since being transferred there from southern arizona , giffords has impressed doctors , the hospital 's medical director said . that includes her ability to do exercises that involve moving , sitting and standing .  she 's doing very well ,  dr. gerard francisco said saturday , adding that she  surprised us  with her ability to use her muscles and other developments .  she did not need as much assistance as we anticipated .  on sunday , giffords ' husband mark kelly , a nasa astronaut , posted on his twitter feed that his wife was continuing to work toward a full recovery .  gabrielle starts her second day of rehab in 20 minutes at memorial hermann . no weekends off here ,  he wrote . giffords has a breathing tube in her neck and can not talk , but francisco said he believes she is trying to communicate . she is very responsive to others and follows commands . he said doctors were particularly encouraged by giffords ' bringing her left leg , which was dangling off the side of the bed , up onto the bed . giffords has good movement and muscle tone on her left side , he said , and some on her right side as well -- even though she was shot in the left side of her brain , which controls her right side . arizona doctors said giffords ' transfer from that state went flawlessly . dr. randall friese of the umc trauma center said that at some points as she traveled through the streets of tucson , giffords could hear applause from those who turned out to honor her .  she responded very well to that ,  he said , smiling and even tearing up a bit .  it was very emotional .  despite reaching a series of milestones , giffords has a long road ahead , doctors have said . once she enters rehabilitation , the process is expected to take four to six months . cnn 's elizabeth cohen contributed to this report .", "summary": " new : federal
