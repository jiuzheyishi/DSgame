{"text": "embracing the hair you 're born with sounds like it should be the easiest thing in the world , but for some , it 's a huge challenge . nikki walton , a 29-year-old licensed psychotherapist whose own journey to hair acceptance has grown from a passion into a business , knows that hurdle all too well . as the founder of curlynikki.com , walton now confidently boasts a lush , natural texture that lives up to her online nickname ,  curly nikki .  on her website , she leads the charge for a community of women seeking a resource and a space where they can let their hair down , just as it is , no straightening required . but walton can vividly recall the days when straight hair meant beautiful hair , and if she could n't be seen with it straight , she 'd rather not go out at all . as a young adult , walton would feel  gorgeous  and  ready  to take on the world when her dark hair 's natural twists and turns were straight , sleek and swinging thanks to a stylist 's heat tools . but when that style fell flat and the frizz began to appear ,  i would become an introvert ; i did n't want to do anything ,  she said . eventually , the boyfriend who was driving her to and from hair appointments -- and who 's now her husband and father to their 2Ã‚ 1/2 - year-old daughter -- intervened .  he said , ` this is n't healthy . i do n't know if you 've noticed , but you need to step back and assess this . you 're pretty , and i want you to feel pretty no matter what the condition of your hair is , '  walton recalled .  and he was right . my hair was running my life . my confidence was in flux with my hair .  that conversation inspired walton to take action , and she soon found herself researching ways she could work with the kind of hair she was born with . once she unchained herself from her flat iron , she found not only a more genuine confidence but a new freedom to live her life as she chose -- not as her hairstyle mandated .  once you get to that freedom ,  she said ,  you 'll be very excited to help those around you achieve that as well .  walton has been lending that helping hand on curlynikki.com for the past four years , and she recently compiled her accumulated wealth of hair care know-how into a book ,  better than good hair : the curly girl guide to healthy , gorgeous , natural hair .  walton describes the guide as a little like  what to expect when you 're expecting ,  mixed with the approachable , easy-to-understand wisdom she extends on the web . depending on the person , opting to wear one 's hair in its natural state can feel like a rebirth of sorts . some women may choose to cut much of their hair off -- doing a  big chop ,  as it 's called -- to get rid of heat-damaged or chemically straightened locks . for others like walton , who opted to wear her hair more naturally but skipped the dramatic haircut , there 's still a learning curve to figure out how to wear one 's natural hair texture .  in my house ,  walton said ,  any time we had somewhere important to go , if it was easter sunday -lrb- or -rrb- christmas mass , we had to make sure our hair was pressed and braided neatly . that 's what my mom knew , that 's what her mom knew , so we did n't even question it .  by the time she was in middle school , walton would want to  shrink into a hole  at the salon while she waited for a stylist to blow dry her freshly washed hair .  i did n't want people to see my hair . i could n't even look at myself in the mirror ,  she recalled .  i did n't even know what my real texture looked like . ... i just knew that if it got a little bit wet , or if i sweat -lrb- ed -rrb- a little bit too much , i put my hands into my roots , and it felt terrible .  as a result , walton had to do both a habitual and a mental shift when she decided that having healthy hair was more important . that new way involved regularly trimming her hair herself and wearing what she calls  low-manipulation  styles , like buns , which meant she was n't putting added stress on her hair with constant washing and styling . celebrity hairstylist and salon owner ted gibson concurs with walton 's careful , routine trimming , which he says is essential whether you chemically straighten your hair or are as natural as can be .  sometimes women , when they get a relaxer , they do n't want to get a haircut , but that 's part of the service for us ,  gibson said .  getting your ends trimmed is essential in growing your hair and making your hair so that it 's in better shape . hair will split after a period of time , and that 's sometimes where thinning hair comes from .  it took walton about a year and a half to get rid of her damaged bits , and at the time , she was simultaneously working on being able to leave the house with her new , natural ` do . at first ,  you have that spotlight effect , because you think everybody 's staring at you , because you 're very self-conscious ,  walton said .  and most people are n't staring at you , and if they are , maybe they 're thinking good things , not the negative things you 're projecting onto them .  on her site and particularly in her book , walton emphasizes how necessary confidence is to the process .  this is your hair , and people have to accept it because you do . and when you exude that confidence , people get that from you and they do n't bother you . often , we have to fake it till we make it , because people will be able to detect that insecurity .  the phrase  natural hair  is thrown around a lot , and it can mean different things to different people . there are those who would agree with celebrity stylist laini reeves , for whom being natural starts with the product .  being a hairdresser , i look for two things : i look for performance , and i look for ingredients . it 's hard to find completely 100 % natural hair care that has the performance that you need , but technology is becoming so advanced that the chemists know how to alter ingredients that make it have the performance ,  said reeves , who 's worked with stars like amy adams and emily blunt . for example , if you 're a curly , you might want to check out coconut oil to use as a conditioner , reeves said , in an effort to rebuild the hair and get a softer texture .  my advice to anybody : read the label and educate yourself ,  reeves said .  i 'm not an extremist . i 'm not anti this or that ; i just like to make more conscious decisions in my life .  walton , too , cautions against the perception that maintaining natural hair means standing against chemical straighteners or straight hair overall .  it 's all about achieving versatility and achieving healthy hair and achieving the freedom to be able to wear your hair curly or straight ,  she said .  the goal that i had for myself was to feel just as attractive and just as professional and sexy with my hair curly as i felt when it was straight . i 'm there in that place now , and i want other women to be able to experience that too . that level of confidence , we call it genuine self-esteem -- the kind that does n't fluctuate .  there 's also a side benefit to all of that confidence , walton added .  accepting what your hair does naturally will help you attain a better quality of life ,  she said .  you can straighten your hair and do whatever you want to do , because we 're women ; we like to change it up . it 's that key of getting comfortable in your own skin . my quality of life has greatly improved now that my first thought and consideration is not my hair .  have you struggled with
