{"text": "i am covering the olympics for slate this year , and , as such , it 's my job to know what happens at the games as soon as it happens . no waiting for the tape-delay broadcast for me ; i wake at 4 a.m. to watch archery and stay in front of the screen until the sun sets on the british isles . what this means is that i have personally spoiled at least seven people 's enjoyment of the olympics by blabbing prematurely about who won what event .  did you see that michael phelps came in fourth ?  i ask .  no , you jerk , and thanks for ruining it for me . i was going to watch that tonight ,  they respond . for this and myriad other moments of spoiler-related thoughtlessness , i heartily apologize . and in order to make amends , i hereby offer 10 tips on what to do and how to prepare if you want to avoid having the games spoiled by careless obsessives like me . opinion : is it really #nbcfail ? 1 . the key to any good spoiler-avoidance strategy is practice . construct a training space in your basement or backyard , and prepare yourself for the challenges to come . see how long you can resist the urge to check your phone for swimming updates . practice walking with your fingers in your ears while shouting  i ca n't hear you ! i ca n't hear you !  2 . fun fact : casual commuting is responsible for 75 percent of sports spoilers . when you 're walking along the street or sitting on a subway , you often ca n't avoid overhearing other people talking about the games . so be sure to take the necessary precautions before you leave the house . map your route and follow it to the letter , making sure to gaze straight at the ground the entire way . some might recommend that you also don a heavy pair of earmuffs , but there 's no need for you to go outside looking like a freak . carrying around a portable white noise machine will be fine . 3 . your smartphone is your enemy during these next two weeks . if you carry it around , you will be tempted to check the internet , and you risk receiving spoiler-laden text messages from your gymnastics-loving friends . switch to an older phone for the duration of the olympics , preferably one that is decades old , is shaped like a brick and has a wan green display that can handle neither text messages nor the internet . you could also take this opportunity to rediscover the joys of pre-cellular communication devices . bag up some quarters and see if you can still find a working payphone . fire up your old cb radio . -lrb- nobody on the cb radio is talking about the olympics . they 're all talking about speed traps and convoys and such . -rrb- . twitter takes the olympic gold for speed . 4 . streamline your social media feeds . you can probably divide your facebook friends into  people who are likely to follow the olympics  and  people who are not .  hide all status updates from the olympics-following friends . this should leave you with a facebook feed composed entirely of elderly relatives , local merchants and new mothers posting photographs of their children . abandon twitter entirely , or , at the very least , unfollow everyone except jose canseco . 5 . implement and rigorously follow a household media blackout : no radio , no television , no newspapers , no internet , no virtual reality devices . mollify your children by telling them it 's dictionary month , and promise a handsome prize to whichever child memorizes the most words . if your spouse complains , cut her off by shouting irrationally  who did you marry : me or comcast ?! it 's like i do n't even know you anymore !  if a full-fledged media blackout is n't feasible , then at least limit yourself to the stations that are least likely to air anything having to do with modern times : the radio stations that play big band music and old-timey radio programs . on television , the tv stations that specialize in old reruns of  mama 's family .  6 . your friends and family are likely to try to spoil the olympics results for you . thus , it is critical that you do your best to alienate them for the duration of the olympics . avoid bathing and repel them with your hideous smell ; refuse to answer their phone calls , e-mail messages or direct questions . if they start talking about london , cut them off immediately with a brusque  i do n't want to hear anybody talking about the olympics . my grandfather died in a decathlon accident !  7 . the office is bound to be a prime place for olympics spoilers . stay away from the water cooler ; go thirsty if you must . arrive 10 minutes late for every meeting , to avoid any obnoxious spoiler-laden pre-meeting chatter . take the stairs instead of the elevator ; it 's better to be a bit winded than to risk picking up untimely information on those stupid elevator televisions they have . really , the best thing is to just not go to work for a couple of weeks . now 's the time to cash in those  olympics days  you 've been saving up . jobs give their workers olympics days , right ? day 4 : the best photos of the olympics . 8 . do n't go to the gym , either , because the gym is filled with armchair olympians who like nothing more than to discuss the day 's sporting events . do your exercising outdoors , instead . if you must visit the gym , be sure to only use the unpopular equipment , like jump ropes and medicine balls . and , for goodness sake , stay away from bars , because bars are a prime location for loose-lipped sports talkers . instead , you should drink alone at home . if you find yourself craving the tavern experience , all you need is some plywood , a few milk crates and a couple of cases of keystone , and , presto , you 'll have your own makeshift wet bar . -lrb- home improvement projects are easy ! -rrb- . 9 . if you are handy , you might consider building a cone of silence , like they used in the tv show  get smart .  this is basically just a hard plastic fishbowl that you wear over your head . -lrb- this will certainly stop you from hearing any spoilers , but also , if you wear it , you may asphyxiate . -rrb- . 10 . you know where nobody 's talking about the olympics ? in the forest . take these next two weeks as an opportunity to go back to nature . pitch a tent in the woods , and commune with the stars and the seedlings . bring a battery-powered television that gets only three channels , and fire it up every night around 7 . you 'll be able to watch the key moments of the games in peace and quiet . and , despite what you 've heard , it is quite unlikely that you 'll be eaten by a bear . photos : olympian outtakes . how are you avoiding spoilers during the olympic games ?
