{"text": "kanye west and the confederate battle flag . that 's the discussion . it 's not about race relations or a relic 's true meaning . it 's not about whether a group can co-opt a pejorative of which they 've historically been the butt and make it their own , much like the gay community did with  queer  or african-americans did with the n-word . no , the conversation is about west and that flag . the rapper thrust himself into the spotlight , yet again , with news that several pieces of merchandise from his yeezus tour are emblazoned with the controversial southern cross . at his tour store in los angeles , a replica of the flag is affixed to the wall with red tape and adorned with the words ,  i ai n't coming down .  twitter exploded after word got out , and while west saw some support , including a fellow who called him a  pro-black genius ,  others called him a disgrace . read one tweet ,  ye - thats stupid ! brother i marched to have that vile rag torn down from the state house grounds .  asked to explain the rationale for including the controversial symbol on his clothing , west told amp radio ,  the confederate flag represented slavery in a way . that 's my abstract take on what i know about it , right ? so i wrote the song , ` new slaves . ' so i took the confederate flag and made it my flag . it 's my flag now . now what you gon na do ?  he added later in the interview ,  it 's colorless also . it 's super - ` hood and super-white-boy-approved at the same time .  those are n't the words of someone seeking to further dialogue , said hip-hop historian and san francisco state adjunct professor dave  davey d  cook . it sounds more like a man courting controversy , especially when you consider the source .  kanye does n't move by accident . there 's definitely a level of publicity involved in this ,  cook said , adding that while west  built his career around controversy ,  no one should begrudge him selling anything that people are buying . green-lighting racism ? there are dangers , though , and cook worries that west has missed an opportunity to educate people on the flag 's symbolism . there 's also the chance he could embolden those who fly the flag with ill will toward blacks .  kanye runs the risk of green-lighting something that is overtly racist , and i do n't think he has any plan in mind on how to educate people ,  cook said .  the opportunity to educate people on the symbolism of that flag and the racism attached to it is there .  not everyone is holding west to such a standard .  he is an entertainer , for god 's sake . surprise , surprise . of course , it 's part of a publicity thing ,  said harvard university law professor randall kennedy , adding that that does n't preclude it from being useful , interesting or justifiable . kennedy , whose half dozen books on race include  nigger : the strange career of a troublesome word ,  said there are parallels between groups co-opting epithets and west co-opting the flag ,  but listen , n -- r is still a term of abuse used to terrify people and hurt people .  there are both positive and negative potential upshots to west 's campaign , kennedy said . if it lessens someone 's anxiety about seeing the flag or diminishes the symbol 's  power to intimidate ,  it 's a win , but if people forget what the flag stood for or become too ignorant about its meaning to counter claims that it 's merely a symbol of state 's rights , there could be detriment .  here were people who were willing to fight and die in order to enslave people , and that should n't be forgotten ,  kennedy said . cook said that if west wanted to meaningfully take on a hot-button social issue , there are more effective ways of doing it . he pointed to numerous examples in hip-hop : talib kweli has been outspoken on new york 's stop-and-frisk policy and florida 's  stand your ground  law ; rhymefest and immortal technique visited alabama in protest of the state 's immigration law ; and several rappers have penned thoughtful lyrics admonishing the prison-industrial complex .  it 'd be nice if kanye was doing town halls while he was on tour ,  cook said .  he 's in a position to do that . i 'm not sure if he really realizes it or wanted to go in that direction .  not a trailblazer . whatever west 's true intention , it 's worth noting , as kennedy pointed out , that west is n't the first person to do this . about a decade ago , a charleston , south carolina , clothing company called nu south featured designs with the southern cross in red , black and green , the colors of the pan-african flag . several rappers have also used the flag , including ludacris , david banner , pastor troy , lil jon and outkast , though cook is quick to point out ,  they 're not selling a flag . they were wearing it , so there 's a difference .  pastor troy wonders if west , who was born in atlanta but grew up in chicago and is about to move into a bel air mansion with fiance kim kardashian , understands how powerful the symbol is in the south . driving through south georgia during a phone interview , the atlanta rapper , whose real name is micah levar troy , said he had just been passed by a swamp boat , the entire hull of which bore the confederate flag , and he would remind west to be careful disrespecting things that others find sacred .  now , these are the ones kanye needs to be worried about . kanye ai n't waving that flag in front of them ,  he said .  be careful , kanye .  not that troy has n't used the flag on album covers and in videos , but  i was n't lifting it up to glorify it ,  he said , explaining he knew the ramifications of using the banner . to troy , the flag stood for rebellion , and he was being rebellious himself in flaunting it .  i was letting them know it was a new day down here in the south , from then to now . whoever would 've thought a black man could touch that flag without getting killed ?  he said . with west , troy said ,  it sounds more like a personal agenda , which you 're free to have . but make it make sense , as my dad used to say .  a complicated symbol . the rev. al sharpton shared what he felt the flag represented in a column last month :  the confederate flag symbolizes dehumanization , injustice and pain . it is a stark reminder of an era in our history that was defined by the abhorrent practice of slavery . and it is representative of a mentality that looked upon blacks as inferiors who needed to remain in the shackles of subservience .  yet that meaning is far from universal . in addition to the aforementioned state 's rights advocates , there are those who see it only as a symbol of southern pride or heritage . southern governors have risked boycott and ouster from office to keep it flying at state installations . meanwhile , president barack obama has said it belongs in a museum .  when people say that the confederate flag represents slavery , i ask them , ` if you look at the importation of slaves to the united states from africa , what flag did they fly under ? it was the united states flag ,  said george mason university 's walter williams , an economics professor who studies and writes about race .  people say , ` let 's get rid of the confederate flag because it 's a symbol of slavery . ' i say , ` what do we do with the american flag ? '  he said . williams does n't like hip-hop music , but that does n't mean it should be banned or removed from public view , just like the constitution should n't be outlawed because some people have visceral reactions to the second amendment , he said . while the nazis represented a  despicable  regime , it 's a  gross violation  of freedom of expression to ban anyone from displaying the nazi flag , williams said . to williams , it 's a matter of freedom of expression , the true test of which is not how one reacts when people  express themselves in ways you think they ought to express themselves , but when they express themselves in ways you find offensive .  while cook is n't wholly ruling out that west has a plan to stoke dialogue about the flag , he has n't seen it yet . if the  jesus walks  rapper is just engaging in naked profiteering , that 's fine , but cook said he hopes the flag 's true meaning and symbolism is n't lost or skewed in the flap .  you ca n't leave room for misinterpretation , or some people will take that to the bank ,  cook said .  he 's going to take some of this to the bank himself .  follow eliott c. mclaughlin on twitter : @cnnwriters .", "summary": " kanye west tells radio station that confederate flag represents slavery , so  it 's my flag now    experts say it 's at least part publicity stunt , but there is potential for meaningful dialogue .   rapper pastor troy wonders if west grasps flag 's symbolism , warns him ,  be careful , kanye    professor : it 's about freedom of expression ; we ca n't ban symbols we dislike .
