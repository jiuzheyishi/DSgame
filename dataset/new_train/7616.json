{"text": "hiding : julian assange and ecuador 's foreign minister ricardo patino greeted crowds from the embassy window last night . britain could be stuck with wikileaks fugitive julian assange for another nine years -- at a cost of # 40million -- william hague warned last night . the foreign secretary said assange could stay in his ecuadorian embassy bolt-hole until 2022 -- when the statute of limitations on his extradition request expires . the grim prediction means the suspected rapist could run up a # 40million policing bill as a team of officers guard the embassy day and night . the cost of keeping watch on him cast a shadow over talks between mr hague and his ecuadorian counterpart ricardo pantino yesterday . the two country 's governments agreed to set up a working group of officials to discuss the case , but whitehall officials said there was no sign of an end to the deadlock . diplomats said ecuador will not step back from its position that assange should be granted free passage to south america . this is unacceptable to britain because the law dictates he must be sent to sweden to answer rape charges . one senior source said officials were frustrated that ecuador will not budge from what the uk sees as an unjustifiable position . he said : ` assange is saying that he is prepared to stay for five years . ` but the statute of limitations for an extradition request is ten years , so they will be stuck with him in their embassy for nine more years . ` we had a routine exchange of views . they did n't bring anything new to the table . ecuador has not changed its position one bit since the day assange fled to them . ' mr patino said he had talked with assange until 4am yesterday and he was in ` good spirits ' . he added : ' i hope mr assange will not grow old and die in our embassy -- but we are defending human rights . ' assange , whose supporters fear he will be sent to the us to be charged over leaking diplomatic cables , entered the embassy in london on june 19 last year . a police team has been posted outside the embassy at a cost of # 11,000 a day in case he tries to escape , but assange shows no sign of walking out . insiders say he is up all night on the internet ` guzzling coke ' . a recent visitor said : ` he looks very thin and gaunt . it looks like he burns the candle at both ends . his skin almost appears bleached , almost transparent . ` it is obvious he has not seen any sunlight for a long time . if you ask him why he is still there , he will just mumble something back at you about  freedom  and his  principles  . ' support : a crowd gathered outside the embassy in london as the ecuadorian foreign minister visited mr assange nearly a year after he first went into hiding in the building . security : the police operation to guard the embassy and prevent mr assange from escaping has already cost more than # 3million . wanted : mr assange faces questioning in sweden over alleged sex offences but fears he will be extradited from there to the us over wikileaks . asylum : mr assange is currently being protected within the ecuadorian embassy in london but will be arrested and deported if he steps outside . last night the . australian , who is thought to have a personal fortune of # 1million , was . pictured smiling as he shook hands with mr patino before their meeting . he said : ` my situation here has been . physically difficult but the staff at the embassy have been really kind . and supportive despite the occasional entertainment outside , whether . they are people chanting or policeman coming down on ropes . ' after the meeting , he went on : ` the minister emphasised his government 's continued commitment to support and protect me . ` he set out how he and the ecuadorian government are actively seeking a solution to my present situation . ' i . remain immensely grateful to the support ricardo , president -lrb- rafael -rrb- . correa and the people of ecuador have shown me over the last year . ' mr . patino added : ' i have just finished meeting with julian assange who is . in good spirits despite the limitations of his accommodation . ' i was able to say face to face to him , . for the first time , that the government of ecuador remains firmly . committed to protecting his human rights and that we continue to seek . cast iron assurances to avoid any onward extradition to a third state . ` good spirits ' : mr patino said mr assange was doing well , as supporters marked the first anniversary of his stay at the embassy with balloons . ` during the meeting we were able to . speak about the increasing threats against the freedom of people to . communicate and to know the truth , threats which come from certain . states that have put all of humanity under suspicion . ' it . is believed at least three metropolitan police officers are on guard at . the embassy , which is on the second floor of a building near harrods in . knightsbridge , 24 hours a day . usually one officer stands on the steps outside , while one waits by the lifts in the communal foyer in case mr assange attempts to access the roof and escape by helicopter . another stands on an exterior staircase from where they can see the single bed where he sleeps . it is believed there are always other officers on standby near the embassy in case of any escape attempt .", "summary": " william hague and his ecuadorian counterpart failed to reach agreement on assange 's future as he marks first anniversary of stay at embassy this week .   he will be arrested and deported to sweden if he steps a foot outside .   the australian , 41 , is wanted for questioning over alleged sex offences .   fears deportation to us and trial over wikileaks if he goes to sweden .
