{"text": "while many people get their new year 's countdown clocks ready , jahi mcmath 's family is scrambling as a darker deadline looms . a judge 's ruling will allow a hospital to disconnect life support machines at 5 p.m. monday from the 13-year-old girl , whom doctors declared brain dead after she suffered complications from tonsil surgery earlier this month . jahi 's family , who wants to transfer her somewhere else , told cnn affiliate kgo that they spent sunday working the phones , trying to line up another option . the case has drawn national attention and sparked protests from some local leaders who say the hospital that treated her should have provided better care . medical ethicists , meanwhile , say the high-profile case fuels a misperception : that  brain death  is somehow not as final as cardiac death , even though , by definition , it is . the case is  giving the impression that dead people can come back to life ,  arthur caplan , director of the division of medical ethics at nyu langone medical center , told cnn last week . but jahi 's family members maintain that they 're hoping for a miracle and want to transfer the girl from children 's hospital oakland to another facility . a statement released by family members saturday and provided to kgo says they are weighing several options .  our attorney is in discussions with two facilities that have expressed preliminary approval for accepting jahi on a ventilator ,  the statement said .  one is in southern california , the other is in new york .  doug straus , an attorney representing children 's hospital oakland , said in a letter to the family 's lawyer sunday that officials are still awaiting specifics from the family .  to date , there has been no communication from any facility named by you regarding a transfer or requirements for transfer with any of the medical professionals at children 's . the family has not identified any facility with which children 's can have this dialogue . nor have we been provided with a transportation plan or coroner authorization ,  he wrote .  as your email and your statements about the facility in the los angeles area acknowledge , discussion about performing medical procedures upon a dead body presents unusual and complicated questions . until there is a definite commitment by a facility to accept jahi 's body upon specified terms , i do n't think i can tackle those issues . please let me know if the family is able to identify a facility .  when ` life support ' is really ` death support ' jahi was declared brain dead by doctors at the hospital on december 12 , three days after tonsil surgery . family members and hospital officials fought over her future in court . last week , a judge ruled she was brain dead and urged both sides to work together to resolves the situation . but the sparring showed no sign of slowing over the weekend , with family members sharply criticizing the hospital 's handling of the matter .  we wish to acknowledge that jahi 's case , and our stance regarding her right to life , and her mother 's right to make decisions regarding her child , has stirred a vibrant , sometimes polarizing , national debate . this was never our intention ,  the family 's statement said .  we have our strong religious convictions and set of beliefs and we believe that , in this country , a parent has the right to make decisions concerning the existence of their child : not a doctor who looks only at lines on a paper , or reads the cold black and white words on a law that says ` brain dead ' and definitely not a doctor who runs the facility that caused the brain death in the first place .  the hospital 's statement sunday said they were supporting jahi 's family .  we continue to do so despite their lawyer 's criticizing the very hospital that all along has been working hard to be accommodating to this grieving family ,  the hospital said . when routine surgeries go wrong . cnn 's janet digiacomo , elizabeth landau , dana ford , dan simon , michael martinez and carma hassan contributed to this report .", "summary": " jahi mcmath 's family wants to transfer her to another facility .   the 13-year-old suffered complications after tonsil surgery .   doctors and a judge have declared her brain dead .
