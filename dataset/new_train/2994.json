{"text": "the next time you step foot on a golf course , beware the legal minefield that can await you . if the game was not difficult enough already , it has a well-deserved reputation of being the most litigious of all sports , bar none . the cases that come to court cover the full spectrum of grievances and bizarre incidents , from the elderly irish pensioner suing his former golf club for cutting -- yes cutting -- his handicap , to two-time major winner rory mcilroy going legal in a high-stakes wrangle over his multimillion-dollar deal with nike . from players tripping over rabbit holes , to a pair of new york doctors involved in a landmark legal action after one of them was blinded by the other 's errant shot . it all backs up the main thrust of a publication from 2007 by craig brown , a law professor at the university of western ontario in canada .  golf and the law seem to have been made for each other ,  he wrote in  why lawyers love golf .   on every fairway , in every stretch of rough , in every clubhouse , in every golf bag , at every swing at the ball , in every set of plans for a new course , in every application for club membership , there lurks a potential lawsuit .  dalton floyd jr. of south carolina 's floyd law firm has made a 40-year-plus career of handling such cases . he gives an example where neither the claimant nor the appellant were left with a good leg to stand on : .  a lady and her husband were walking from the tee to her golf cart . in a freak accident she stood on a piece of unmade ground and contrived to rupture her achilles tendon ,  he told cnn .  both her and husband were keen line dancers , could n't take part in the activity for months and brought a claim on that basis . the club had to settle .  golfing mousetraps . it highlighted the fact that golf clubs have to think very carefully about every area of their activity because there are mousetraps everywhere , in the legal sense . most golf holes have yardage markers dotted on the fairway to let golfers know how far they are from the green , the most common at 150 yards out . but they had better make sure they are accurate .  a golfer hit the ball onto a green and hit a player who was waiting to putt ,  recalls floyd .  the golfer hitting the shot claimed the yardage markers put out by the course were inaccurate and he thought the green was further away and out of his reach .  the club had to settle the claim because they were liable .  and beware the hasty and ill-thought-out redesign of a golf course , says floyd .  a club in hilton head cut down trees on the left of a dogleg hole , which meant a lot of balls ended up in a big condominium . the owners were not happy and the club was held liable and had to settle .  serious injury . while it is easy to poke fun at some of the claims , others are for serious injury sustained in the course of playing the sport . as cnn reported in 2010 , being hit by a poor shot while playing is a risk golfers assume and this was backed up by new york 's highest court in a key ruling . playing at a course in long island , anoop kapoor hit a shot which struck his fellow doctor azad anand in the left eye . anand was blinded after the incident and launched a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against kapoor for damages , alleging his friend was negligent for failing to warn of the shot . kapoor testified he thought anand was behind him and that he did n't see anyone between him and the hole when he took his shot . kapoor unintentionally sliced it , striking anand with terrible consequences . floyd says most claims of this nature are dismissed :  thank goodness the courts have an understanding that you ca n't hit the ball straight all the time , particularly the amateur golfer .  i think generally we get good decisions from judges because they understand golf is a sport and there is a certain amount of risk when you play .  but that did not stop 15-year-old alex good of hillsboro , oregon from suing a local golf course for negligence after he hit himself in the eye with his own ball while on its driving range . according to court documents , good and his high school teammates were using the practice range . it was raining and the staff at pumpkin ridge put up an awning . when good teed off , his ball hit a metal post that was holding up the awning just inches in front of his driving mat . the ball ricocheted off and hit him in the left eye . good 's lawyer claimed pumpkin ridge should have known that the metal pole was a danger . pumpkin ridge did not respond to cnn 's enquiries about the current status of the suit . costly repair . during the economic downturn , even well-to-do golfers have felt the pinch , says floyd , but he warns against what one did to save a few dollars : repairing your own clubs . he cites the case of a player who took his tee shot -- then the head of the repaired club flew off and got stuck in his playing partner 's knee . painful for the claimant -- and costly for the do-it-yourself golfer , who was forced to settle the claim . it 's not a position in which former world no. 1 mcilroy should ever find himself , but he is embroiled in a very public legal dispute with his former management agency over its role in his contracts with nike and other key sponsors . the 24-year-old from northern ireland claims he was misled over the terms of the deals and is seeking compensation . the agent , conor ridge , and the management company horizon sports deny the claim and are counter suing in a case which is slated for the courts in october 2014 . mcilroy , whose form has slumped since signing the big-money deals , admitted that it had taken a toll .  i 've seen more lawyers ' offices and more lawyers this year than i care to see in my entire life ,  he told reporters at the world tour championship in dubai last month . angry tiger . he also said he was taking advice from nike stablemate tiger woods on how to deal with these pressures , although the world no. 1 himself is at the center of a controversy which threatens to end in a lawsuit . in a published article grading the tour performance of top players , former pga pro and now analyst brandel chamblee flunked woods , questioning his integrity and saying that he had been  a little cavalier with the rules .  as evidence , he cited three instances where woods had been penalized for rules infractions and a fourth where an nbc analyst questioned the drop that woods made after his ball landed in a water hazard . woods ' agent mark steinberg responded angrily over a  shameful , baseless  report and said he was considering a legal action for damages . mcilroy will doubtless take his own counsel but might look no further than the fate that befell a 75-year-old amateur golfer from across the border in the republic of ireland . handicap blues . thomas talbot , a retired insurance official , was left with a massive legal bill in excess of $ 500,000 after launching an action against his former club because it had cut his handicap . this would normally be a cause for celebration , but talbot took it as a slight , particularly as a court in dublin heard he was accused of  handicap building  -- or allegedly playing below his ability to get his handicap raised and thereby be able to win more competitions . talbot sued the hermitage golf club and its former handicap secretary in the irish high court for defamation , but a judge found against him last year and he has been left with heavy costs . golf for a long time was a male-dominated sport but as more women started taking part , clubs which restricted membership came under the legal spotlight for alleged discriminatory practices . federal law in the united states now requires clubs open to the public to admit women , but augusta national , home of the u.s. masters tournament , was a private club and adopted a strict male-only membership policy for 80 years . that suddenly changed in august 2012 , when it announced it would admit its first two female members , former u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice and business leader darla moore . the volte face came without ever reaching a court of law , but rather thanks to the tireless efforts of women 's rights activist martha burk and reported pressure from key sponsors . discrimination suits also extended to the top level of men 's professional golf when casey martin , a former stanford university teammate of woods , took out a case against the pga tour . martin suffers from a debilitating leg deformity that obstructs blood flow back to his heart . having qualified for the full pga tour in 2000 , martin wanted to use a golf cart in tournaments , but was refused permission by tour officials . martin took a lawsuit on grounds of disability discrimination and finally won his battle in the supreme court . but he was unable to capitalize on his early promise and dropped off the tour , although he was a surprise qualifier for the 2012 u.s. open . trump challenge . no article about lawsuits in golf would be complete without mention of u.s. tycoon donald trump and his battles to complete a $ 1 billion development in northern scotland . he faced down opposition from locals and environmental groups , including a lawsuit from an 86-year-old pensioner , to get permission to build his championship course on protected sand dunes in aberdeenshire . but having built the course , now trump himself has gone legal after the scottish government gave planning permission to a massive offshore wind farm just off the coast -- and within sight of his new resort . trump has called the 11 turbine scheme a  useless and grotesque blot on our heritage  and has launched a lawsuit to attempt to stop it . the scottish government , led by first minister alex salmond , wants all the country 's electricity demands to be met from renewable sources by 2020 and is vigorously defending its decision in the court case , which started november 12 in edinburgh .", "summary": " golf has a reputation for being one of the most litigious sports .   cases range from the seemingly absurd to the serious .   rory mcilroy involved in legal action against former management company .   donald trump suing the scottish government over an offshore wind farm .
