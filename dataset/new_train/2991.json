{"text": "on april 28 , 2003 , apple threw open the virtual doors to its itunes store , and music -- all digital media , really -- has n't been the same since . suddenly , an industry terrified of online piracy had a legitimate place to earn money from the sale of digital music . listeners no longer had to drive to their neighborhood record store -lrb- remember those ? -rrb- to buy that new album by norah jones or 50 cent . a song cost only 99 cents , a bargain next to an $ 18 cd . and itunes-powered ipods , with their signature white earbuds , became a must-have mobile accessory . not everyone was thrilled . record labels grumbled at being strong-armed over song prices by apple ceo steve jobs . some musicians complained that they did n't earn enough royalties from digital-music sales . but by 2010 , itunes was the largest music retailer on the planet . today , it has 435 million registered users in 119 countries and recently served up its 25 billionth song , downloaded by a man in germany . itunes also now sells much more than music : customers can download movies , tv shows , games , books , podcasts and more . in recent months , apple 's retail juggernaut has shown signs of weakness . recent figures show that its growth may finally be slowing down . and services such as pandora , spotify , rdio and others , which allow users to stream songs for free or a modest monthly fee , are supplanting itunes among many young listeners . but its arrival 10 years ago this week was a sea change for anyone who makes , distributes or enjoys listening to music . cnnmoney : the evolution of itunes . here 's a look at some ways itunes changed music , and us : . it celebrated the song , not the album . thanks to itunes , all of a sudden , you did n't have to buy that chumbawamba record to get  tubthumping  -lrb- the  i get knocked down  song -rrb- . you could cherry-pick whatever songs you wanted instead of paying extra for the filler on an album or -- heaven forbid -- for a cd single . and sure enough , sales of songs far outpace sales of whole albums on itunes . one downside of this is that artists have less incentive to make thematic concept albums . it 's hard to envision what the impact of  sgt. pepper  or  ok computer  might have been in the itunes era . it rewarded impatience . here 's the way it used to work : you 'd hear a song on the radio . you 'd have to figure out what it was -lrb- a challenge in the days before shazam -rrb- . you 'd drive to a mall . you 'd search for the record . you 'd buy the record -- if it was in stock . you 'd put it in your cd player or on your turntable . finally , you 'd get to listen . now : hear song , download song . instant gratification . if the internet has made the world 's knowledge accessible to almost anybody with a computer , itunes has done the same with music . according to apple , the itunes store now stocks more than 26 million songs , many of which are n't about taylor swift 's ex-boyfriends . now , whether it 's javanese gamelan music or 13th-century christmas tunes , it 's all at our fingertips -- and we can sample it immediately . kids , you 've got no excuse . it killed the mixtape . ahh , those lovingly made aural valentines , filled with oh-so-cool jams sure to impress your romantic interest or hipster friend . so fun to make , not always so fun to receive . sound quality ? eh , it 's good enough . throughout the history of recorded music , the idea was usually to improve sound quality . as music went from scratchy cylinders to 78s to lps to cds , there was usually a corresponding leap in audio excellence . but the digital formats available from itunes , which compress audio files to make them easier to download , are a step down from cd quality . and you know what ? outside of audiophiles , nobody cares . the itunes store and its digital brethren have helped clear the way for the  good enough  society . those smartphone photos ? not as good as a digital camera 's but good enough . that netbook ? not as powerful as a laptop but good enough . convenience almost always wins . as wired 's robert capps wrote ,  having it here and now is more important than having it perfect .  it killed album art . this week , storm thorgerson died . you probably do n't know his name , but you know his work : thorgerson was a graphic artist who designed album covers for pink floyd , led zeppelin and 10cc , among many others . you may also have seen thorgerson 's shrunken covers on itunes , where they have no more heft than an app icon . the song is the thing in the itunes world , and that means there 's less importance for the kind of artwork thorgerson did -- which , in its 12-by-12-inch lp album cover form , was sometimes more impressive than the music it housed . yes , itunes offers booklets , images , videos and movies , but you ca n't frame those and hang them on a dorm room wall ... or use them to spread out , uh , study accessories . it made apps mainstream . until july 2008 , apps were just something you ate before the main course . then came the app store , a specialty shop inside the larger itunes department store , and apple 's iconic  there 's an app for that  campaign . soon , every early adopter was waving around their iphone , boasting about all the apps they 'd loaded onto it and slinging virtual birds at virtual pigs . the ipad only accelerated this trend . in january , apple announced that more than 40 billion apps had been downloaded from its online store . ` all together now ' a small minority of artists have refused to sell their music on itunes . but one group in particular was unmoved by the move to digital downloads : the beatles . thanks to legal disputes and sonic concerns , for more than seven years , the fab four -lrb- and their many representatives -rrb- resisted calls to transfer their prized catalog to itunes , leaving music fans stuck with their old-fashioned cds , lps and reel-to-reel tapes . that finally changed in 2010 , when the beatles ' apple corps joined with apple 's core music distribution product . -lrb- yes , the use of the name  apple  was another part of the dispute . -rrb- since then , the two have  come together  to the benefit of both . in the first week of availability , itunes sold 450,000 beatles albums and more than 2 million beatles songs . ` curse you , itunes !!!!!!!! ' despite its hundreds of millions of users , itunes has its critics . it 's become one of the most unpopular programs apple offers . it 's slow to load , it 's a memory hog , and it likes to update seemingly every day .  wo n't someone take itunes out back and shoot it ?  slate 's farhad manjoo asked in an article as itunes 11 was released .  each new upgrade brings more suckage into your computer .  apple fanboys wait excitedly for most new apple products . but for itunes ? not so much . and then there 's this : legally , you do n't own the songs you download on itunes ; you simply own the right to play them on your devices . so it might be a good idea to hang on to those old lps and cds -- and leave your passwords in your will .", "summary": " apple 's itunes store launched april 28 , 2003 .   by 2010 , itunes was the largest music retailer on the planet .   despite some gripes , itunes was a perfect fit for our instant-gratification culture .   services such as pandora and spotify are supplanting itunes among young listeners .
