{"text": "a utah couple is facing a $ 3,500 fine and a damaged credit score for doing what many people do after a bad purchasing experience : posting an online review . their story -- first reported by cnn 's affiliate in salt lake city kutv -- started in 2008 when john palmer bought his wife christmas gifts off kleargear.com . the items never arrived and the palmers said the transaction was automatically canceled .  after 30 days , paypal said ` hey , there 's no activity here ' and they turned around and gave the money back into my husband 's account and effectively canceled the sale ,  jen palmer told cnn . after repeated calls to kleargear.com to find out what happened , jen palmer posted a review of the company on ripoffreport.com saying in part ,  there is absolutely no way to get in touch with a physical human being . no extensions work .  web 's black market peddles drugs , guns . more than three years later , the palmers received an e-mail appearing to be from kleargear.com stating that they would be fined $ 3,500 if the negative review posted on ripoffreport.com was n't taken down within 72 hours .  we were shocked that someone would attempt to do this because it 's ridiculous that anyone would turn around and try to extort us like this ,  jen palmer said . button lets kids remove online posts they regret . the e-mail cited an obscure non-disparagement clause in the terms of use contract that states :  your acceptance of this sales contract prohibits you from taking any action that negatively impacts kleargear.com .  the palmers say this clause was added after they purchased the items , citing their 2008 customer agreement which they found . legal experts warn that more and more companies are adding this type of language in the fine print as protection .  the first amendment does not protect certain kinds of free speech and you can sign a contract giving away your free speech ,  according to cnn legal analyst paul callan . he said he believes kleargear.com 's terms of use contract is not fair and would likely be thrown out by the court . study : 15 % of american adults are not online . the palmers tried to take down their online review , but could n't because ripoffreport.com requires the company to enter into arbitration to have a post removed , which would cost $ 2,000 , and kleargear.com refused . so kleargear.com reported the palmers ' $ 3,500 unpaid fine to a collections company . after that , jen palmer said the couple had trouble getting approved for financing because their credit score took a huge hit . cnn e-mailed kleargear.com and tried multiple phone numbers listed on its website . no one responded back and all the numbers were disconnected . kleargear.com did respond via e-mail to kutv , defending its actions , referring to its  terms of sale ,  and saying its request that jen palmer remove her post was not blackmail but a  diligent effort to help them avoid -lrb- the fine -rrb- .  holiday shoppers pledge to buy american . the better business bureau is investigating kleargear.com separately and has put the company on alert . kleargear.com is n't the only company with a so-called non-disparagement clause in its customer agreement terms . cnn found a similar clause on a vacation rental company , shoredreams.net , that threatens a charge of up to $ 10,000 for online reviews containing  unreasonable negative sentiment .  after a cnn report about the clause aired , the company removed it from its terms and conditions , citing customer feedback . a spokeswoman for shoredreams.net explained that the non-disparagement clause was intended to provide protection against customers who demand compensation by threatening unreasonable negative reviews after leaving a unit . the company adds it has never imposed a fine on a customer for violating the clause . since the palmers ' story first surfaced , a wave of outrage has made its way across the internet against kleargear.com and as a result , the company has since protected its twitter account and shut down its facebook page , according to techcrunch.com . the palmers say they 're taking their fight all the way to court .  we do n't want them to get away with this ,  jen palmer said .  we are apparently not the only ones that they have done this to , but we are the only ones who are fighting back . and we 're not giving up .  during this busy online shopping season , retail analysts suggest you take steps to protect yourself by taking the time to read the fine print and ensure a company is legitimate before buying a product online . and if you do write a negative review , make sure it 's accurate because you could be sued for libel even if the company does n't have a non-disparagement clause , according to cnn legal expert paul callan .", "summary": " a utah man purchased online gifts , but they never came .   after getting no response from the company , his wife posted a negative
