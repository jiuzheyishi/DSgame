{"text": "beijing china has arrested a pro-democracy activist , the latest detention in the government 's effort to prevent the arab world 's  jasmine revolution  from spreading into china , a human rights group said wednesday . zhu yufu , a longtime activist and a founder of the china democracy party , is accused of  inciting subversion of state power ,  the group chinese human rights defenders said . zhu is at least the fourth activist reported to be arrested and accused of that crime in recent weeks . amnesty international said ding mao , ran yunfei and chen wei were formally arrested between march 25 and march 28  and could face lengthy prison terms .   since an anonymous online call on 17 february to stage a ` jasmine revolution ' in china more than a hundred activists , many of them active on twitter and blogs , have been detained , put under surveillance or illegal house arrest , or have simply gone missing ,  amnesty said in a report this week .  moreover , at least a dozen lawyers say they have been briefly detained and pressured by the authorities not to take up cases defending those detained , and even told by police to stop tweeting about the detained people .  cnn 's call to china 's ministry of foreign affairs on wednesday evening was not immediately returned .  china is a country ruled by law , and chinese citizens are supposed to conduct their businesses within the framework of china 's constitution and laws ,  much like the united states , wang baodong , spokesman for the chinese embassy in washington , wrote in an e-mail . .  no one is allowed to enjoy privileged rights above the law , no matter who you are and what high positions you hold .  in recent years , he said , about a dozen high-ranking chinese government officials per year have been prosecuted and punished  because of their unlawful activities such as corruption and election manipulations , which rarely catches the attention of the american media . we hope that the western media will take an objective and fair attitude toward china 's human rights situation , which has been constantly improving .  last week , china denied reports that a dissident artist was being held due to his calls for reform . the government insisted that ai weiwei was being investigated for economic crimes .  it has nothing to do with human rights or freedom of expression ,  ministry spokesman hong lei told reporters during a regular weekly briefing . gao ying , ai 's mother , told cnn that she is very worried .  there is nowhere i can ask about his whereabouts ,  she said .  i would sell my house -lrb- for the money -rrb- to go to court if necessary ... i will go to the prison with him . i would die there with him .  if this is an economic crime case , why did it need so many policemen ?  she asked .  why did they raid his studio , why everyone is now under close supervision ? is it worthwhile ? this is very stupid .  ai , one of the country 's best-known artists , helped design the bird 's nest stadium for the beijing olympics , but he later called for a boycott of the 2008 games because , he said , china was using them as propaganda . he has also accused the chinese government of trying to silence dissidents . zhu yufu is  the first individual outside of sichuan province to be formally arrested as part of the ` jasmine revolution ' crackdown ,  chinese human rights defenders -lrb- chrd -rrb- said . he previously spent seven years in prison for  subversion of state power  following a 1998 crackdown on the china democracy party , and he was imprisoned again between 2007 and 2009 , the china-based group said . chrd also said beijing-based housing rights activist ni yulan and her husband dong jiqin , missing since april 7 , had been detained . the u.s. state department human rights report on china for 2010 , published last week , says ,  a negative trend in key areas of the country 's human rights record continued , as the government took additional steps to rein in civil society , particularly organizations and individuals involved in rights advocacy and public interest issues , and increased attempts to limit freedom of speech and to control the press , the internet and internet access .  efforts to silence political activists and public interest lawyers were stepped up , and increasingly the government resorted to extralegal measures including enforced disappearance , ` soft detention , ' and strict house arrest , including house arrest of family members , to prevent the public voicing of independent opinions . public interest law firms that took on sensitive cases also continued to face harassment , disbarment of legal staff , and closure .  during a visit to washington in january . chinese president hu jintao acknowledged that  a lot still needs to be done  about human rights in his country . he added ,  china also respects the universality of human rights , but at the same time we also believe we need to take into account the differences in culture when talking about human rights .
