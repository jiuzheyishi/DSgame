{"text": " hi i 'm mindy grossman . i 'm a mom , a wife , the ceo of hsni but most of all i 'm a disruptor .  mindy grossman has been the driving force behind making the home shopping network both hip and profitable , by bringing in celebrities from jessica simpson to p. diddy and boosting sales dramatically . digital sales now account for approximately 45 % of hsni 's -lrb- hsn and cornerstone -rrb- total revenues , according to forbes . cnn 's isha sesay finds out how she did it and what inspires her . upbringing . isha sesay : you did n't study fashion , so how did you get into this business ? mindy grossman : i probably have one of the most unconventional career paths ever . my parents married young but were n't able to have children so my father 's boss in the produce business lent them the money to adopt me . i felt a real responsibility to be the first one to go to college , and the first one to be successful . i grew up very fast , i took things very seriously . i graduated high school at 16 and went to college , determined to be an attorney . i also got engaged very young , at 19 . but when i was in my last semester of senior year of college i realized i was leading someone else 's life and i was n't really recognizing things that were inside me that were really important . creativity and curiosity and really experiencing things . i moved to new york and was offered a job working for a company called manhattan international . it was a menswear conglomerate at the time , working for the president of their international division . i was 20 . early on i was told i could do anything i wanted to do . it was n't an issue being a woman or not coming from a wealthy family , and that is what always inspired me . the vision . is : how was it perceived when you first joined hsn in 2006 ? mg : it was definitely an interesting time . i spent the first 18 years of my career in the menswear industry . when i started polo jeans , which was my startup experience , and then i went to nike , so those were somewhat difference transitions . when it was announced that i was leaving nike , to go to what at the time was called iac retail , it was n't exactly looked at as aspirational . is : but why was it so attractive to you ? mg : because i had seen the world changing . i had the opportunity to be traveling globally , to japan to china , latin america . i saw the wave of growth of mobile interaction in japan that was n't even glistening here at that time . how people were interfacing with brands . how technology was going to change things , how content was becoming power . so i knew that there was something there and i thought this could be part of it . i was at home watching hsn , keeping an eye on the competition but i 'm also food network lover . i remember my husband saying  what are you doing  and i said  i 'm trying to see what 's gon na click  . all of a sudden i saw wolfgang puck -- who was engaging and entertaining and he was n't selling . he was inspiring and engaging customers and they wanted to buy his product because of that . the next day i went and had lunch with chairman barry diller at the four seasons and kind of laid out this vision . and what 's wonderful , in pure barry fashion he was like , go forth . and you know - i jumped in . is : do you shop at hsn ? mg : i 'm going to tell you the truth . my husband once burst out laughing and i said what 's so funny . he said you just got a letter from yourself for being one of the best customers at hsn ! is : how much do you buy ? mg : i think i might be one of , if not the biggest jewelry customers . i believe that the reason that i really understand our consumer is i am her . i love the thrill of it , i love discovery , i love the story behind what i 'm buying . you can walk with me in my home and i will tell you the story of where i found that chair and how i found that chair and every single piece . the celeb factor . is : part of the reason for your success has been you attracting major celebrities and their brands and bringing them to hsn . why has it done so well ? mg : one of the things that we said early on is if we 're going to have credibility in this idea of editorial program commerce , we need every one of the individuals that come to hsn , they have to have a great product , a great story and be a great storyteller . it 's about the story , so if you look at our recent 100 foot journey or maleficent with our disney partnership , those are things that can transport people they can feel they 're part of that journey and then they can be inspired to want the product , and that 's what we 're trying to do . the challenges . is : what are some of the challenges you 've faced in your time here ? mg : the challenge was getting people to embrace the new , and dealing with being dismissed . it hurts because you take it personally , but it makes you stronger . i 'll never forget when i first went to some fancy cocktail party in new york , somebody said asked what i did , and i said i was the ceo of iac retail and we have hsn , and they go -lrb- whispering -rrb-  i 've shopped on hsn  and i go ,  why are you whispering ?!  but it was a very sobering experience and one that really , reinforced my belief of how to behave , as a leader as an individual . inspire : actress who became nasa 's ` secret weapon '", "summary": " mindy grossman is the ceo of a tv shopping network .   she changed people 's view of home shopping with celebrity endorsements .   she cites risk taking and being your own customer as keys to her success .
