{"text": "the sun is not yet up over the desert , but already 50 horses and riders are gathered at qatar 's endurance village in al-wakra , half an hour 's drive from the capital doha . they are gathered to compete in a 120-kilometer -lrb- 74.5-mile -rrb- endurance race , the likes of which are held here most weeks . masked riders gaze steely-eyed into the desert as their horses crest their necks and paw the ground , eager to get the race under way . the starter counts down in arabic , and the horses and riders surge over the starting line , galloping into the pitch-black desert with their high-held tails streaming behind them . hot on their heels a fleet of land cruisers hares after them across the sand , the glare of their headlights creating a moving oasis of light . these are the support vehicles from which the owners , trainers and managers can observe the race in progress and shout instructions . today , the horses will complete laps of a 30 km -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- course , stopping for checks at the end of each lap . any horse deemed unfit to continue the race will be eliminated at each check point . they will travel at speeds of up to 40 km per hour -lrb- 25 mph -rrb- for around eight hours . of the 50 who started the race , fewer than a quarter will complete it . most of the horses are pure-breed arabians who are revered in islamic culture , prized for their beauty , intelligence and , above all , their endurance . it was the arabian horse that formed the genetic blueprint for the modern racehorse , with every modern thoroughbred tracing its dna to just three  original  oriental stallions imported to the uk in the 18th century . some say the arabian horse was a gift to mankind from allah . the ancient breed is supremely well-adapted to the unforgiving desert terrain of the middle east . many of these animals are ex-racehorses , gradually trained and brought up to fitness to compete in endurance races . although the sport is ancient in its origins , today 's races are as professional as they are competitive , with horses conditioned to the peak of fitness and subject to rigorous veterinary inspections both during and after the race . at each stage 's completion , the horses are doused with water and their heart rates measured . a team of veterinarians inspects each horse thoroughly before it is allowed to continue the race . the number of competitors is gradually whittled down until only the very fittest are left to contest the final laps . endurance is taken seriously in this part of the world : many of the horses are owned by members of the qatari and dubai royal families . one such owner is sheikh maktoum , ruler of dubai . his son sheikh rashid is a champion endurance rider in his own right who is competing here today .  i 've been riding since i was 11 years old and doing endurance since 2006 ,  he said during an inspection .  some people in my family are more into flat racing -lrb- his father owns one of the most important thoroughbred racing operations in the world -rrb- , some are more into endurance racing . i actually started with polo but then i was attracted by endurance and i loved it . hopefully i will be doing it for the rest of my life .  unfortunately for sheikh rashid , he and his striking grey horse are eliminated after the penultimate lap . but is it one of his compatriots from dubai who claims first place in a sprint finish with another rider . they are among only a handful of riders to complete the grueling course . the enduring appeal of such a sport is easy to understand ; physically and strategically demanding , it is also an expression of the extreme respect with which horses -- particularly arabian ones -- are treated in this part of the world . muslims were told that if they treated these precious horses with love and respect , they would be handsomely rewarded , both in their earthly life and beyond . while the winning rider accepts this congratulations from the crowd , his horse -- a magnificent chestnut with the dish-shaped face and high tail carriage characteristic of the breed -- is handed to a team of grooms to be looked after . with a last look back over his shoulder as he is led away , the horse flares his nostrils and whinnies , a final call to the desert from whence he came .", "summary": " the ancient tradition of desert racing continues in the united arab emirates .   the 50 horses and riders set off , completing laps of the 30-kilometer course .   the horses are given thorough medical checks after each lap to ensure they are healthy .   only a handful of the horses competing make it to the finish line in qatar .
