{"text": "some of the world 's oldest and rarest bibles and biblical texts were placed online tuesday in newly digitized form by two of the world 's most venerable libraries . the project , which aims to make 1.5 million pages of ancient texts freely available in virtual form over the next three years , is a joint effort by the bodleian libraries at oxford university and the vatican library . the project is focused on three main areas : ancient greek manuscripts , hebrew manuscripts and 15th-century printed books , known as incunabula . they will include secular and religious texts . for its online launch , however , the organizers have highlighted a smaller group of bibles and biblical commentaries , each of which has been chosen for its particular historical importance . they include a copy of a gutenberg bible , the first major book printed with moveable metal type in the western world , and the beautiful woodcuts of a bible printed in 1478-1479 in cologne , known as stamp . ross . 283 . the four-year project , which began in 2012 , is funded by a 2 million pound -lrb- nearly $ 3.3 million -rrb- award from the polonsky foundation , a charity that supports higher education and research . dr. leonard polonsky , in a video clip posted on the project 's website , said that it would ensure that fragile texts that  should be part of the inheritance of mankind  were safeguarded for future generations .  it 's too dangerous to have unique exemplars of anything in one place ,  he said .  digitizing enables us to secure all of this material and of course make it broadly available . it 's an opportunity you ca n't resist .  the archbishop of canterbury , justin welby , said ,  where you can see these actual texts there is just a lifting of the spirit , something that inspires worship .  the project is of  huge international significance ,  he said , because a far wider range of scholars than before will now be able to see the texts . conservation staff at the bodleian and vatican libraries have worked together to ensure the ancient documents are not exposed to any harm in the digitization process , a news release from the bodleian libraries said . scholars will be able to zoom in on texts and images to study them more closely .  i envision how useful it will be to scholars and many other interested people ,  monsignor cesare pasini , the prefect of the vatican library , is quoted as saying .  moreover , i see the common fruit of our labor as a very positive sign of collaboration and sharing that is a trademark of the world of culture .  rare psalm book sells for $ 14.2 million .", "summary": " the bodleian and vatican libraries are digitizing rare and ancient texts in a joint project .   the texts will be freely available online for anyone who wants to look at them .   they include greek and hebrew manuscripts and early printed books .
