{"text": "sudan 's foreign ministry denied published reports that a woman sentenced to death for refusing to renounce her christian faith is expected to be released . foreign ministry spokesman abubakar al-sidiq said that he is not aware of any plans to release mariam yahya ibrahim before a ruling from an appeals court . ibrahim was condemned to die by hanging after she declined to profess she is a muslim , the religion of her father . sharia law considers her a muslim and does not recognize her marriage to a christian . she is unlikely to change her mind despite giving birth in prison , says her husband daniel wani , who also is a christian . some western media outlets have reported that ibrahim would be released in a few days , but her husband said that only the appeals court could free his wife .  i 'm not aware that any release is imminent ,  wani told cnn . technically , the president of sudan can not pardon her , so the judiciary might be the only way out for the government , which is coming under increased international pressure to release ibrahim . the court convicted her of apostasy and adultery two weeks ago . at the time , she was eight months pregnant . she gave birth to a baby girl this week at a khartoum prison , where she 's detained with martin , her 20-month-old son . despite languishing in prison with two infants , she 's holding firm to her beliefs , according to her husband .  there is pressure on her from muslim religious leaders that she should return to the faith ,  wani told cnn in a tv exclusive .  she said , ` how can i return when i never was a muslim ? yes , my father was a muslim , but i was brought up by my mother . '  wani said his wife is a practicing christian , more so than him , and even had their son baptized .  i know my wife . she 's committed ,  he said .  even last week , they brought in sheikhs and she told them , ` i 'm pretty sure i 'm not going to change my mind . '  wani , who is a u.s. citizen , said he is thrilled about his new daughter but hopes her birth does n't hasten his wife 's death sentence . in past cases involving pregnant or nursing women , sudan waited until the mother had weaned her child before executing any sentence . sharia law as practiced in sudan prohibits carrying out the death sentence on an expectant woman until two years after she gives birth . cnn sought comment from the sudanese government and was directed to the justice ministry . a cnn request for an interview was denied , and the justice minister said they do n't comment on such matters because a final judgment has not yet been issued . an attempt to contact sudan 's foreign affairs minister for comment was unsuccessful . woman raised as christian , husband says . ibrahim , 27 , was arrested after muslim relatives accused her of renouncing her religion . their complaint alleged that she went missing for years , and her family was shocked to find out she married a christian , according to her attorney , mohamed jar elnabi . wani said he 'd never met the relatives who made the accusations . his wife , he said , was raised a christian by her mother , an ethiopian orthodox , after her muslim father deserted the family when ibrahim was 6 .  these people filed charges claiming that she was their sister and filed a police report saying that she had disappeared ,  he said . at first , ibrahim was charged with adultery for marrying a christian . the apostasy accusation was added after she maintained she was a christian , according to her husband .  the police originally called for the case to be dismissed , but these people went back and added another charge ... which is adultery , by saying she was their sister and a muslim . it is illegal for a muslim woman to marry a christian man , therefore we were brought before the court .  she 's been detained since january 17 , he said . in addition to the emotional turmoil resulting from the conviction , the couple also have to worry about their children , wani said .  an illegitimate marriage does not result in legally recognized offspring , which means that my son and the new baby are no longer mine ,  he said . wani 's physical condition makes the ordeal even harder . he uses a wheelchair and  totally depends  on ibrahim , according to her lawyer .  he can not live without her ,  he said . wani said he 's not been allowed to visit his detained family as much since the apostasy charge was added .  she 's in a bad mood ,  he said of his wife .  she 's frustrated .  more punishment . in addition to the death sentence , the court sentenced ibrahim to 100 lashes for the adultery conviction . the court had warned her to renounce her christianity by may 15 , but she has steadfastly maintained she is a christian and will remain so . sudanese parliament speaker fatih izz al-deen said claims that she was raised as a non-muslim were untrue . she was raised in an islamic environment , and her brother , a muslim , filed the complaint against her , according to al-deen . ` i 'll stand by her ' wani said he was optimistic the appeal their lawyers have filed would lead to the court 's ruling being overturned .  i 'm hoping that , given the way people have come together around the world -- which i want to thank them for ,  he said .  all the rights groups , all the broadcasters ... it 's looking like it had an effect . perhaps it will result in the judgment being overturned .  but until it 's done , the mother of his children has his support .  i 'm standing by her to end . whatever she wants , i 'll stand by her ,  he said . worldwide condemnation . rights groups and foreign embassies worldwide have condemned the verdict . the ruling also created shock waves in sudan , where activists are defying the government and criticizing what they consider an overly harsh implementation and interpretation of islam .  the fact that a woman could be sentenced to death for her religious choice , and to flogging for being married to a man of an allegedly different religion , is abhorrent and should never be even considered ,  said manar idriss , amnesty international 's sudan researcher . foreign embassies in khartoum , including those of the united states , united kingdom and canada , urged the sudanese government to reverse course . there 's no timetable on when the judicial process will be over , but the couple is n't giving up . the appeals court 's ruling could come within the next week , their attorney says . until then , they 're grasping at small signs of hope . the last time sudan executed someone for apostasy was in 1985 when a man criticized sharia law .", "summary": " foreign ministry denies reports that meriam yehya
