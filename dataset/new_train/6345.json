{"text": "chemists in singapore have unveiling a groundbreaking new instant test for the most popular date rape drug . the flourescent sensor can change the colour of drinks within second to warn people drugs have been added . it can detect gamma-hydroxybutyric -lrb- ghb -rrb- , or ` liquid ecstasy ' , which can can make anyone fall into a deep sleep . the simple test for date rape drugs : ghb orange , the fluorescent sensor for detecting date rape drug ghb -lrb- bottle in top left -rrb- , under uv light with the drug ghb -lrb- bottle in top right -rrb- , and when it was mixed into red wine without ghb -lrb- vial in front left -rrb- and with ghb -lrb- vial in front right -rrb- . ghb was used as a central nervous system depressant to treat sleep disorders , promote fat reduction and muscle development , until it was banned for sale as a supplement in the us by the food and drug administration . it is odourless and colourless , and can go undetected in anyone 's glass . a small amount of the drug -- two to four grammes -- can make anyone fall into a deep sleep . current tests for ghb are difficult to carry out , the researchers say . professor chang young-tae , from the department of chemistry at national university of singapore , said : ` the current method in the market is using -lrb- a -rrb- kind of paper -lrb- a tissue-like piece of paper -rrb- and ... run the paper chromatography separations . ` the problem is , to run those samples -- the paper chromatography -- it takes about 10 minutes of your time . ' ` currently , we are using the test tube kind of approach ... but who would want to bring this -lrb- a test tube -rrb- to the discotheque ?  ' scientists from the national university of singapore -lrb- nus -rrb- have now found a way for ghb to show itself instantaneously - by changing the colour of the drink . when the sensor is mixed with a sample of a beverage containing ghb , the mixture changes colour in less than 30 seconds , making detection of the drug fast and easy . the team shortlisted 17 fluorescent compounds and further tested them with a wide range of different ghb concentrations . through this , the team identified that an orange fluorescent compound , coined ghb orange , changes colour when it is mixed with ghb . in order to examine the efficiency of ghb orange , the team tested its detection capability by mixing a small amount of it with samples of various beverages , ranging from alcoholic , non-alcoholic , coloured and colourless drinks , which contain ghb . drinks spiked with ghb are almost impossible to detect - but a new test claims to be able to make drinks change colour if it has been added . the test revealed differences in the fluorescence intensity between ghb-free and ghb-spiked beverages . for drinks that are translucent or of a light colour , such as water or vodka , the change in colour can be easily detected with the naked eye . the change in the colour of darker drinks , such as cola and whiskey , requires the aid of additional lighting to better detect the change . the team now hope to develop a simple kit they can commercialise using the technology .", "summary": " singapore researchers say test can cause a drink to change colour in seconds .   can detect ghb , also known as liquid ecstasy .   set to be developed in an easy to use test .
