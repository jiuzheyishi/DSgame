{"text": "a study has claims that honeybees -lrb- pictured -rrb- rely on a built in ` sat-nav ' system to find their way home . it has been claimed that bees solve difficult maths problems and that their tiny brains are better than computers . and now a new study suggests that the insects rely on a built in ` sat nav ' system to find their way around . honeybees make ` mental maps ' of their home ranges allowing them to pinpoint destinations miles away from their hives . while humans , sharks and even pigeons are known to use this technique , it was popularly thought that bees rely solely on the sun 's position to find their way back to their hive . dr james cheeseman of auckland university in new zealand , said : ` only 50 years ago the claim any non-human animal had a cognitive map was deeply controversial because it suggested a computational theory of mind . the question of whether insects do is a frontier question . ' to come up with their finding , scientists captured and anaesthetised honeybees and shifted some of their circadian -lrb- body -rrb- clocks by six hours to disorientate them . they fitted them with tiny radar transponders to track their movements after releasing them in a different location . the researchers reasoned that if the bees did rely on the sun as a compass , then the alteration to their body clocks would disrupt their ability to find their way home . they found that when the bees with . altered body clocks were let out in a field in brandenburg , germany , . they returned with similar speed and accuracy as those that had not been . put to sleep , according to the study published in the journal . proceedings of the national academy of sciences . although hv1a/gna was carried to the brain of the honeybee -lrb- stock image -rrb- , it had no effect on the insect , which suggests the highly selective spider venom toxin does not interact with the calcium channels in the bee . bees can solve complex mathematical problems which keep computers busy for days , a 2010 study showed . the tiny insects learn to fly the shortest possible route between flowers discovered in random order . effectively , they are capable of solving the ` travelling salesman problem ' - unlike any other animal known besides humans , scientists said . the classic conundrum involves finding the shortest route that allows a travelling salesman to call at all the locations he has to visit . computers solve the problem by comparing the length of all possible routes and choosing the one that is shortest . bees manage to reach the same solution using a brain the size of a grass seed . artificial flowers were used to test bee behaviour . the researchers wanted to know whether bees would follow a simple route defined by the order in which they found the flowers , or look for the shortest route . after exploring the location of the flowers , bees quickly learned to fly the best route for saving time and energy . dr cheeseman said : ` the results suggest bees may navigate by a mental terrain map in addition to learned sun-compass directions . ' it is known that mammals can navigate areas by making cognitive maps - a mental representation of landmarks like rocks , trees and rows of bushes . but it was unclear as to whether insects possess the same skill . ` the results we report imply the bee is like mammals and birds in that its brain constructs an integrated , metric cognitive map , ' he said . the discovery is remarkable because the brain of the bee is tiny and lacks structures such as the hippocampus , which is used in navigation . but the insects must somehow construct a type of map that includes information on directions , distances , diverse landmarks , feeding sources and terrain features to permit the complicated computation of an efficient journey home . in the experiment , when the bees with altered body clocks were released , they returned with similar speed and accuracy as those that had not been put to sleep , suggesting bees may navigate by a mental terrain map in addition to learned sun-compass directions . a stock image of a honeybee is pictured .", "summary": " it was thought that bees rely on the sun 's position to find their way home .   scientists from the university of auckland altered bees ' body clocks to show that they could find their way back from an unfamiliar environment .   study suggests bees create a ` mental map ' like humans and other mammals instead of solely relying on the position of the sun .   discovery is remarkable because bees ' brains are tiny and lack structures such as the hippocampus , which is used for navigation .
