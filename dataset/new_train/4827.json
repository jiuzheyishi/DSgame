{"text": "cairo , egypt it started with verbal abuse , and then -- perhaps inevitably -- it got physically , terrifyingly violent . supporters of egypt 's president hosni mubarak flooded into cairo 's tahrir square wednesday after the president 's opponents dominated the scene for more than a week . separated at first by barriers , the rival demonstrators exchanged insults , then began throwing anything they could find at each other , including shoes , rocks and sticks . suddenly the barriers came down . people surged toward each other in a chaotic scene that conjured images of a revolution . some injured protesters fell . others stumbled through the crowd . blood streamed down the faces of the wounded . a few women away from the front line gave the injured water and swabbed at their wounds . many of the injuries were serious , even though demonstrators wrapped sweatshirts and other clothes around their heads to protect themselves from flying stones . dozens of wounded were carried away , bleeding from gashes . it was impossible to tell from visits to a makeshift clinic which side was faring worse , cnn 's ben wedeman said . he said simply :  they are all egyptians .  a mosque served as a makeshift field hospital , staffed by volunteer doctors , he said . the day was spotted with scenes of brutality . at one point , bloodied men from the pro-regime side were dragged toward the center of tahrir square by anti-government demonstrators who beat and kicked them along the way . one man ripped out the hair of one of the captives . police were nowhere to be seen . army tanks surrounded the square , but the military proved unable or unwilling to separate the two sides . the hatches on their tanks and armored personnel carriers remained closed . some brave egyptians tried to stop the violence , putting their bodies between the sides . briefly they seemed to succeed . there was a lull in the violence . some protesters from the rival camps embraced . all at once , about 50 or 60 people carrying clubs and riding horses and camels charged into the square , beating some protesters . at least one man was pulled off his horse and beaten . and the frenzy intensified . people tore paving stones out of the streets with crowbars and their bare hands , filling bags with rocks to use as an arsenal in the street battle . some ripped street signs out of the ground , using the metal as makeshift shields . cnn 's hala gorani was threatened by a pro-mubarak supporter who told her to get out of the area .  i was a little bit fearful ,  she said . another protester stepped in and protected her , telling the first not to touch her because  she is with me .  she said she ran as fast as she could back to her colleagues .  i 'm fine , but i 've got to say , this is a situation that can turn on a dime . there is a lot of anger coming from those protesters .  they are attacking journalists , she said , and will threaten anyone who looks western . it was unclear whether there was shooting on the square . cnn 's fred pleitgen and anderson cooper said they heard shots being fired , although cooper suggested it may have been troops on the sidelines shooting into the air to try to restore order . the interior ministry denied there was shooting . cnn 's ivan watson , overlooking the square from a hotel , did not hear any gunfire , he said , calling that  a blessing .  and somehow , amid the clashes , pockets of peace remained -- including around small groups who , amid the violence , dropped to their knees and faced mecca . the time had come for daily prayers . but the battle continued for hours , with regime supporters blocking exits from the square as soldiers largely remained on the sidelines . a group of women sat weeping , terrified by the violence they had seen . as night fell , pro-mubarak forces began throwing molotov cocktails , and with the sun going down , flames rose from the square . the army deployed hoses from the sidelines of the square , spraying water over the heads of the demonstrators onto the fires . the troops may be able to extinguish the physical fires . whether they will be able to put out the metaphorical ones sweeping the city -- if they even want to -- remains to be seen . cnn 's amir ahmed and ivan watson contributed to this report .", "summary": " pro-regime forces throw molotov cocktails , starting fires as night falls .   paving stones are torn out of the ground to be used as weapons .   a mosque becomes a makeshift field hospital , staffed by volunteer doctors .   men on horses and camels charge into the crowd with clubs .
