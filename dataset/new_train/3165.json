' the controversial comment was one of mr . banks ' regular ` thought for the week ' comments he writes on the . blackboard in the tap room to get punters talking . outraged : publican kevin banks , pictured with denim jacket that he wore for matches filled with manchester united badges , accused police of overreacting to a complaint from a customer . but . police were called in by customer who noticed the message alongside . routine announcements written by mr banks including use of electronic . cigarettes at his pub and prices of lager . today , mr banks accused officers of cracking down on free speech over the way they handled a complaint . an officer went to speak to the father-of-six and gave him ` words of advice ' before the landlord agreed to let him rub out the message . no further action will be taken against him . manchester united fan mr banks , who is the landlord of the sweet green tavern in bolton , greater manchester , defended his post about the 1958 crash in which 23 people lost their lives . he claimed he was simply repeating a statement made by former united player wyn davies about the tragedy . tragedy : the munich air disaster killed 23 of the 44 passengers onboard the british european airways plane which was bringing home members of the manchester united football team from a european cup match . mr banks said : ' i ca n't believe police have n't got better things to do than speak to me about a message which i wrote to get people talking . it 's another example of a crack down on free speech . ` if someone is offended by it then i 'm afraid that 's tough on them . people die everywhere and i do n't see why this is distasteful . ' i put it up on the blackboard , there is nothing disrespectful about it . people are edging round death all the time , this is the real world , get on with it . ' i am a manchester united supporter and went to 500 consecutive matches . i do n't find it disrespectful - whoever does needs to get a reality check . ` to me it is something thought-provoking to make people stop and think . last week , i had a message up about planet earth celebrating its 13.82 billion birthday .

' i know wyn davies quite well and we talked about the air disaster . he said of all the airports it could have happened it was munich , he said you do n't suppose it means manchester united never intended coming home . ` i 'd never thought or heard of that before and i thought that was very clever . i wrote on the blackboard , ` just had a conversation with win davies and he points out that the air disaster happened at munich and he thinks it stands for this . underneath i put that he was a clever man . backlash : mr banks , pictured outside his pub , insists he meant no offence when he wrote the acronym about the munich air disaster on a blackboard . ' i thought to myself is this offensive but i could n't see that it was . what is offensive is opposing fans chanting ` munich munich munich ' at manchester united fans . ' i was off work on the friday and the barmaid said there was a woman in who she 'd never seen before who said it was extremely offensive and it should be taken down . i explained how i 'd got the remark . ` the next thing i knew was the police were at the pub and they wanted to arrest me . the policeman said he was here to see me about the offensive remarks and i asked him why it was offensive . ' i told him he was telling me it was offensive but why . i said if he could tell me why then i would take it down . he said it was a public order offence . i said that i used to be a manchester united fan and a former player had told me it . ' i intially said i was not giving him permission to wipe it off the board but he wiped it off anyway because he said he did n't want to arrest me . i just could n't believe the over reaction . ' ` in future under my messages i 'll write : ` however if you find offence with the above statements feel free to use your democratic sights to go and drink elsewhere ' . one customer , said : ` there are normally little quips on the blackboard , but this upset me . ' a lot of people died in that crash and it was horrific . i find it offensive . if someone chanted this at a football match they would probably be prosecuted and i think it was right police spoke to the landlord . ` what he wrote was disrespectful to the people who died . ' dale o'donnell , from the manchester united online fanzine stretty news , said : ` if i saw that message on a pub wall , i would walk out . it 's a disgusting thing to write . ' i can understand the landlord 's general point that people are too sensitive towards death , but this is not the way to go about proving a point . ' a spokesman for greater manchester police said : ` we had a call about a blackboard message about the munich air disaster that was deemed to be offensive . ` we sent an officer and the landlord offered to resolve the complaint by removing the message . he denied that the message was offensive but was happy to remove it .
