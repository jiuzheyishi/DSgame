{"text": "universities minister david willetts said all universities can do is ask students if they have booked a flight home . universities can not be expected to march foreign students to the airport when their course ends , senior tory minister david willetts has warned . the universities minister told mailonline lecturers could ` ask in a friendly way ' when graduates were planning to return home . but he insisted they can not be forced to track them once their course ends or ` escort ' them to the airport . it puts him at odds with home secretary theresa may who wants new rules to force colleges to make sure students from overseas do not stay on once their visas run out . official figures suggest that around 100,000 foreign students stay on in britain illegally each year . according to the office for national statistics , 145,000 non-eu students arrived here in 2012 . yet last year , only 50,000 non-eu students returned to their home countries . mrs may wants the tory manifesto to include a pledge to force colleges and universities to take responsibility for making sure foreign students go home . but universities say they can not be held responsible for what ex-students do after they leave their course . now their opposition has been backed by mr willetts , who warned the most universities could do was ask if students from overseas were planning their return . he pointed to the university of portsmouth which runs a scheme where they ` monitor and ask ' overseas students who are coming to the end of their course if they are preparing to return to their home country . mr willetts said they ask : ` have you booked your flight , when are you planning to go home , all that kind of thing , asked in a friendly way . ' he told mailonline : ` at the moment universities do n't have a legal responsibility for escorting students to the airport . ` my view is overseas students come here to study and after that they either have to go back home or they 've got a suitable level of job to stay on to do post-study work . ` universities can help us ensure that students go home . ' last year 177,000 people came to the uk for formal study , according to the office for national statistics said . he played down the suggestion of a ` massive dispute ' between the department for business , innovation and skills and the home office . ` but there are limits to what they have got legal powers to do . they can ask them but if you have finished your degree at the end of june but your visa expires at the end of august , the university has n't currently got the legal powers to track its recent graduates up until the end of august . ` but what they can do - and i encourage them to do this - what they can do when the students have finished their exams is say  so you are planning to go back home at the end of august ? you know , what are going to do ?  ` they can ask that information , then voluntarily the student can provide it . ' home secretary theresa may wants the next conservative manifesto to include a pledge to force universities to take responsibility for making sure foreign students go home . the home office has been stung by criticism over its failure to reduce immigration to the ` tens of thousands ' . david cameron and mrs may have repeated the tory pledge many times since the coalition was formed , but the latest figures show net migration hit 201,000 in 2013 . some have argued for students to be removed from the headline net migration figures , over fears it risked deterring people from choosing british universities . instead the home office has proposed curbs on students bringing in dependants and sanctions against institutions which allow students to break the rules .", "summary": " exclusive : senior minister says universities can not track ex-students .   urges them to ask questions about travel plans before their course ends .   but they have ` no legal responsibility for escorting students to the airport '   home secretary theresa may wants tough action to send students home .
