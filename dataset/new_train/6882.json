' i decided that if we could do that without a major row we must have something pretty special going . ' i knew i was going to propose but i did n't want to do anything that was too cliche so i came up with this idea about three weeks ago . ' i have never done anything as big as this before . i spent the first day painting the wall over and the second day i spent all day painting . ` it took me eight hours but i managed to catch stacey completely by surprise . when she saw what i had done she just burst into tears , she was so thrilled .
