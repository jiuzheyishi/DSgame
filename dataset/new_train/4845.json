{"text": "with about 2,400 four-year universities located in the u.s. , high school students may find the actual process of applying to college as anxiety inducing as waiting for an acceptance letter . startup splash networks wants to make selecting schools to send an application to easier . on tuesday , the company is launching a facebook app called admissionsplash that shows prospective college students how likely it is that they will be admitted to each school on their lists . the app asks students for their basic information : test scores , address , and other factors that affect admissions , like whether they volunteer or play sports . it then uses an algorithm to give users a desirability rating as well as the likelihood , ranging from  very poor  to  very good ,  of getting into the schools . admission splash currently runs customized equations for about 1,500 schools that it developed using the admission data they release . admissions offices often paint a picture of case-by-case application analysis that ca n't be narrowed down to an equation .  although high school grade point average and standardized test scores are important indicators of academic achievement used in ucla 's admissions review , they only tell part of the story ,  advertises ucla 's prospective student website , for instance . but admissionsplash 's equation , which definitely does n't take essays into account , has been pretty accurate in tests that use publicly available admissions profiles . in the case of ucla , approximately 85 % of students the app said would get admitted actually did . the sample sizes of these tests are fairly small -lrb- 73 people for the ucla test -rrb- , so i would n't suggest posting admissionsplash results on one 's facebook page before getting an acceptance letter . using the tool as a way to compare schools ' competitiveness or to share a list of prospective schools with friends , on the other hand , seems like a win .
