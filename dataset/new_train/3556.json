{"text": "ronny deila tore into his celtic players after their champions league hopes were blown to pieces by henning berg 's poles . the scottish champions now require a miracle at murrayfield next week if they are to stay in europe 's premier competition following an abysmal performance which saw efe ambrose dismissed on the stroke of half-time . after callum mcgregor gave celtic an early lead , two goals from miroslav radovic and one apiece from michal zyro and jakub koseci saw legia warsaw shoot down the visitors - and remarkably the scoreline could have been even worse had ivica vrdoljak not missed a penalty and had a second one saved by fraser forster . humiliated : celtic 's players trudge off the pitch after they were comfortably beaten on wednesday night . with celtic needing a 3-0 win in the unfamiliar surroundings of the national rugby stadium , furious fans will be questioning the logic of handing over celtic park over for the opening ceremony of the commonwealth games . angered by a ` poor ' display and ` stupid mistakes ' , deila said : ` it was a very poor performance and worst of all was the commitment , the energy . i need much more energy in the game . we did n't stay together for 90 minutes . ` we started well and got the first goal but then gave way to pressure and lost our heads . we started giving the ball way in midfield so many times and mistakes in the back four , some were high , some were low , instead of being together . ` but what is done is done , we have to learn from this very quick . we got the away goal and we still have a chance . pandemonium : legia warsaw 's players go wild after miroslav radovic scores his first goal . ` it is possible to win 3-0 again - like we did last year in the play-off - and with the help of the supporters we will do everything we can to do that . ` but we have to learn from this week . we need a whole different attitude and discipline in our play . ' the norwegian did not excuse himself from blame and vowed to make himself clearer in his instructions ahead of the second leg , insisting his team should not have gone on the offensive after radovic put the poles in front just before half time . ` it was not the plan to go forward at 2-1 . we had a spell when we had good control but started making stupid mistakes and they got space behind us . mountain to climb : deila must somehow inspire celtic to overcome the three-goal deficit . ` that is my responsibility . i have to be much clearer as to what i expect and how we perform as a team , defensively and offensively , and tonight we lost our heads and that is not good enough . ' deila was not too harsh on ambrose whose defending was ropey before he was sent off for a ` last man ' challenge on mical kucharczyk . ` it is not only that situation , it was a consequence of many situations . we lost the ball too much in middle , the back four was not together and when we lost the ball we were too open . ` we made it difficult for ourselves and in the end they got a counter-attack and efe went in , but it was a more of a consequence of bad defending . ' long journey home : celtic fans will not be please with what they saw from their side . legia boss berg was delighted by the way his side kept going despite missing two penalties . ` we did n't feel sorry for ourselves , we pushed and got more goals and we could have scored more , ' said the former rangers player . ` it is not normal to miss two penalties , especially for ivica as he has never missed for me . ivo was confident but that is football . but i am very happy with the way we played and so happy for my players to show what we can do in a game like this .
