{"text": "more than one in four britons have the early signs of liver disease , according to the british liver trust . a booze-free january is not enough to repair the liver and keep it healthy , leading experts have warned . aside from the fact that many of us simply resume old habits once the month is over , a fatty diet and sedentary lifestyle can be just as damaging , they say . a roadshow carried out by the british liver trust charity last year found that 28 per cent of people tested were showing the early signs of liver disease . if left undetected however , these . early signs could lead to permanent liver damage . liver disease , now the fifth biggest killer in the uk , has increased in the past year as british culture continues to embrace the daily consumption of alcohol and unhealthy food choices , combined with a sedentary lifestyle , the trust said . with no early warning signs , and tolerance levels varying genetically , liver testing is critical to identify early signs of damage so people can make lifestyle changes to save their lives . the charity is calling on the government to make . early liver screening available to everyone at risk in a bid to save one . million lives a year . it believes gps should ask their patients more lifestyle questions and offer a simple liver function test , as they do for patients with suspected high blood pressure . the charity made its plea as it launched its second love your liver awareness campaign , to be led by a nationwide roadshow of ` pop-up ' liver health clinics . the trust 's chief executive , andrew langford , said : ` last year the love your liver roadshow found that one in four people tested were showing the early signs of liver disease . caught at this early stage , lifestyle changes allow the liver to repair itself . ` having an alcoholic drink every night , over-indulging in rich food too frequently and not making time for regular exercise are major contributing factors for liver disease . ' a key issue is that many people do n't realise that regardless of alcohol intake , a lack of exercise and a fatty diet can also cause cirrhosis and liver cancer . he told the guardian : ` in the last five years , we have seen a real decrease in the age of death from liver disease . it used to be in the 60s , now it is 58 , and by 2020 we would expect it to be about 50 if it follows this trajectory . ten years ago , it was very unusual to see a 30-year-old in a liver unit awaiting a transplant . now it is not uncommon . ' one key problem is that many of us do n't realise that regardless of alcohol intake , a lack of exercise and a fatty diet can also cause cirrhosis and liver cancer . these two factors also cause fat to build up in the liver . mr langford added : ` it is a myth that cirrhosis is always caused by alcohol . ` as everyone is affected differently , and symptoms are almost unrecognisable until the damage is beyond repair , the government needs to take action to help people understand the damage they are doing . ` it 's not about a quick fix in january , to repair the liver and keep it healthy , people need to follow our three-step plan all-year round : 1 -rrb- take two to three days off alcohol every week ; 2 -rrb- get regular exercise ; 3 -rrb- cut down on sugar and fat . ` our love your liver campaign offers free screenings to the public at a series of pop-up liver health clinics , offering free fibroscan tests which help identify the early warning signs and practical advice about how to love your liver . ` however , we can only reach a very small group of people and we 're appealing for the government to do more . ' the campaign can be followed via www.loveyourliver.org.uk www.facebook.com/britishlivertrust and twitter @livertrust .", "summary": " 28 per cent of people tested by the british liver trust were showing the early signs of liver damage .   liver disease is now the fifth biggest killer in the uk , due to alcohol , fatty diets and sedentary lifestyles .   charity is calling for early liver screening to be made available to all those at risk , in a bid to save one million lives a year .
