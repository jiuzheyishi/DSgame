{"text": "the checkered flag has only just fallen on the final formula one race of the year in brazil but the sport 's top car designer is already predicting a spicy 2014 season . adrian newey is the man behind the red bull racer that has powered sebastian vettel and the team to four straight world championships . but the englishman is not taking red bull 's dominance for granted as major rule changes loom on the horizon . next year , each team must package its car around a new turbo engine as well as complying with aerodynamic rule changes which will mainly affect the design of the cars ' front and rear wings .  the aerodynamic changes are big ,  explained newey to formula1.com .  but they are smaller than the changes we had in 2009 .  so yes , there is the chance that one team comes up with a car that is better than their rivals ' , but on top of that you have the engine changes .  what is absolutely unclear is whether one engine manufacturer will be able to come up with a significant advantage .  but the car that will brush aside all others will be a car having the combination of good engine and good chassis -- if one side is letting you down you will have a problem .  who will come up with the ideal combination ? that 's the big guessing game for all of us and will add spice to the 2014 season .  red bull will continue to be powered by renault while mercedes and ferrari will pit their new 1.6-litre , v6 engines against the french engine manufacturer . the 2014 cars will also rely on more hybrid power harvested from energy recovery systems -lrb- ers -rrb- . while these elements of the car are out of newey 's hands , the englishman , who says he has received offers to join rival teams , remains in charge of red bull 's car design as the team 's chief technical officer . there has already been speculation within the sport that the 2014 cars will be less easy on the eye than this season 's sleek racers . it 's a theory that also irks newey , who still uses a drawing board to sketch out the design of his peerless machines .  ideally the car is fast and has a stylish design ,  the former williams and mclaren designer continued .  but everybody in the paddock will give a fast car preference over an attractive car -- that 's the way it is .  yes , for me it would be good if a bit more consideration was given to aesthetics in the drafting of the regulations . but fast is paramount over beauty .  newey and his team of more than 100 engineers have been working on red bull 's 2014 for many months , even while juggling the demands of winning current championships . amazing brain . but the englishman , rated as the sport 's leading car designer , was still willing to share some tips on preparing for a major rule change -- even if there could be a slight danger that rivals such as ferrari , mercedes and mclaren might just pinch some of his ideas .  the first thing that you do is to read the regulations -- very , very carefully ,  he explained .  you try to read what they actually say , rather than what they intend to say , as this is not always the same thing .  after that i 'm actually breaking it down into bite-size chunks . then you try to understand from the regulations the aerodynamic and mechanical packaging that appears to be the best solutions for those different areas .  you go away and research them and at some point try to bring it all back together again . for me that is the important bit : the end product should be a whole and not pieces thrown together into one cluster .  does it still look a good idea after 24 hours ? that decides whether it gets a tick or a cross .  actually , you develop a sensibility for that procedure . the brain is an amazing thing : you might be doing something completely different -- maybe making a cup of tea -- and suddenly you know right from wrong !  the most coveted designer in formula one will find out whether he has got it right or wrong when testing for the new season begins next january .", "summary": " red bull car designer adrian newey says 2014 rule changes will spice up new season .   he says it is a  guessing game  which team will have best engine/chassis combination .   newey says he would like the rules to consider car aesthetics more than they do .   englishman says he has a  24-hour  rule he applies to all his design ideas .
