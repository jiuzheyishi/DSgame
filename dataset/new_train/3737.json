{"text": "it has long been thought that the hip bones of whales and dolphins are essentially useless . but scientists have now discovered that in fact the opposite is true and that they are very important for mating in the species . experts also believe that their shape and size even influences how sexually attractive a cetacean is . no bones about it : scientists matthew dean -lrb- pictured left -rrb- and jim dines -lrb- right -rrb- have discovered that the pelvic bones of whales and dolphins -lrb- which they are holding -rrb- are important for mating and are not useless as previously thought . both whales and dolphins have pelvic bones , which are evolutionary remnants from when their ancestors walked on land more than 40 million years ago . common wisdom has long held that those bones are simply vestigial - slowly withering away like tailbones on humans . ` everyone 's always assumed that if you gave whales and dolphins a few more million years of evolution , the pelvic bones would disappear . but it appears that 's not the case , ' said matthew dean , assistant professor at the university of southern california -lrb- usc -rrb- . for four years , he and the natural history museum of los angeles county 's collections manager , jim dines , have painstakingly analysed cetacean pelvic bones . having a whale of a time ! experts say the shape and size of a whale 's pelvic bone influences how sexually attractive they are to females . they found that the bigger the testes , the bigger the cetacean 's pelvic bone . most whale species do n't maintain fixed partnerships and females have several mates each season . whales use a mating call to attract a partner and some that travel in pods perform specicic rituals to snag a mate . baleen whales such as humpback and blue whales sing a unique songs to woo a partner potentially miles away . sperm whale pods find each other with calls and clicks and when they find each ther battle one another to attract a female . killer whales develop dialects distinct to pods . they do this so they can locate a suitable mate from outside their own community . they wrote in the journal evolution , the muscles that control a cetacean 's highly flexible penis , attach directly to its pelvic bones . the scientist theorised that the pelvic bones could affect the level of control over the penis that an individual cetacean has , perhaps offering an evolutionary advantage . to test their idea , they examined hundreds of pelvic bones and used a 3d scanner to make digital models of the curved bones in order to gain an unprecedented level of detail about their shape and size , as well as to compare them . they then gathered data about testis size relative to the mass of whales . in the natural world , more ` promiscuous ' species where females mate with many males , create a more competitive mating environment and the males develop larger testes as a way of attracting females . size matters : males from more promiscuous species such as dolphins evolve larger penises , so larger pelvic bones appear necessary to attach larger muscles for penis control , the experts said . a couple of mating whales are pictured along with others . for years humans have wondered what the high pitched noises made by dolphins and whales mean . and now scientists believe that the marine animals squeal with delight to express their happiness . initially , noises emitted by the animals when offered fish treats were thought to be signals communicating the presence of food . whales and dolphins are known to squeal when they hear a whistle or buzzer associated with a food reward . but . when dolphins and beluga whales were trained to switch off a sound . after making a deep dive , they announced a successful mission it was the equivalent of a human ` whoop ' of triumph , according to u.s. cetacean expert and author dr sam ridgway . ` the -lsb- squealing -rsb- behaviour had transferred over to another stimulus that was n't food , ' he said . to . investigate further , dr ridgway and his colleagues at the national . marine mammal foundation in san diego , california , analysed decades of . recordings of experiments involving dolphins and beluga whales . they . wanted to understand if the delay before a squeal was mirrored by the . release of dopamine , a brain chemical that stimulates sensations of . pleasure . dopamine . release takes 100 milliseconds , so if the delay between a reward . promise and a squeal was longer than this amount of time it would . suggest a connection . in dolphins , the delay was 151 milliseconds and in beluga whales 250 milliseconds . ` we . think we have demonstrated that it -lsb- the victory squeal -rsb- has emotional . content , ' said dr ridgway , whose findings appear in the journal of . experimental biology . the experts compared the size of pelvic bones to the size of an animal 's testes , relative its body size , and found that the bigger the testes , the bigger the cetacean 's pelvic bone . males from more promiscuous species also evolve larger penises , so larger pelvic bones appear necessary to attach larger muscles for penis control , they said . ` our research really changes the way we think about the evolution of whale pelvic bones in particular , but more generally about structures we call vestigial , ' professor dean said . ` as a parallel , we are now learning that our appendix is actually quite important in several immune processes , not a functionally useless structure , ' he added . the duo believe that their new way of measuring and quantifying the complicated 3d structures of bones , could be used to record and study bones held by museums . squealing with delight : last month , scientists found that dolphins squeal with delight to express their happiness and likened it to a human ` whoop ' of triumph .", "summary": " whales and dolphins have pelvic bones , which are evolutionary remnants from
