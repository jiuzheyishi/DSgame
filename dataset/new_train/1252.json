{"text": "volatile volcano mount etna has been blowing perfect ` smoke ' rings into sicily 's blue skies . the volcano erupted violently on november 11 and since then has produced regular explosions , as well as hundreds of perfect vortex rings . while theories abound , scientists are not entirely sure why the volcano is able to blow the circular puffs of steam - although some think a circular vent could be the cause . scroll down for video . volatile volcano mount etna has been blowing perfect smoke rings after erupting violently on november 11 and has since produced regular explosions , as well as dozens of perfect vortex rings . some of the smoke rings measure hundreds of feet in diameter , according to volcano discovery . german volcanologist dr tom pfeiffer , who founded the volcano watching website and runs tours of active volcanoes , said dozens of smoke rings were blown eastwards by a strong wind . he believes the reason for the unusual smoke-like formations is because the violent eruption had changed the structure of a vent -- perhaps into a particularly circular shape that allowed the volcano to make the steam rings , which he said are a ` rare phenomenon ' . writing on the website , he said : ` being . etna , she exaggerates : not only one ring every now and then , but she . made dozens if not hundreds during a few hours , often in a row . ' in 2,000 when the volcano produced another series of impressive rings , two volcanologists , said they could be formed by rapid gas pulses emitted by narrow vents into the atmosphere . more recent rings are pictured . volatile volcano mount etna has been blowing perfect smoke rings after erupting violently on november 11 and has since produced regular explosions , as well as dozens of perfect vortex rings . it is not the first time that etna has managed to produce the circular smoke rings and photographs have been taken of them since the 1970s and notably in the year 2000 . mount etna is the tallest and most active . volcano in europe and is situated on the geological boundary where the . european and african plates collide . in . 2,000 when the volcano produced another series of impressive rings , two . volcanologists , drs jurg alean and maro fulle , told the bbc : ` they -lsb- the rings -rsb- could be formed by rapid gas pulses emitted by narrow vents into the atmosphere . ` the physics seems somewhat complicated and we are trying to establish if there are sound scientific theories about them . ' the pair run a monitoring station and keep a photographic record of the volcano 's activity . other experts have theories about why the rings of steam are produced . it is not the first time that etna has managed to produce the circular steam rings and photographs have been taken of them since the 1970s and notably in the year 2000 . here , it is possible to see the steam rings above the volcano . german volcanologist dr tom pfeiffer believes the reason for the unusual smokey formations is because the violent eruption had changed the morphology of a vent . writing on fiboni blog , sana lane said steam rings above volcanoes typically measure between 100m and 200m across . she said ` vortex rings ' are formed when air mixes with steam or smoke , having been forced out of a small circular opening . because there is a bottleneck at the opening , the air in the centre if forced out faster , which creates a circular motion to form a vortex . the shape of the ring is maintained because of the rotational motion of the air so the rings need the right shaped opening and velocity to form . mount etna is not the only volcano to have created the curious rings and stromboli in italy , hekla in iceland and mount aso in japan are also said to have produced steam rings . mount etna is an active volcano on the east coast of sicily , italy , close to the cities of messina and catania . it lies on a convergent plate margin between the african plate and the erasian plate . it is the tallest active volcano on the european continent at 3,329 m high . when etna started to erupt last month -lrb- pictured -rrb- none of the villages of catania , dotted around the mountain , needed to be evacuated , though airspace over the southern italian island was briefly closed . more than 25 per cent of sicily 's population lives on etna 's slopes , and it is the main source of income for the island - a combination of agriculture , due to its rich volcanic soil , and tourism . here , etna is pictured erupting last month .", "summary": " the volcano in sicily erupted violently on november 11 and has created hundreds of smoke rings that travelled east .   volcanologist dr tom pfeiffer , who photographed the phenomenon , believes they were produced by a circular vent .   it is not the first time etna has managed to produce the smoky halos .
