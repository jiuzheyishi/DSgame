' leder filed for divorced in 2009 after his wife of 22 years had admitted to cheating on him with her 23-year-old tennis coach . with his marriage over , a friend told the post the magnate ` went wild , ' going on a dating binge . magnate : leder , right , co-founded sun capital partners in boca raton , left , in 1995 after drawing inspiration from a visit to romney 's firm , bain capital . in an interview with the new york times this past january , leder criticized the media of mischaracterizing him as a ` private equity party boy . ' ` i think the portrayal of me as having wild and crazy parties is absolutely incorrect , ' he told the paper . ` i spend a small percentage throwing some parties , attending some parties . ` i like music . i like to dance . but rather than reporting on how i spend 340 days and nights of my year , the media likes to report on the other 25 . ' in the same january interview with the times , the sun capital co-ceo revealed that he was inspired to go into private equity after paying a visit to romney 's investment firm , bain capital . ` mr. romney was an early investor in some of the deals done by mr. leder 's investment company , sun capital , which today oversees about $ 8billion in equity , ' the article said . leaked : mother jones , a liberal news magazine , says it obtained the footage from an anonymous person who attended the fundraiser . blunder : the resulting outcry is still regarded as one of the main reasons why the republican lost the race to the white house . the times noted that leder 's firm was accused by a federal regulatory agency of pushing the fast food chain friendly 's into bankruptcy in 2011 to avoid paying pensions -- a fate that was shared by some 25 companies in sun capital 's portfolio since 2008 . before founding sun capital in 1995 , leder worked as a senior vice president at the now-defunct lehman brothers . on may 17 , leder organized a fundraiser for mitt romney , inviting 150 wealthy donors to his home in boca raton for a lavish dinner . during the party , the republican nominee was taped telling the guests , among other things , that the nearly 50 per cent of voters who support the president ` believe that they are victims , who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them , who believe that they are entitled to health care , to food , to housing , to you-name-it . exclusive event : leder invited some 150 wealthy donors to his boca raton home in may to help raise funds for romney 's presidential bid . ` that , that 's an entitlement . and the government should give it to them . and they will vote for this president no matter what ... these are people who pay no income tax . ' he added that ` my job is not to worry about those people -- i 'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives . ' the comments set off a firestorm in the media , prompting romney to hold a late-night press conference in an attempt to minimize the damage from the leak . the republican candidate said that obama believes in ' a government-centred society ' whereas he believes in a ` free people , free enterprise , free market ' society and had an approach that would put 23 million people back to work . he added that ` my campaign is about helping people take more responsibility ' and ` getting people back to work . ' romney conceded only that his sentiments were ` not elegantly stated ' because he was ` speaking off the cuff . ' battered : the obama campaign quickly jumped on the statement saying romney ` disdained ' half of the nation . standing by his words : at a press conference on monday , romney said his remarks were ` not elegantly stated , ' but did not back away from the message . on its part , the obama campaign quickly seized upon the controversial comments by the president 's opponent , which came only 50 days before the november 6 election . in a statement reacting to the secret recordings , jim messina , obama 's campaign manager , said : ` it 's shocking that a candidate for president of the united states would go behind closed doors and declare to a group of wealthy donors that half the american people view themselves as  victims  entitled to handouts , and are unwilling to take  personal responsibility  for their lives . ` it 's hard to serve as president for all americans when you 've disdainfully written off half the nation . ' romney 's 47 per cent figure seems to have come from a tax policy center report that found 46.4 per cent of american households paid zero income taxes or received a net refund from the government . but romney appeared to mix up the 47 per cent of people who did not pay income tax -- many of whom pay state and local taxes and payroll taxes -- with the proportion of core obama supporters . many of those who do n't pay income tax are republican supporters -- particularly working class white men and the elderly . video : mitt romney reacts to the undercover filming from motherjones .", "summary": " marc leder , 50 , is the co-ceo of sun capital partners with perosnal worth valued at $ 400million .   leder divorced his wife of 22 years in 2009 after she admitted to cheating on him .   hosted a series of parties at a beachfront estate he rented for $ 500,000 a month .   leder said in an interview he was inspired to launch his firm after visiting mitt romney 's bain capital .
