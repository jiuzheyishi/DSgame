' mr allamby says today 's children are most at risk of myopia -- with children as young as seven being given smartphones . david allamby says there has been a 35 per cent increase in the number of people with advancing myopia since the launch of smartphones in 1997 . it is predicted that by 2014 teenagers . aged 12 to 17 will be the second biggest market for smartphones behind . 18 to 24-year-olds . mr allamby 's claims are supported by previous research which has shown that using a smartphone can damage people 's vision and cause headaches . researchers at the university of california found that the problem is the demand on the eyes to focus on the screen and simultaneously adjust to the distance of the content . the phenomenon is known as ` vergence-accommodation ' and experiments found people suffered discomfort when content from mobile phones appeared in front of the screen rather than behind it .", "summary": " david allamby says there has been a 35 % increase in the number of people with advancing myopia since the launch of smartphones in 1997 .   he believes the problem could increase by 50 % in the next ten years .   the problem is so common he has given it a name - ` screen sightedness '   50 % of 30-year-olds could have the problem by 2033 due to smartphones .
