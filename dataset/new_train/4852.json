{"text": "lebanese authorities have arrested a wife of isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi -- the man spearheading the islamist terror group 's sweeping rampage across syria and iraq -- said a source with knowledge of the arrest . the woman is one of al-baghdadi 's two wives . her arrest came as part of a  planned operation ,  according to the source . the source described her as a  powerful figure -lrb- who is -rrb- heavily involved in isis .  not much is known about the reported wife , including what her involvement is with the terrorist group , if any .  we will gain some intelligence from her . we may get insights into al-baghdadi 's movement , who he surrounds himself with , whether he was injured , and the degree of his injuries ,  said rep. adam schiff , a california democrat . another intelligence source identified the wife as saja al-dulaimi . she was detained with her 4-year-old son more than a week ago when they tried to enter lebanon , that source said . the arrest was a coordinated operation involving agencies from iraq , syria and lebanon , said the intelligence source . the source said the iraqis had help from u.s. intelligence . in washington , the cia declined to comment . also in washington , several american sources suggested the person arrested was al-baghdadi 's ex-wife , not a current one . al-baghdadi has been calling for the release of his son , the intelligence source said , adding that al-dulaimi was released from syrian custody in march as part of a group of 150 women who were freed in exchange for a group of syrian nuns . the greek orthodox nuns had been kidnapped and held captive by the al qaeda-linked al-nusra front , which al-baghdadi had helped establish . lebanese authorities did n't immediately respond to requests for comment from cnn . agence france-presse , citing unidentified lebanese security officials , reported one of al-baghdadi 's sons was detained . but reuters , also citing lebanese officials , said that a daughter , rather than a son , was being held . the two agencies similarly differed on when the two were picked up by lebanese forces : reuters said it happened  in recent days ;  afp reported it was 10 days ago . regardless , the very idea that a government may be holding close relatives of al-baghdadi is significant , given his pivotal role in isis ' meteoric rise , the extremist group 's widely reviled tactics under his leadership and the breadth of the international coalition aimed at defeating isis .  it 's certainly a new dynamic because we 've never seen anybody connected so close to al-baghdadi being detained ,  terrorism expert sajjan m. gohel said . at the same time , the reports raise a lot of questions , such as what the family members might have been doing in lebanon .  is he estranged from them ? has he fallen out with them ? were they escaping from him ?  asked gohel , who is the international security director at the asia pacific foundation . lebanon is one of several countries heavily affected by syria 's yearslong conflict and the flood of refugees trying to escape the violence . lebanese authorities  have been cracking down very heavily on the border to prevent members of isis seeping into lebanon ,  gohel said .  they do n't want the problems spilling over from iraq and syria into their territory .  another question raised by the reports is whether the wife is affiliated with isis .  if she 's simply an ex-wife , the first thing you got to deal with is she 's an innocent person , potentially , who was married to a bad guy , with a child ,  said philip mudd , a former cia counterterrorism official .  the first hurdle ... before we deal with what she knows , is how closely was she affiliated , and how hard can you press her based on that affiliation . that 's an ethical question ,  he said . mystery surrounds arrest of woman who may be isis leader 's wife . isis rises after al-baghdadi took over . the group that in 2006 would become isis began in iraq , where it targeted the u.s.-led coalition as well as shiite muslims in the country . it suffered heavy losses , but ascended over the past few years to take advantage of a void wrought by syria 's civil war as well as instability in iraq . not coincidentally , this all happened after al-baghdadi took over isis in 2010 . before that , he 'd been at a u.s. prison camp for insurgents at bucca in southern iraq , where he was taken after being detained in february 2004 amid fighting in the flashpoint city of falluja . media reports have claimed u.s. authorities held al-baghdadi for four years . but the pentagon has offered a different time line , saying he was at camp bucca until early december 2004 , when officials there recommended his  unconditional release .  beyond this , little is known about al-baghdadi . according to the u.s. government , he was born in samarra , iraq , and is in his early 40s . what motivates him , how he was trained and who he 's close to -- including his family -- largely remains a mystery . he has emerged from the shadows in fits and spurts . after the death of al qaeda leader osama bin laden in 2011 , al-baghdadi issued a eulogy in which he threatened violent retribution . -lrb- al qaeda disowned isis earlier this year , blaming it for  the enormity of the disaster that afflicted  others trying to unseat syrian president bashar al-assad . -rrb- . there were unconfirmed suggestions last month that al-baghdadi had been wounded in airstrikes in northern iraq . but days later , an audio recording emerged that purportedly contained a message from al-baghdadi saying the u.s.-led coalition to destroy isis is  terrified , weak and powerless .  ` he 's created this myth ' isis itself has never been more powerful , having taken over vast swaths of territory in iraq and syria in the past few years . and it has used brutal tactics to do so -- such as mass kidnappings , rapes , killings and other abuses against civilians and fighting foes alike , actions that a u.n. panel characterized as war crimes and crimes against humanity . al-baghdadi , who has gone by a variety of aliases during his career in terrorism , has been at the center of it . the u.s. state department 's reward 's for justice program , which refers to him as  abu du'a ,  offers $ 10 million for information leading to his arrest . when his group rebranded itself as the islamic state in june , al-baghdadi was tapped as spiritual leader of the new caliphate . he 's sought to burnish his theological credentials , with a biography posted on jihadist websites last year claiming he had earned a doctorate in islamic studies from a university in baghdad .  his knowledge in islamic jurisprudence is somewhat dubious , but nevertheless he 's created this myth and this aura behind him ,  gohel said .", "summary": " woman part of a group freed in exchange for a group of nuns , intelligence source says .   intelligence source identifies the wife as saja al-dulaimi .   several u.s. sources suggest the person arrested is al-baghdadi 's ex-wife .   little is known about al-baghdadi ; u.s. offers $ 10 million for info leading to him .
