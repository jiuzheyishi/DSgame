{"text": "as the ` first minoan cd-rom ' , because of the way the pictorial markings are laid out . the disk is thought to date to the middle minoan bronze age , in the second millennium bc , and was discovered in 1908 at the palace of phaistos , in crete . it measures 6 inches -lrb- 15cm -rrb- in diameter and is covered on both sides in a spiral of stamped signs . since it was found , experts have been trying to decipher the mysterious inscriptions and have come up with a number of interpretations . it is very hard to come up with a definitive reading of the disk , because it is made up of just 241 pictures , or ` tokens ' on both its sides based on 45 individual signs . most experts believe that the inscription should be read from the outside edge of the disk , inwards . dr gareth owens claims the disk features a prayer to mother , which is recorded using an obscure ancient language made up of signs , including what looks like a plumed head , a child and even a beehive . he worked this out by picking out a reoccurring keyword -lrb- pictured -rrb- which he used as a basis for his translation . the phaistos disk is a disk made of fired clay that was found in the minoan palace of phaistos on crete . it is thought to date to the middle minoan bronze age in the second millennium bc , but precise estimates vary . the disk measures 6 inches -lrb- 15cm -rrb- in diameter and is covered on both sides in a spiral of stamped signs . its purpose and meaning is disputed , and now one expert claims it is an ancient prayer to a mother . the disk was discovered in 1908 and features 241 ` tokens ' made up of 45 unique signs laid out in a spiralling clockwise sequence . many of these 45 signs represent easily identifiable every-day things . in addition to these , there is a small diagonal line that occurs underneath the final sign in a group a total of 18 times . the disc shows traces of corrections made by the scribe in several places . dr gareth owens of the technological educational institute -lrb- tei -rrb- of crete believes the disk is dedicated to a mother , archaeology news network reported . ` the most stable word and value is  mother  and in particular the mother goddess of the minoan era , ' he said in a public talk at the institute . he looked at groupings of signs found on three of parts of one side of the disk to come up with this theory . they spell out i-qe-ku-rja and he said that i-qe means ` great lady of importance ' . on the other side of the double-sided disk , he identified the word akka , which he says means ` pregnant mother ' . therefore , he thinks that one side is dedicated to a pregnant woman and the other to a woman giving birth . speaking in a ted talk in may , he explained how he worked with john coleman at oxford university for six years to crack the code . ` it 's the closest thing to a partial minoan rosetta stone , ' he said , stating that they can now read 90 per cent of ` side a ' of the disk . their next challenge is to work out exactly what the signs means , but dr owens is sure it is a ` genuine minoan religious inscription ' . he light-heartedly likened the ancient disk to a cd-rom because it stores information . ` it could stand for clay disk -- read only minos , ' he quipped . the disk is so important because it is from minoan crete -- the first literate civilisation in europe . the disk is thought to date to the middle minoan bronze age , in the second millennium bc and was discovered in 1900 at the palace of phasitos -lrb- pictured -rrb- , in the north eastern crete .", "summary": " ancient clay disk found in crete ` stores ' a prayer to a mother .   experts have been trying to read the pictorial signs for a century and this is the latest interpretation of the mysterious disk .   phaistos disk is made up of 241 ` tokens ' made up of 45 unique signs .   dr gareth owens of the technological educational institute -lrb- tei -rrb- of crete has identified keywords such as ` mother ' and ` woman of great importance '   the next step is to unravel the specific meaning and ancient use for the disk .
