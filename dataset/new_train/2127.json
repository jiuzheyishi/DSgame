{"text": "roger federer took time out from his off-season training regimen to answer questions on twitter from his legions of fans . among the things they learned earlier this month was that federer 's favorite fruits were strawberry , apple and mango and that he has visited 55 countries . when asked what he planned to get wife mirka for christmas , the funnier side of the 17-time grand slam champion emerged : a  hashtag ,  he replied . he added that he was  working overtime  to win the australian open in january -- which leads us to the first of five burning questions looking ahead to the 2014 tennis season . can roger federer win another grand slam ? the numbers , so often in favor of history maker federer , were less kind to the swiss in 2013 . he failed to reach a grand slam final for the first time since 2002 , his grand slam quarterfinal streak ended at 36 and his year-end ranking of no. 6 was his lowest in 11 years . federer only won one tournament , on grass in halle , germany -- though he was bounced from wimbledon a few weeks later in the second round after claiming the title at the all england club a record seven times . longtime coach paul annacone was axed months later . his back problems returned , with federer saying it was a mistake to keep playing at the bnp paribas open in march when the back flared up . it was indeed a slump -- well , for federer . but federer says he is now fit , which helped the 32-year-old finish the season on a high .  my self-confidence has also returned ,  he told the website of one of his sponsors , credit suisse , in late november .  by the end , everyone around me was talking positively again . the mood was much better than in the summer .  that boosts my morale for the coming year , and it 's a big relief . the fun has definitely returned .  federer said he would like to win  about  five tournaments in 2014 and play in  great finals .  the majors are what matter to federer most , and if he was to claim the australian open he would become the second oldest man -- behind andre agassi -- to bag a singles grand slam in the last 40 years . federer probably needs to beat two of rafael nadal , novak djokovic and andy murray to collect an 18th major but his recent record against the trio is underwhelming . he has lost four straight to nadal , three straight to djokovic and fell to murray in an absorbing australian open semifinal last january . no matter what happens to federer in 2014 , though , he 'll still be a major talking point . can anyone stop rafael nadal at the french open ? statistically , nadal became the best player ever at the french open when he won an unprecedented eighth title on the red clay at roland garros . only once has he failed to win in paris in the spring , when robin soderling , nadal 's wonky knees and the then split of the mallorcan 's parents made for a combination too powerful to overcome in 2009 . since then he has captured four in succession . but nadal came within an inch of likely losing at the french open this year to djokovic . the serb led by a break 4-3 in the fifth set of their semifinal when he touched the net before a point ended at deuce . it was an easy put away that nadal had no chance of reaching . djokovic lost the point , nadal broke back and he won 9-7 in the fifth . only two months prior , djokovic snapped nadal 's 46-match winning streak , dating back to 2005 , at the clay-court monte carlo masters . if anyone is to get the better of nadal at the french open next year -- assuming he is healthy -- djokovic , who has appointed boris becker as the head of his coaching team , is the lone serious candidate . who can derail serena williams ? serena williams compiled a 78-4 record in 2013 for the best winning percentage on the women 's tour since 1990 and she took home nearly $ 12.4 million in prize money -- the most ever for a female tennis player in a season . williams was stunned by sabine lisicki at wimbledon in one of those four losses but weeks earlier lifted the french open trophy for the first time since 2002 . when she triumphed at the u.s. open in september , the american climbed to 17 majors to approach chris evert -- once her critic -- and martina navratilova . unlike her fellow 32-year-old federer , williams does n't have as many roadblocks in front of her so she could keep on collecting grand slam titles in bunches . world no. 2 victoria azarenka has yet to win a grand slam outside australia and maria sharapova is returning from another serious shoulder injury . they 're williams ' two main rivals . williams ' first order of business is to end azarenka 's two-tournament reign in melbourne after injuries hampered her down under in 2012 and this year . how will andy murray recover from his back injury ? murray missed the last two months of the season following back surgery and all eyes are on the scot to see how he 'll rebound in 2014 . as the likes of federer , agassi and murray 's coach , ivan lendl , can attest , back problems are difficult to shake . he is due to return to action at an exhibition tournament in abu dhabi on boxing day against jo-wilfried tsonga and might also face djokovic and nadal .  it 's exactly the test i need to see where my game is at ,  murray was quoted as saying by espn uk online . thankfully for murray he was able to end britain 's 77-year wait for a men 's singles champion at wimbledon -- before the back forced him off tour -- when he toppled djokovic in july . prior to nadal re-emerging on the circuit in february , djokovic and murray contested two straight grand slam finals . murray wants to make more history , said mom judy .  andy 's goal is to win more grand slams and try to achieve that end-of-year world no. 1 ranking ,  she was quoted as saying by the scotsman newspaper this week . can anyone new win a major ? with the men 's big four around , unearthing a new grand slam champion in 2014 figures to be difficult . since the spring of 2005 , only one man not named federer , nadal , djokovic or murray has won a grand slam -- juan martin del potro at the 2009 u.s. open . recent years , however , tell us it could happen on the women 's tour . for four straight seasons a debutante has come through at a major , marion bartoli being the most recent at wimbledon . bartoli was the first to admit she benefited from a nice draw , with williams , sharapova and azarenka all exiting before the quarterfinals .", "summary": " roger federer hopes to win  about five  tournaments in 2014 and play in  great  finals .   the swiss ends 2013 at no. 6 , his lowest year-end ranking since 2002 .   serena williams is one major short of tying martina navratilova and chris evert .   andy murray returns to the pro circuit in 2014 after undergoing back surgery in september .
