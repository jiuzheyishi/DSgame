{"text": "prince harry is currently in cape town awaiting an improvement in weather conditions so that he , along with his fellow walking with the wounded teammates , can fly to antarctica 's novo airbase and begin acclimating their bodies to the extreme conditions before their 200-mile trek to the south pole . by committing to head to the bottom of the earth alongside his team , harry is setting a whole new precedent in terms of royal charity involvement for the future . members of the royal family serve to provide continuity , promote british interests , and act as global ambassadors by representing all that is great about great britain , but a large percentage of their operational life is devoted to charity work . for decades royals have travelled the length and breadth of the country , and indeed the globe , on behalf of their many organizations . they act as patron or president , raise awareness of the cause , cut ribbons , unveil plaques , attend dinners , plant trees , and most importantly -- raise money . a royal patronage is about the best gift a charity can receive short of a wealthy benefactor bequeathing millions of dollars to the cause on their death bed , and in times of recession and economic hardship the survival of many charities rests on the regal shoulders of its patron . at 87 the queen has more than 600 patronages and at 92 prince philip has about 800 . according to a recent time magazine article , prince charles raised $ 224 million for his charities between april 2012 and march 2013 . tickets to the upcoming winter whites gala on behalf of homeless charity centrepoint were going for the princely sum of Ã‚ # 500 before selling out almost immediately . the reason for the large price tag and instant sell out ? prince william , patron of centrepoint , will be in attendance . charities can command top dollar when a senior royal rolls out . along with said royal comes a legion of reporters and wealthy benefactors , and whenever kate 's involved you can pretty much guarantee the occasion making front page news the following day . that type of attention leaves charity heads googly-eyed . the royals have always approached charity engagements with enthusiasm , well aware that their presence allows for worldwide exposure . one need only to look at coverage of diana shaking hands with an aids patient in 1989 , or her walk through a partially-cleared land mine field in angola in 1997 , to understand the power of a globally recognized figure . william and harry , however , have taken things one step further in recent years by rolling up their proverbial sleeves and throwing themselves in at ground level . in december 2009 prince william spent the night sleeping rough near blackfriars bridge in central london . he did so in order to gain a better understanding of what the homeless community experiences night after night . had he simply dished out soup and shaken hands with a few volunteers he still would have drawn attention to the work of the charity centrepoint , but by actually bedding down on the streets of central london he significantly heightened public awareness . in march 2011 prince harry joined a team of injured servicemen for the first five days of their trek to the north pole . yes , of course it was about raising money for the charity walking with the wounded , but as harry said at the time , it was also about raising an awareness of the debt the country owes to those it sends off to fight . harry has made no secret of his dedication to the welfare of injured servicemen and women , and the money raised enables the charity to fulfill its mission ; however , by taking part alongside his fellow soldiers , harry gave them far more than a well-funded charity . he showed them that they matter , that their loss matters , and that their lives may continue to inspire . looking to the future of the monarchy , charles has made it clear he wants to push for a more streamlined royal family , but i hope that when the time comes he will make room for extended members of the family to step up and continue their efforts on behalf of their chosen charities . as the only blood-born princesses of their generation , beatrice and eugenie have already shown a readiness to support causes meaningful to them . were the queen to give them an  official  role , their potential could be enormous . it comes down to simple mathematics : streamline the monarchy , and funding to the smaller charities that rely on a royal patron slips down the tubes . royals and charity work will always go hand-in-hand -- and long may it be so . plaques will remain , trees will grow , and the work of the charity in question will continue , but it is this new hardcore approach that is so exciting . it wo n't work for everyone , and it would lose its impact if suddenly every engagement required rigorous training , compression chambers , hard hats , life vests and the likes , but we should salute prince harry on his epic polar endeavor . harry 's physical disability may be limited to a broken toe , but walking alongside those brave wounded warriors will no doubt leave him with an unbreakable spirit . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of victoria arbiter .", "summary": " prince harry is in cape town waiting to continue preparing for a 200-mile trek to the south pole .   much of the royals ' operational lives are devoted to charity work , writes victoria arbiter .   at 87 the queen has more than 600 patronages and at 92 prince philip has about 800 , she says .   she says prince william and harry , however , have taken things one step further .
