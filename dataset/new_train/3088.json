{"text": "recommendations : the report was put together by former civil servant sir joseph pelling , pictured . gay couples should be allowed to have their relationships blessed in church , the church of england said yesterday . bishops should lift their official ban on ceremonies to mark civil partnerships and the relationships of gay and lesbian churchgoers , a long-awaited cofe report said . it signalled an end to the church 's longstanding insistence that gay relationships are sinful and less worthy than heterosexual marriage . the report , written by former civil servant sir joseph pilling and a team of senior churchmen and women , may now open the way for a reversal of the cofe 's opposition to same-sex marriage and the eventual appointment of actively homosexual priests and bishops . it was published seven months after the church first indicated it is looking at ` accommodations ' for same-sex couples and four months after the archbishop of canterbury , the most reverend justin welby , told church leaders that ` we must accept there is a revolution in the area of sexuality . ' archbishop welby said yesterday that bishops will now ` consider the report and decide how such a process might best be shaped . ' in its key paragraph the pilling report declared : ` we believe there can be circumstances where a priest , with the agreement of the parish , should be free to mark the formation of a permanent same-sex relationship in a public service but should be under no obligation to do so . ' acknowledging arguments among the report team , it added : ` some of us do not believe that this can be extended to same-sex marriage . ' current cofe guidance laid down by bishops forbids priests to conduct same-sex blessing services . nevertheless , some estimates say 200 such services a year are carried out in anglican churches . bishops could permit gay blessing services simply by changing their guidelines . their first opportunity to do so will come at meetings next month and in january . the pilling report calls for two years of ` facilitated conversations ' on a series of ideas that will sweep away the decades of opposition to gay rights if a majority in the church accept them . such talks may prove ` difficult and divisive ' a statement by archbishop welby admitted . it called for the talks to end the rule dating from 1991 that says gays are welcome in the pews but that clergy must not be actively homosexual . ` the church 's present rules impose different disciplines on clergy and laity in relations to sexually active same-sex relationships , ' the report said . ` it will be important to reflect on the extent to which laity and clergy should continue to observe such different disciplines . ' the report suggested that reforms might go ahead through bringing in different rules for junior clergy and for bishops - rules similar to those which currently allow women priests but not women bishops . the row over gay bishops has been toxic for the anglicans since the last archbishop of canterbury , lord williams , prevented the appointment of openly gay canon jeffery john as a bishop in 2003 . dr john is now dean of st albans . under consideration : the archbishop of canterbury , justin welby , said the church will now consider the recommendations . in a series of calls for new thinking , the report said the church should show ` real repentance for the lack of welcome and acceptance extended to homosexual people in the past ' . however , it added : ` no-one should be accused of homophobia solely for articulating traditional christian teaching on same-sex relationships . ' the report suggested that the bible does not condemn homosexuality and said no-one should teach that it does . it also warned that liberal attitudes to homosexuality in western countries can cause trouble in countries where christians are vulnerable to attack . congregations in countries like nigeria and pakistan , where homosexuality is universally condemned by muslims , have been subjected to violence in recent years . the report said : ` it is important , for some a matter of life and death , that the church and church people speak with great care and attentiveness to how their words will be received , not only in their own culture but in cultures where christians are marginalised . ' the cofe set itself against the gay rights agenda in 1987 , at a time when pressure for recognition of gay relationships by anglicans was just beginning . its parliament , the general synod , said then that gay sex was sinful . last year the church strongly opposed david cameron 's same-sex marriage legislation , saying it would wreck traditional marriage and undermine families . the pilling report said that there should be no formal liturgy for same-sex blessing services , but consenting priests and parishes should be allowed to work out their own form of service . it hinted strongly that full acceptance of same-sex marriage is on the way . ` a willingness to offer public recognition and prayer for a committed same-sex relationship would , in practice , be hard to implement now for civil partnerships without also doing so for same-sex marriage , ' it said . one member of the report team , the bishop of birkenhead , the right reverend keith sinclair , said he was unable to accept the recommendations .", "summary": " report signals an end to church stance that gay relationships are sinful .   recommendations could lead to actively homosexual priests and bishops .   it was put together by former civil servant sir joseph pilling .
