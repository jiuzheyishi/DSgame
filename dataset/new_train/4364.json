{"text": "world no. 1 victoria azarenka plans to take a break from tennis following her shock fourth-round defeat at the french open on sunday . the 22-year-old , who lost 6-2 7-6 -lrb- 7-4 -rrb- to 15th seed dominika cibulkova , said she was jaded after the opening months of the season in which she won her first grand slam at the australian open and went on a 26-match winning streak . however , the belorussian lost in finals in stuttgart and madrid before pulling out ahead of a second-round clash against the diminutive cibulkova in rome last month due to a shoulder injury . she will lose the top ranking if rome champion maria sharapova can reach the final in paris for the first time in her career .  there has been a lot of tennis for me in the last five months ,  she said .  i have n't been home in a while , and it 's something that i need just to get rested mentally , definitely , and just to get out of the tennis field a little bit .  and once i have my passion and desire back on the court , i 'll be on the grass .  paris goes to beijing ? the li na effect . azarenka had previously lost to the slovakian just once in eight meetings , but five of those had gone to three sets and two were remarkable comeback victories . she had to come from a set and 4-0 down in her opening match in paris last monday , but could not pull off an escape this time as she smashed two rackets in frustration .  today i could n't do it . it was just not going for me . i tried everything . all i could hope for was her mistakes ,  azarenka said .  i think she plays much better against the top players than maybe a little bit lower-ranked players . she really has that desire . i do n't know what motivates her to play that way .  cibulkova reached the french open semifinals in 2009 , but said she was nervous she would again blow her advantage against azarenka -- who stands nine inches taller at six foot .  you ca n't be human if you were n't thinking about that ,  she said .  because this year in miami i was 6-1 5-2 up against her . and last year in miami it was the same .  today it happened the same when i was 4-2 up . and that 's why i got a little bit ... not nervous , but not going for my shots anymore .  but today it was a great thing that i managed to go through these emotions . she was 6-5 up , and i said , ` hey , come on , you have to play your game again and just make it . '  the 23-year-old will next face u.s. open champion sam stosur of australia , who beat 79th-ranked american teenager sloane stephens . sixth seed stosur , the french open runner-up in 2010 , ended the 19-year-old 's dream run as she won 7-5 6-4 in 85 minutes . stephens lost in the first round last year and has not won a match in three attempts at her home grand slam . italy 's sara errani earlier reached the quarterfinals after beating 2009 french open champion svetlana kuznetsova . the 21st seed , who also made the last eight in melbourne in january and has won three clay titles this season , won 6-0 7-5 to set up a clash with angelique kerber . the german 10th seed , who lost to stosur in the new york semifinals in september in her best grand slam achievement , ended the hopes of 21-year-old croatian petra martic as she won 6-3 7-5 on court suzanne lenglen .", "summary": " top-ranked victoria azarenka beaten in last-16 clash by slovakia 's dominika cibulkova .   world no. 1 loses to the 15th seed for only the second time in nine encounters .   cibulkova , a semifinalist in 2009 , will next face u.s. open champion sam stosur .   german 10th seed angelique kerber also in last eight along with italy 's sara errani .
