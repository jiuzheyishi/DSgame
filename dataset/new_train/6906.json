{"text": "andy murray has criticised alex salmond 's decision to ` photobomb ' david cameron with a saltire after he won last year 's wimbledon finals . stressing he always plays as a brit , yhe tennis ace said he ` did n't like it ' when the first minister unfurled the flag in the royal box , moments after his dramatic win over novak djokovic . mr salmond was widely criticised at the time for trying to hijack the sporting triumph to push his case for scottish independence , with critics telling him to ` put it away dear ' . scroll down for video . scottish nationalist leader alex salmond waved the scottish flag after andy murray won the 2013 wimbledon men 's singles final . murray has revealed he ` did n't like it ' but was nervous about expressing a view on scottish independence . mr salmond smuggled the blue and white flag into centre court in the handbag of his wife , moira . as the crowd stood to applaud murray 's win in straight sets , he pulled the saltire out and waved it around directly behind mr cameron 's head . the move was seen as a crass attempt to politicise one of the crown jewels in the sporting calendar . now , almost a year later , murray himself has admitted he was not happy with the stunt . in an interview with the sunday times he said had met mr salmond after winning the us open in 2012 . ` he seemed perfectly nice to me but i did n't like it when he -lsb- salmond -rsb- got the scottish flag up at wimbledon , ' murray said . mr salmond defended his behaviour last year , insisting it had been a long time coming . barack obama spoke out against independence . alex salmond today expressed surprise at us president barack obama issuing a public warning against independence . mr obama last week said the us wanted britain to remain ` strong , robust , united and effective ' , adding : ` from the . outside , at least , it looks like things have worked pretty well . ' in response , mr salmond told bbc one 's mar show : ; it was certainly surprising , because the american government had made it very clear they were staying studiously neutral in the democratic referendum that is taking place in scotland . ` but then of course , david cameron has been begging everybody internationally to say anything to help with his travails at the moment . he 's right to be worried , incidentally -- the latest yes poll 's at 46 per cent . ` so perhaps on the richter scale of presidential interventions , this was pretty mild . it 's a matter for the folks of scotland ; he hopes that the uk will be strong and united as an ally . well , if scotland becomes independent , america will have two allies in these islands , not one . ' ` it 's the first scot since harold mahony in 1896 -- it 's not something that happens very often , so i think a few saltires hoisted over wimbledon does n't really harm at all , the snp leader said . ` this was after the match was finished , incidentally . this was part of the celebration . ` and the answer is no , i am not responsible for the seating arrangements in the royal box . ' i had the flag last year , actually -- i just did n't get the chance to wave it . ' but tory education secretary michael gove said at the time : ' i think it was a wee bit of a stunt ... my advice to alex would just be  put it away dear  . ' murray remains cautious about being seen to express a view on the prospect of scotland breaking away from the uk , but he insisted he had always played as a brit . he added : ` i started competing for great britain when i was 11 . ` i 'm 27 now and i 've been competing for great britain for 16 years . ' a year before winning the wimbledon championships in 2013 , murray won gold on the same court in the london 2012 olympic games . but he said he did not know who he would play for if scotland does go it alone . voters in scotland will decide whether to back independence in a referendum on september 18 . while recent polls have suggested support for independence is growing , an ipsosmori last week put yes on 36 per cent and no on 54 per cent . politicians on both sides of the debate have locked horns on the merits and dangers of breaking up the uk , but few scottish celebrities have spoken out in fear of alienating half of the country . actor sean connery is backing the yes campaign , while singer rod stewart , comedian billy connolly and cyclist sir chris hoy have voiced doubts about independence . those who have urged scotland to stay in the uk -- including singer david bowie -- have been viciously criticised online by the so-called cybernats . mr salmond insisted that there was nothing wrong with celebrating the first scot winning wimbledon since 1896 . murray suggested this was playing a part in his decision not to express a view either way . ' i do n't know even when i was younger whether that is something i would have talked about , ' he added . ` it 's very difficult to have an opinion these days because half the people will agree with you and half of the people will think you 're an absolute idiot , ' he said . a spokesman for mr salmond said : ` andy is reigning wimbledon champion and a great scottish tennis player . he has made it clear a number of times that he does n't want to comment on scottish politics . ` everyone should just accept that and let him get on with playing tennis , rather than attempt to put him on the spot about who he would play for in a future olympics .
