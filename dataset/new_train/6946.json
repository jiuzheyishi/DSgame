' i do n't suit scarves and my complexion is shot with the chemo . so i am afraid . no hair = sickness . and that 's a fact , i have also seen how my lickle ones respond at the mention . it is a visual reminder mummy is n't well . so much to try and understand and that 's just the loss of hair . wig day has suddenly become very important x ' on november 9 , 2013 , the mother-of-five offered these words of wisdom to others , ` do n't count the days , make the days count ' . a post on november 14 , said : ` can it get worse i ask myself ? yes it really can ... and i 'm sure it will . ' i was advised not to see this as a battle but i think i will disagree . fighting this mind , body and should twister takes every ounce of my energy : . will the chemo work?if so , how much will it do?how long have i got?how awful on a scale of 10 today , oh another 9 . will i be able to walk today?will i lose my hair today?will my support fall away?am i better off not existing at all ? it 's a veritable melting pot of teenage angst.i wish i was a bigger person lol and able to be really grown up and level headed . i only needed another 20 years to reach that echelon . ' ` she supported me during the birth of my children and was my birthing partner for all three of my births and she was amazing . ` towards . the end we were able to repay some of that support and we sang songs to . her that she used to sing to us when we were young during her final . hour . ` she just got on with things . even when they stopped the medication she fought for another 24 hours . ' her daughter jemma campbell , 20 , added : ` we were always a team and did everything together . it was me and her against the world . ` everybody . loved her . when i was at school all my friends would come over just to . see her . whenever anyone had a problem they would turn to her .
