{"text": "england 's trip to estonia might not be one to grab the headlines but , personally speaking , it certainly brings back memories . this is only the second time england have been to tallinn but the first occasion we were there , on june 6 , 2007 for a euro 2008 qualifier , i realised that i could no longer carry on representing my country . that was the match that pushed me into international retirement . a fortnight earlier , i had just played in my second champions league final in three years . that game against ac milan came at the end of a season when my form had been consistently good , so i felt i had solid claims to be considered for a starting role for england . jamie carragher -lrb- left -rrb- was left on the bench as england beat estonia 3-0 in a euro 2008 qualifier in june , 2007 . ledley king -lrb- centre -rrb- was chosen to partner john terry -lrb- right -rrb- in the absence of the injured rio ferdinand . midfielder joe cole -lrb- second from left -rrb- is congratulated after scoring against estonia at the a. le coq arena . on the friday before we headed out to estonia , wembley hosted its first england senior game since its redevelopment , against brazil . rio ferdinand was injured and i thought i 'd take his place alongside john terry but i played right back and was n't overly thrilled with my performance . i had hoped it was just an experiment but ledley king retained his place next to terry for the game in the le coq arena , which england comfortably won 3-0 . i stayed on the bench and when steve mcclaren made that decision , i knew the final nail had been put in the coffin for me , internationally . it was in tallinn that i knew the time had come to concentrate solely on liverpool . carragher -lrb- right -rrb- had started at right back for england in a friendly with brazil at wembley five days earlier . brazil forward robinho -lrb- right -rrb- tries to hold off a challenge from carragher during the 1-1 draw . this week i 'm looking forward to ... immersing myself in roy keane 's book . i 've just got my copy of the second half and although i am only a couple of chapters into it , it has not disappointed . people have their own opinions of roy and some would be fearful of him , given how outspoken he can be . i have always judged people how i find them and i can honestly say that i have never found a fault in him . during euro 2012 , i worked with him on itv as a pundit . as you can imagine , he was never afraid to say what he thought but , away from the cameras , he was always good company and he enjoys talking about football . this latest book has generated a lot of headlines but i do n't think it should be forgotten what a magnificent player roy was . former manchester united midfielder roy keane poses at the launch of his new book at the aviva stadium . carragher -lrb- second from right -rrb- and keane -lrb- right -rrb- worked together as itv pundits during euro 2012 . i would have loved to have been on the same team as him and it must have been a joy for centre backs to have him standing in front , for the cover he would provide . do not underestimate , however , the skill he had . i noticed wayne rooney said in a recent interview that he regarded roy as the best passer of the ball he played with and i could see no reason to argue with that claim as his distribution was magnificent . he had a fabulous career and i know i 'm going to enjoy reading about it . keane lifts the lid on his career at manchester united in his latest autobiography the second half .", "summary": " england last faced estonia in a euro 2008 qualifier in june , 2007 .   rio ferdinand was out injured and ledley king was chosen to partner john terry in the centre of defence .   jamie carragher decided to concentrate on liverpool after being left on the bench for the 3-0 win .   he had started at right back in a friendly with brazil less than a week before .   carragher has started reading roy keane 's new autobiography the second half , which was released this week .
