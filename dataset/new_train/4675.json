{"text": "nelson mandela 's willingness to forgive and forget helped peacefully end an era of white domination in his native south africa . but as news of his death spread , mourners there and around the world professed that he , himself , would never be forgotten .  mandela 's biggest legacy ... was his remarkable lack of bitterness and the way he did not only talk about reconciliation , but he made reconciliation happen in south africa ,  said f.w. de klerk , south africa 's last white president before giving way to mandela , the country 's first black leader . south africa 's current leader announced late thursday that , after years suffering from health ailments , the man known widely by his clan name of madiba died at 8:50 p.m. -lrb- 1:50 p.m. et -rrb- surrounded by family . he

the official sapa news agency reported early friday that mandela 's body had been moved to a military hospital in pretoria . it 's expected to be embalmed in the next three to four days , after which there will be a public memorial service at a johannesburg soccer stadium , according to government sources . then , his casket will lie in state for several days in pretoria , and next week -- probably friday or saturday -- it will be flown to his ancestral hometown of qunu for a state funeral and burial , the sources said . until that funeral , zuma has ordered flags around south africa to be  flown at half-mast ,  something that other countries including the united states and united kingdom are also doing . the african national congress -- the political party long associated with mandela -- said  our nation has lost a colossus , an epitome of humility , equality , justice , peace and the hope of millions .   the large african baobab , who loved africa as much as he loved south africa , has fallen ,  the party said in a statement , comparing mandela to a sturdy tree found in africa .  its trunk and seeds will nourish the earth for decades to come .  as news spreads , mourners recall ` remarkable man ' throngs -- some of them in pajamas , due to the late hour -- gathered outside mandela 's house in a johannesburg suburb after word of his death was announced , with people of all races singing , dancing and otherwise paying tribute to the late leader . some said the news had n't sunk in yet , while others expressed relief that he died peacefully , according to the official sapa news agency .  we must pay tribute to mandela , the best state leader of all time ,  said 23-year-old zaid paruk . similar scenes broke out elsewhere in the country including soweto

national anthem upon hearing the news .  everyone is emotional but the messages that are going out are of love and happiness ,  said curling-hope , a cnn ireporter .  everyone is holding each other

mandela 's name  became synonymous with the pursuit of dignity and freedom across the globe .   a great light has gone out in the world ,  tweeted british prime minister david cameron .  nelson mandela was a hero of our time .  reaction from u.s. politicians was similarly swift , with ex-presidents george h. w. bush calling mandela  a man of tremendous moral courage  and bill clinton remembering him as  a man of uncommon grace and compassion , for whom abandoning bitterness and embracing adversaries was not just a political strategy but a way of life .  obama : ` he belongs to the ages '  we 've lost one of the most influential , courageous and profoundly good human beings that any of us will share time with on this earth ,  said current u.s. president barack obama , the first black leader of his own country who said his first public activism was an anti-apartheid protest .  he no longer belongs to us . he belongs to the ages .  kenyan activist : mandela saved my life . the immensely popular leader largely stayed out of the public spotlight in recent years due to his medical issues , including a hospitalization for a lung infection in june . on september 1 , mandela was discharged from a pretoria hospital where he had been receiving treatment since june , according to zuma 's office . he was moved to a home in the johannesburg suburb of houghton , where a bedroom was transformed into something akin to an intensive care unit , according to his ex-wife , winnie madikizela-mandela . last month , madikizela-mandela told south africa 's sunday independent newspaper that tubes used to clear his lungs meant to prevent infections also made it so that he could not speak . she said then that he  remains quite ill ,  with doctors tending to him regularly .  he communicates with the face , you see ,  madikizela-mandela told the newspaper then . his history of lung problems dates to his days in robben island , where he was imprisoned for 27 years as part of his fight to overturn the country 's system of racial segregation . tokyo sexwale , who was incarcerated a few meters from mandela , recalled him as  a very formidable and larger-than-life figure  who was nonetheless  very humble  and loving .  he was embraced even by white wardens , his own jailers , because he demonstrated that through the power of dialogue ... people on different sides , former enemies can come together ,  sexwale told cnn . toiled to dismantle entrenched apartheid . mandela emerged from prison more prominent than ever and in 1994 -- four years after his release and one year after earning the nobel peace prize with de klerk , who was then south africa 's president -- he became south africa 's first black president . statesman , president , ambassador to the world . mandela left the presidency in 1999 , but remained one of south africa 's most respected and revered international ambassadors , a model for world and particularly african leaders . and a new generation has been introduced to him through movies such as  invictus  and  mandela : long walk to freedom .  the latter film was in the middle of its london premiere when news broke of mandela 's death , though attendees -- prince william and catherine , duchess of cambridge , among them -- did n't learn about it until producer anant singh came onstage as the closing credits ran . he explained that mandela 's daughters had said the premiere should go on ; there then was a moment of silence in oden cinema .  it was as if he was born to teach the age a lesson in humility , in humor and above all else in patience ,  said bono , the u2 singer and africa activist .  in the end , nelson mandela showed us how to love rather than hate , not because he had never surrendered to rage or violence , but because he learned that love would do a better job .  hollywood reacts to loss of a legend . his last high-profile public appearance came in 2010 , when south africa hosted soccer 's world cup .
