{"text": "french officials exploded in outrage after bnp paribas agreed to plea guilty to criminal charges , pay nearly $ 9 billion in fines , and have access to dollar clearing suspended for a year for its persistent violations of us economic sanctions against iran , cuba and sudan . the international bank fell under us jurisdiction by virtue of facilitating transactions in dollars which passed through the us . most financial commentators had little sympathy with the french position , since the giant bank 's conduct was egregious . it included ongoing records-doctoring to hide the true identity of customers and stymieing the us investigation . but the french argument was essentially political : that the us had no right to impose its will on a foreign bank , and these transactions were legal under european law . yet this is far from the first time the us has used its position as issuer of the world 's reserve currency to advance its foreign policy agenda . for instance , in the suez crisis in 1956 , britain 's need for dollar credit to defend the pound enabled the us to force britain and france to pull back from military confrontation . the economic reality is that the us derives considerable power from its role as the issuer of the world 's reserve currency and its control over dollar-based payment systems . large banks run huge volumes of transactions with each other during the day . they are willing to do so because these systems are ultimately backstopped by the federal reserve . while parties unhappy with america 's use , and some would contend abuse , of us dollar dominance , financial institutions could set up dollar transaction mechanisms that completely skirted the us . but with low volumes and no fed protection , they 'd be vastly higher cost . the other alternative is to try to encourage more use of non-dollar currencies , like the euro and china 's renminbi . but the euro has no benchmark bond , plus continued concerns about political fracture and sovereign bond restructurings mean it 's not a contender to replace the greenback any time soon . and even though china has been aggressively promoting trade denominated in the renminbi , the volume is puny , a mere 1.5 % of the global total . but putting aside the international row , what does the bnp paribas settlement say about addressing misconduct at too big to fail banks ? perversely , while banks are wards of the state and get more support and subsidies than any other type of business -lrb- for instance , zirp and quantitative easing are massive transfers from savers to financial players -rrb- , the authorities have lacked the will to discipline them effectively . even though the bnp paribas fine exceeded a year of earnings , the bank 's stock rose 3.6 % when the deal was announced , saying that investors though bnp paribas had done well . the conundrum is indicting a bank at the parent level is widely perceived to be a potential death blow , since many counterparties would have to stop doing business with it immediately . removing the us banking licenses of a serial fraudster , another possible remedy , would similarly put a us firm out of business and would inflict severe , permanent damage on a big foreign bank . hence the tendency of officials to rely on big , or at least big-sounding , fines . but it is bankers , not banks , that commit crimes . here , the bnp paribas deal falls short . true , 13 officers were forced to resign , including one of its chief operating officers . but he was on the verge of retirement , and more important , no one was charged criminally or fined . by contrast , in 1991 , when salomon brothers failed to curb a trader that was repeatedly gaming government bond auctions , salomon 's ceo , vice chairman , and president departed abruptly . we 've seen nothing like that punishment meted out to top executives in the post-crisis wave of investigations . and until that happens , banks will continue to behave as if they have the upper hand . read more : why screen stars are battling europe 's banksread more : banks know that customers hate them .", "summary": " bnp paribas has been fined nearly $ 9 billion in fines for violations of us sanctions .   french authorities criticized the fine as excessive and disproportionate .   author yves smith says fines such as this have only limited impact on the banks .   banks will not change until top executives face punishment , yves smith writes .
