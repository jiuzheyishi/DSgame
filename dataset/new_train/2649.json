{"text": "san diego some people see a silver lining and go looking for a cloud . they just ca n't feel good about the world they live in , even when they 're presented with a feel-good story . instead of rejoicing in a positive development , they 're critical and cynical and mean . you 'll find these folks in both political parties , and all across the ideological spectrum . this includes the left-leaning media and the liberal blogosphere , where they seem to have a tough time praising a republican for doing something right . and some on the right would probably say that about me . i 've spent plenty of time in the last quarter century writing about things that republicans do wrong . but criticizing republicans when they deserve it does n't stop me from giving credit where it 's due . so let 's give credit to josh romney , the 38-year-old son of the 2012 republican presidential nominee , who , police have confirmed , helped four people -- a husband , wife , and two teenage sons -- after a car crash in holladay , utah . it all happened on thanksgiving night . after dinner with his parents and family , romney was driving home with his wife and children when , he told reporters , he saw a car speed by him and crash into the kitchen of a home . he rushed to the scene of the crash . he said that he helped the four passengers out of the wreckage of the car and , police confirmed , he walked them to the front lawn so they could get medical attention . an adult male was in the basement of the home at the time , and he was n't injured . and the family was n't seriously injured . that 's good news . afterward , romney went to twitter -- the modern-day town square -- and tweeted about the experience . he included a photo of himself standing next to the wreckage . this being a photo , he was smiling . the tweet simply read : .  was first on scene to big accident , see pic of car in the house . i lifted 4 people out to safety . all ok . thankful . Ã¢ $  josh romney -lrb- @joshromney -rrb- .  that 's it . not exactly a victory lap , is it ? yet , for his trouble , the hero of this story got hammered by the left and other twitter users .  why are you smiling like a tourist at such a horrific scene ?  wrote twitter user laila yuile in reaction to romney 's tweet . others wrote that romney 's post constituted a classic  humblebrag ,  a kind of sneaky boast where someone uses 140 characters to show off without letting it show . we are told that some consider  humblebragging  to be an even worse breach of etiquette than plain ol' generic bragging because it tends to be served up with a side of fake modesty . #seriously ? this is what we 've come to ? we now go hunting for bad behavior , even when someone does a good deed . is this sort of thing a result of boredom or poor manners ? abc news blogs reported that the term  humblebrag  was coined in 2011 by american comedian harris wittels . it noted the blowback this way : .  josh romney , mitt romney 's son , is drawing some flak after rescuing four people from a car crash on thanksgiving . it was n't the act itself that sparked the ire of so many on social media , but rather the tweet he posted in the aftermath of his self-acknowledged heroism .  united press international reported this : .  josh romney says he helped rescue victims of a car crash in utah , but now he 's getting grief for talking about it on twitter .  i admit that posing in front of wreckage from an auto accident is a little creepy . and , even in the age of twitter , it should be possible to render aid to those who need it without feeling compelled to broadcast it all over the internet . and yet , it 's hard to detect any amount of gloating either in the text of romney 's tweet , or in the statement he issued the day after the accident , part of which read : .  my family and i are grateful that no one was seriously injured and glad to have been able to help those affected by this terrible accident . what i did to help the people involved in the accident is what anyone else would do who witnessed such a potentially dangerous situation .  this young man sounds like a class act . which is more than i can say for those petty souls who , in this case , went out of their way to cast a good samaritan in a bad light . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of ruben navarrette .", "summary": " ruben navarrette : some look for gloom even in feel-good stories , like that of josh romney 's tweet .   romney tweeted picture of himself , saying he was first on scene of crash , helped victims .   he was slammed online for  humblebragging  ; navarrette : really ? helping a bad thing ?   navarrette : he sounds like a class act -- more than the haters deriding a good samaritan .
