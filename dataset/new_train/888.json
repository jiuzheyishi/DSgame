{"text": "a four-year-old boy who went into hospital to have his tonsils out died after drowning in his own blood as a result of a 15,000-to-one complication , an inquest heard . oakley gould seemed to be recovering well after the routine operation at his local hospital in stevenage , hertfordshire , and was sent home . but six days after the surgery , he began losing large amounts of blood during breakfast and his terrified parents paramedics hayley clark and david gould called an ambulance . doctors at the same hospital were unable to save oakley , who had suffered cardio-respiratory failure when his lungs filled up after a ` catastrophic bleed ' from a tiny artery . procedure : oakley gould had seemed to be recovering well after the routine operation at lister hospital in stevenage . the inquest heard that oakley had been back to hospital with a temperature and with low blood oxygen levels but was discharged again , with no indication of what was to come . coroner edward thomas told his grieving mother and father : ' i have heard what happened that day . ` oakley left hospital . he seemed ok and suddenly , during breakfast , he had this catastrophic bleed . ` what happened then will always be with you . i feel so sorry for you because it must have been absolutely awful . ' clinicians had recommended surgery for the youngster because he suffered from obstructive sleep apnoea , where his pronounced adenoids and tonsils made it hard for him to breathe , especially at night . dr petros vlastarakos said the operation on the boy 's tonsils was one of three similar ones on the day , and that he had carried out 142 of the procedures in the uk and about 40 more in his native greece . he used a bipolar diathermy , which uses a low electrical current to heat a concentrated area of tissue to cauterise arteries and veins to stop bleeding . he also tried to attach ties as an added measure but could only manage it on one of them , despite trying twice on the second one . his senior consultant colleague also tried but could not fit the tie . ' i could n't get a grip on the tissue , ' he said , yet he added that he believed he was the only surgeon in his department who used both diathermy and ties , as his colleagues were satisfied with just diathermy . he explained how , following the operation at the lister hospital , the usual checks were conducted and oakley was not bleeding . tragedy : the post-mortem examination on oakley was carried out at great ormond street hospital . marian malone , who carried out the autopsy at great ormond street hospital , told the coroner : ` at post mortem examination there was actually very little to see with the naked eye . it seemed to have healed as well as expected . ' i also examined to see if any damage had been done to the major arteries supplying that area and they were all intact . ' she said it was only when she examined samples under a microscope that she found an artery with necrosis , or dying tissue , in its wall . in the absence of any infection , she suggested a possible cause of the so-called secondary haemorrhage could have been part of the healing process itself . ` granulation tissue is healing tissue and it has lots of blood vessels growing in it because it is the new tissue growing in to repair . it is very vascular , ' she said . ` the granulated tissue is all healing and you have the broken surface on top . the tissue is gradually replaced but just at the stage when the damaged tissue is coming off it is possible to have secondary haemorrhage . ` the next area is very rich in vessels and is exposed to the surface . it is typical of how catastrophic haemorrhage happens . ' explaining that the condition was ` recognised , albeit rare ' , she warned : ` there are many publications demonstrating that it can even happen in hospital , that patients can die because of the rapidity . ' dr vlastarakos added that the only way oakley would have stood a chance of survival were if he and an anaesthetist had been standing by him with their equipment when the haemorrhage occurred . mr thomas recorded a narrative verdict on oakley at the inquest in hatfield , adding : ' i will record that oakley died from a recognised late complication from an operative procedure . ' he told the parents : ` one of the sad things is that what happened here is extremely rare but not rare to the people who suffer from it , because it happened to you .
