{"text": "an italian trade union has been slammed by jewish groups for offering a spoof ` hitler prize ' to people who work with animals , who have been targeted by extremists . feder fauna , a union for people working commercially with animals such as breeders and farmers , named the prize because the nazi leader created a law to protect animals while ordering human experiments . the union has called on its members to nominate those they considered ` most worthy ' of receiving the award such as those who have suffered violence from animal rights activists . crass : a poster for the italian trade union 's ` hitler prize ' , which has enraged jewish groups . massimiliano filippi , general secretary of feder fauna , said : ` the hitler prize represents a condemnation of those who trample on human rights in the name of the ideology of  animal rights  ! ' i find that asking to stop experiments on rats and proposing instead experiments be done on prisoners has a close affinity to nazism . ' a poster for the prize features a . picture of hitler feeding two deer at the entrance to the auschwitz . concentration camp in occupied poland where 1.3 million people were killed . after coming into power in 1933 , the nazis brought in a raft of laws to protects animals . the first was a law banning vivisection which was enacted in august 1933 , by hermann g√∂ring as the prime minister of prussia . in november 1933 , the reichstierschutzgesetz -lrb- reich animal protection act -rrb- was brought in banning , among other things , the force-feeding of birds , commercial animal trapping and the docking the ears and tails off dogs without anesthesia , was also banned . regulations were placed on the boiling of . lobsters and crabs in restaurants and in one case , goering even sent a . fisherman to a concentration camp for cutting up a frog to use as bait . severe restrictions were placed on hunting , and the shoeing of horses became regulated . the nazis also established nature preserves , and introduced a . school curriculum for the humane treatment of animals . it features the slogan animal rights ' with the word ` rights ' replaced with ` reich ' . however despite having an anti-nazi message , the prize has been condemned for diminishing the suffering of those who died in the holocaust and because it could be seen to show hitler in a positive light . italy 's only female rabbi barbara aeillo told the local that the prize ` exemplifies a disturbing trend of intolerance and hate that is on the rise not only in italy but throughout europe . ` creeping nazism is a slow but steady trend that minimizes the holocaust , demeans the memory of those murdered and diminishes the suffering of the survivors . ` the fact that a competition like the hitler award is even conceivable , let alone celebrated , is more than troubling and indicates a significant change in the italian public 's general tolerance for anti-semitic remarks and activity . ' angelo bonelli , leader of italy 's green party , described the prize as a ` sordid provocation ' . last week former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi provoked outrage when he said his children are persecuted ` like jews under hitler ' . asked about whether his five children had asked him to sell his media empire and leave italy to escape his legal troubles , berlusconi said : ` my children say that they feel like jewish families in germany under hitler 's regime . truly , everyone is against us . ' nazi germany under adolf hitler murdered an estimated six million jews during world war two .", "summary": " trade union feder fauna slammed over controversially-named prize .   nazis created laws to protect animals while ordering human experiments .   union claims prize condemns who put animal rights before human rights .   but italian rabbi claims it demeans the memory of holocaust victims .
