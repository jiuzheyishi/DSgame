{"text": "while most people will turn and run in the face of an erupting volcano , photographer daniel fox heads straight for the heat . the canadian daredevil is fascinated by hypnotising beauty of lava and spent last month capturing these spectacular images of a lava field in kalapana , hawaii . taking the images meant risking his life to get just a couple of feet away from the intense heat . ` sometimes i could barely stay long enough to take one photo before feeling my face burn , ' he said . scroll down to his mesmerizing video . extreme photographer , daniel fox , 39 , is fascinated by the hypnotising beauty of lava and spent last month capturing these spectacular images while visiting a friend who lives next to a lava field in kalapana . fox describes the images as ` visceral , organic or intense ' . he would shoot two or three times a week , leaving at 6pm to hike 90 minutes searching for active lava . the intense heat causes the fiery lava to glow spectacularly against the night sky forming hundreds of unique shapes as it flows across the hawaiian landscape . the liquid temperature of lava as it explodes through a volcanic vent ranges from 700 to 1,200 °c . it is 100,000 times as thick as water and can travel huge distances before cooling and turning solid . from stark zigzagged lines to breath-taking bulges which look like a human heart no two flows are ever the same . the 39-year old photographer , who has lived in the us for the past 15 years , could only snap a single shot at each spot before the intense heat would begin to burn . he would shoot two or three times a week , leaving at 6pm to hike 90 minutes searching for active lava . ` i had to be careful for the camera as with all the electronics and the memory card , the last thing i wanted was for anything to melt , ' he said . from stark zigzagged lines to breath-taking bulges which look like a human heart , no two flows are ever the same . the intense heat causes the fiery lava to glow spectacularly against the night sky , forming hundreds of unique shapes as it flows across the hawaiian landscape . the liquid temperature of lava as it explodes through a volcanic vent ranges from 700 to 1,200 °c . it is 100,000 times as thick as water and can travel huge distances before cooling and turning solid . fox risked his life to take these images . he said that he could sometimes could barely stay long enough to take one photo before feeling his face burn . ` hiking to the lava field is extremely dangerous . just a couple of weeks ago another tourist died and earlier this year a men fell into the lava . ` people do n't realise how dangerous it is until too late . i 've seen some venturing out with only flip flops , shorts and no water . fox first visited the area for a weekend in march and fell in love with it . he came back with the intent of producing content for his next photo exhibit . ` although interesting i always see the same kind of lava photography -- with long exposures , at dusk or dawn and showing the environment . ` but there is so much more to it . every time lava pushes itself out it creates new unique forms -- it 's like a snowflake each is different , none are alike . ' fox aimed to take abstract , artistic photos by using a telephoto lens rather than a wide-angle one . to do this , he used a canon 100-400mm and canon 100-300mm on his canon 7d . most lava photography uses long exposures , at dusk or dawn . fox 's images are more abstract and show the intense beauty of lava removed from its environment . fox aimed to take abstract , artistic photos by using a telephoto lens rather than a wide-angle one . to do this , he used a canon 100-400mm and canon 100-300mm on his canon 7d . as the lava cools and crystallises it begins to contract and turn into igneous rock . sometimes lava can accumulate in volcanic craters creating what is known lava lakes . ` the lava field a factory of abstract art and that is what i wanted to capture -- a more artistic perspective capturing the details , textures , shapes and forms that we usually miss , ' he said . ` the resulting photos are sometime zen , visceral , organic , or intense . ' the images may look like a series of abstract paintings , but fox said he left most of the photos relatively untouched , apart from some masking , rotating , cropping and lightroom image adjustments . ` you have to be really careful and know what to expect -- you have the normal heat from the lava , the accelerated dehydration cause by the wind and temperatures , the acid fumes , the extremely sharp lava rock , the treacherous terrain and the lack of orientation at night , ' said fox . ` you have to look for hollow spots that will give in when walking on them , which happened to me and resulted in a deep gash on my shin . then there are the whiteouts when it rains , turning the entire place into a massive steam room . ' video : fox . shot footage of the lava as part of his story on time and our perspective on it . time from daniel fox on vimeo . but if chasing 1,200 °c lava was n't impressive enough , fox is now planning a six year around-the-world sailing journey called the epic expedition . the 200,000 mile sailing expedition will see fox visit over 250 remote islands while circumnavigating twice the globe . he hopes to produce thousands of photographs , several hundred hours of film footage , and precious scientific data from over 16 countries , four oceans , 13 different currents , and six geographical zones . fox is now planning a six year around-the-world sailing journey called the epic expedition . the 200,000 mile sailing expedition will see fox visit over 250 remote islands while circumnavigating the globe twice .", "summary": " canadian extreme photographer , daniel fox , unveils stunning images of lava in hawaii .   he only had moments to capture the photos before feeling his face and camera burn .   hypnotising photos provide an abstract representation of lava , detailing its textures , shapes and forms .
