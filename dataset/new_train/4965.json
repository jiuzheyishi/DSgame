{"text": "in defiance of newton 's law that every action has an equal and opposite reaction , any discussion of legitimate controls on the use , handling and sale of firearms routinely yields an explosive overreaction of opposition . i learned that firsthand when i organized a voluntary gun buyback program for january 8 in tucson , arizona . it was the tipping point for me to change my party affiliation from republican to democratic . on january 8 in 2011 , a seriously deranged young man murdered six people , including a 9-year-old girl , and wounded 13 , including rep. gabby giffords , during a 45-second shooting rampage in tucson . he was finally subdued when he stopped to change clips in his semiautomatic weapon , after firing 31 rounds . in the immediate aftermath , our community came together as one in our grieving over the deaths and in our resolve to do what we could to prevent a repeat of the tragedy . but the irrational fears of the gun lobby succeeded in shouting down the debate , and in the intervening two years not a single piece of meaningful legislation has been adopted that would even begin to solve the problem . i was the target of some of that violent overreaction in the two weeks leading up to the buyback . thinly veiled threats were leveled at me . i was referred to as  hitler .  the response made it clear the event i was planning hit a nerve among a group who evidently believe the proper disposal of a firearm is tantamount to the desecration of a holy icon . opinion : a father 's murder , a plea on gun control . guns are not fetish objects . the buyback was simply an offer to people who were uncomfortable with having a weapon in their homes to trade those weapons into the tucson police department in exchange for a $ 50 grocery gift card . more than $ 10,000 in gift cards were distributed during the event . the money i used to buy those cards was donated in just under two weeks by tucson residents , who still cling to the hope we will re-engage on the topic of rational gun control . they showed that the loud voices are not going to shout down the discussion this time around . but on the periphery of my buyback , and on the periphery of rational discourse , was a group of gun and nra enthusiasts holding a  cash for guns  firearms flea market . they held it on the boundary of the police department parking lot in which my buyback was taking place . obama 's gun violence measures : would they work ? in arizona , it is legal for a person to walk up to another on a street corner , hand him cash for a firearm and simply walk off with it , with no need for a background check into his psychological or criminal history . that was exactly what happened with those who came to my buyback to  score some deals  on weapons by outbidding the gift cards i was offering . i was a republican at the time , but less than one week after the buyback , i chose to switch parties . i believe there is a centrist element among the rank and file in the gop , but the leadership is led by the far right and openly beholden to the nra and the gun lobthe overreaction to the gun buyback made it clear that , in tucson at least , the republican party is out of touch with the values of the community . the cash for guns event clearly highlighted that anyone , a criminal or someone who is mentally ill , can immediately buy a gun with no questions asked in tucson . it 's obvious that public safety demands that background checks be incorporated somehow in private , person-to-person purchases of guns . newspaper removes online data of gun permits . that really is low-hanging fruit in the regulation of weapons sales . legislators have got to stand up to the gun lobbyists who resist even this minimal change in the law and adopt it -- federally and immediately . consider if the tucson shooter had needed to change clips after just five rounds had been fired , or even 10 . the carnage of the day would have been significantly decreased . lives would have been saved . the size of gun magazines is also low-hanging fruit in this conversation . so is the need to stop selling armor-piercing ammunition on the open market . unless the goal is to kill a police officer , certainly rational people can agree that restrictions on the manufacture and sale of this sort of ammunition is in order . nra draws heat over shooting game . over the past three years , the arizona legislature , with a republican supermajority , has adopted statutes that have been offensive to latinos , women and youth . i have openly resisted those bills , and after the recent elections in which those three demographic groups rejected the republican brand , i had hoped things would change , and that the party leadership would resist the continuing lurch to the far right . but even after 20 schoolchildren were killed in newtown , leaders of the gop have shown no inclination to resist the gun lobbyists who fund campaigns , but who come empty-handed when asked to craft reasonable gun legislation . until the republican party hemorrhages more and more centrists , leaders will not wake up to the damage they 're doing to themselves and the party . the debate over rational gun control legislation is an opportunity for them to engage in a productive manner to make this nation safer .", "summary": " steve kozachik organized a gun buyback in tucson , the city where gabby giffords was shot .   he was vilified and threatened by pro-gun people , who staged a  cash for guns  flea market .   this spurred kozachik to leave the gop , which he says is beholden to gun lobby .   kozachik : discussion of sensible reforms is drowned out by extremists .
