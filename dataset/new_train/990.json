{"text": "a teenager has made a miracle recovery - after he had a massive heart attack that left him technically dead for seven minutes - before being saved by his teacher . dan edwards , 17 , from worcester , collapsed after running up stairs at college - while rushing to get to a hospital appointment . the teenager was technically ` dead ' as his heart stopped beating for seven minutes . back at home : dan is now recovering with his family , including mum sue -lrb- left -rrb- sister megan and dad darren -lrb- right -rrb- . but thanks to the quick thinking of his tutor , who started cpr , he has made a miraculous recovery . tutor matt harwood desperately battled to keep him alive after calling paramedics - but after realising he had no heartbeat for more than seven minutes , feared the worst . after arriving at hospital , doctors warned his terrified parents , sue and darren , that they did n't know whether their sporty son would pull through - and if he did , feared he would be severely brain damaged . lucky : doctors had suspected dan had issues with his heart . but less than a month after his brush with death , dan has stunned medics by making an amazing recovery - and is now recovering at home in worcester . his mum , sue , 40 , an nhs administrator , said : ` we are so grateful to everyone who has helped dan pull through - we ca n't thank them enough . ` we came so close to losing our son , we 're just so grateful that so many people knew basic first aid , and for everything the doctors have done for him . ` even after dan 's heart had been restarted , the doctors told us they did n't know if he 'd make it through the night . ` we were distraught - just a few hours before our healthy and happy son had been heading off to college on his moped , and now we were being told we might lose him forever . ` it was devastating . once his heart had been stabilised , they still said that he might have suffered bad brain damage because his heart had been stopped for so long . ` we were told it would take a long time for him to properly wake up - but a few days later , dan was sitting up in bed laughing and joking . ` even the nurses in the hospital told us it was a miracle - he was really one of the lucky ones . ` engineering student dan had been due to attend a hospital appointment for tests after doctors told him they suspected he might have issues with his heart . but after running up a flight of stairs at the worcester college of technology , to grab his coat , the teen suffered a cardiac arrest and collapsed , on september 28 . fortunately , one of his tutors , engineering manager matt harwood , heard him fall - and despite initially thinking that dan had fainted and put him in the recovery position - but quickly realised he had no pulse and began cpr . he was joined by colleagues , including community first responder david price , who took over the cpr , until paramedics arrived and restarted his heart with a defibrillator . dan , who collapsed on the top floor of the cathedral building at about 10.30 am on friday , september 28 , said : ' i ca n't remember much about what happened . ' i felt like i was in a swimming pool and i had fallen asleep . ' i could hear the faint voices of the paramedics calling my name , but i did n't know where i was . ` i 'm so thankful to the people who saved me - it has n't really sunk in yet how serious it was . ' dan 's parents were already at worcester hospital , waiting for dan to arrive for his appointment when they got a call from the college to say their son was being rushed in . sue said : ` we were completely panicked - it did n't seem real when they said dan had collapsed and was in an ambulance . ` we feared the worst , and seeing him in intensive care was devastating . ` the doctors told us they did n't know if he would pull through - they said he was very very sick . ` he was being kept alive by machines and was in a coma . ` they said it would take a long time for him to wake up , but four days after it happened , he was alert and awake . ` the nurses said there 's not many people lucky enough to survive what he did - and they said it 's a miracle he recovered as quickly as he did .  healing : the teenager has now had a pacemaker fitted . the device is roughly the same size as a matchbox . matt said : ` we knew that dan 's life was in the balance , so we all worked as hard as we could to save dan . ` the paramedics were first class and reassured us we did the correct thing and that our reaction had given him a fighting chance . ' i think someone must have been looking down on him . ' dan , who was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , has now been fitted with a cardioverter defibrillator to regulate his heartbeat . the device , slightly larger than a matchbox , monitors the heart rhythm and can deliver low-voltage electrical impulses to keep the heart beating correctly and larger shocks if needed . dad darren , who works in manufacturing , said : ` we are so grateful to the staff at the college , and especially to matt , who realised what had happened and sprung into action so quickly . ` we want to share dan 's story to encourage people to consider learning basic first aid - it 's so simple that anyone could do it , but all of dan 's friends have said that if he 'd collapsed in front of them , they would n't know what to do . ' i ca n't thank the staff at the school enough for saving my son 's life - there 's no way we can repay them .
