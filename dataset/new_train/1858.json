{"text": "cancer is as old as the earliest life on earth and may never be completely wiped out , scientists have warned . despite billions being invested in countless research projects across the globe , a new study has reached the sobering conclusion : the disease is here to stay . the discovery means the disease will be more difficult to cure or treat , because of its highly evolved structure . scientists in germany and croatia say the war on cancer , proclaimed in the 1970s , may never be won , as they discover the disease is more evolved that previously thought , cancer cells , pictured . it suggests our cells ' ability to develop cancer is ` an intrinsic property ' , that has evolved over millions of years . but researchers , at germany 's kiel university and the catholic university of croatia , say ` knowing the enemy ' will give scientists the best possible chance to fight it . the evolutionary biologists have found the first evidence of naturally occurring tumours in two species of hydra - simple freshwater animals . they say the existence of the disease in the tiny , coral-like polyps that first emerged hundreds of millions of years ago , suggests cancer is an inherent part of our evolution . professor thomas bosch , who lead the research team , said : ` cancer is as old as multi-cellular life on earth and will probably never be completely eradicated . ' while searching for the origin of the cancer gene - the cause of all tumours - the team stumbled upon the discovery in hydras , said scientist tomislav domazet-lo≈°o . he said : ` our data predicted that the first multi-cellular animals already had most of the genes , which can cause cancer in humans . ' the team of researchers found cancer tumours growing in two species of hydra , pictured , simple freshwater animals . but they wanted to establish the evidence that these animals can actually suffer tumours . the team now believe they have achieved an impressive understanding of the roots of cancer . professor . bosch said : ` now we have discovered tumour-bearing polyps in two . different species of hydra , an organism very similar to corals . ` this provides proof that tumours indeed exist in primitive and evolutionary old animals . ' a further discovery was that the invasive nature of the disease also dates back millions of years . cancer is set to overtake heart disease and stroke as britain 's biggest killer , experts said this week . the number of deaths from cardiovascular disease has dropped across the country and most of europe , scientists have found . and . a ` tipping point ' is approaching when deaths from stroke and heart . disease will be outnumbered by fatalities due to cancer - especially . among men . the report 's . co-author dr nick townsend , a senior researcher at the british heart . foundation , said : ` the reason why cancer has overtaken cardiovascular . disease as the main cause of death in these countries is due to the fact . that fewer people develop cardiovascular disease and , in those who do , . fewer die from it . ` this is . probably due to improvements in the behavioural risk factors associated . with cvd , such as decreases in the number of people smoking tobacco , . along with better treatments , including preventive ones , such as the . increasing use of statins . ' if tumour cells are introduced into a healthy organism , they can trigger tumour growth in the hydras , the team found . professor bosch added : ` the invasive characteristic of cancer cells is also an evolutionary old feature . ' in the u.s. alone it is estimated more than $ 500 billion was invested in cancer research by 2012 . the worldwide research has led to improved preventative , diagnostic and treatment methods , which have been proven to yield successes . but every second person affected by cancer still succumbs to the disease today . professor bosch concluded : ` our study makes it unlikely that the war on cancer proclaimed in the 1970s can ever be won . ` cancer cells have deep evolutionary roots . any crucial cell in your body can make a mistake . you carry a time bomb in your body when you 're born . ` it can explode early in life , or middle age or later . that does n't mean that , with a patient who develops cancer , there 's nothing you can do . ` medical technology will allow us at early time points ... at least in some cases , to successfully treat and clean a patient completely and forever of troublemaking cells . ` knowing your enemy from its origins is the best way to fight it , and win many battles , ' he added . the study was published in the journal nature communications .", "summary": " evolutionary biologists in germany and croatia found the disease is more evolved than previously thought .   they reached the sobering conclusion : the disease is here to stay .   found the first evidence of tumours in hydra - simple freshwater animals .   suggests cancer is as old as multi-cellular life on earth but researchers said it does not mean medical technology ca n't fight the disease .   professor thomas bosch , said : ` knowing your enemy from its origins is the best way to fight it and win many battles ' "}
