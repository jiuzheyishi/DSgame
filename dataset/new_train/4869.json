{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- truth and reconciliation . as we mark martin luther king jr. . day this year , it 's worth asking : can america handle either one ? when nelson mandela became president of south africa after the end of apartheid he had two choices . he could have gone down a path of confrontation and retribution against the white afrikaners who had ruled so oppressively . or he could have skipped quickly past the history and reality of apartheid and pardoned all its perpetrators in the interests of maintaining order . he did neither . in one of his many acts of civic genius , he chose a path for his country that exposed the ugliness of the past and only then invited forgiveness . his government launched a truth and reconciliation commission , led by archbishop desmond tutu . the commission gathered public testimony across the land , naming the institutional structures and individual acts that had brutalized blacks . no perpetrator was granted amnesty without a candid accounting of his or her deeds . the opportunity for restorative justice gave every participant a sense of heightened responsibility -- a chance to be bigger citizens , together . only then could reconciliation begin . and though the commission was not sufficient to  solve race  in post-apartheid south africa , it was still necessary . without such an attempt at formal accounting , without such an opportunity for oppressed and oppressor to face one another , that nation 's challenges would be even greater today . for proof , consider our own nation 150 years post-slavery . for a fleeting while after the civil war , we tried reconstruction . freedmen could earn wages and vote freely and claim an equal place in politics . then we gave up on reconstruction . and jim crow came along to make black citizens second-class and to ensure that neither truth-telling nor reconciliation would be on the agenda . consider our nation 50 years post-civil rights movement . that movement is sometimes called the second reconstruction . it sought to finish the fight to make truly equal citizens out of the descendants of slaves . but here we are today , still plagued post-ferguson and post-staten island by divisions of color and caste -- and by an inability to talk about them without angry defensiveness . that 's why it 's worth asking whether the united states today could take a page from south africa 's script . fania davis , a civil rights attorney and restorative justice activist in oakland , california , has proposed just that . in a widely circulated essay in yes ! magazine , davis argues that ferguson , missouri , needs a truth and reconciliation commission on extrajudicial violence against african-americans -- and that america does , too . you can hear the objections already . for instance : wo n't cataloging acts of racism from the past just make it harder for us all to get along ? but of course , racism is not only in the past . it did not end with the thirteenth amendment of 1865 or with the voting rights act of 1965 . it is present in the acts and attitudes of many today . it is present in the institutional residue of past choices . that the phrase #blacklivesmatter must be said says it all . the criminal justice system , the education system , the economic system and -lrb- as this year 's so-white oscars remind us -rrb- the pop culture system -- all of them value black lives , black voices and black experience less than fully . we must all face that fact . there 's also this objection to a commission : that by racializing everything it would basically be racist . consider the words of supreme court chief justice john roberts , who , arguing against affirmative action , once wrote that  -lsb- t -rsb- he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discrimination on the basis of race .  this tidy tautology flattens out history . it obliterates the difference between injury and remedy . it wants to rush us along to a  colorblindness  that our society has n't yet earned and perhaps should n't even seek as an ideal . as a chinese american , i am an inheritor of what white people wrote in the constitution and what they did to subvert it . i am the beneficiary of what black people and people of every color have done to redeem the constitution . i am sometimes the object of a presumption that yellow people are presumed foreign until proven otherwise . i own the good , the bad and the ugly of this country . none of this is neat . none of it is colorblind either . ultimately the deepest objection to a racial truth and reconciliation process in america is that it would be hard . hard to start and to finish . we americans can be a bit lazy when it comes to messy civic and historical truths . we want our stories -- and our story -- to have happy endings . we want reconciliation on the cheap . but the point of mlk day , and of mlk 's entire life , is that true redemption is never cheap or easy . so to honor him truly , let 's commit to what 's hard . whether through official commissions or citizen conversations , let 's face ourselves .", "summary": " eric liu : mlk lesson for all of us is that true redemption is never cheap or easy .   liu : post-ferguson , we 're still divided by color ; it 's time for reconciliation .
