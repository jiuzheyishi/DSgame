{"text": "from cookbooks to cranberries , putting delia smith 's name to something has long been a recipe for success . substitute a dash of delia with a pinch of pippa , however , and it seems to leave a rather sour taste . customers are struggling to stomach the news that the duchess of cambridge 's sister is replacing delia as a columnist in waitrose 's magazine . pippa middleton 's new role seems to have left a sour taste in waitrose customers ' mouths . just days after miss middleton was appointed as the face of the supermarket , shoppers have flooded waitrose 's twitter and facebook accounts with their complaints . ` a gratuitous insult to any customers with half a brain ! ' wrote one , as another warned : ` if her party book is anything to go by , you may well regret your decision . ' pippa 's book , celebrate , offered illuminating advice including a recipe for making ice . it also gave tips such as pouring hot drinks from flasks into ` mugs or paper cups ' , and counselled that toasting marshmallows over a fire required ` a long-handled fork ' and ` flames ' . waitrose ditched delia , 71 -- whose cookery books have sold 21million copies -- when her three-year contract ended in january . the first column by pippa , 29 , will be published in the april edition of waitrose kitchen , on sale from the end of this month . the magazine 's editor has promised she will dispense sage advice on how to prepare a ` friday night feast ' , and said her ` wealth of experience ' will be ` loved ' by readers . but customers have already begun asking why they would take cookery tips from someone who has ` probably never boiled an egg ' . kitchen favourite : delia is considered a domestic expert , but waitrose have asked pippa to hand out cookery advice . one twitter user wrote : ` ca n't believe waitrose has replaced queen of cooking delia with pippa ' , while another said : ` i want a real cook to inspire me , not a relative of the royals who just happens to be famous for wearing a dress . ' the comments can all be viewed on waitrose 's twitter feed , which has 42,000 followers . meanwhile , on the supermarket 's facebook page , james hunting wrote that pippa 's appointment was a ` ridiculous idea ' , adding : ` i am not sure she has a grasp on the lifestyle and concerns of the typical waitrose shopper . ' another customer , david lee , added : ` why oh why would you drop delia smith , we have used her recipes for years ! pippa is hardly a famous cook , perhaps a few cupcakes , does that qualify her for the job ? ' gamely , waitrose has been replying to each and every comment , thanking customers for their ` suggestions ' and repeating : ` pippa is not a replacement for delia . pippa will write a column in our monthly waitrose kitchen magazine . ' pippa has told fans she is looking forward to writing her column , saying : ` it will be an exciting opportunity to share my passion and enthusiasm for food and entertaining . ' last night a waitrose spokesman said : ` we are not making any comment about what is on facebook and twitter because we are absolutely delighted that pippa middleton is joining us as a columnist . ' delia smith was unavailable for comment .", "summary": " shoppers flood waitrose 's twitter and facebook accounts with complaints .   magazine 's editor promises pippa will dispense advice on preparing feasts .
