' he claimed that on a range of major issues including capital markets union , banks which are ` too big to fail ' and euro bonds , ` there was not a single idea put forward by lord hill that showed that he had a least some conceptions about these things ' . he suggested that criticism of lord hill would be more intense were britain 's relationship with brussels not already under strain . ` no one would claim that he had knowledge of the issues at hand . no i think that the main factor that played was that some people were hesitant to send a rebuke to the uk at times when the relationship between the uk and the european union are quite tense . ` he may be a good commissioner , but i would probably not assign him this portfolio .
