' i ca n't put into words how angry i am and i will never ever use thomas cook again . ` what . hurt me most of all is that it was meant to be our last holiday all . together as a family and the place was just disgusting . hellish holiday : this was the family 's walk to the private beach after they thought they had bought a luxurious trip set in beautiful surroundings . the family say this was their walk to the private beach - and claim that staff at the resort charged them to move . ` my young daughter was really shaken up and crying , and she could n't enjoy her holiday because she was so upset . ' ian , 43 , took his family to tunisia in 2011 . while on holiday , his sons jack , 17 , sam , 16 , and daughter charlie , 10 , and the family planned to return to the area the following year - but wanted a hotel with spacious grounds and thrilling water slides . michelle went into thomas cook 's . barnsley shop the following year and paid nearly # 4,000 to book her . family 's last holiday together . michelle said : ` we explained to the in-store rep that we wanted to stay in the soviva hotel because it was next to the port . ` she said she knew which hotel we meant , showed us the brochure and booked us two rooms for two weeks . ` we were told there was a sea view and that the door of the hotel lead onto the beach , which was privately owned by the hotel . ' but when the hotel transport took the . byford family miles past the port , it began to sink in that their . luxury break was not all it seemed . this was the view that greeted the byfords , and thomas cook have only given them # 35 compensation . the advertised soviva resort on the thomas cook website boasted an ` extensive and spacious resort ' that was popular with families . the byfords claim when they arrived at the hotel , they were shocked to see stray cats wandering through the hotel . michelle said : ` the rugs in the hotel . corridor were wet through and as we walked in , the stench of cat wee . hit us . it was so strong that it made our eyes stream . ` the hotel 's pool was filthy . the water was black and there was all sorts of mud and rubbish in it . ` that 's when we saw the poo floating in the pool . ' ` we then went to look at our private . beach and were horrified . we came out of the hotel and we had to walk . through all of the rotting toilets and rubbish . charlie was really . distraught . ` there were dirty nappies and a sewage pipe on the beach , spilling out onto the sand . ` there was no way that i could have my kids staying there . it was obvious that i had been sold a false holiday .

' michelle and ian byford , with their sons children jack and sam , say their luggage was lost and they have spent an extortionate amount ringing thomas cook . michelle and ian byford say that they have spent weeks trying to get a refund from the holiday operator . incredibly , in an email sent from . thomas cook in response to the family 's complaint in december , they . state : ` we are careful to document that the areas surrounding your . holiday accommodation do not form part of your package holiday and are . therefore not inspected . ` as this is that case , we are unable to accept any responsibility for the condition of these areas . ` after reviewing your case and all of . the information available to me , i would like to offer you a . compensation payment in light of the disappointing conditions you were . greeted with on arrival at the soviva resort . ' the byfords tried to enjoy the rest . of their stay in the new hotel , but the money they had spent moving . meant they did not have any money for activities . the soviva resort is rated as a . four-star establishment and is described on thomas cook 's website as : ' a . popular choice for families with children or those seeking a lively . holiday , this extensive and spacious resort enjoys a wide range of . facilities as well as a varied animation programme .

' but when the family arrived at the airport , sons jack and sam could not find their suitcase . the suitcase contained a # 399 . camcorder , three # 30 toothbrushes and hundreds of pounds worth of new . clothes that the two boys had saved up to buy . the byfords were forced to fly home on the 10am plane without the missing suitcase , or face paying for new flights . michelle said : ` we made our first . complaint on 16 september and it was n't until the end of november that . we found out we would n't be getting the suitcase back . ` we had to provide receipts for . everything in the case or we would n't get our money back . luckily i had . the receipt for the camcorder , but who keeps receipts for clothes ? ` we claimed # 1,700 back for the case and only received # 1,100 so are yet again , another # 600 out of pocket . ' as well as the charge for changing . hotels , the taxi and the lost items , the family have also spent huge . amounts on phone bills calling thomas cook every day to claim their . compensation . the family had an email confirmation of their complaint on 6 december which offered them # 35 in compensation . michelle said : ` we are absolutely . disgusted , our holiday was ruined and we are out of pocket by hundreds . and hundreds of pounds . it 's been a living nightmare . ' initially thomas cook offered the couple # 35 compensation for their ordeal . after the mailonline contacted them , the tour operator said they contacted the family to arrange compensation and were investigating the issue . a thomas cook spokesman said : ` the hotel is closed for the winter and undergoing refurbishment . ` the family have this afternoon agreed to a refund of the # 288 and a goodwill gesture of compensation of # 500 .
