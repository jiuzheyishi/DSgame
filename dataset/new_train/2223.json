{"text": "new york safely back on american soil , freed americans josh fattal and shane bauer on sunday recounted their two years in  a world of lies and false hope  behind the walls of an iranian prison . wearing green shirts and big smiles , bauer and fattal landed at john f. kennedy international airport four days after their release by iranian authorities . in a news conference following their arrival , they described long days held in isolation , the hours punctuated by the screams of other inmates , and their  total sham  of a trial .  releasing us is a good gesture , and no positive step should go unnoticed ,  fattal told reporters sunday afternoon .  we applaud the iranian authorities for finally making the right decision regarding our case . but we want to be clear that they do not deserve undue credit for ending what they had no right and no justification to start in the first place .  fattal , bauer and bauer 's now-fiancee , sarah shourd , were arrested after straying across the unmarked border between iraqi kurdistan and iran in july 2009 . shourd was released in 2010 , but bauer and fattal were freed only wednesday , after 781 days in captivity and a trial for espionage that bauer said was based on  ridiculous lies .   sarah , josh and i have experienced a taste of the iranian regime 's brutality . we have been held in almost total isolation from the world and everything we love , stripped of our rights and freedom ,  bauer said . he urged iran to release all political prisoners immediately , telling reporters ,  there are people in iran who have been imprisoned for years for simply attending a protest , for writing a pro-democracy blog or for worshiping an unpopular faith .  but he also criticized the treatment of prisoners held in u.s. facilities , such as the military 's prison camp for suspected terrorists at guantanamo bay , cuba .  in prison , every time we complained about our conditions , the guards would immediately remind us of comparable conditions at guantanamo bay ,  he said . while the hikers do n't believe american policies  justify what has been done to us ,  he said ,  we do believe that these actions on the part of the u.s. provide an excuse for other governments , including the government of iran , to act in kind .  they said they were held in near-complete isolation in tehran 's evin prison , allowed a total of only 15 minutes of telephone calls with their families throughout their ordeal . fattal said the two had to wage repeated hunger strikes in order to even receive letters from their families . iranian authorities told them their families had stopped writing , that they would receive due process of law and that the swiss ambassador -- who represents u.s. interests in iran -- was not interested in seeing them . worse , fattal said ,  many times -- too many times -- we heard the screams of other prisoners being beaten , and there was nothing we could do to help them .  shourd said bauer was beaten and fattal was forced down a flight of stairs during their captivity . she was released on medical grounds in september 2010 , and told cnn the screams that echoed within tehran 's notorious evin prison  will always be with me .   i do n't know what was being done to them ,  she said .  but not being able to help another human being , being completely impotent and unable to do anything to ease their suffering , is something i 'll never forget .  iranian authorities released fattal and bauer on wednesday . they first were flown to oman , where they enjoyed several days of freedom after their lengthy captivity . fattal 's mother , laura fattal , told cnn their families  were hooting and hollering and waving our scarves  when they landed .  we could n't wait for them to get to us ... i could n't have asked for anything better ,  she said . and bauer 's mother , cindy hickey , said the families have n't heard  a whole lot of details  from their sons since their release .  we have taken the time to just sit and talk and regather ,  hickey told cnn .  we 've been very busy traveling ,  she said . hickey said they were held as  political pawns .  bauer and fattal blamed three decades of hostility between the united states and iran for making their plight worse than that of other westerners who had strayed into iranian territory .  it was clear to us from the very beginning that we were hostages ,  fattal said .  this is the most accurate term because , despite certain knowledge of our innocence , iran has always tied our case to its political disputes with the u.s.  but , shourd said in hindsight ,  i do n't believe that iran got anything good out of this .  i do n't believe it was good for the country , and it certainly was n't good for the iranian people , whom i admire and support in their struggle for democracy and freedom ,  she said . fattal and bauer thanked the numerous people in america and abroad who helped secure their freedom , including their iranian attorney , masoud shafiee . shafiee  was never allowed to represent us properly , but he never gave up ,  fattal said . shourd said no one has ever taken credit for paying her bail or those of fattal and bauer . she and bauer became officially engaged on friday , although he proposed to her during their time in prison .  when sarah was about to walk out of evin prison last year , we vowed to each other that none of us would be entirely free until all of us were free ,  bauer said .  that moment has now thankfully come .  cnn 's susan candiotti , todd baxter and mohammed jamjoom contributed to this report .", "summary": " new : bauer and fattal blast iran 's  brutality  after returning to the united states .   new : their espionage trial was a  total sham
