{"text": "efforts to rescue a research crew aboard a ship stuck in ice off antarctica stalled thursday after sea ice conditions made a key element of the rescue plan risky , australian maritime officials said . the rescue plan called for a helicopter to ferry the passengers from the mv akademik shokalskiy to a chinese vessel , where they would then board a barge to take them to an australian icebreaker , the australian maritime safety authority -lrb- amsa -rrb- said in a written statement . but the shifting ice conditions prevented the barge from being able to reach the chinese vessel , the statement said .  alternative measures to complete the rescue operation are now being investigated by amsa and the ships involved ,  the statement said . the news is the latest chapter in a saga that began christmas eve after the russian-flagged mv akademik shokalskiy got stuck in 10 feet of ice . even if the rescue begins friday , it will still be weeks before the research team will make it to hobart , australia , john young of the australian maritime safety authority said .  mid-january is our best guess ,  young told reporters on a conference call . the rescue plan called for the helicopter , which can transport 12 people each trip , to ferry the ship 's 52 passengers -- who include the research team and journalists -- to the chinese icebreaker called the snow dragon , or xue long , the maritime agency said . the 22 russian crew members of the akademik shokalskiy will stay aboard , it said . the passengers are then to be transported by barge from the chinese ship to the australian icebreaker aurora australis . that 's because the chinese helicopter ca n't land on the australian icebreaker because of load restrictions , and ice conditions make it unsafe to land it next to the ship , amsa said .  the preferred option is to wait for conditions that will allow the rescue to be completed in a single operation to reduce unnecessary risk ,  the maritime agency said . the master of the akademik shokalskiy has decided to keep the crew members on board until the pack ice eventually breaks up and allows the ship to move again , young said . the vessel has enough supplies to keep the crew going for  a very long time ,  he said . failed rescues . the planned helicopter rescue follows a failed attempt by the chinese icebreaker , which made it six nautical miles from the trapped vessel before being stopped by the ice . that was followed by an effort by the australian icebreaker , which was forced monday to suspend efforts to reach the expedition because of bad weather . the aurora australis got within 10 nautical miles of the ship before it turned back . over the weekend , an effort by the french icebreaker astrolabe was called off by the maritime agency . in preparation for the helicopter rescue , members of the research team as well as the crew of the akademik shokalskiy marked a makeshift helipad on the ice where the helicopter can land . video clips posted online by the research team showed people , with arms locked , walking to tamp down the snow .  as we understand , the helipad was suitable yesterday and will be suitable today ,  amsa 's richard wallace said . once the passengers are safely aboard the aurora australis , the ship will complete a resupply mission to casey station , an australian base in antarctica , before making its way to hobart , the maritime agency said . viral sensations . the exploits of the research crew have gone viral , thanks in large part to twitter and youtube posts by those aboard the stranded vessel . chris turney , an australian professor of climate change at the university of new south wales , has tweeted photos of the stranded ship , the crew and penguins , who he said -- according to one post on twitter --  to check out what 's going on .   the group on this ship is incredibly collegiate ,  said alok jha , a science correspondent for the guardian newspaper , told cnn 's anderson cooper 360 .  there are a lot of skills and things people are sharing with each other .  turney has said there are regular briefings on the status of rescue attempts , and in the meantime , people are doing what they can to keep busy . that includes yoga and spanish classes , jha and turney said . the group even managed to ring in 2014 with good cheer .  we 're the a , a , e who have traveled far , having fun doing science in antarctica !  a dozen or so of them sang in a video posted on youtube .  lots of snow and lots of ice , lots of penguins , which are very , very nice !  really good food and company , but a bloody great shame we are still stuck here ! ice cold , cha cha cha ! ice cold , cha cha cha !  spirits strong among passengers on ship stuck in antarctic ice . cnn 's radina gigova and jethro mullen contributed to this report .", "summary": " new : ice conditions have stalled a helicopter rescue , officials say .   new : alternative rescue measures are being considered , maritime officials say .   new :  the preferred option is to wait for conditions that will allow the rescue ,  they say .   efforts by australian and chinese icebreakers to get to the crew have failed .
