{"text": "washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- the supreme court jumped into the same-sex marriage debate again , deciding friday to hear arguments this spring on the question of whether states have the right to ban same-sex couples from getting married . it 's expected to hammer out a decision on one of the most controversial social issues by june when the 2016 presidential race will be well underway , forcing the debate into full view during what 's expected to be a crowded and diverse republican primary . it 's not an issue that establishment republicans are eager to drag into the spotlight . on the national level , the party is increasingly reluctant to focus on social issues , especially after the 2012 debacle over todd akin 's rape comments and as polling continues to show a majority of americans support same-sex marriage . a recent cnn/orc international survey indicates that 57 % of americans think gays and lesbians have a constitutional right to get married . off the table or on ? some republican strategists say quietly that a decision could bring some finality and take the issue off the table well before the election , while others say it could reignite the debate .  i fear there could be a bigger fight within the gop because of a supreme court decision than there would be without one ,  said vin weber , a former congressman from minnesota and an adviser to mitt romney 's 2012 campaign .  i do n't want to see a fight over this issue , because i think it 's evolving on its own state by state .  he added :  i would guess social conservatives would take up umbrage , make it a divisive issue , and force every republican candidate to go on record saying what they really believe .  it 's a tough issue to talk about for republicans , consultants say , because no matter what position they take , they 're going to get in trouble with one side of the party or the other . former florida gov. jeb bush , who adamantly stood against same-sex marriage during his unsuccessful 1994 gubernatorial run , struck a conciliatory tone last week when florida became the 36th state to legalize same-sex marriage .  we live in a democracy , and regardless of our disagreements , we have to respect the rule of law ,  bush said in a statement , calling for  respect for the good people on all sides of the gay and lesbian marriage issue .  weber said that bush 's statement likely reflects the position of a majority of republican candidates and elected officials on the issue .  they 're not quite ready to endorse gay marriage , but they really do n't want to crusade against it like they used to ,  he said .  they 're looking for ways to describe their position that do n't put them directly at odds with supporters of same-sex marriage .  ` profound consequences ' opponents of same-sex marriage , however , argue that anyone who thinks the fight will slowly die down is highly misguided . brian brown , president of the national organization for marriage , said a supreme court decision that reverses same-sex marriage bans will be  a frontal assault on the religious liberty of all americans .   there are going to be profound consequences ,  he said .  if the supreme court rules , it will be just like roe v. wade all over again .  with the 2016 gop field spanning a wide ideological spectrum , there 's a sizable crop of potential candidates who 've signaled that they 're ready for a fight . sen. ted cruz spelled out a 10-point agenda for the new republican congress in a speech monday that also read like a potential presidential platform . one of his themes was the need to  rein in judicial activism ,  pointing to federal court rulings on same-sex marriage .  the constitution makes clear marriage is a question for the states ,  he said .  it 's not a question for a bunch of unelected federal judges who may disagree with the democratic views of the people who live in the united states of america .  mike huckabee last fall threatened to leave the gop if republicans do n't take a stronger stand against a wave of acceptance .  if the republicans want to lose guys like me and a whole bunch of still god-fearing , bible-believing people , go ahead and just abdicate on this issue ,  he said . he seemed to soften his tone a little bit , writing in his newly released book that the idea that  same-sex marriage is destroying society is actually greatly overstated ,  adding that christians who get divorced  have as much to answer for as do those who militantly push to redefine marriage .  still , while conservative candidates are more vocal about standing on principle , strategists say it 's not as likely that they 'll start a war over same-sex marriage in the face of issues involving the economy , terrorism , and health care -- especially when the tide has rolled in favor of same-sex marriage at such a rapid pace in the last couple of years .  it 's not 2004 . gay marriage is not going to determine the outcome of presidential election like it did in ohio ,  said gop strategist tara setmayer , referring to the surge of republicans who showed up to the polls to approve same-sex marriage bans in nearly a dozen states a decade ago . the turn-out helped tip the scales for george w. bush 's re-election .  the issue may come up in the primary , but i do n't think anyone wants this to be the hallmark of this campaign ,  she said .", "summary": " the supreme court decided friday to hear same-sex marriage arguments this year .   that could lead to a major decision during the early 2016 presidential race .   strategists say a decision could be welcome news to some republicans , while others are ready to fight .
