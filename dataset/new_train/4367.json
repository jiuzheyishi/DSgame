{"text": "when scott warner swallowed a palm full of pills and washed them down with vodka , all he could think about was the way his son looked back at him and smiled before boarding a plane to iraq . heath warner was 19 , an army private , when a bomb killed him in al anbar province on november 22 , 2006 .  from the moment those men in uniforms were at our door , each day , the pain kept getting worse ,  recalled scott warner .  i was crawling up a wall . people out in the real world would tell me , ` why are n't you over this ? he 's been gone for years . why are n't you better by now ? '  all i wanted to do was end my life . i know i 'm not alone . i 've talked to other parents , other family members . we are hurting and someone must do something .  if you need help , contact the veterans crisis line 1-800-273-8255 , press 1 . though the military tracks suicides among service members , suicides among their family members -- spouses , siblings and parents -- go uncounted . but cnn learned wednesday that the pentagon 's defense suicide prevention office has sent a report to congress detailing for the first time a proposal for tracking those deaths . the report came partly in response to cries for help from groups like the national military family association , whose members know firsthand about the suicides and have struggled to call attention to the problem . read the full report -lrb- pdf -rrb- . in interviews with cnn , military family members who have attempted or considered suicide say the cumulative trauma of 12 years of war -- america 's longest battles -- and unprecedented multiple deployments of their loved ones have left them wrung out and desperate . some have attempted suicide while struggling to care for injured service members . others , like scott warner , have been pushed to the edge by the loss of their loved one at war . warner has slowly emerged from the darkness that enveloped him before his suicide attempt in 2010 . when he heard about the defense department 's report , he was hopeful .  if they do this , it would validate that families are traumatized ,  warner said .  this is a lonely journey that parents , siblings , spouses are walking . i know ; i 've talked to them . i do n't care how long it takes , we all want this .  the report , obtained by cnn wednesday , says the defense department does not currently have the ability to investigate , monitor or receive notification of military family member deaths and details how that might be done and what it would cost . it would take 18 to 24 months for the pentagon to analyze data it could buy from the centers for disease control and prevention 's national center for health statistics , which tracks deaths in the general u.s. population , the report says . that data -- names and locations of deaths -- could then be compared against data the defense department has on family members enrolled in an id card program . the card allows them access to health benefits and other services , like shopping at on-base commissaries . the cost of the effort , the report says : $ 681,600 the first year and $ 502,200 each additional year . the report concedes there are limitations to the plan . some family members , for instance , opt out of enrolling in the id program . service members ' parents typically would not be in the id program . if a relative not in the program committed suicide , it 's possible they would not be counted . veteran confronts rape , suicide : ' i am angry that others are going through this ' spokespersons for the house and senate armed services committees told cnn on wednesday that lawmakers are still reading the 20-page report .  $ 600,000 is very little money to spend on something this important ,  said kristina kaufmann , a longtime military wife who since 2006 has written editorials in national newspapers and spoken before congress about the need to track military family member suicides .  a couple years ago , i had people telling me i was being histrionic . they 'd say a bunch of military spouses were n't killing themselves . but we have the anecdotes . what we do n't have -- and i 'm glad we 're going to try to get -- is the actual data .  kaufmann personally knew military wives who committed suicide . she was friends with faye vick . in 2006 , the fort bragg mother placed her baby and 2-year old in the backseat of her car and asphyxiated them all . websites become tool for stopping veteran suicides . monique lingenfelter was the wife of a sergeant assigned to a special operations unit at bragg . in 2009 , she barricaded herself in her home and shot herself . another military spouse , karen ruedisueli , told cnn that the organization she works for , the national military family association , a nonprofit that serves a quarter-million military relatives , has heard an increasing number of stories about family members killing themselves . late last year , the group formally implored congress to ask the defense department to find a way to measure the deaths .  we have a large network of volunteers across the country who come to us with these accounts and we have no way to track them ,  ruedisueli said .  we 're encouraged that dod has come up with some kind of methodology .  the spouse of the highest-ranking military officer in the country tried to call attention to the problem four years ago . deborah mullen , wife of adm. mike mullen , then the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , took the stage at a defense department conference to say she 'd tried to get information about suicides among relatives . she met with leaders to see if they tracked family member suicides . army leaders told her there were nine military family member suicides in 2009 . study : mental illness , not combat , causes soldier suicides . mullen said she asked army officials if they knew how many family members had attempted suicide .  i was stunned when i was told that there were too many to track ,  she told the crowd .  if that number is that large just in the army , we really do n't have an idea of the scope of the problem .   it 's our responsibility ,  she implored .  these are our family members . we have got to find a way to track them .  an annual survey by blue star families , the largest military family advocacy group , found suicide among relatives to be a serious concern . out of 5,100 military family members surveyed in 2012 , 9 % of military spouses reported that they had considered suicide . of those , nearly a quarter said they had not sought help . but even if they had , it 's unclear if they would have been heard . view : stop saying ` committed suicide ' the defense suicide prevention office report noted that branches of the military do not share standardized procedures in tracking suicide . the army is the only service that attempts to track its military family members who commit suicide , the report says .  i think we understand the bureaucracy ,  scott warner said .  i know this will be difficult . it 's government . but what else can we believe other than that they will try ?  sharing experiences can help .", "summary": "
