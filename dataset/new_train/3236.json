{"text": "living in a wealthy country does n't necessarily mean you will be happier , according to a study . researchers found that once a nation 's gross domestic product surpasses # 22,200 per person , individual happiness begins to nosedive -- as the worry of ` keeping up with the joneses ' kicks in . the researchers said these high expectations in the world 's wealthiest countries were to blame for creating dissatisfaction among citizens . the british study compared per capita gdp with data on life satisfaction gathered from the world values survey . wealth does n't pay : once a country 's gdp per person tops # 22,200 per person , the level of the nation 's individual happiness starts to drop . in the poorest countries happiness rises as a country 's wealth increases and citizens are able to afford their basic needs . people in countries with a gdp per capita of below # 4,100 were 12 per cent less likely to report the highest level of life satisfaction than those in countries where it reached # 11,100 . however , beyond a level of # 12,600 per person , the link between increasing prosperity and happiness is much less marked . between this level and the very highest gdp per capita level # 33,000 , the probability of reporting the top level of life satisfaction changes by no more than two per cent . satisfaction peaked at # 22,200 , after which it appeared to dip in the world 's richest nations . it means britons , with a per capita gdp of around # 22,800 , should be fairly satisfied with their lives . lead researcher dr eugenio proto , of warwick university , said : ` whether wealth can buy a country 's happiness is a major question for governments . many policy-makers , including in the uk , are interested in official measures of national well-being . satisfaction : graphic shows how happiness declines in countries with a gross domestic product of # 22,100 per capita . ` our new analysis has one very surprising finding which has not been reported before -- that life satisfaction appears to dip beyond a certain level of wealth . ` in our study we see evidence that this is down to changes in the aspiration levels of people living in the richest countries . ` as countries get richer , higher levels of gdp lead to higher aspiration . there is a sense of keeping up with the joneses as people see wealth and opportunity all around them and aspire to having more . ` but this aspiration gap -- the difference between actual income and the income we would like -- eats away at life-satisfaction levels . ` in other words , what we aspire to becomes a moving target and one which moves away faster in the richest countries , causing the dip in happiness we see in our analysis . ' contrast : . based on the findings , residents of wealthier nations such as . switzerland , pictured , should be less content than their uk . counterparts . but a separate un study ranked the country in the top five . of most satisfied nations , while britain was ranked in 22nd place . the findings , published in journal public library of science one , seem to confirm the easterlin paradox -- that the link between life satisfaction and gdp is more or less flat in richer countries . but the study seemed to go further in suggesting a small drop in life satisfaction once countries go beyond a certain level of prosperity . based on the findings , residents of wealthier nations such as the netherlands , switzerland and norway should be less content than their uk counterparts because of the higher gdp per person . but a separate un study published earlier this year found all three countries rank in the top five most satisfied nations , while britain was ranked in 22nd place .", "summary": " a british study compared per capita gdp with data on life satisfaction .   it found satisfaction peaked in countries with a gdp at # 22,200 per person .   after # 22,200 , happiness levels dip in the world 's richest nations .   researchers say higher life aspirations in these countries is to blame .
