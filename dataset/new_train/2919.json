{"text": "by now , everyone should know that aviation is the safest way to travel : even in parts of the world with a  high  accident rate , that rate is still far below other ways to get from point a to point b . this level of safety is due to a tradition of hard work and technological advances that must continue . new threats emerge every day , but through proactive efforts in data collection and analysis , we do n't have to wait for an accident anymore -- we can mitigate these risks before they become real problems . so how do we square those facts with terrible tragedies such as air france 447 ? plane crashes do still occur , even with state-of-the-art aircraft . everyone in the industry must continue to work hard on safety . with the air france 447 final report published this week , we now have a clearer picture of the events that led to this tragedy . the report concluded that a series of errors by pilots and a failure to react effectively to technical problems led to the crash . we already knew much of what we happened that evening : the autopilot shut itself off when the air speed indicators failed and the plane  handed itself  to the co-pilot . for the next several minutes , it should have been a pretty benign situation , but the flight crew made some inexplicable decisions and ultimately the plane crashed in the ocean . what we must now try to understand is why the pilots reacted the way they did . in the past decade , we 've seen tremendous advances in automation in the cockpit . this automation has proven to be vital to raising the level of safety in aviation even higher and also to provide more efficient airline operations . it has removed some of the threat of human error during normal operations . pilots now spend most of their time monitoring the automation . but what happens when the automation turns itself off or fails for some reason ? q&a : has air france flight 447 mystery been solved ? the elephant in the room has always been that training standards have not kept up with the technological changes in aircraft . in the early days of aviation , training included how to recover from some of the most commonly-faced emergencies , such as a lost engine during take off . these scenarios are no longer common , yet the training has not changed significantly to recognize this new reality . automation used to be the pilot 's assistant . now the pilot is expected to back-up the automation . that is a fundamentally new task that the industry has n't trained for . regulators around the world need to acknowledge this and work to change the basic requirements in training programs . pilots need to know what it feels like to stall at high altitudes and train on how to recover . they need to know what to do when an airplane is suddenly handed to them during an abnormal flight situation by the autopilot turning off . they need to learn what to do and perhaps most importantly , what not to do in order to avoid increasing risk . some of this will require a renewed emphasis on manual flying skills , but new training will also have to be developed to address the fundamental new relationship that has developed between man and machine . there are a number of airlines around the work who are already changing their training standards to reflect this and we applaud this effort . all airlines should do this . they should not wait for their regulators to act . as with any tragedy , there will be a temptation to focus on blame and political posturing , but af447 is a case where politicians and judges should keep a respectful distance . there is some serious technical work to be done , and the aviation community needs to act quickly and objectively . it is a responsibility that the entire aviation community embraces and we are confident that the safety professionals will find solutions that ensure that tragedies like this do n't happen again . it is a debt we owe to those who have been lost . news : who 's really flying the plane ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of bill voss .", "summary": " final report on crash of air france flight 447 concludes human error to blame .   flight 447 crashed into the atlantic ocean en route from rio de janeiro to paris .   investigation focused on pilots reactions to instrument failure , autopilot switching off .   voss : flying is safest way to travel , but more must be done to improve pilot training .
