{"text": "starting a company can feel like a lonely business . but for a little more than $ 100 a month , hong kong resident ken chan can develop his start-up , network with like-minded people and relax with a game of ping-pong -- all under the same roof . he is one of a growing number of go-it-alone entrepreneurs and freelancers in asia leaving their apartments and cafes , and settling into  co-working  spaces . at these shared offices , they get to work in what is usually a laid-back but professional environment . however , almost just as important for these nomadic workers are the social and emotional benefits of mingling with their own kind .  coming here , you can feel supported by other people working on their businesses and feel less alone ,  said chan , who goes to the co-working space cocoon , where he works on his internet start-up , wholedaybuy.com . but chan says not to underestimate the practical advantages of having actual office space in hong kong , where high rent makes a permanent office out of reach for many who are just starting out .  if you want to meet a client , you want to have the space . it 's a physical location to gather people ,  he says . thought to have first started in san francisco in 2005 with citizen space , co-working spaces are now widespread in the u.s. and europe and are making headway in asia , courting mostly people in their 20s and 30s working on projects solo or in small teams . there are now dozens of such places in tokyo , and a handful have opened in shanghai and hong kong . the congested cities seem ready-made for co-working , with cramped apartments that could make working from home unpleasant -- and unimpressive for investors or clients . and going it alone is just starting to catch on in asia , where people traditionally strive to work for large corporations .  it 's only becoming acceptable to take the risk of starting tech start-ups or being a freelancer ,  says constant tedder , the british founder of the hive in hong kong , a co-working space that opened in may . the cost of going to the hive ranges from $ 40 , for a day pass , to over $ 750 per month for a dedicated desk . tedder sees the demand throughout asia and is looking to expand to other cities in the region . for freelancers , who often work in creative industries like design , stuffy cubicles just do not cut it , tedder said .  there 's definitely this emerging segment of people who do n't want to project a corporate image , but they want a comfortable space to work ,  he says . the hive touches all the hallmarks that make co-working an attractive alternative to sitting in a coffee shop with a laptop : the space is open , desks equipped with power outlets are meant for sharing , members each get their own lockers , and enclosed meeting rooms provide privacy when needed . and , it hosts informative talks and networking events . most co-working spaces have a heavy component of building community and encouraging entrepreneurship -- some operators say breaking even is nice but not the primary goal . at cocoon , which occupies a sprawling 14,000 square feet and has a ping-pong table and meditation room , members must pass an application process , showing that they have something to offer the co-working community , whether it be a solid start-up idea , programming skills , mentorship or investment potential .  we think hong kong can use another place to foster entrepreneurs , and we hope talent can collaborate amongst themselves ,  says erica ma , one of cocoon 's founders . cocoon charges $ 125 per month , which is unusually low , but the founders see the program as a kind of social enterprise to support start-ups and smaller businesses . the space organizes regular events , including a recent talk on brand licensing and barcamp , a technology conference that originated in the u.s. entrepreneurs say in the daily grind , which often means hours sitting in front of a laptop , it helps to know that others are doing the same thing . yet people working on internet start-ups do not get much support , as the field is still seen as unconventional in hong kong . so for jah ying chung , who is starting launchpilots.org , a site that helps young people get involved in social causes , going to cocoon provides motivation .  it 's different when you 're always seeing people doing stuff that 's cool . it 's a big impetus ,  she says .", "summary": " co-working spaces widespread in u.s. , europe and making headway in asia .   these places court mostly people in 20s , 30s working on projects solo or in small teams .   freelancing catching on in asia , where people traditionally work for large corporations .   most co-working spaces seek to build community and encouraging entrepreneurship .
