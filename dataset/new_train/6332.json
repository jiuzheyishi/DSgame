{"text": "james bond has entered into mortal combat with some of the world 's most dangerous criminals on countless occasions -- yet always beats the odds and walks away with his life . now one eagle-eyed fan has calculated the exact probability of 007 dodging death so many times -- and come to the conclusion he should have died years ago . gordon stanger worked out that the spy had been shot at a staggering 4,662 times since the first film , dr no , in 1962 . death defying : daniel craig , pictured in 2006 's casino royale , is one of several bonds to have improbably dodged death over the years . the survival of james bonds like piers brosnan is all the more surprising given the spy normally , unlike this picture , finds himself unarmed when faced with death . he then estimated there was a 5 per cent chance of the spy being fatally wounded on each occasion . expressed mathematically , this means the chance of bond not getting killed is 1.4 x 10 to the power of minus 104 , or in mr stanger 's words , ` as close to zero as makes no difference ' . when you take into account the 130 other attempts on bond 's life that did not involve being shot at , the chances of him surviving are even slimmer . there have been 22 official bond movies and the attempts on 007 's life have grown increasingly sinister . in the 1964 film goldfinger , bond was handcuffed to a ticking bomb and strapped to a table underneath a giant laser . mr stanger estimates that over the years james bond -lrb- played by roger moore , left , and sean connery , right -rrb- has killed 198 of his enemies in the films . when the agent asks : ` do you expect me to talk ? ' the film 's eponymous villain replies : ` no , mr bond , i expect you to die . ' bond 's survival rate is even more staggering when you consider he is rarely armed when he finds himself in a fight to the death . his survival is often due to his use of household appliances , such as lamps or abandoned objects . mr stanger , who lives in the solomon islands , also estimates that britain 's most famous agent has killed 198 of his enemies in the films . mr stanger constructed his formula after new scientist magazine asked its readers to work out what was the probability of bond still being alive . the 23rd bond film , skyfall , which will star daniel craig , dame judi dench and naomie harris , is currently being filmed .", "summary": " chance of bond not being killed over the years is ` as close to zero as makes no difference '   britain 's most famous spy has killed 198 of his enemies over the 22 official films .
