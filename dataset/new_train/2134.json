{"text": "while some architects compete over height , others compete with shape . after china 's  donut  hotel -lrb- aka the sheraton huzhou hot springs resort -rrb- hit monitors earlier this month , another eye-opening hotel design has just been announced -- also with a massive hole in the middle of the building . designed by spanish architecture firm ooiio , the unbalance hotel -lrb- the project 's working title -rrb- resembles a tilted photo frame at the edge of a high cliff in lima , peru .  lima hasn ´ t got a representative iconic building that brings the more than 8 million inhabitants of the city to be well known worldwide ,  ooiio director joaquín millán tells cnn .  we wanted to create something radical , strong . a landmark , a building that makes you think , a shape that shakes your imagination .  we know that as soon as you do something that radical on such a dominant location there are going to be a lot of people hating it . and some of them also loving it .  this is what we want -- make people talk about architecture , and what to do and not to do with lima 's urban landscape .  bold purchase . hugging a space between the pacific ocean and the city , the unique shape of  unbalance hotel  ensures people behind the building wo n't have their views out to the ocean blocked . the bold dream , however , will be fulfilled only with the help of an equally bold investor . fortunately for ooiio , a private latin american investor , who the company wo n't name , is said to be pleased with the design .  we were not sure if he was going to react ok to such a strong proposal ,  says millán .  actually we had a b option ready just in case , but we never had to show it .  after a long silence he started to say nice things about the project , and he sees the economic potential of such a building design . now he is in love with it !  the design is still in its development stage and nothing has been confirmed , so no construction or opening dates were given . if approved , the  unbalance hotel  is meant to serve as both a hotel and congress center , consisting of 125 rooms , restaurants , conference rooms and an exhibition space . the interior design will include  some spaces with non-vertical facades , and very spectacular hall and rooftop restaurants ,  says millán . other outrageous designs from ooiio include miraflores-barranco footbridge , a spiky footbridge that looks like peruvian crystal , and valer church , a wooden church that doubles as a public space in a small norwegian village .", "summary": " spanish design firm ooiio has an imaginative design for its upcoming hotel project in peru .   called  unbalance hotel ,  the design resembles a tilted photo frame by the cliff .   the design will avoid blocking sea views and aims to become a landmark for lima .
