{"text": "sitting in the public gallery at bristol crown court , civil servant ruth edwards grasped her sister 's hand and collapsed in tears as her father david was jailed for killing her mother . yet , the 28-year-old , who works at the ministry of defence , was not just grieving for her 44-year-old mother michaela , who had been strangled to death with her own dressing gown cord . she was mourning the fact that her father , who also worked at the mod , would spend the next 11 years behind bars . in a remarkable act of forgiveness , ruth and her younger sister sara , 25 , even sent a letter to the court begging for their dad 's freedom . they described their parents as ' a couple who could n't be apart but should n't have been together ' . ` they had an intense and destructive relationship that brought out the worst in each other , ' they added . heartbreaking : david edwards was jailed for strangling his wife michaela to death . his daughters ruth and sara , are still close to their dad . ruth , centre , is pictured with sara , left , and their father , right , when they were younger . now , speaking for the first time since that day four years ago , ruth said : ' a lot of people will struggle to understand how we could forgive dad . ` but i 've never blamed him for mum 's death because it was not his fault . he 's like two different people to me . the person who killed my mum was n't my dad . he was someone different , who was n't in control of what he was doing . ` my dad is a really gentle man and it must have taken a lot to push him to do something so awful . he lost his rag and saw red . that 's how i deal with it in my head . i separate the person who killed mum from the person who is my dad . ' ruth 's story is told in the cutting edge documentary lifers , which is screened on channel 4 tonight . filmmakers were granted unprecedented access to leicester 's gartree prison , home to 600 men sentenced to life in jail . david edwards , now 51 , who worked for the mod in bristol , has been at the prison since he was sentenced to life on november 12 , 2008 . he had strangled his wife at their home in bradley stoke , near bristol after she had taunted him about her new lover . edwards , who is now doing a degree in art history , told the programme : ' i feel i had all the advantages life had to offer me . that makes me feel my crime is in some way worse than everybody else 's . when you kill the person you love , it 's almost like a double grief . you grieve for the loss and you grieve for the fact you 've caused that loss . ' tragic : david and michaela on their wedding day . david strangled his wife at their home in bradley stoke , near bristol after she had taunted him about her new lover . it had all seemed so different when they got married at the catholic church in borehamwood , hertfordshire , in the summer of 1983 . ruth was born on valentine 's day the following year and sara came along two years later . but in 1996 - when ruth was 12 and sara ten - the couple , who both worked for the mod , were forced to relocate to bristol . ` we were definitely aware they had problems , ' recalled ruth . ` they had lots of fights over money and the stress it was causing . i think moving to bristol made things worse because mum was away from her family and lost her support network and missed her parents . ` but i have lots of good memories from childhood -- going out for day trips to london zoo and on family holidays . when they were n't fighting there was a lot of love between them and things were really good . ' the couple 's relationship teetered on until their daughters had left school but in 2005 they separated for a year . edwards moved out to live in a flat in bath while his wife stayed in the family home with ruth . sara was in her first year at hull university . ` mum and dad were n't talking at the time , ' said ruth . ' i remember her finding a receipt for some furniture he was buying . he had rented a flat and had the delivery details on it with his new address . mum read it and said :  oh . he must be moving out .  difficult : ruth and sara visiting a zoo with their mother michaela . the sisters said their parents had ` an intense and destructive relationship that brought out the worst in each other ' ' i was quite relieved at the time because i wanted them both to be happy -- and if they were n't happy together i 'd rather they were happy apart . the tension was so high -- they would fight , not talk for a couple of months and then get back together and then the cycle would start again . ` but at the same time it 's so hard when your parents split up . you feel awful and you are torn in two directions . you do n't want to take sides . dad was in a serious bout of depression and would n't talk to anyone while mum saw it as a new start . ' however , about a year later , edwards returned home . ` he wrote to mum saying he was ill and would like to meet up and talk about it , ' said ruth . ` she went for a drink with him and he came back with her and sat down in the front room . it was all a bit confusing . they did n't explain anything to us . they just went on as if nothing had changed . sadly they did n't have marriage counselling . ' close : ruth and sara with their father on bonfire night . the two sisters sent a letter to bristol crown court begging for their dad 's freedom before he was sentenced for killing their mother . within a year ruth had moved out , exhausted by her parents on-off relationship . she barely spoke to her mother again . ` it became unbearable living there , ' explained ruth . ` that 's why i moved out . we never had any big blow-ups but she would give me the cold shoulder and silent treatment and act like i was n't there . ' ruth did not talk to her mother again until her father had a heart attack in march 2008 . even then her mum got a friend to call her . by then her parents were separated - although they lived in the same house , ate together , travelled to work together and went on trips together . edwards still did the washing , his wife 's ironing and paid the major bills . when he was in hospital , his wife visited him every day . ' i went out of my way to drive her to the hospital , ' recalled ruth . ` but she treated me like a taxi driver . she was so rude . she was very short and abrupt and could n't bear to say thank you to me . ' happy : ruth , sara and their father are pictured on holiday in bulgaria . david was sentenced to 11 years behind bars for killing their mother . but towards the end of the year , michaela began dating someone else and edwards emailed both his daughters asking to stay the night . ` it was the first time i had seen him since his heart attack , ' said ruth . ` he was very down . there was definitely something wrong . but he did n't specify what it was and i did n't push him . perhaps i should have ? hindsight is a brilliant thing . ' ruth spent christmas with her sister and the pair had lunch with ruth 's now ex-boyfriend roy , a warehouse worker , on december 27 . when they returned home , two policemen knocked at the door and told them their mother was in hospital . the detectives said that their father was in a police cell , having called 999 and confessed to strangling her . ' i remember thinking there must be a mistake , ' she said . ' i could n't believe dad had done anything to her . i was in complete shock . i remember saying :  are you sure it was him ?  but they said :  yes . he confessed straight away .  ' the girls immediately went to visit their mother in frenchay hospital , where she was in intensive care . but four days later , on new year 's eve , they decided to switch their mother 's life support machine off . ' i had mixed feelings seeing her at the hospital , ' said ruth , who had not spoken to her mother for ten months . she looked very tiny and vulnerable . a wave of emotion hit me because it was so sad . but we knew she was not going to wake up from the coma . ' happier times : david and michaela with sara in london . the couple 's daughters said they could n't be apart but should n't have been together . the funeral was held at westbury-on-trym crematorium and the whole family attended apart from edwards who was in custody . the next time the girls saw their father was in court when he pleaded guilty to their mother 's murder . ` we had been hoping that he would not plead guilty , ' revealed ruth . ` but dad did n't want a trial or to see mum 's name dragged through the mud . even now he still cherishes her above all else . there 's no doubt he 's still in love with her . ' since their father was jailed , both ruth and sara have travelled a 250-mile round trip to visit him each month . ` it was such a lovely feeling to be able to see him after everything we had all gone through , ' explained ruth . we just wanted to say to him :  it 's ok . we 're not angry with you . we understand .  although he was in total shock -- his eyes were barely focusing -- you could see that he felt relieved . ` what is surprising is that my sister and i have discovered that we are both a lot stronger than we thought we would be . ` neither sara nor i have had counselling . we talked about it a bit but felt we did n't need it . to some people it might seem strange . but the bond between dad , sara and me is stronger than ever .
