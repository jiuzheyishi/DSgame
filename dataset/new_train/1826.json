' ` liz . has been a guest in our home , has spent time and shared holidays with . our children , and when mary and i got married in 2012 - she did n't . hesitate to tell us how happy she was for us , ' poe wrote on the social . media site . ` to have her now say she does n't support our right to marry is offensive to say the least . ' sisters at war : the wyoming candidate for senate liz cheney , left , announced her staunch opposition to gay marriage angering her gay married sister , mary cheney , right . the statement from the former vice president and his wife also appeared to be an attempt to bolster ms cheney 's run for the wyoming senate seat . ` one thing should be clear . liz has always believed in the traditional definition of marriage . she . has also always treated her sister and her sister 's family with love and . respect , exactly as she should have done , ' said the couple . liz cheney was asked on fox news if she was flip-flopping on her gay marriage stance . host chris wallace pointed out that while she had opposed a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage , she had also supporting the state department 's plan to offer benefits to same-sex employees and their partners . ` it 's not , and i stand by both of those positions , ' ms cheney said . ' i do n't believe we ought to discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation . ` if people are in a same-sex . relationship and they want their partner to be able to have health . benefits or be designated as a beneficiary in your life insurance , . there 's no reason we should n't do that . pained : in november , dick cheney , right , and his wife lynne , center , said in a statement that they were ` pained ' over the public dispute between their two daughters over their differing views on gay marriage . not backing down : liz cheney reasserted her stance against gay marriage in november despite having a legally-married lesbian sister . ' i also do n't support amending the constitution on this issue . i do believe it 's an issue that 's got to be left up to the states . i do believe in the traditional definition of marriage , ' ms cheney added . in september her sister mary cheney , who legally married her longtime partner heather poe in washington in 2012 and has two daughters , wrote on facebook saying her sister 's stance on gay marriage was ` dead wrong ' . ` for the record , i love my sister , but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage . freedom means freedom for everyone . that means that all families - regardless of how they look or how they are made - all families are entitled to the same rights , privileges and protections as every other . ' liz cheney responded to that message soon after , saying that she too loves her sister but this is an issue ` on which we disagree ' . ms cheney 's strong stance on the issue of gay marriage may have had something to do with her bid to win the senate race in ultra-conservative wyoming . partner : mary cheney wed her longtime partner heather poe , left , in 2012 . they are pictured here at a memorial for victims of the 9/11 attacks .

' i believe the issue of marriage must be decided by the states , and by the people in the states , not by judges and not even by legislators , but by the people themselves . ' this stance is also a slight departure for the candidate in regards to her high profile father . since as far back as 2004 , dick cheney has maintained a pro-gay marriage stance . ` lynne . and i have a gay daughter , so it 's an issue our family is very familiar . with , ' mr cheney told an audience that included his daughter while . stumping in iowa in 2004 . ` with . the respect to the question of relationships , my general view is . freedom means freedom for everyone . people ought to be free to enter . into any kind of relationship they want to .
