{"text": "men should not take high doses of vitamin e or selenium supplements because they have no health benefits and increase the risk of prostate cancer by up to a fifth , scientists have claimed . vitamin e , naturally found in nuts , spinach and broccoli , is taken to boost the body 's immune system and the mineral selenium , found in fish and meat , is taken to ward off heart disease . but us researchers claim large doses of both can increase the risk of prostate cancer by 17 per cent . discovery : men should not take high doses of vitamin e -lrb- pictured -rrb- or selenium supplements because they have no health benefits and increase the risk of prostate cancer by up to a fifth , u.s. researchers have claimed . this can rise to as much as 91 per cent if a man already has high levels of selenium before taking supplements . the warning centres on high-dose supplements , with researchers saying there appear to be no risks from taking a standard multivitamin . but nor were there any apparent benefits from the supplements . lead researcher alan kristal , of the fred hutchinson cancer research centre in seattle , said : ` men using these supplements should stop , period . source : vitamin e , naturally found in spinach , left , and nuts , right , is taken to boost the body 's immune system . neither selenium nor vitamin e supplementation confers any known benefits , only risks . ' the study looked in detail at a past trial , carried out to test whether extra vitamin e and selenium could help prevent prostate cancer . but instead , researchers discovered more cases of prostate cancer among men taking 400 international units -lrb- iu -rrb- of vitamin e daily than those taking a placebo . this is the equivalent of 363mg a day , which is 30 times the recommended daily amount . men with low levels of selenium were the most affected by extra vitamin e -- with the supplements raising their prostate cancer risk by 63 per cent . dr kristal said : ` many people think that dietary supplements are helpful or at the least , innocuous . this is not true . ` we know from several other studies that some high-dose dietary supplements -- that is , supplements that provide far more than the daily recommended intakes of micronutrients -- increase cancer risk . ' more than 35,000 healthy men in their 50s and older took part in the initial trial , which began in 2001 . further investigation of this data , published yesterday in the journal of the national cancer institute , revealed the latest findings . in the uk , the recommended daily amount of vitamin e is 12mg , and most multivitamin pills contain between 15mg and 30mg . however , the uk expert group on vitamins and minerals says the upper ` safe ' limit is between 700 and 800mg a day -- twice as much as taken in the trial . dr matthew hobbs , deputy director of research at prostate cancer uk , said more studies were needed , but added : ` if men are concerned about their prostate cancer risk , rather than worrying about selenium and vitamin e supplements , they should talk to a gp . '", "summary": " vitamin e and selenium supplements do not benefit health , say scientists .   claim large doses of both can raise risk of prostate cancer by 17 per cent .   this can rise to 91 per cent in men with high levels of selenium in body .   vitamin e , found in nuts and spinach , is taken to boost immune system .
