{"text": "guilty : majid hussain is pictured arriving at exeter crown court . mr hussain , who was found guilty of falsely claiming at least # 35,000 in benefits , was handed a nine month suspended sentence . an iraqi immigrant who falsely claimed at least # 35,000 in benefits has been spared jail today . majid hussain claimed income support , housing benefit and a council tax reduction for more than a decade - despite having more than # 35,000 stashed away in a bank account . he had denied three counts of benefit fraud but was found guilty at exeter crown court . hussain walked free from court however , when he was handed a nine month suspended sentence . the court had heard during the trial how hussain , of exeter in devon , arrived in the uk as a mature student in the 1980s funded by saddam hussein 's government . he was left around # 18,000 by his father but said that the money had been put into a royal bank of scotland account for use as a trust fund to pay for his children 's education . but the unemployed 62-year-old signed forms saying that he did not have any undeclared savings when claiming benefits . he said that under sharia law he did not consider the money to belong to him . while claiming benefits , the account grew to be worth # 36,000 . hussain , who has never worked since he arrived in the uk , received at least # 35,000 in benefits between 1997 and 2010 - though the precise figure can never be determined because records do not go back far enough . the father of four stopped receiving income support after the existence of the account was revealed in 2010 - at which point he immediately began withdrawing money from it . however , he is still receiving disability living allowance because he suffers from crohn 's disease , kidney problems and muscle pain . the jury was given a dossier of forms signed by the defendant in which he declared that neither he nor any of his children - aged between nine and 18 - had any savings affecting the means test for their benefits . his defence statement read : ` he did not notify the dwp of some of the money under his control because it was left to him on strict islamic terms by a relative for the sole use of his children . ` in accordance with islamic belief and law , there was no possibility or option for it ever to be used for his own use and as such there was no intention to deceive . ' sentenced : majid hussain claimed he did nothing wrong because he was acting under the rule of islamic law . testifying in court yesterday , hussain said : ' i read the koran and in the koran it commands you to honour your parents . ` you have to respect them . in the koran we call them the  second god  . ' he continued : ' i have an article of the koran here - it says ,  allah commands you to render back your trust to those to whom they are due and not to break your oath . for allah knows all that you do .  ` that 's what we 've been taught - always obey your parents . i was just going to keep the money for my children and not touch it . i had no right to the money . ' he added that his father had ` worked so hard ' to save the money he gave his son , working in heat of up to 56c -lrb- 133f -rrb- . hussain initially told investigators he had saved the money from the scholarship he received from the iraqi government while studying at the university of exeter from 1986 to 1996 , according to prosecutor gareth evans . when an official asked him if he knew his benefits would be withdrawn if he had declared the account , he said ` yes ' , the court heard . home : the defendant has lived in the uk since moving from iraq as a mature student in the 1980s . he then allegedly started withdrawing large sums of money from the rbs account , reducing it by # 24,000 over seven months . mr evans told jurors : ' i am afraid that his declarations that he had no bank accounts or savings with his wife or any children he was claiming for was a lie . ` if he would have disclosed this account then he would not have been entitled to benefits at all . ` he has been dishonest claiming his benefits , he knew that he should have declared the account and he failed to do so dishonestly in order to claim benefits . ' sentencing hussain , recorder paul dunkels qc said : ` the jury rejected that this money was held in trust for your children 's education . ` the -lrb- benefit -rrb- forms you filled in when making your claims made it perfectly clear that you had a duty to tell the authorities -lrb- of the money -rrb- . ` the real extent of how much money -lrb- paid in benefits -rrb- can never be obtained because your fraud has gone on for such a long period of time . ' he made no order for costs , although confiscation proceedings are expected to be taken against hussain .", "summary": " unemployed majid hussain given money by father to spend on his children .   did not declare bank account because ` under islamic law money was not his '   came to britain as student funded by saddam hussein 's iraqi government .   he was handed a nine month sentence suspended for two years .
