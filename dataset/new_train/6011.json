{"text": "follow @@ jeffpowell_mail . objecting to the referee only four days before the biggest fight in post-war britain is just the latest quirk from george groves and he will enjoy the war of nerves even though his appeal failed . groves , who will exchange grudge-laden championship blows with carl froch at wembley stadium on saturday night , is clearly a boxer with a difference . he split with his trainer just before his first tilt at froch 's world super-middleweight title , and this is the same eccentric who has just signed for a german promoter on the eve of the rematch which will make him a superstar in britain , win or lose . video scroll down to watch george groves working out . failed : george groves -lrb- left -rrb- lost his protest about charlie fitch refereeing saturday 's bout against carl froch . rematch : groves will fight froch in front of a sell out crowd at wembley stadium on saturday evening . no go : groves objected to fitch 's appointment as his refereeing style may benefit froch -lrb- left -rrb- . controversial : referee howard foster stopped george groves -lrb- left -rrb- in the original bout in november . bad blood : the incident is the latest in a heated build-up between froch -lrb- left -rrb- and groves -lrb- right -rrb- . having insisted he would not fight froch a second time if either the referee or the judges were british , he staged his late protest against american charlie fitch being the third man in the ring . since froch 's promoter eddie hearn had already asked for another us referee , david reiss , to be replaced , this may have been as much a tit-for-tat reaction as a suspicion that fitch 's style might help his opponent . boxers usually leave the wheeling and dealing to their managers . when groves dispensed with adam booth , who doubled as his trainer , on the november eve of froch-groves i , he then had to hire the lesser-known paddy fitzpatrick to work his corner . fitzpatrick is now established as his trainer but groves takes care of his own business . but why burden himself with the potentially distracting extra workload ? ` that part 's simple , ' he says . ` i no longer trust anyone else to look after me and my money . ' so , . as if preparing to fight a three-time champion in froch 's 12th . consecutive world title fight is not enough , the 26-year-old groves took . out a british boxing board of control licence to manage himself . shortly . before his work-out in front of hundreds of fellow londoners at the . westfield shopping centre on tuesday , he found time to lodge his . complaint about the ref . popular : hundreds of fans turned out at westfield shopping centre to see groves get put through his paces . raring to go : groves has predicted he 'll knock out froch in three rounds on saturday night . he did so knowing that it might not be possible for a second substitute to be found and flown to london in time to undergo the british board 's stringent medical checks . by now the ibf , whose world . super-middleweight title is at stake along with a wba belt , could be . forgiven for wishing they had not acceded to groves 's petition for this . rematch following froch 's controversial win first time out . groves scorned legal representation at that hearing , paying for his trip to new jersey and arguing his own case . he . then opposed the use of any british officials , so upset was he with the . premature stoppage inflicted by home referee howard foster . gloves on : froch 's -lrb- right -rrb- rematch with groves -lrb- left -rrb- will take place on saturday at wembley stadium . controversy : there has been bad blood between the pair since froch was deemed to have beaten groves in november . again he succeeded , though by laying claim to the position of mandatory title challenger he shot himself in the foot financially . in these circumstances , the ibf stipulate that the defending champion receives up to 85 per cent of the purse . so while froch can bank between # 5-10million for saturday night 's work , depending on the size of the pay-per-view audience , groves is believed to be receiving around # 1.5 m . he shrugs and says : ` after i 've knocked out carl my big pay-days will come .
