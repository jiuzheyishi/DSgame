{"text": "what does it mean to be nigerian ? that 's the question on the lips of many in africa 's most populous country as new national identity cards are being rolled out . but this is an i.d. with a difference . the card , which fits into a wallet and comes with a credit-card style chip , can also be used to make electronic payments . nigerians can use it to deposit funds , receive social benefits , pay for goods and withdraw cash at atms across the country , according to mastercard , which provides the card 's prepaid payment technology . the company also claims that by providing proof of identity , the card solves one of the biggest problems people face when trying to open a bank account .  to all nigerians , i say , remember the national identification number , is your identity ,  nigerian president goodluck jonathan said at the launch of the national identity smart card , or neid , at the end of august .  the card is not only a means of certifying your identity , but also a personal database repository and payment card , all in your pocket .  the card could also be used for voting in the future , while chris onyemenam , director general and ceo of the nigerian identity management commission -lrb- nimc -rrb- , said that citizens will have  the potential to use it as an international travel document .  earlier this week , finance minister ngozi okonjo-iweala said 3,000 people had received cards . in order to get the document , nigerians have to register at one of the nimc enrollment centers around the country and provide 10 fingerprints , a picture of their face and iris , as well as information about their age and place of birth . once registered , the nimc official issues an i.d. number and then the card . growth opportunity . nigeria produces more oil than any other african nation , but the world bank says only about 30 % of the population have a bank account . given 170 million people live in the country , mastercard claims to have spotted an opportunity for growth . research conducted by mastercard 's consultancy arm says that cash dependency in a country like nigeria can cost up to 1.5 % of gross domestic product . given nigeria has recently recently re-calculated it 's 2013 gdp to a figure of $ 488 billion , making it africa 's biggest economy , that 's certainly an amount the government is keen to keep a hold of . card controversy . but not everyone is happy with this pocket-sized one-stop-shop . human rights activist shehu sani attacked the scheme on facebook : . while eze onyekpere , lead director at the non-governmental organisation centre for social justice , said the collaboration was not appropriate .  there should be difference between everyday credit or payment cards and an identity card issued by a sovereign authority ,  he says .  even if mastercard was needed to ensure a good payment system , there is nothing that says it must be heavily embossed on the card . it could guarantee the card without necessarily getting this free advert from 170 million nigerians .  onyekpere has also criticised the way the nigerian government partnered with the international payments provider .  the choice of mastercard did not undergo a competitive selection process ,  he claims .  it was clearly an abuse of nigeria 's public procurement process and the selection should have been open to all companies that can provide the service . a mastercard spokesperson denied the payments company was turning the i.d. card project into a branding exercise . in an emailed statement the company said  the brand mark is not mastercard 's corporate logo , nor is it an advertisement for the company . the mastercard brand displayed on the card is what makes the electronic payment component of the eid card accepted as a means of payment .  nimc spokesperson umar abdulhamid rejected any allegation of foul play in partnering with mastercard .  it 's a level playing field ,  he said in a phone interview .  other payment providers have been invited to get involved , but were apprehensive .  and daniel monehin , president of mastercard 's sub saharan africa division , joined abdulhamid in dismissing this claim . in a phone interview he said that  the collaboration went through all the highest levels of government .  previous attempts . this is not the first time nigerian authorities have tried to implement such a card . the idea of a national identity card scheme for nigeria was first initiated in 1978 , according to the u.n. office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs . but successive governments and coups meant the idea did not become a reality . more recently , progress on the provision of identity cards for nigerians took shape in early 2003 , when some 60,000 centers were set up to register citizens . while the approach to take photographs and fingerprints sought to avoid fraud , an article on the u.n. refugee agency 's website reports that irregularities in the roll-out of the i.d. cards meant that by 2008 the government was planning a new card . a month into this latest identity project there remains no fixed timetable for when the roll out of the initial 13 million cards will be completed . read more : africa 's oil and gas : boom or hype ? read more : in the driving seat of s. africa 's economy . more from marketplace africa .", "summary": "
