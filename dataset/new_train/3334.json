{"text": "goodbye to the lob , farewell to the pob and anybody sporting a frob had better start growing out that fringe fast . this autumn it 's all about the wob , or wavy bob . yes , after the long bob , the posh -lrb- victoria beckham -rrb- bob and the fringed bob , the wavy bob is the only hairdo in town . queen of the wob brigade is jennifer lawrence , who grew out last year 's pixie cut into the casual flicky style . beyonce , nicole richie and sienna miller have gone for the chop - and every time i switch on strictly i see caroline flack 's wob bouncing across the dancefloor . scroll down for video . going for the chop : lydia with long locks and , right , her new carefree wavy bob . the name may be silly but the look is sizzling : youthful , edgy and seemingly low-maintenance , as messiness is the key to the wob 's appeal . what 's more , it is supposed to work on almost every face shape . ` the wob is carefree , ' says beverly hills-based celebrity stylist nelson chan . ` the waviness brings out the sexiness in women . ' well , it certainly looks lovely on lawrence . but would it suit me , 20 years her senior at a ripe old 44 , at least a stone heavier and with no hairstylist in my entourage ? i was n't so sure . my hairdo is n't so much low-maintenance as no-maintenance . i do n't even own a can of hairspray and the last time i visited the salon with a photograph , saying ' i want to look like her ' , it was the mid-nineties and i was clutching a picture of jennifer aniston . on me , the ` rachel ' was a disaster . i could n't be bothered to style it properly , so it ended up more rod stewart . i grew out the layers and since then i 've kept my hair one length , usually just below the collarbone . so maybe it was time for a style reboot , and perhaps a wob would be the answer . my ten-year-old daughter was solidly behind the idea . but when i sat down in jo hansford 's mayfair salon , i found myself feeling wobbly . all around were chic-looking women with cascades of glossy hair - yet i was sacrificing my long locks for a short , deliberately scruffy bob . was i insane ? stylist michaela galvin was reassuring . ` it will definitely suit your face shape , ' she said . but was i too old for such a trendy look ? ` oh no ! we 've had all sorts of people asking for them . ' the wob brigade : jennifer lawrence , left , and sienna miller have both got the haircut . then she sliced through six inches of hair in a single snip and there was no going back . a wob may look carefree but it 's quite complicated to create . first michaela snipped my hair off in a straight bob just below the chin . then she set to work with thinning scissors to reduce the volume - a relief , as otherwise i could see myself with a triangular ` do ' like wendolene ramsbottom , wallace 's love interest in a close shave . ` the problem is you 've got about five times as much hair as jennifer lawrence , ' michaela explained . once my hair was lying closer to my face , she chopped into it at the bottom to add the required touch of shagginess . finally she added a few romantic waves with curling tongs . ` do n't curl the hair right to the end , ' she counselled . ` you want to leave a little flick out at the bottom , so it looks very casual . ' for the final touch she sprayed my hair with shu uemura 's art of hair texture wave spray , which contains cottonseed oil for shine-free hold -lrb- glossiness is a no-no in a wob , apparently -rrb- . et voila ! two hours later , i had the season 's ultimate un-do . looking in the mirror , i was shocked to see air where i 'd once had hair . but gradually i found myself warming to my wob . the casual waves added width to the top half of my face and made my eyes look wider and my jawline slimmer . less time on hair styling means more time on rehearsing : strictly come dancing 's caroline flack is another fan of the style . ` wow ! ' said my husband that night . my eldest daughter loved it too . ` it 's epic ! ' she shrieked . the eight-year-old was n't so sure . ` you look messy , ' she said , fetching the hairbrush . it was next morning that the wob 's real benefits started to reveal themselves . i leapt out of bed , flung on my clothes and hustled the children off to school without bothering even to comb my bed-head . but as i crashed through the school gates , i had a smug conviction that this morning i looked chic rather than shabmy friends said i looked younger . my wob was n't too hard to style . that night , for a party , i re-did it using my sister 's hair tongs to add the waves , then glued them in with l'oreal 's tecni-art fix anti-frizz . not everyone liked the look . my mother was frankly puzzled . ` what does it mean ? ' she asked . and in truth , the style is not quite as easy to wear as its fans claim . a messy hairdo can look fabulously edgy with smoky eyes , glossy lips and a designer outfit , much less so with no make-up and yoga pants . i 've cut down on hair-brushing time in the mornings but have to spend extra minutes applying mascara and lipstick . that 's a small price to pay , though , for never having a ` bad hair day ' . and the wob 's real secret is that if you do need to look sophisticated , a few brush-strokes and a blast with the dryer can turn it into the sort of sleek bob even your mother would admire . jo hansford.com .", "summary": " queen of the wob brigade is jennifer lawrence .   the look is sizzling : youthful , edgy and seemingly low-maintenance .   lydia slater gave it a try .
