{"text": "it 's become a go-to tool for journalists , a digital man-on-the-street interview when big news breaks : see what they 're saying on twitter . there 's just one problem with that , says the pew research center . opinions expressed in the rapid-fire twitter echo chamber , particularly in response to political news , are often at odds with the general public 's . the differences ? sometimes twitter is more liberal . at other times , it 's more conservative . and it 's very nearly always more negative .  overall , the reaction to political events on twitter reflects a combination of the unique profile of active twitter users and the extent to which events engage different communities and draw the comments of active users ,  the report reads .  while this provides an interesting look into how communities of interest respond to different circumstances , it does not reliably correlate with the overall reaction of adults nationwide .  in the yearlong study , pew focused on political events such as the result of the 2012 presidential election , the first presidential debate between president barack obama and challenger mitt romney and several speeches given by obama . some examples : when obama won re-election , public opinion polls suggested 52 % of the public was pleased and 45 % unhappy . on twitter , a full 77 % of tweets about his win were positive and only 23 % negative . similarly , only 20 % of the public told pollsters they thought obama did a better job than romney in their first debate -lrb- the one in which obama was criticized for looking tired and unfocused -rrb- . but 59 % of tweets favored him . part of that might be explained by looking at who uses twitter . pew 's research shows that twitter users are considerably younger than the general public and more likely to lean democratic . in a 2012 survey , half of adults who said they posted news on twitter were younger than 30 , compared with 23 % of all adults . and 57 % of those who posted news on twitter were either democrats or leaned democratic , compared with 46 % of the general public . but twitter pundits do n't always lean to the left . nearly half of the u.s. public -lrb- 48 % -rrb- thought obama did a good job on his second inaugural address . but only 13 % of the tweets about it echoed that opinion . opinions about sen. john kerry being nominated as obama 's secretary of state split the general public : 39 % approved , 36 % disapproved and 26 % had no opinion . on twitter , a measly 6 % expressed support , while 32 % were negative and a clear majority , 62 % , expressed no opinion . the reason for such a swing , pew said , is that on twitter , unlike in opinion polls , users decide what they think is important enough to mention publicly . a generally popular event might not be portrayed that way if an angry minority is more inspired to post about it . for example , nearly 14 million wrote on twitter about obama 's re-election while a mere 70,000 remarked on kerry 's nomination . politics also reflect a truth that anyone who 's followed the oscars , super bowl , debate nights or , really , any public event can attest to -- the twitter universe is never happier than when it 's being snarky , or downright nasty , to someone .  the overall negativity on twitter over the course of the campaign stood out ,  pew writes .  for both candidates , negative comments exceeded positive comments by a wide margin throughout the fall campaign season .  there were more negative than positive comments about obama and romney on twitter . the negative comments about obama bounced back and forth between 40 % to 50 % throughout the campaign , while positives went up to about 30 % and down into the teens . -lrb- remember , lots of comments can be neutral -rrb- . romney 's negatives were higher . usually , between 50 % to 60 % of talk about him was not nice , while positives only broke above 20 % during the campaign 's final days . another thing to keep in mind when monitoring the conversation on twitter : while it seems to be omnipresent among the digitally connected -lrb- yes , like we journalists tend to be -rrb- , its overall reach is modest compared to other media . in the pew 's 2012 news consumption survey , just 13 % of adults said they ever use twitter or read twitter messages . only 3 % said they regularly or sometimes tweet or retweet news or news headlines on twitter .", "summary": " study : twitter opinions rarely reflect those of the general public .   pew research says the most significant difference is that twitter 's more negative .   twitter users are younger than the public and more identify as politically liberal .   but during some events , the site skewed too conservative vis-a-vis opinion polls .
