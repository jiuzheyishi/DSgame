{"text": "as sparring partners go , a hollywood actress and an evolutionary biologist would not appear to be a natural fit . however , oscar-winner angelina jolie , 39 , and controversial scientist professor richard dawkins , 73 , have found themselves inadvertently at loggerheads over whether children should be allowed to read fairytales . miss jolie , who plays an evil fairy godmother in her latest film maleficent -- a spin on the classic story of sleeping beauty -- said fairytales play an important role in how she raises her six children , using ` a little magic ' to impart important moral lessons . angelina jolie , left , says fairytales are important to teach moral lessons . however , professor richard dawkins , right , warned they could damage children . in a new interview , she said : ` there are morals in these stories and you want a little magic -- it 's important to have something that we 're a little bit in awe of . ` the other day , one of the kids lost a tooth and i talked about the tooth fairy . half of them are old enough to think :  what are you talking about ,  yet they 're still not sure there is n't something . ` and i 'm not lying to them . i say ,  i really ca n't tell you . i do n't really know . mothers are sworn to secrecy .  ` kids grow up fast enough these days , so let 's allow them to have a little bit of childhood for as long as they can . ' richard dawkins acknowledged that the appeal of fairytales lay in their magic but believes they may be causing more harm than we think . he also questioned whether we should let children believe in father christmas at all . do you think teaching children myths like santa claus and fairy tales is damaging ? do you think teaching children myths like santa claus and fairy tales is damaging ? now share your opinion . the comments put her at odds with professor dawkins , famous for his vocal opposition to religion , who this week branded fairytales ` pernicious ' and warned they could damage children . talking at the cheltenham science festival recently , the father-of-one , said : ` is it a good thing to go along with the fantasies of childhood , magical as they are ? or should we be fostering a spirit of scepticism ? i think it 's rather pernicious to inculcate into a child a view of the world which includes supernaturalism -- we get enough of that anyway . ' he faced a backlash after the appearance , even being branded a ` soulless bore ' by former labour mp tom watson . miss jolie plays an evil fairy godmother in her latest film maleficent , a spin on the classic story of sleeping beauty . professor dawkins has since tempered his views , saying : ` i did not and will not condemn fairytales . my whole life has been given over to simulating the imagination , and in childhood years , fairy stories can do that . ' however , he reasserted his opinion on thursday that there is an ` interesting question ' surrounding the effect a ` diet of supernatural magic spells ' might have on the development on children . in contrast , miss jolie , who has three adopted and three biological children with partner brad pitt , 50 -- maddox , 12 , from cambodia , pax , 10 , from vietnam , zahara , 9 , from ethiopia , shiloh , 7 and twins knox and vivienne , 5 -- said she has loved fairytales all her life and that it was this fascination that drew her to the role in maleficent . richard dawkins has claimed that forcing a religion on children without questioning its merits is as bad as ` child abuse ' . the leading atheist said he was against the ` indoctrination of religion ' and teaching it as fact . dawkins ' best-selling book the god delusion argues that belief in a supernatural creator is irrational and harmful to society . in the earlier interview , he claimed he had been told by a woman that while being abused by a priest was a ` yucky ' experience , being told as a child that a protestant friend who died would ` roast in hell ' was more distressing . in remarks to qatar-based tv network al jazeera , he said : ` horrible as sexual abuse no doubt was , the damage was arguably less than the long-term psychological damage inflicted by bringing the child up catholic in the first place . in the interview with psychologies magazine she said : ` i was fascinated by -lsb- maleficent -rsb- as a child . i thought she was the scariest and the most interesting of all the disney characters . but i wanted to know more about her . who is that gorgeous , elegant creature ? so i loved the idea of playing a disney villain . it sounded so much fun . ` i was afraid of her . but i loved her too because she was this elegant , sexy , evil creature . i was drawn to her . ` i got really emotional because the script is very powerful . the kids loved it . ` we tried to make this sophisticated enough that adults will read things into it that kids wo n't . parents watching the movie will identify with maleficent in a different way , which i think is fine . ` little kids on set cried when they saw me . people would bring their children on to the set and one kid said  mommy , tell that mean witch to stop talking to me !  ` we have a choice about how we take what happens to us in our life and whether or not we allow it to turn us . we can become consumed by hate and darkness , or we 're able to regain our humanity somehow , or come to terms with things and learn something about ourselves .
