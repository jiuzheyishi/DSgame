{"text": "a group of morris dancers have been forced to end a 900-year-old procession as they struggle to cope with the magnitude of paperwork involved . the dolphin morris men revived the 12th century event , dating back to 1109 , in 1981 and have carried it out every year since . but this saturday will be the last time they dance 20 miles from nottingham to southwell as organisers ` can no longer keep up with the 21st century ' . tradition : the dolphin morris men have danced across 20 miles from nottingham to southwell every year in a 900-year-old tradition but can no longer afford to close roads and cope with the magnitude of paperwork . end : the procession , started in 1109 , cost # 500 this year and took weeks to organise , co-ordinators say . to hold the procession , which snakes through pubs and village greens along the route , the committee have to apply for road closures and buy signs . added to the remaining costs , they have finally decided it is untenable . co-ordinator chris gigg said : ` what started as a simple procession has become very complicated . the cost associated with this year 's event has been about # 500 . ` because of the procession , we have to close off some of the roads , which obviously takes a lot of planning . ` if you 're having road closures , you also have to hire road signs and things like that . the administration and costs involved in organising the event is out of all proportion . ` we 're really disappointed as it has been a fantastic tradition , with people coming together from all over the region . ` unfortunately the 21st century has caught up with us . ' support : the parade started as a way to raise money to support the church and build the southwell minster . route : 160 morris dancers will leave nottingham at 8.30 am this saturday after the lord mayor hands over a purse containing 13 shillings and four pence - the amount nottingham gave to southwell in 1109 . the dolphin morris men 's bagman martin . morley , 60 , said : ` i 've really enjoyed being part of this ancient . tradition , especially as people from all over come along to take part . ` unfortunately , increased regulation with road closures and costs has made it very difficult , so we 've decided to stop doing it this year . ` it 's a shame , but it has just become a bit too much for us . ' the gate to southwell tradition celebrated the 12th century procession of parishioners to southwell minster in order to pay for the upkeep of the cathedral . as the dolphin morris men 's website explains : ` it all started in 1109 when it was decided to build a ` mother church ' at southwell - what is now known as southwell minster . ` churches do n't come cheap , so they hit . on a ruse to invite people from all over the diocese to walk to . southwell and bring money with them . the walking made it a nice day out , . and the transport costs thus saved could be given to the church . the . perfect plan ! lamenting the magnitude of red tape , co-ordinator chris gigg said : ` the 21st century has caught up with us ' ` the amount given by each parish varied , according to the wealth and generosity of the parishioners . nottingham , for example , gave 13 shillings and four pence -lrb- about 66p -rrb- , whereas lowly stanton gave only 5d -lrb- about 2p -rrb- . the whole lot came to 15 pounds , 18 shillings , seven pence and one farthing . ` in today 's money , just under # 16 - the cost of a cd - but in those days , enough to buy a whole steeple , or a good sized nave . ' history books show that morris dancers have been involved in the event from as far back as 1530 . on saturday , more than 160 dancers will process between nottingham and southwell . the ceremony begins at 8.30 am when nottingham 's lord mayor hands over a purse containing 13 shillings and four pence . some dancers walking the entire 20 miles and others using cars or minibuses to get between the various meeting points . it ends with a rendezvous at southwell minster where the purse containing the ` southwell pence ' is handed over to the clerk . dolphin morris men member bob hine , 70 , was responsible for re-starting the event 33 years ago and has been part of the procession ever since . he said : ` i 'm trying to think of it in a more positive way . ` it 's amazing we 've kept this going as long as we have . ` it started off as a one-off event so to have carried it on for more than 30 years is fantastic . ' peter goode , nottinghamshire county council 's traffic manager , said : ` it will be disappointing to see the loss of a 900 year-old tradition , but there is also a need to recognise the complexity of managing old events safely on today 's roads which carry high volumes of fast-moving traffic . ` the county council has supported this event by waiving charges for making legal orders and approving traffic management , but we do have to ensure that event organisers make their own proper arrangements to ensure the safety of participants and the general public and to minimise disruption . ` the standards for the management of traffic are set by the department for transport and apply across all local authority areas and to all similar events nationwide . ` we are happy to work with the event organisers and propose other routes which may reduce their costs by being less dependent on road closures , diversions and traffic restrictions .
