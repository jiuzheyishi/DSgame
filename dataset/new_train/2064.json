{"text": "at&t broadband users will soon face a cap on the amount of internet data they can download a month . traditional dsl users will be capped at 150 gb per month , while subscribers to the fiber-backed uverse system have a 250-gb limit . usage over that will be charged at $ 10/month for 50 gb , the company says . the company says that currently only a small percentage of users -- around 2 % -- use this much data a month . if that 's the case , it 's not clear why the company is bothering to install the caps . it is , however , the same rationale -lrb- and the same usage stat -rrb- that the company relied upon to explain why it would be capping iphone data plans last summer , which had hitherto been  unlimited .  wired : congressman wants to ban download caps . dsl and uverse connect fairly directly to a hub -- unlike cable connections where users share a local loop that can become congested . bulk-bandwidth costs for an isp are a tiny portion of its business costs , and those prices continue to fall even as users consume more and more data . so , how could a user end up hitting these caps ? streaming video such as hd movies from netflix , using bittorrent to download movies and heavy gaming with services like steam can easily eat up lots of data , especially in households with multiple heavy internet users . at&t is n't the first large broadband provider to impose caps . comcast imposed a 250-gb cap shortly after the company was caught throttling bittorrent downloads . time warner cable tried going further with trials of a service that imposed very low limits for users , which led to a furor among users and lawmakers . there 's little data to demonstrate whether large isps actually are experiencing real issues with congestion . skeptics see the limits as ways to discourage cable video customers from  cutting the cord  and getting their video online , or as a way to pocket profits instead of re-investing in bulking up their infrastructure . derek turner , the research director for the net neutrality advocacy group free press says the limits will discourage online innovation , and that with the growth curve of internet usage , the limits will soon catch many internet user .  when isps force their customers to watch the meter , experimentation , innovation and business will suffer ,  turner said .  at&t 's actions are another troubling symptom of a broadband market that lacks meaningful competition , and this move may be the start of a race to the bottom among other providers to see who can squeeze its customers the most . at worst , this is a plan designed to discourage cord-cutting and pad profits ; at best , this is another example of an antiquated phone-company business model being forced onto an otherwise vibrant and limitless marketplace .  subscribe to wired magazine for less than $ 1 an issue and get a free gift ! click here ! copyright 2011 wired.com .", "summary": " at&t broadband users soon to face cap on amount of internet data they can download .   traditional dsl users will be capped at 150 gb per month .   subscribers to the fiber-backed uverse system have a 250-gb limit .
