{"text": "a long time ago in a galaxy far , far away ... an empire has spread across the galaxy , and the few remaining jedi defend themselves against the sith . at the same time , a dispute over trade and treaties is interrupted by ... general luke skywalker ? a little confused ? that 's because these familiar elements from  star wars  lore are part of george lucas ' rough draft for the first movie -lrb-  episode iv : a new hope  for the uninitiated -rrb- , illustrated for the first time by dark horse comics as  the star wars .  the first of eight issues of the comic book series is out now . when luke is a much older man , vader does n't wear a helmet , han solo resembles a lizard and there is a character named kane starkiller , it might take some getting used to . but it 's a fascinating part of movie history , no doubt . cnn spoke separately to j.w. rinzler , who adapted lucas ' script for comics , and artist mike mayhew . cnn : what captured your interest when adapting this script ? rinzler : it 's so similar and yet so different at the same time . all the puzzle pieces are there but arranged to form a different picture . you 've got sith and jedi , you 've got a desert planet . you 've got a planet with twin suns , an imperial city and a cloud city . when i read the rough draft , it had all those things which made me want to make it into a comic book . it 's such a great story , george is a great storyteller . cnn : was it difficult to illustrate this story from a script written nearly 40 years ago ? mayhew : not at all . i 've been in comics 20 years , and when i read the rough draft , i thought , i can make a comic of this tomorrow . it was just a very well-written screenplay , and that 's what a comic book script is . this is genuinely george 's first complete screenplay story of this tale , and it 's wildly different . you can see why some of it was changed because there 's no way they could have done it . it was just too ambitious . when you look at movies now like  avatar  and  the avengers ,  it seems prophetic . audiences expect all that action and set pieces , and one thing after another . i 'm sure back then they looked at this and thought ,  what 's this guy thinking ?  the other interesting thing is you see the origins of the characters we know and love . darth vader is kind of a general , he 's one of the main heavies but he 's not a lord of the sith . here , vader is really three characters : general vader , this lord of the sith named valorum , and this mechanical man . you think you know these characters and then you discover their truer origins . cnn : what do you think fans will take away from this book ? rinzler : based on early fan feedback from the first issue , they 're really enjoying this alternate universe , and they 're getting to read a story that 's being told by george . even through my adaptation , you feel his voice . you see many of the things you love in  star wars  but in a slightly different way . you have the tusken raider moment surging in front of the binoculars , except it 's not a tusken raider , it 's a different character . fans are saying they 're reading it two or three times to take it all in . mayhew : this to me is the greatest  what if  story in comics . what if this made it to the screen ? the mind reels at the possibilities . cnn : is there one particular thing that is farthest away from the  star wars  we know and love ? rinzler : everyone seems to latch onto the fact that han is a big green alien . that 's pretty far ! he does n't have his own ship . his character is probably the most different , although he can already talk to wookies . it 's fascinating to see all this stuff starting out , in a way . what 's really fun is that r2-d2 talks in this one . there 's a couple of points where i felt like  r2-d2 should say something here ,  and i added a line and that was really fun . mayhew : the characters in this story are much different than the characters in  star wars .  the relationships are a lot different and to me , more intense . leia 's story is a little more complicated , and she 's more a part of the action . annikin is more of a trained jedi than luke was . the older general skywalker to me is so much cooler than obi-wan . this character is like captain america , a bigger than life hero . cnn : is there a possibility that this alternate version of  star wars  could live on beyond these eight issues , at least in the fans ' minds ? rinzler : fans have been asking already about this , because so many things are hinted at particularly in the first issue , about the past , or characters in the periphery , or just spoken of and not seen . they 'd love to see those mysteries explained , but we have a little movie called  episode vii  coming up and that will take precedence . ` star wars ' cinematographer gilbert taylor dies at 99 . j.j. abrams talks production plans for ` star wars '", "summary": " new comic book  the star wars  adapts and illustrates george lucas ' rough draft script .    it 's so similar , yet so different at the same time ,  says writer j.w. rinzler .   characters such as kane starkiller and a lizard-like han solo populate this universe .
