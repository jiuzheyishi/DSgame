{"text": "washington all major indicators of violence in iraq have dropped by between 40 and 80 percent since february 2007 , when president bush committed an additional 30,000 troops to the war there , the pentagon reported monday . the quarterly report to congress noted that the military , political and economic gains made in the five-year-old war remain  fragile , reversible and uneven ,  and that islamic jihadists loyal to al qaeda in iraq remain capable of high-profile attacks . but civilian deaths have dropped from a peak of nearly 4,000 a month from december 2006 to january 2007 to about 500 a month as of may , and u.s. troop deaths have dropped from 126 in may 2007 to an all-time low of 19 in may 2008 . the report cited the emergence of the sons of iraq as a major reason for the downturn in civilian-oriented violence and deaths . the groups are made up of an estimated 90,000 iraqis , often former insurgents , paid by u.s. commanders to help protect neighborhoods and provide intelligence on extremists . u.s. troop deaths and civilian deaths spiked in march , when iraqis battled militia forces loyal to shiite cleric muqtada al-sadr in basra . at the end of march , an operation in sadr city by u.s. and iraqi forces to clear out insurgents firing rockets into the green zone also kept the death toll up , according to the report . but while the death toll went up in march , it remained lower than the numbers that prevailed before the  surge  campaign began in early 2007 . the next april and may saw a sharp downturn in deaths across the board , the report found . the fighting in basra and baghdad was a major test for iraqi troops . military officials said the iraqi operation in basra initially looked like a failure , but has turned out to be a success as iraqi troops continue to hold and stabilize the southern city . in ongoing operations in the northern city of mosul to drive out al qaeda , iraqi forces are showing clear signs of independent operational capability with little to no u.s. help , u.s. military officials said . the report suggested those successes are bolstering the ranks : more than 27,000 iraqis have joined the country 's security forces since the last pentagon report , in march , bringing the total number of iraqi soldiers and police to about 560,000 . since the march report , the iraqi government focused on resolving conflicts from basra and sadr city that dominated the political and security landscape over the past three months , the report said . the report also said increasing oil export revenues are putting more money into the country for development , reconciliation programs and security . insurgents continue to strike , however . an attack by a female suicide bomber sunday in baquba , which killed a reported 15 people , is one example of instability in regions with a heavy insurgent presence . while death tolls are down , the report highlighted the negative influence iran is having inside iraq . the report said iraq 's neighbor  continues to fund , train , arm and guide  anti-american  special groups ,  the u.s. term for splinter factions of al-sadr 's mehdi army and other shiite militants . iran has denied u.s. allegations it is supporting insurgent factions within iraq . but u.s. and iraqi troops have discovered iranian weapons inside iraq , including iranian made roadside bombs -- and during the fighting in basra , large stashes of iranian-made weapons were found with manufacture dates on them as recent as this year , according to u.s. military officials . the report said the iraqi government continues to press the iranians , who deny blame . may 2008 marked a sharp drop in high-profile attacks from al qaeda , according to the report . attacks in may hit a two-year low , about 70 percent lower than the peak in march 2007 . the u.s. military said the drop is connected to u.s. and iraqi operations directed at al qaeda , but pointed out that in a single day -- april 15 -- a high-profile attack killed more than 150 people .", "summary": " pentagon 's quarterly report to congress notes violence reduction .   it also notes that jihadists loyal to al qaeda in iraq are still a threat .   report credits sons of iraq , former insurgents who are now being paid by u.s.   increasing oil export revenues are putting more money into iraq , report says .
