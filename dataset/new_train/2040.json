{"text": "even in the midst of the civil war , there was still one thing the north and south shared -- a serious addiction to caffeine . confederate troops were less likely to get a cup of coffee . in that respect , the union clearly had an advantage . not only did the north have more than two-thirds of the population and control most of the heavy industry , railroads , and financial reserves in the country , it hoarded supplies of the highly addictive little bean , leaving the confederacy to wage its own war against java deprivation . coffee : it 's what 's for breakfast , lunch and dinner . throughout the civil war , coffee was as prevalent on the battlefields as it is in offices today . in fact , the union army was fueled by the stuff to the point that , if there was no time to boil water , the boys in blue would chew on whole beans as they marched . and at night , union campsites were dotted with tiny fires , each boiling a pot of coffee like a million miniature starbucks . beyond caffeine cravings , union troops loved their coffee because it was , literally , the best thing on the menu . before the advent of helpful -lrb- and tasty ! -rrb- artificial preservatives , a marching soldier 's rations were neither varied nor particularly appetizing . typically , they consisted of salted meat , unleavened bread -lrb- accurately christened  hardtack  -rrb- , and a little sugar and salt . it did n't help that union supply chains were riddled with corrupt food contractors who charged the government top dollar for rotten , stale , and insect-ridden foodstuffs . coffee , however , was almost always fresh because it was delivered in whole-bean form -- making it difficult for even the most dishonest supplier to skimp on quality . not that they did n't try , of course . in fact , officials began requesting coffee as whole beans after some crooked contractors tried to up their per-pound profits by slipping sand and dirt into packages of ground coffee . in 1861 , hoping to cut down on the time soldiers spent roasting and grinding beans , the army switched to a concentrated proto-instant coffee . the new concoction , called  essence of coffee ,  was made by boiling prepared coffee , milk , and sugar into a thick gloop , which soldiers then reconstituted by mixing it with water . the product reportedly tasted every bit as bad as you 'd imagine , and thanks to the corrupt dairymen who sold the army spoiled milk , it also tended to cause diarrhea . needless to say , the union army was soon back on the bean . southern discomfort . noxious as essence of coffee was , confederate soldiers would have gladly downed a cup or two . but , because of a union naval blockade , coffee -lrb- along with weapons , machinery , medicine , and other vital materials -rrb- was in short supply in the south . before the war , a pound of beans would have set you back around 20 cents in yankee dough . once pre-war stockpiles ran out , however , the same amount was running as high as $ 60 in confederate money . -lrb- despite the undervalued currency , that was still a lot . -rrb- . there was some coffee that made it into the confederacy -- usually carried by steam-powered blockade-runner ships . but , for the most part , southerners had to rely on coffee substitutes , including various forms of roasted corn , rye , okra seeds , sweet potatoes , acorns , and peanuts . unfortunately , all these imitations lacked potency , tasted awful , and upset the bowels . the only slightly better alternative was tea made from the leaves of the native yaupon shrub . the good news was that it contained caffeine ; the bad news was that it was incredibly difficult to digest . luckily , there was one surefire way for southern folk to get their coffee -- by making peace with the union . soldiers on the front lines often called informal truces so rebels could swap tobacco for yankee coffee and then dash back to their camps before they were reported missing . e-mail to a friend . for more mental_floss articles , visit mentalfloss.com . entire contents of this article copyright , mental floss llc . all rights reserved .", "summary": " coffee was a hot commodity in the civil war .   union troops had it for breakfast , lunch , dinner .   suppliers sometime ground dirt into beans .   blockade kept coffee had to get for confederate troops .
