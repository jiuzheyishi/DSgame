{"text": "steel : home secretary theresa may , pictured leaving number 10 this week , urged the tory party not to buckle . theresa may has cast herself as the tories ' new iron lady , telling colleagues pushing through unpopular spending cuts and reforms : ` whatever you do , do n't buckle . ' in another speech ranging far beyond her home office brief , the most senior woman in the government insisted it was possible to do ` more for less ' across the public sector -- highlighting welfare , defence and local government . mrs may also suggested the government had to do more to stand up to vested interests in the private sector -- particularly banks and big utilities . ` big , unaccountable businesses that manipulate markets or abuse their monopoly positions should also be in our sights . ` whether it 's the banking sector , where customers find it difficult to switch companies , or the big utility firms , with their opaque pricing plans , or the oil industry , which stands accused of price fixing by whistleblowers , we should be as tough with the private sector as we are with the public sector , ' the home secretary said . in a speech to the centre-right think tank reform , mrs may , who has been careful not to stray from her brief since speculation about her leadership ambitions erupted earlier this year , sketched out a broad platform for a tory victory in 2015 . the steely home secretary , hailed as ` britain 's angela merkel ' by her allies , said the conservatives ' mission went far beyond the elimination of the vast budget deficit left behind by labour . she pointed out that her party had questioned the level of labour 's public spending as long ago as the 2001 election campaign but ` sadly our argument fell on deaf ears , and we all know what came next ' . a senior tory minister today fuelled speculation that theresa may is positioning herself as a future party leader . in the commons labour mp john spellar -lrb- warley -rrb- said mrs may could benefit from persuading police forces to buy more british vehicles , as he urged government departments to back the country 's car industry . mr spellar : ` will you talk to the home secretary and get her to back british industry ? it might even help her leadership ambitions . ' mr fallon prompted cheers from the commons as he replied : ` they may not need that much help . ' ` high taxes , a structural deficit , . unreformed public services and an unbalanced economy meant that when the . crash came , britain was n't ready , ' she added . mrs . may said there was ` no other way ' than fundamental reform of the public . sector and pointed to her own success in reducing crime , while slashing . budgets . ` when we said we . would cut central government police budgets by twenty per cent in real . terms over four years , the critics -- not just the labour party , but . acpo , the police federation and many academics -- were united . frontline . policing would be decimated and crime would go up . ` but in fact , the opposite happened -- crime is down by more than ten per cent since the election , ' she said . ` that crime is down is thanks to the efforts of thousands of officers up and down the country and the leadership of chief constables , but it 's also down to police reform . mrs may pointed to measures to make . police more accountable via beat meetings , crime maps and elected . commissioners , and the abolition of national targets and the . introduction of greater flexibility in police employment . ` we 're delivering more with less , ' she insisted . the . home secretary said the tories had to ` make sure that the debate in . this country never returns to the false choice of more spending or worse . services ' . she went on : . ` we have to reassure people about our motives and our values . we have to . show them that we 're committed to universal public services and we must . never appear to be doctrinaire about what we 're doing . ` we . have to be clear that we 're reducing spending on public services not . because we care little for them , but because we have to for the sake of . our economy . ' pointer : mrs may set out what david cameron needed to do to win back support and reassure voters he holds conservative values . urging cabinet colleagues not to waver in the teeth of opposition to reforms , she said : ` difficult decisions often mean upsetting people -- especially when the change involves pay and conditions . but that does n't mean you can shirk them . ` you have to decide what is in the national interest and do it . keep making your case , always remind people of what you 're trying to achieve , what 's the end objective , but whatever you do , do n't buckle . ' mrs may would not countenance any sort of leadership challenge to david cameron , and has repeatedly stressed her loyalty to him . however , she is understood to regard boris johnson as ` faintly ridiculous ' and is determined to prevent him becoming leader in the event of the tories losing the next election .", "summary": " home secretary ranges far beyond her brief with rallying cry to cabinet .   insists it is possible to do ` more with less ' but not cutting out of ideology .   hailed as ` britain 's angela merkel ' by allies who predict leadership bid .
