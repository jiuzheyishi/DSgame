{"text": "paul ryan hopes to deliver a knockout blow to president barack obama 's hopes of re-election tonight against joe biden who expects to come at him ` like a cannonball ' . paul ryan has been taking time out from his workouts to prepare assiduously for tonight 's vice-presidential debate in danville , kentucky with both camps predicting a muscular showdown between the two campaign attack dogs . if the pictures in the next edition of time magazine of the vice-presidential candidate working out last year are anything to go by , he 's at least in physical shape for the showdown . tough guy : paul ryan , pictured here demonstrating his workout technique last year , is hoping to deliver a knockout blow to obama 's re-election hopes tonight . photo credit : gregg segal for time . ryan said this week he expects biden to come swinging for him from the off after obama 's disastrous presidential debate last week : ` what was wrong with obama ? i do n't know . it was really something , ' ryan said . ` president obama was flustered . he has a terrible record to run on . it 's pretty indefensible as witnessed by the fact that he did n't do a very good job of defending it last night . ' ` that means the focus is going to be on joe , ' ryan said , ` and i expect the vice president to come at me like a cannonball . he 'll be in full attack mode , and i do n't think he 'll let any inconvenient facts get in his way . ' brains and brawn : ryan is seen as the intellectual superior to biden . photo credit : gregg segal for time . at the same time , ryan aides have said their man will be aggressive , accusing biden of misrepresenting his record . biden this morning joked with reporters about his strategy , saying : ` you ever see me rope-a-dope ? ' while the romney campaign has been publicly playing down the chances of representative ryan , chairman of the house budget committee , scoring a major victory in the vice-presidential debate , privately hopes are high that he could do very well . advisor : paul ryan today tweeted this picture of him hugging one of his sons as he prepares for the showdown . biden , who was a senator for 36 years , is legendarily verbose and prone to verbal slips which have been a boon to the romney campaign - most particularly when he said republicans wanted to ` put y' all back in chains ' and when he said the middle class had been ` buried ' under obama . ryan , just 42 , is widely seen as one of the most intellectually impressive of a new republican generation , a policy expert steeped in the minutiae of the economy and who entered congress in 1999 when he was just 28 - two years younger then biden was when he became a senator in 1972 . feeling good : republicans are more confident than democrats going into the vice presidential debate . biden is expected to assail ryan on his own budget plans in the house . but ryan , who has fallen in line with romney on policy issues , will want to keep the focus on his running mate . ` you have to remember this is a romney-ryan ticket , and there 's one presidential candidate , there 's one person at the top of the ticket , ' romney spokesman kevin madden told reporters . a new pew research centre poll has found that voters view biden less favourably than ryan and much worse than they did when he debated the 2008 republican vice - presidential candidate sarah palin . by a 40 per cent to a 34 per cent margin , voters expect ryan to beat biden at their thursday debate in danville , kentucky . among independents , 42 to 25 per cent believe ryan will win . this could create an expectations problem . for ryan - much as was the case for obama , who was heavily favoured in denver . at the weekend , ryan said of biden : . ` he 's fast on the cuff , he 's a witty guy . he knows who he is and he 's . been doing this for 40 years . so you 're not going to rattle joe biden . ' all smiles : biden joked with reporters after stepping off the plane with his daughter ashley biden today ` have you seen my rope-a-dope ? ' romney tried to damp down ryan 's . experience , telling cnn : ' i do n't know how paul will take on the debate . obviously the vice president has done 15-20 debates in his lifetime -- he . is an experienced debater -- i think this is paul 's first debate . i may be . wrong , he may have done something in high school , we do n't know . ` but , . it will be a new experience for paul , but i am sure he will do fine . frankly , he has policy , facts , and results on his side . so i think you . find in the analysis people make the assessment on these debates not so . much on the theatrics or smoothness of the presenter , but the policies . and pathways being described . ' popularity contest : a new pew research poll has found . that voters view biden less favourably than ryan . charmer : ryan is widely seen as one of the most intellectually impressive of a new republican generation . in fact , according to abc news , ryan has taken part in at least eight debates during his 14 years in congress - though none of them anything like as high-profile as thursday 's clash , which could be seen by as many as the 67 million who watched romney and obama in denver . according to pew , biden , whose role in the campaign is as attack dog and as the man who can connect with blue-collar voters , is viewed favourably by just 39 per cent of voters . four years ago , when he faced palin , his favourability rating was 53 per cent . romney has leapt to level pegging - or . even into the lead - in national polls since his much-praised debate . performance in denver . while obama still holds slim leads in . battleground states , his campaign badly needs to alter the trajectory of . the race . biden has the opportunity to do that but . traditionally vice-presidential debate , while they have provided . entertainment and some big moments , have not had an appreciable effect . on the general election result . losing ground : biden is . viewed favourably by just 39 per cent of voters compared to four years ago , when he . faced palin and his favourability rating was 53 per cent . in 1988 , senator lloyd bentsen of texas delivered one of the most famous put-downs in political history . when senator dan quayle , then vice-president george h.w. bush 's running mate , said he had nearly as much congressional experience as john f. kennedy , bentsen pounced . he said : ` senator , i served with jack kennedy : i knew jack kennedy ; jack kennedy was a friend of mine . ... senator , you 're no jack kennedy . ' quayle responded lamely that this was ` really uncalled for ' and his political career arguably never recovered . but in the november election , the bush-quayle republican ticket was victorious over governor michael dukakis of massachusetts and bentsen , the democratic ticket .", "summary": " ryan says he expects biden to come at him ` like a cannonball '   pressure on biden to be aggressive after obama flop in denver .   he joked this morning about his strategy , saying ` you ever seen me rope-a-dope ? '   expectations are high that republican vice presidential nominee paul ryan will win the debate against vice president joe biden .   biden , a senator for 36 years , is a far more experienced debater than ryan , who is 27 years younger than biden .   republican nominee mitt romney is tamping down expectations that ryan will win the debate to avoid negative fallout if his running mate fails to impress .
