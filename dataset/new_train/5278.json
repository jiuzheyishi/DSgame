{"text": "around 100,000 people were struck down with norovirus -lrb- pictured -rrb- over christmas - and cases will continue to rise , experts have warned . around 100,000 people were struck down with the winter vomiting bug over christmas - and cases will continue to rise , experts have warned . figures released today show the number of confirmed cases was 72 per cent higher than this time last year . the dramatic rise was attributed in part to an early outbreak of the illness which closed dozens of hospital wards as it swept across the country . a total of 3,877 laboratory-confirmed cases of norovirus have now been recorded in england and wales - up on the 2,255 of last year . but the health protection agency -lrb- hpa -rrb- said that for every reported case , an estimated 288 were not flagged up , meaning around 1.12 million people could now have contracted the illness this season . this is about 100,000 more than during the pre-christmas period - until december 23 - when 1.01 million people were estimated to have come down with the bug . the number of reported cases dropped slightly during the christmas week but this was in keeping with dips at the same time in previous seasons , the hpa said . john harris , an expert in norovirus from the hpa , said : ` as we have seen in previous years there has been a dip in the number of confirmed laboratory reports owing to the christmas and new year period . ` however , in line with other norovirus seasons we will expect to see an increase in the number of laboratory reports in the next few weeks . during the two weeks up to december 30 , there were 29 hospital outbreaks reported , compared to 70 in the previous fortnight , bringing the total for the season to 590 . cases of norovirus shot up earlier than expected this winter across europe . but experts have been unable to determine why this is the case or predict whether numbers will continue to rise at the same rate . although people can suffer from norovirus at any time of the year , activity increases in the winter months . norovirus is no different from other viruses that circulate at this time of year , but it is incredibly infectious . it is the uk 's most common cause of gastroenteritis , and spreads easily when everyone is cooped up inside during the winter . one problem is that people do not . develop long-lasting immunity -- you are protected for only a few . months , so next winter you can easily get it again . the vomiting viruses , colds and flu tend . to peak in winter partly because people congregate inside , explains dr . ron cutler , director of biomedical science at queen mary , university of . london . ` viruses can be picked up and passed on . often as a result of poor hygiene -- which often means people just not . washing their hands , ' says dr cutler . ` a get-together where people are in . close contact inside -- for example , a concert in a closed venue , or a . church carol service -- is the perfect environment for viruses to . spread . ' he adds : ` the problem with viruses is . that in the first phase of infection there are no signs or symptoms -- . and this can last for days , although normally people are contagious at . this stage so it can then be passed on to other people . ' viruses also survive longer during . winter weather , thanks to the lack of sunshine and the damp weather . conditions , says professor ian jones , a virologist from reading . university . for norovirus , you need exposure to only . a small number of virus particles -- between ten and 100 -- to catch the . sickness compared with 10,000 particles to catch flu . ` you only need to come into contact with . a single droplet from a sneeze -- which can contain up to a million . virus particles -- to become infected with a cold , ' says professor jones . mr harris added : ` norovirus is very contagious , and anyone who has had it knows it is very unpleasant . ` if you think you . may have the illness then it is important to maintain good hand hygiene . to help prevent it spreading .  we also advise that people stay away . from hospitals , schools and care homes as these environments are . particularly prone to outbreaks . ' a department of health spokesman said : ` the nhs is well prepared for the winter . no a&e s have had to close so far this winter and we are providing additional funding to the nhs to help it cope with the added pressure that the winter brings . ` flu and norovirus are typical at this time of year - that 's why we are running the ` catch it . bin it . kill it ' campaign to remind people that one of the best ways to stop the spread of winter bugs is to catch it , bin it and kill it when you cough or sneeze and wash your hands regularly . ` our weekly published figures show the number of beds closed across the nhs due to norovirus symptoms is around 2.4 per cent . this compares to 2.9 % of beds that were closed during the peak of norovirus cases last winter . '", "summary": " figures released today show the number of confirmed cases was 72 per cent higher than this time last year .   number of cases dropped slightly during .   the christmas week but is set to rise again in the coming weeks .   hospital outbreaks this season rise to 590 .
