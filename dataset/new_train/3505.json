{"text": "compromise : david cameron told mps the deal has protected the principle of a free press from statutory regulation . david cameron , ed miliband and nick clegg yesterday unveiled a cross-party agreement on press regulation after ` shambolic ' all-night talks -- only to see the deal immediately opposed by senior tories and challenged by key elements of the newspaper industry . all three party leaders tried to claim victory after 20 months of wrangling in the wake of the phone hacking scandal ended in an agreement by the prime minister to set up a media watchdog . it would have the power to require front-page apologies and issue # 1million fines , under a royal charter . the campaign group hacked off , which represents celebrities and other victims of press intrusion and had four representatives at cross-party talks , warmly welcomed the deal . by contrast , there was no-one present at the early hours negotiations from the newspaper industry -- which was not informed the talks were taking place . and last night there were doubts over whether major newspaper publishers would agree to recognise the new watchdog , while some tory mps warned it constituted a serious threat to three centuries of press freedom . four newspaper groups , the daily mail group , news international , northern and shell , publishers of the express , and the telegraph media group , as well as the newspaper society and the professional publishers association , said they had not been consulted over the final package and there were ` deeply contentious issues ' to consider . the newspaper society represents 1,100 regional papers . london mayor boris johnson , a former journalist , telephoned mr cameron yesterday and expressed ` serious concern ' about a proposal to hit publishers who refuse to sign up to the new watchdog with ` exemplary ' damages in libel cases . scroll down for video . the prime minister , pictured leaving number 10 ahead of his statement , hailed the deal which would secure upfront apologies and million-pound fines . ` the thing that is really exercising . boris is the idea that if we do n't join the club then you get whacked . with massive fines , ' an ally said . ` he made that clear to the prime minister . he has enormous concerns about it . he does n't see how , if proprietors and editors do n't sign up to it , you can start hitting them . that is something that concerns him greatly . ' former tory cabinet minister peter . lilley went further , telling mps the new regulator would act as an . orwellian ` ministry of truth ' and urging media organisations to follow . the example of the spectator magazine , which has indicated it will . refuse to recognise the body . there was wider concern on the tory benches at the chaotic nature of the discussions at which the deal was brokered . actor hugh grant lead the hacked off campaign for tougher press regulation . mr cameron pulled the plug on . cross-party talks on thursday , claiming labour had produced fresh . demands , apparently prepared in close co-operation with hacked off . but over the weekend , facing a . commons defeat as labour and the lib dems threatened to join forces , the . prime minister reopened discussions with mr clegg . his chief . negotiator , cabinet office minister oliver letwin , was then dispatched . to talks in labour leader ed miliband 's office in the commons on sunday . night . deal done : culture secretary maria miller claimed to have averted labour 's ` extreme version ' of press law , but labour deputy leader harriet harman claimed it was a deal which victims of phone hacking could be ` pleased ' with . four representatives of hacked off , . which has campaigned for a draconian crackdown on media excesses , were . present . a deal was finally reached at 2.30 am yesterday . downing street denied that mr cameron . had been asleep , insisting he had been in touch with mr letwin . regularly throughout the night , with their last contact at 3.20 am . tory mps expressed private amazement . that the government had allowed talks to take place in mr miliband 's . office , or with hacked off present -- but no-one from the media industry . deal : miliband , clegg and cameron launched a new round of late-night negotiations on the issue . in the commons later the prime . minister said a press law had been avoided -- although he conceded there . were ` two very important but relatively small legislative changes ' needed . they include a clause allowing more . punitive libel damages to be awarded against publishers who refuse to . recognise the watchdog . a separate clause was passed last night to . ensure that the royal charter for the press can not be amended unless . two-thirds of mps and peers and all three main party leaders agree . mr cameron made a number of . concessions to secure the deal , dropping an effective veto for the . industry over the regulator 's membership and agreeing that the regulator . should have the power to ` direct ' newspapers on the prominence of . apologies and corrections . recommendation : lord justice leveson called for a new press regulator underpinned by statute . a labour mp yesterday demanded that the editor of the sun be sacked after the newspaper paid damages for accessing a stolen mobile phone . immigration spokesman chris bryant called for dominic mohan to quit after his reporters read messages from a mobile belonging to fellow labour mp siobhain mcdonagh . the sun accepted there had been ` a serious misuse of miss mcdonagh 's private information ' after her phone was taken from her car in south-west london in october 2010 . the sun , which was not accused of stealing the phone , offered an unreserved apology and miss mcdonagh said she was paid # 50,000 damages by news corp. . after the hearing , miss mcdonagh said that she felt very uneasy after being told in 2012 that the paper had appeared to have ` acquired her mobile phone ' . the regulator was also given the . power to appoint the committee which writes the editor 's code , . dismantling the one part of the existing system that is agreed to work . well . mr cameron told mps : ` this system . will ensure upfront apologies , million-pound fines , a self-regulatory . body with independence of appointments and funding , a robust standards . code , an arbitration service that is free for victims and a speedy . complaint handling mechanism . we can put all of this in place without . the need for statutory regulation . ' broadcaster jonathan dimbleby , . chairman of the index on censorship , warned : ` the two-thirds block on . any changes to the royal charter could be abused in the future -- not . least when today 's emerging consensus shows that the parties can come . together in both houses to agree on press regulation . ' mr lilley said : ` we are giving a body . the right to decide what is fact and what is true . at worse , it is . going to be establishing a sort of mini self-appointed ministry of . truth . ` we note that no similar powers are taken with respect to the bbc . ' mr lilley added : ` i hope personally . that when this is established quite a lot of media organisations will . have the courage to follow the spectator and stand aside from this body . and remain free while hopefully adopting the highest standards in the . way they publish and treat the public . ' conservative mp for clacton douglas carswell said : ` today is a milestone . press now answer to quangocrats . awful , awful , awful . the mps have produced a press regulatory regime of fiendish complexity , with layer upon layer of bureaucracy . the process begins with the political parties themselves who , by devising the terms of yesterday 's royal charter , have interfered in the workings of the free press for the first time in 300 years . as we show in the flowchart , the first step to be taken under the charter they have produced will be the establishment of a recognition appointments panel -lrb- shaded red , on the bottom right-hand side -rrb- . handpicked by ex-whitehall mandarin sir david normington , the current commissioner for public appointments , none of the four members can ever have been a newspaper editor . in turn , as the arrow on the diagram shows , this panel will then appoint a recognition panel . this will contain up to eight members , none of whom , the politicians have decided , can be an editor , publisher or a member of the commons or lords . crucially , it will have sweeping powers to oversee the new independent press regulator . the recognition panel will carry out regular checks on the regulator and will pass judgment on whether or not it is working . a negative verdict could take westminster back to the drawing board . this brings us to the regulator itself -- which , as we show in the boxes coloured blue , is being established under a separate , hugely complicated process . the first move in setting this up will be the establishment of a six-strong foundation group -lrb- bottom left -rrb- appointed by the newspaper industry and headed by ex-president of the supreme court lord phillips . the group 's job is solely to set up a regulatory appointments panel , which will contain five members -- an independent chairman , two other independent members , an editor and one other industry member . this panel 's job is two-fold . first , it must pick the 12 members of the main board -lrb- coloured purple -rrb- of the new press regulator , which will be independently chaired with six other independent members . the five industry members on the board -- a minority -- can not include serving editors . the panel will also establish the complaints committee , an off-shoot of the regulator containing the main board 's chairman , six independent members and five industry figures , none of whom can be a serving editor . the complaints committee will decide if the new code on journalistic conduct and ethics has been breached in individual cases -- which could lead to the main board ordering the publication of prominent apologies and corrections . drawing up this new code will require the establishment of yet another panel -- the code committee -- featuring five independent members , five journalists and five editors . it will be appointed by the main board , raising concerns that it will be acting as judge and jury on rules it has itself written . to this galaxy of committees will then be added two other new bodies , which are offshoots of the new regulator 's main board . the first , the standards and compliance arm , will have the power to investigate potentially systemic problems at a newspaper , such as phone hacking , and impose huge fines . meanwhile , the arbitral arm will set up a panel to adjudicate on civil complaints against newspapers , without the need to go to court . if a member of the public wins a case , the newspaper involved must pick up their costs . but , if the person loses , newspapers will not be able to recover their own legal fees -- potentially leaving regional newspapers , in particular , with crippling bills . there are also concerns about the system being swamped by compensation-seekers . to get this byzantine system of regulation off the ground will require countless meetings involving dozens of panel members and independent experts . the danger is that it will collapse under its own complexity .", "summary": " press watchdog will issue # 1m fines and demand front page apologies .   body will be created by royal charter instead of being set up by legislation .   all three party leaders tried to claim victory after 20 months of wrangling .   hacked off , which represents celebrities and other victims , had four present .   no-one from newspaper industry was informed the .   talks were taking place .
