{"text": "anyone who climbs a high-security fence at an airport and scurries onto a runway would have to be drunk , on drugs or desperate , one might think . two men -- at two separate airports in newark , new jersey , and phoenix , arizona -- did just that on christmas day . one showed  indications of possible drug and alcohol impairment .  the other was wearing woman 's clothing and was not interested in anything at the airport -- instead he was seeking safety from someone who frightened him , police said . both men were charged with trespassing and released . the breach at newark exposed a failure of a $ 100 million system designed to protect new york city area airports . the phoenix fence hop was the fifth in a decade at that airport , cnn affiliate kpho reported . fleeing in woman 's clothing . when siyah bryant , 24 , allegedly mounted the barrier at newark liberty international airport , it went unnoticed for a day . on thursday , a review of security camera footage revealed his ascent , according to port authority police . the cross-dressed suspect then ran across two runways to get to terminal c , two police sources said . nobody saw it , but he was literally on the screen at the time . the security apparatus in the perimeter intrusion detection system -lrb- pids -rrb- made by raytheon co. combines radar with video cameras , motion detectors and  smart  fencing , according to the maker 's website . the technology part worked . someone else may not have . cameras captured images of the intruder and an alarm went off . police are investigating the actions of the person who monitors the images . an airport employee nabbed the suspect , port authority police chief louie koumoutsos said in a statement . he wants to know  why it took an unacceptably long time for officers to locate and take into custody a suspect who was being held by an airport employee .  a law enforcement official , who is not authorized to speak publicly about the case , said bryant told detectives he got spooked while in a car with someone and tried to get away , the official said . the fright was apparently enough to drive bryant over two big barriers . he allegedly scaled an eight-foot exterior fence and then a 10-foot , high-tech fence equipped with motion sensors and cctv cameras , said paul nunziato , a spokesman for airport police officers . phoenix drunken folly ?
