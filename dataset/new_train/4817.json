{"text": "if you 're tired of nagging your kids -lrb- or another member of your household -rrb- to brush their teeth , you have a new ally . a french company has introduced what they 're calling the world 's first connected electric toothbrush , which syncs wirelessly with a smartphone to track brushing habits , announce whether you , or your kids , have brushed thoroughly enough and reward you for good oral hygiene . for extra motivation , or shaming , the brush can share information with your social network or even your dentist . it 's called the kolibree toothbrush , and it was unveiled this week at the international consumer electronics show in las vegas , where some attendees asked if they could test prototypes on their pearly whites right there -lrb- for sanitary reasons , the answer was no -rrb- . the device will cost from $ 99 to $ 200 , depending on the model , and will be available for pre-order this summer through kickstarter or another crowdfunding site .  it works just like a regular toothbrush ,  said kolibree spokesperson renee blodgett in a phone interview .  the only difference is that all the data is stored on your phone so you can see how you 're brushing .  users download a mobile app and connect via bluetooth , and the kolibree documents every brushing via three sensors that record 1 -rrb- how long you brush , 2 -rrb- whether you brush all four quadrants of your mouth , and 3 -rrb- whether you brush up and down -lrb- good -rrb- instead of just side to side -lrb- bad -rrb- . the data automatically syncs to your android phone or iphone , telling you whether you brushed long enough and reached all the crucial areas of your teeth and gums . the kolibree app charts your progress and scores your brushing technique to encourage you , or your kids , to improve brushing habits . in this way , the device turns a mundane daily activity into a game , which its makers hope will engage people -- especially kids -- and encourage them to brush longer and more often .  you create this incentive around brushing ,  blodgett said . the brushing data also will be available via an api to let third-party game designers develop new apps for the kolibree system . the kolibree toothbrush was invented by thomas serval , a french engineer and a leader in that country 's tech industry . he was inspired to design it after suspecting that his children were lying to him about whether they had brushed their teeth . it 's not the first  smart  toothbrush on the market , however : the manual , $ 25 beam brush went on sale about a year ago . the beam also connects to phones via bluetooth and records brushing time , although unlike the kolibree it can not track the brush 's movements in the mouth .", "summary": " a french company has introduced what they 're calling the world 's first connected electric toothbrush .   the kolibree can sync wirelessly with your smartphone to track your brushing habits .   users download the mobile app , connect via bluetooth and every brushing is recorded .
