{"text": "a motorbike hurtles towards me , a man carrying a goat perched pillion . i leap out of the way just in time and hear the warning cry - ` balak ! balak ! ' - as two young men on bicycles heading in the opposite direction swerve around me and disappear into the throng . on my right , silk , silver and spice sellers jostle with leather-workers and wood carvers ; on my left people queue to buy boiled sheep 's brains . musky aromas emanate from herboristas to compete with the smell of citrus , mint , cedarwood - and the odd whiff of drains . just desert : the sahara desert tour was an evening excursion which involved riding dromedaries -lrb- resting in the distance -rrb- into the 450 foot high erg chebbi dunes to watch the sun go down . thunderstorm optional . the word ` bustling ' could have been invented to describe the souks of morocco . and nowhere does it seem more appropriate than here in the medina of fes , where human life exists in all shades , from poverty to splendour . the winding passages - full of shops , locals , tourists , saucepans , mirrors , wedding dresses , children selling packs of tissues , and the odd lost kitten - seem even more vibrant than in the fabled market of marrakech , which i passed through two days earlier . is it really only 48 hours since i landed in north africa ? it feels a lifetime ago . archers has been offering mainstream and specialist holidays to destinations across the planet for 50 years . its 10-night ' highlights of morocco ' package is a firm favourite - and the itinerary is exhaustive . our tour director ann - a resident of the country for 35 years , having arrived as young rep -- is a font of information , and has links with local businesses and guides all over the country . the group i am travelling with could not be described as young . pensioners with a yearning for adventure dominate this inquisitive army of 36 adventure-seekers - from the uk , canada , australia and the us . my travelling companion and i are soon rather sweetly dubbed ` the girls ' . alliances and unlikely friendships are formed , and we swap contact details with people we would never have expected to meet before the trip . the medina in fes -lrb- left -rrb- was a real eye-opener , teeming with life - in contrast to the tranquillity found in former palace gardens like this one in meknes -lrb- right -rrb- , which was made even more colourful by the local guide . it does not take long to see why former king hassan ii described his country as having ` one foot in africa , the other in europe ' . morocco is a vast and varied territory that was only united into a modern nation state in 1956 . the rise and fall of powerful dynasties and mighty empires - a recurring pattern in its colourful history - has resulted in a melting pot of tribes , and a multi-faith society . while arabic and french is spoken by the majority , a large number of people are descended from the ancient berbers -lrb- or amaziah -rrb- , who have preserved their own languages and customs . our tour is a 1,000-mile -lrb- 1,700 km -rrb- round trip which takes in the labyrinthine walled cities of marrakech , casablanca , rabat and fes . roman ruins , ornate mosques , kasbahs and palaces with beautiful tiled courtyards are all part of our progress . snow-capped mountains , vast barren plains and deep gorges feature heavily as we continue our journey . although i am unconvinced about the prospect of lengthy stints on a coach , i soon find that this is a good way of getting under the skin of a country - each day offering a totally different experience . from the urban sprawl of casablanca we travel to the historic city of meknes - where , during a tour of the former royal stables and granaries , our local guide paints a colourful picture of the bloodthirsty 17th century megalomaniac sultan moulay ismail , who was rumoured to have sired 1,000 children . catherine and jane chill out in a shepherd family 's tent in the desert -lrb- left -rrb- , but say no to the mint tea ... right , camels woven from palm trees are sold at the side of the road by young boys to boost the family income . then we journey through vast red plains , past the occasional solitary goatherd or flock of camels , to the ancient city of fes . after a couple of days there -- the chaotic medina being an obvious highlight - we travel south , through the curiously swiss-like chalet town of ifrane , where the privileged go to ski . then we wind through the atlas mountains and the spectacular ziz valley - a slash of green in the barren landscape , with more than a million trees . we end up in erfoud , an oasis town on the edge of the mighty sahara desert . king mohammed vi , who began his rule in 1999 when his father hassan ii died , has brought a -lrb- relative -rrb- wave of democracy and modernity to the country . a massive road building programme -lrb- with solar-powered street lights in places -rrb- has been implemented to improve the movement of morocco 's rural population - while the inevitable increase in tourism is mirrored by a growing number of golf courses and shopping malls . thankfully -lrb- for us anyway -rrb- there are still few modern features in the south , and an extraordinary experience in the sahara desert tour proves to be my favourite moment of the entire tour . from our haven of a hotel in erfoud , a fleet of four-by-fours whizzes us into the desert . an hour later , we are removing our shoes outside a berber shepherd 's tent , although -lrb- pre-warned by ann that the ` furry bag ' the water is stored in is in fact a goat 's carcass -rrb- we politely turn down the offer of mint tea . the next leg of our trek into the 450ft-high erg chebbi dunes is on a different type of 4x4 entirely . atop my own personal dromedary i drink in the sight of the vast orange sands curving ahead of us , the line of majestic camels silhouetted against the sky . there is no sound except the occasional grunt of a camel , or call from one of the men , and an expectant hush descends as we sit in a line along the sharp edge of a dune , to watch the sunset . suddenly , thunder rumbles and a flash of lighting cracks the sky . the sand turns red as the heavens open , and our camel drivers scurry to cover us in blankets . a thunderstorm in the desert ! i feel blessed to experience such an incredible sight . our tour ends where it began - in exotic marrakech , with its extravagant architecture and busy squares and markets . lights up : snake charmers , musicians and acrobats appear every night in the main square in marrakech . as dusk falls on the djemaa el-fna square , stallholders scramble to set up their mobile restaurants , the light provided by bare bulbs hooked up to gas cylinders . we descend from the rooftop terrace where we have been watching the scene unfold , and sit at one of the food stalls - where we enjoy freshly fried calamari , salads and flatbreads with fiery dips , and aubergine cooked to perfection . families huddle in circles around flickering coloured lanterns , and men selling gaudy toys shout for custom - amid snake charmers , musicians , acrobats and storytellers . it is a magical scene . but i ca n't help drifting back to that sand dune , lightning flickering above me - an experience that touched my soul . archers holidays offers a 10-day ` highlights of morocco ' tour on a year-round basis . priced from # 850 per person , the tour includes return flights and airport transfers , nine nights b&b accommodation , six dinners , a range of guided city sightseeing and the services of a tour director . tour highlights include marrakech , casablanca , rabat , meknes , fes and ouarzazate , the atlas mountains , dades valley and the ziz valley . no ` single supplement ' on selected departures . call archers holidays on 0800 668 1892 or visit www.archersdirect.co.uk .", "summary": " marrakech is morocco 's most famous city , but fes is also a global wonder .   a good portion of the country can be easily seen on a 1,000-mile round trip .   erfoud , a small town in the south , is a great base for sahara desert visits .
