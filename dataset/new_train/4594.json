{"text": "amardeep kaleka will never forget the moment when his father laid on the ground and prayed . satwant singh kaleka had been shot five times while wresting a gunman in a sikh temple in oak creek , wisconsin . his turban was knocked off , and two kids and a priest crawled up beside him . together , they prayed . amardeep kaleka went to the temple and stared at that spot . his father did not survive . he died along with five others .  it felt like he was praying and putting something into the zeitgeist and imprinting it ,  he told cnn . his son hoped it would lead to a changing tide on gun violence . interactive : faces of the gun debate . as he began his meditation that day , amardeep made a vow : he would do whatever he could to ensure nobody ever went through what his family had .  it just came over me that you ca n't stay silent ,  he said .  you ca n't continue to allow violence like this to happen haphazardly at a church , at a school , any place . that was august 2012 . four months later , 20 children and six adults were gunned down in newtown , connecticut . that school massacre has led many people , including kaleka , 33 , to question where we go from here as a country . or if we will ever get there at all . it led him to stand up at a gathering here on thursday , cnn 's  guns under fire : an ac360ยบ town hall special ,  and ask a panel of advocates with polar opposite views if they could agree on anything . if there was actually any middle ground .  after meeting with so many senators , so many gun proponents and gun control advocates , it seems like they 're recycling the same jargon all the time ,  he said , explaining his reason for the question .  so i was just hoping , let 's get to the common ground .  the panel included national rifle association board members , the president of the brady campaign to end gun violence , law enforcement representatives and other participants voicing viewpoints across the spectrum . was there a consensus ? sort of .  there 's a lot of common ground ,  sandra froman , a member of the nra board of directors and a former president of the group , said at the town hall .  we do n't want people who are insane to have guns , we do n't want terrorists to have guns . part of this national dialogue is coming together .  so everyone agreed : something has to happen . the devil is in the details .  i think the common ground clearly exists from a policy standpoint when talking about background checks ,  said dan gross , president of the brady campaign to end gun violence . but it is n't that simple . it never is when it comes to gun control .  the nra is not against background checks ,  froman said .  we support making sure they are enforced . we 're not supporting more background checks of law-abiding citizens .  her remarks signaled a slight change in the nra 's stance . in a heated back and forth , the two debated whether it was truly harmful to force everyone who wants to purchase a gun -- whether at a gun store , a gun show , or in a private sale -- to go through a background check . froman talked about how the current background check system was broken , noting that an  instant check  in colorado can actually take about 10 days .  we have to get it working before we add any more checks ,  she said , noting that requiring everyone to undergo a check would take a lot of resources and money . philadelphia police commissioner charles ramsey spoke from his experience , saying whatever it took , whatever the price tag , it would be worth it to stem the violence .  please , do n't worry about the cost . i 'll spend the money ,  he said , a line that drew massive applause from the crowd at george washington university .  it 's a much greater cost than human lives . we have to do something . the status quo is not acceptable .  when kaleka , the son of one of the sikh shooting victims , rose to ask his question about finding a middle ground , he was n't just talking about policy . he also meant in our collective way of thinking . a filmmaker , kaleka has made a documentary about violence in america . there are too many facets to the problem , he says .  it 's a culture of violence . and that has to do with guns , that has to do with mental illness , it has to do with stigmatizing people , it has to do with the media , everything about our culture .  many appeared to think he was right .  everybody 's got to step up on this ,  ramsey said .  that 's prosecutors , the courts , everyone . if we 're serious about this it ca n't just be a series of laws that are passed .  much of the discussion inside the town hall went beyond politics and legislation . one heated debate focused on whether armed guards should be posted at schools . that 's a proposal that 's been discussed by former congressman asa hutchinson .  what is more important than the education and the safety of those children ?  he asked , noting that if malls have armed security , so should schools .  i believe an armed security presence is very important .  it 's an idea that veronique pozner thinks about . her son noah was killed in the shooting at sandy hook elementary in newtown .  i think there might be a certain power in deterrence ,  she said .  in the case of newtown , it 's clear that the perpetrator did choose the path of least resistance , the most vulnerable defenseless victims . he did n't head for the high school where he could have been tackled .  while she said she was n't sure an armed guard would have saved her son , she did say it made her feel more comfortable dropping off her other children at the new school for sandy hook children , a building that does have armed guards . colin goddard , who survived the virginia tech shooting , said he understood the desire to protect children , but he did n't understand why arming guards is the go-to solution .  i just do n't understand why the first idea put forth is something that might help at the last second ,  he said , to massive applause from the audience .  we can do things in advance to keep a dangerous person and a gun from coming together in the first place .  that 's the conversation that usually leads to a debate about mental health . it is an area president barack obama has pledged resources to ; he and many others hope to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill . the difficulty comes in figuring out who poses a threat .  we look at behavior and what 's going on in the person 's life , the social dynamics and what are the personality issues that make that person think acting out dangerously is a way to handle their problems ,  said mary ellen o'toole , a former fbi special agent and criminal profiler . froman , the nra board member , said she 'd like to see more sharing of resources to ensure a database of the mentally ill would prevent them from having access to guns . but liza long , whose blog post  i am adam lanza 's mom  went viral after the newtown shooting , said perhaps we were thinking about this all wrong . what if was n't just about identifying threats , but actually making a change .  we spend a lot of time talking about keeping guns out of the wrong hands ,  she said .  what if we could put those resources to making people less dangerous .  for kaleka , at the end of the day , progress on enforcing background checks would be a step in the right direction . he recognizes that no solution will make everyone happy . but he wishes every advocate , no matter their point of view , would think about the issue as if they were in his shoes .  when you are a survivor or a victim or someone close to you dies , it 's everyday you think about it ,  he said .  gun advocates or scholars or people making money about it , they probably think about it 10 % of how much we think about it . we go to the bathroom and think about it . we take a cold shower one day , and we start to cry . we wake up in the middle of the night with night sweats , and we have to live with it . every breath is taken with some thought of violence and safety .  he thinks it is time the country does the same : that its citizens think about the issue with every breath .  i can never go another moment in my life without thinking about it . my wife , my brother , my mother , the people of newtown , they will not go a moment for the rest of their life without thinking about it ,  he said .  personally i think the tide is changing , the zeitgeist is moving towards justice . hopefully , once we stop the fear mongering on both sides we can finally get to the point of what makes sense .  his greatest hope : that the will to do something about the violence does not die along with those who never had to . complete coverage : the gun debate .", "summary": " amardeep kaleka lost his father in a shooting at a sikh temple in wisconsin .   he appeared at cnn 's  guns under fire : an ac360ยบ town hall special    kaleka hopes the country will at last find middle ground on the issue of guns .    i think the tide is changing ; the zeitgeist is moving towards justice  "}
