{"text": "while the olympic games in london steals the world 's attention , over 5,000 miles away another global event born from the same ideal of cultural exchange and peaceful rivalry is entering the home stretch . rather than competition , expo 2012 in the city of yeosu , south korea , is the latest incarnation of an event that officially is meant to foster international understanding ; unofficially it is used for national promotion , boosting trade and providing networking opportunities . of the approximately 4 million visitors that will have wandered through the transformed cement port and industrial site before it closes on august 12 , most will have been there to enjoy the pavilions hosting interactive displays on ocean conservation and marine exploration -- the theme of this year 's event . but a small but notable minority will not have been there to watch the shows . for them it provides a number of chances to broker deals and reach new contacts where 104 countries can be reached in a day .  it 's government relations really ,  said stine l. guldmann , director of the denmark pavilion .  south korea is quite important to denmark . it 's an opportunity to brand your country both in a tourism way but also attract skillful people or showcase our abilities .  denmark 's pavilion is funded by a mix of public and private money , including some danish companies at the forefront of the renewable energy industry . lego bricks are on hand to attract the visitors and keep them entertained , but a backroom for more grown-up meetings is regularly used .  there has to be a reason for them both -lrb- government and private companies -rrb- to be here and spend money on it ,  said guldmann .  it 's a success if our private partners are happy with their participation and our political relations are very strong .  the basic principle of expos is non-commercial and educational , according to the bureau international des expositions -lrb- bie -rrb- , the organizing body that was founded in 1928 . yet that has not prevented a strong presence from the commercial sector , with a large part of the yeosu site devoted to temporary pavilions from south korea 's biggest corporations , some of which were built at a cost of more than $ 1million .  expos do n't provide concrete benefits for companies ,  says lee joon-hee , commissioner for expo 2012 .  but is it still relevant ... the evidence of why they are still relevant is that a lot of companies and countries want to host expos .  participant countries have different reasons to be in yeosu . qatar and the u.s , with strong trade and diplomatic ties to south korea , respectively , have been two of the more popular pavilions . earlier this year a 20-year deal for qatar to supply south korea with natural gas was signed between the two countries , but pavilion manager mona sulaiti was keen to stress that the reason for their participation at event  is about people , not business relationships .  andrew snowhite , ceo of the u.s. pavilion , believes the event is unique in its scope and potential .  it 's the only place where you can create something that has a critical mass around it ; it 's a very large event . it 's a big tourism opportunity for some , for others it 's about trade ,  he said . for developing countries like angola , participation is a way to draw attention to a little known country , either as a holiday destination or potential trading partner .  we do n't see it as being old fashioned ,  said claudia santana of angola 's pavilion .  we are building our country since 2002 ... if you search for an official tourism website in angola you ca n't find it , so we have to find other ways to show our country . there 's a lot of work ahead for our country and this is part of it .  for all the fostering of relationships and networking over glasses of sweet tea or lego , ultimately the biggest tangible benefit of the event goes to yeosu itself . the city is little known by people within south korea let alone internationally , but around $ 2billion spent on operations and facilities from the government , bie and private investors has completely transformed it .  this area is relatively backwards and needs a boost ,  said lee joon-hee , saying it is part of a larger project to develop south korea 's southern  sun belt  .  it will put yeosu on the map . we have big ambitions to be a famous marine resort area .  yeosu 's infrastructure has been upgraded , with new , marble-smooth roads cutting through the lush hillsides and along the coast , while the train to the capital seoul now takes half the time it used to . while it is still undecided what will happen to most of the expo site when it closes -- conference centers and shopping malls have been mooted -- and tourism to the region develops , there will be an immediate beneficiary of the improved infrastructure : the petrochemical industry . just a few miles from the expo is one of south korea 's biggest industrial complexes that dwarfs the expo site and is the area 's largest industry .  for the moment we just want domestic development ,  says lee ,  secondary is marine resort development .
