{"text": "in the last years of the 19th century , the hamlet of hille in cornwall was a thriving farming community . a new chapel and schoolroom were built , along with a pretty cottage for the schoolmistress . but within 20 years , hille and all its homes had been abandoned . the first world war sounded the death knell for hille -- not one of its men returned after the armistice . for almost 50 years it lay abandoned and decaying , until one summer sunday in 1962 it was rediscovered by don slaughter , an essex businessman , and his wife eileen . village for sale : hamlet hille in cornwall , which was saved by the slaughters in the 1960s and turned into a holiday village , is now for sale . ` we used to drive down from chelmsford every weekend looking for something to buy but could n't find anything , ' says don 's widow eileen today . ` we 'd stopped at a petrol station and the man told us hille was for sale but he said ,  it 's not the sort of place for nice people like you .  ' their interest piqued , the couple drove down the twisting roads , took one look and agreed to pay # 2,000 for the main house , schoolhouse , 15 dilapidated cottages and a range of barns and other buildings in ten acres -- then set about restoring the hamlet , which they renamed trefanny hill . for the past 50 years , the restored hamlet -- three miles from the village of duloe , between looe and liskeard in east cornwall -- has been operating as a busy tourist business , with hundreds of holidaymakers renting its cottages , swimming in its outdoor pool , playing tennis or relaxing in its very own pub , the trefanny inn . new life : horses riders passing the house that jon is building for himself , nicknamed ` the castle ' but after half a century , the family is selling up . ` my dad died five years ago and mum 's now 86 , and there are other things i want to do , ' says son jon slaughter , who is building his own house in the village . jon has already sold two two-bedroom cottages for # 145,000 each , as well as st mary manor house , in which he was brought up , for # 490,000 . and now the remaining 15 cottages and a barn with planning permission for conversion into a four-bedroom house are on the market with a price tag of # 2 million . of the cottages , seven have one bedroom , five have two , and three have three bedrooms . all have their own gardens , and the . price also includes the village 's tennis court , badminton court , play . area , pool and ten acres of land , as well as three barns , which . currently comprise the pub , laundry and games room . ` when . mum and dad came here , all but two of the cottages had been condemned . and the only house that was habitable had an outside loo , so they lived . in a caravan while they did it up , ' says jon . family project : don slaughter and his son jon , aged five , working at trefanny hill in the 70s . ` locals used to drive up here on a sunday to see what these weird people were doing . ' within months , the first house was ready for guests and the couple started work on the rest of the village , and along the way they discovered ancient treasures , including an 11th century aspersorium -- a vessel for holding holy water . ` this part of cornwall was popular . with pirates and smugglers and they would have come through here because . the penzance to london stagecoach used to go straight through hille , ' says jon . the couple then . converted a former cider barn into trefanny hall , which became the . family home until they found another hidden property . ` mum . was out walking one day and in the undergrowth she came across a . chapel , which they did n't even know existed . it was owned by the church . of england and they bought it and converted it into their own house , ' explains jon . today , all the houses have open fires . or log-burning stoves , washing machines , dishwashers and microwave . ovens , and many families return year after year , not just in summer but . all year round . ` we get a . lot of people at christmas and , in our best year , had a turnover of . # 345,000 , ' says jon , who was born three years after his parents moved to . cornwall and has no plans to leave trefanny . for . the past 20 years , he has been building the castle , a vast granite . structure which , when finished , will have a medieval living room , . banqueting hall , kitchen , winter parlour , one bedroom and a bathroom . ` i 've got planning permission for a second wing with another 20ft by 40ft bedroom and en suite and rooms below that . i 'll build it in modules and add things as i go , ' says jon . estate agent maitlands , which is handling the sale , has had a lot of interest from buyers who want to carry on running trefanny hill as a holiday village , but the prospective purchasers have struggled to find a bank willing to lend to them . ` we had two families who wanted to buy it and run the business together , but getting a mortgage has been a problem , ' says claire biddlecombe , of maitlands . ` we are currently negotiating with a group of local investors who are looking to split the village and sell off the houses individually . ' while tourists , many of whom have returned to trefanny hill year after year , will lose out , the holiday village may be worth less than the sum of its parts , so breaking it up could make sense -- and a quick profit . maitlands fine and country : 01752 850418 .", "summary": " all men in hille in east cornwall died in the first world war .   bought by essex couple in 1962 and turned into holiday village .   now their son is selling the properties which includes a chapel .
