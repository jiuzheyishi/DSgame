' the device was fitted to entrepreneur mr sachiti 's lexus sc430 , pictured . mr sachiti thought the cigarette box-sized device was a bomb and went to a police station for help thereby sparking an emergency . mr sachiti said his work involved security and anti-fraud consultancy work with banks and he feared it could be computer hackers pursuing him . the police threw a cordon around his car and blocked off the high street in sutton , south london , while they investigated . one resident who was caught up in the evacuation of a nearby caffe nero , said : ` i was alarmed about what was happening . i was told to get off that part of the high street and to stay away from the cordon for my own safety .
