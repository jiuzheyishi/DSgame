{"text": "after a boeing 747 dreamlifter landed at a small airport in wichita a couple of months ago -- the pilot having mistaken the runway for a much longer and wider one in a similar orientation at a nearby military base -- i made the prediction that it was n't the last time we 'd see such a blunder . i just did n't think it would happen again so soon . but on sunday , a southwest 737 crew mistook a runway at a small local airport in hollister , missouri , for the much larger runway at nearby , branson airport , and landed at the small strip by mistake . to make matters more hair-raising , the 737 touched down on a relatively short runway even for light planes , never mind for airliners . to their credit , the crew members of the boeing jet got it stopped short of the end of the runway , where an embankment separated it from u.s. highway 65 , without doing any damage to passengers or the plane . the question arises :  how did a professionally trained crew manage to screw up so badly ?  the answer is it 's very easy to do . take the accidental landing of a c-17 at a small florida airport in 2012 , for example . the crew 's intended airport was macdill air force base , but it instead touched down the giant jet on the much , much shorter , 100-foot-wide runway a few miles away . military personnel had to work for hours after the mix-up to lighten the airplane 's load so it could take off from the short strip . the fact is that any pilot with a lot of experience who claims to have never at least lined up to land at a runway other than the intended one is probably fibbing . i 've been flying everything from light propeller planes to big jets for more than 30 years , and i 've aimed for the wrong runway three times and a really big taxiway on a different occasion . the problem is there are two distinct modes of operating an airplane , by reference to the instruments and by visual reference . with very , very few exceptions , every flight ends with the pilot turning off the autopilot -lrb- if it was engaged -rrb- , taking physical command of the plane through the flight and power controls ,  acquiring  the runway visually and landing . sometimes that process happens in the last 10 seconds of a flight , sometimes in the last five minutes . it 's that visual acquisition of the landing runway that 's the trap . when pilots see what they believe is the right runway , they 're going to land there unless some big alarm goes off in their head . it 's simply human nature , and pilots are humans . they proceed to disregard the instruments and simply  hand fly  the airplane to a landing , that is if the co-pilot does n't alert them to the flub . all the while the navigation instruments  know  the plane is headed to the wrong airport , but the pilots do n't pay attention because in their mind they 've already found the right runway , so why even bother to look at the instruments ? why do n't more of these wrong airport episodes end in disaster ? it 's luck that most of them do n't . tragically , there are exceptions . in 2006 , a regional jet took off from the wrong runway in lexington , kentucky . the runway was too short and the jet crashed , killing 49 people in the process . landing at the wrong airport or choosing the wrong runway can be catastrophic . had the 747 in wichita tried landing on a runway as short as the one the much smaller 737 touched down on over the weekend , i do n't think it could have stopped in time to avoid going off the end and at the very least wrecking the airplane . modern airliners have two things going for them â $  great brakes and powerful reverse thrusters â $  and in the case of both the 737 and the 747 before it , it was a good thing they did . i was n't there to witness either event , but i 'd be shocked if the smell of superheated brake pads was n't in the air . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of robert goyer .", "summary": " robert goyer : 2 months after a jet landed on wrong runway , it happened again in missouri .   how does crew get it wrong ? if you 've been flying a long time , it 's happened to you , he says .   he says pilots turn off autopilot just before landing , do n't always see it 's wrong field .   goyer : it can be deadly . a saving grace of newer jets : great brakes , reverse thrusters .
