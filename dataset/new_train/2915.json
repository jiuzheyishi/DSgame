{"text": "the implementation of the affordable care act is not going well . first , the volume of people showing up to healthcare.gov on october 1 completely crashed the site . then , it turned out the data being passed up and back was completely corrupt . then , millions of americans began discovering that plans they  liked  were being canceled , and they were being told it was because of the affordable care act . president obama announced an administrative fix to this problem on thursday : an extension that allows insurers to keep people on health care plans that the affordable health care act would not have allowed . the cancellations had posed a real problem for the obama administration , because they flew in the face of what many believe is a core promise of health care reform : that you could keep your policy if you liked it . millions are finding out this is n't true . those of us who have been in the weeds of health policy have known this for a long time . most americans did not . the affordable care act changes the way insurance is regulated . it declares that many services are now mandatory . this included a lot of preventive care , as well as maternity care . any policies that do n't provide these services will no longer be offered . other policies had very low annual or lifetime limits . these , too , have to go away . anyone who had one will need to find a new policy . it 's very likely that newer policies , with more robust benefits , will be more expensive . that will make many people unhappy . we can argue that the new policies are still a good deal , or that much of that cost will be defrayed by subsidies , or that future protections to both beneficiaries and their families are worth the added cost , but that 's somewhat beside the point . many people feel like they were told they could keep their insurance , and now they think they have been lied to . obama knows the law is in trouble . many democrats feel like they took hard votes and stuck their necks out to support the law , and now that there 's a perception that the executive branch has dropped the ball , their support is not as strong . there are a number of bills and fixes being debated . that wo n't be easy , though . that 's in part because no insurance plan sticks around forever . plans change from year to year , premiums change from year to year , coverage changes from year to year , and deductibles , copays , and co-insurance change from year to year . they always have . it has never been the case that you could be guaranteed that your plan would exist -- as it does today -- for as long as you would like . i 've had plans i 've liked canceled many times in my 10 years working at my current job . one bill being put forth in the house would allow insurers to continue to offer plans that have been discontinued due to the affordable care act . the problem with that is that many insurance companies do n't want to continue to offer those plans indefinitely . they do n't make sense financially . therefore , passing this law wo n't stop millions of americans from getting cancellation notices anyway . a different bill in the senate would force insurance companies to continue to offer those plans or leave the state entirely . if you thought the affordable care act was a government takeover before , this bill is much , much worse . it would compel insurance companies to comply with a whole new host of potentially unprofitable regulations . the truth of the matter is there is no easy solution here . disrupting the current system is n't a bug of health care reform ; it 's a feature . it 's what was supposed to happen . all reform will do so . even republican proposals , like sen. john mccain 's when he was running for president , to change the health insurance tax deduction , would have completely upended the employer-sponsored health insurance system . then-sen . obama attacked him savagely for just that back in 2008 . it 's fine for president clinton and others to just  demand  this be fixed . unfortunately , it ca n't be , at least not easily and not cheaply . letting healthy people keep these plans -lrb- because most of those in the pre-affordable care act individual market are healthier -rrb- and stay out of the exchanges will raise the premiums for everyone else , and thus the amount the government will have to pay in subsidies . forcing insurance companies to continue to offer old plans in a new marketplace could wind up hurting their bottom line significantly . obama 's administrative fix , much like the house bill , allow plans offered this year to remain in place if people want them . but that will just shift blame to the insurance companies when they cancel them . for many of the reasons above , they wo n't want to keep them going . the real problem here , and one that few are addressing , is that the old health care system is n't that good . we wanted to change it . doing so means that it , well , changes . if we liked our old health care system , we could keep it . but we did n't , and so at some point we 're going to have to accept a new one . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of aaron carroll .", "summary": " aaron carroll : obama 's quick  fix  on insurance cancellations puts off needed changes .   he says aca mandates adequate care ; policies without it must go away .   he says  fix  just shifts blame to the insurance companies when they cancel policies .   carroll : to fix broken health care , we must accept changes . there are no easy answers .
