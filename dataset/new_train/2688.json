{"text": "what began as an online protest over the controversial case of an alleged rape of a then-14-year-old girl became a street demonstration tuesday night as hundreds of protesters gathered in a small missouri town demanding  justice for daisy .  it was the first physical protest since the case launched a social media fervor driven by online activist group anonymous . a few relatives of the alleged victim cried as people gathered , telling cnn they were glad to see some people in maryville , a town of 12,000 residents , finally supporting the girl . daisy coleman says a teenage boy raped her in 2012 when she was 14 . coleman 's mother , melinda , says that after her daughter 's alleged assault , her children received threats . melinda coleman was also fired from her job as a veterinarian at a clinic . the colemans have since moved from the town in northwest missouri , about 100 miles north of kansas city . in april , their house in maryville -- which had been vacant and for sale -- burned . some of the protesters who came to the rally on tuesday were out-of-towners who were so moved by the case they drove several hours to attend . they said they were hopeful that the rally would inspire a wider conversation about rape and rape victims . melinda coleman , who was not at the rally , said she was heartened to hear so many people had gathered in support of her daughter . she held back tears of her own as she told cnn 's  erin burnett outfront  :  i think it 's a wonderful sentiment and i 'm really touched ... and happy .  she said she is ecstatic the case has been reopened after a special prosecutor was appointed monday .  i think that just the fact that we 're being heard and we 're getting a chance at justice is huge . all we 've ever wanted was to have some justice ,  she said , adding that she has yet to meet with the new prosecutor . in an interview with erin burnett last week , daisy coleman described leaving her house during a sleepover and going with a boy who was later charged with sexual assault . the charges against matthew barnett , 17 at the time of the incident , were subsequently dropped . a lawyer for barnett said last week that his client cooperated with authorities and admitted he had sex with daisy .  while many find matt barnett 's behavior reprehensible , the legal issue was whether a crime was committed ,  robert sundell said in the statement . daisy coleman 's friend , paige -- who says she was raped by a different boy that same night -- had her case settled in juvenile court . cnn does not typically identify alleged victims of sexual assault but has done so in this case because paige , daisy and her mother have chosen to go public . cnn has agreed to identify paige by just her first name . on monday , a new special prosecutor promised to review the case  without fear and without favor .   i know that this case has raised a variety of concerns in northwest missouri , so please know this : this case will be thoroughly reviewed ,  jackson county prosecutor jean peters baker said . a judge appointed baker as special prosecutor days after a different prosecutor , who dropped charges , said he 'd request the move . the initial prosecutor , nodaway county prosecutor robert l. rice , has said he dropped a sexual assault charge against the boy because the girl and her relatives refused to cooperate .  there was insufficient evidence to prove a criminal charge beyond a reasonable doubt ,  he said in a statement . a charge against the boy 's friend who was accused of recording part of the incident on an iphone was also discontinued . but the case got new life this month after the kansas city star featured it and cnn interviewed daisy and her mother . why anonymous wants justice in missouri rape case .", "summary": " hundreds gather in small missouri town in support of girl who says she was raped .   family left town after the alleged assault , saying they were harrassed .   special prosecutor was appointed after different prosecutor dropped charges .   the alleged victim says she was raped when she was 14 .
