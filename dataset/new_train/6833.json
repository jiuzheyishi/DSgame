{"text": "andy murray says he will have studied some videos ahead of his match against rafael nadal and i am pretty certain what three of those showreels will have been . one will have been the first set he played against the spaniard in last month 's italian open quarter-finals , which he won 6-1 and was , in my view , the best tennis andy has ever played on clay . two others will be the most recent victories of novak djokovic over nadal -- in april 's miami final and the italian final two weeks last sunday . these were masterclasses in how to beat the world no 1 . video scroll down to watch sportsmail 's mike dickson preview the semi-finals in paris . post-match : andy murray congratulates rafael nadal after the spaniard beat him in rome last month . preparing : murray plays a forehand during a practice session on thursday as fitness trainer matt little looks on . the orthodox wisdom has been that the best way to play the great spaniard is to go more to his backhand , but that has changed in my view and djokovic , who has beaten him in their past four meetings , has had a lot of success hitting hard to nadal 's supposedly stronger forehand side . over the years , nadal 's backhand has become an incredibly solid shot , partly because he is a natural right-hander . his defence is phenomenal on that wing . another factor is that rafa 's biggest weapon of all is the ` inside-out ' forehand he hits when running around his backhand -- these are both good reasons not to overdo the hitting towards that side of the court . murray has to take the ball on in the way he did in rome . at times in that match he really hurt nadal with his backhand and by hitting hard and flat to him on both sides . it was a contest he could have won . silverware : novak djokovic -lrb- right -rrb- holds the trophy after beating nadal in the final of the italian open in rome . i also think you will see the scot use . the drop shot more than he did against gael monfils , who gets fired up . chasing into the net . i have really enjoyed watching andy over the past two weeks and this is the first time i have seen him with his ` mojo ' back since wimbledon . there have been spells here when he has played superb clay-court tennis , with his movement outstanding and that backhand better than ever . whatever the result today i think it will put him in extremely good shape for the grass-court season . feeling good : murray has played superb tennis on the clay of paris during his run to the semi-finals . can he beat nadal ? i do not sense any great vulnerability in the spaniard , although his serve has not been quite as strong as previously . clearly he is the solid favourite but if andy manages to dictate for long enough then he has a chance . a word of warning is that if the predicted hot weather materialises that is good for rafa , as it will add zip and bounce to his ground-strokes .", "summary": " murray 's 6-1 first set against nadal at the italian open last month was his best ever tennis on clay .   novak djokovic 's victories over nadal in miami and rome were masterclasses .   the serb has had a lot of success hitting to nadal 's forehand side .   murray 's movement is outstanding and his backhand is better than ever .
