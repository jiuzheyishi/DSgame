{"text": "a recent study on global wellbeing showed the danes to be the happiest people on the planet and with about a fifth of them living in their capital it stands to reason that copenhagen must be a little bit special . the amalienborg palaces are the royal family 's winter residence . so what are they so happy about ? well , lifestyle magazine monocle recently named copenhagen as being the world 's most livable city , highlighting the quality of its infrastructure , transport system and contemporary buildings . it 's true that the city is well planned and well managed ; it boasts a new metro system , the main arteries in the centre are pedestrianized and the other streets are filled with cyclists rather than exhaust fumes . but copenhagen is not some soulless exercise in sterile urban planning . there are the winding medieval streets of indre by and the latin quarter , the picture-postcard houses of nyhavn , the canals of christanshavn , and the palaces and parks of fredericksstaden and rosenborg . the city is , simply , charming . if you spend some time in copenhagen you 'll quickly come to understand the danish concept of  hygge  , a word with multiple meanings that is best translated as something between  cozy  and  relaxed  . but if that suggests a city of bygone cuteness it does n't take into account the sleek modernism of danish design . arne jacobsen 's legacy can be seen throughout the city -lrb- check out the radisson sas royal and café stelling -rrb- but no less visionary are recent structures such as henning larsen 's futuristic opera house or the dramatic new royal library , known as the  black diamond  . the clean lines and minimalism that characterize danish design are evident in the interiors of the city 's stylish bars , restaurants and hotels and perhaps their influence can even be detected in the trend away from bland , stodgy cooking to a cleaner , healthier style that is earning the city 's restaurants acclaim and michelin stars . the alternative side of copenhagen can be seen in places like christiania , the ` free city ' founded in 1971 by a collection of dropouts , hippies and social visionaries . the fact that this semi-autonomous experiment in communal living has survived for so long is testament to the open-mindedness of the danish ; but the very existence of christiania has always been controversial and government plans to ` normalize ' the area suggest it may not be ` free ' much longer . like any city of its size , copenhagen has its share of social problems . nørrebro has been the scene of a riots in recent years , with some commentators blaming social deprivation and others blaming boredom among young people . but it is working class areas like nørrebro and vesterbro , away from the tourist trail , that are the beating heart of the city . they are home to many of copenhagen 's trendiest bars and clubs and they have a sense of community that is difficult to convey ; it is something danes might describe as  hygge  . so why are the danish so happy ? go to copenhagen and you 'll understand .", "summary": " copenhagen has been described as the world 's most livable city .   the city is charming , with medieval streets , canals and royal palaces .   sleek danish design is evident everywhere and gives the city a modern edge .   the ` free city ' of christiania is testimony to danish open-mindedness .
