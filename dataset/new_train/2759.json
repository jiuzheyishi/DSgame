{"text": "as we mark the 25th observance of world aids day on december 1 , we have a golden opportunity to begin to end the hiv/aids pandemic . to start with , this has been an extraordinary year for hiv/aids research , with headline-grabbing breakthroughs that stand as undeniable evidence of progress toward a cure . the first documented case of a child cured of hiv , reported in march , was followed in july by a report of two adult hiv patients no longer showing any signs of virus after undergoing stem-cell transplants and stopping antiretroviral treatment . much work lies ahead before these and other scientific advances can be parlayed into a broadly applicable cure that can be made available to the 35 million people living with hiv/aids worldwide . but it is an irony bordering on tragedy that just as a cure for hiv/aids is beginning to seem like a realistic proposition , the belt-tightening measures of the age of austerity could halt our momentum , cripple our progress and dash our hopes for ending aids in our lifetime . as a result of u.s. budget sequestration , the national institutes of health -- the engine of progress on aids research for 30 years -- will lose $ 229 million in aids research funding in the coming year . this caps a dismal decade for aids and other biomedical research support : from 2003 to 2012 , the nih lost 22 of its purchasing power as a result of stagnant levels of funding . this hammer blow to aids research funding will be accompanied by cuts to a range of other hiv/aids programs -- cuts that will have negligible effect on the federal deficit but will have real consequences for people living with hiv/aids in the united states and around the world . alicia keys : get loud about fighting hiv . based on the latest available data , amfar , the foundation for aids research , has estimated that reduced funding for the president 's emergency plan for aids relief -lrb- pepfar -rrb- alone could result in 228,000 fewer people receiving treatment for hiv . this could lead to as many as 52,000 aids-related deaths and could leave more than 100,000 children orphaned . the institute of medicine has said that pepfar has been  globally transformative  and has  had major positive effects on the health and well-being of individual beneficiaries , on institutions and systems in partner countries , and the overall global response to aids .  interactive : world aids day and what it means . why , then , are we shortchanging a program that enjoys broad bipartisan and popular support , has done more than any other foreign policy initiative in recent years to burnish america 's image abroad , and has already altered -- though not irreversibly -- the trajectory of the hiv/aids pandemic ? nor will people living with hiv here in the united states be spared . amfar also estimates that the sequester could cause about 15,000 americans who need help paying for their medications to lose support from the aids drug assistance program . and more than 4,000 households could lose housing assistance as a result of cuts in the federally funded housing opportunities for people with aids program . all of these cuts will fall disproportionately on people of color . just a few years ago , the notion of a cure for hiv was considered by many to be heretical . it was creating false hope . it was n't technically feasible . it could n't be done . that all changed with the first reports , in 2008 , of timothy brown , the  berlin patient .  while on treatment for hiv , brown was diagnosed with leukemia . to treat the leukemia , he received a stem-cell transplant -- with a twist . his savvy german doctor deliberately sought , and found , a stem-cell donor from among a very small group of people born with a genetic mutation that renders them highly resistant to hiv infection . after the transplant , brown was able to stop hiv treatment without experiencing a return of the disease . zero new hiv infections among children can be a reality . similarly , the idea of an  aids-free generation  today is tossed around with abandon . it was n't always thus . but over 30 years , we have developed a raft of tools that enable us to effectively prevent and treat hiv infection . what 's more , research has shown us conclusively that treatment is prevention . putting people on antiretroviral drugs makes them less infectious and less likely to transmit the virus to others . combine a broader deployment of these tools with an expansion of programs such as pepfar and a sustained investment in research , and you have a trifecta : a winning combination that could achieve the conquest of the aids pandemic in the foreseeable future . backpedal on aids , and you 'll pretty much guarantee that we 'll be dealing with it for generations to come . bill gates : where to put the smart money to end aids . the opinions expressed are solely those of kevin robert frost and sharon stone .", "summary": " it 's been a year of breakthroughs in hiv/aids research .   but sequestration and cutbacks will affect those living with the disease .   backpedaling on aids may mean we continue grappling with it for generations .
