{"text": "a woman ` kettled ' by police , before being filmed and told to hand over personal details during a 2011 trade union rally was treated unlawfully , the high court said today . the metropolitan police argued they were legally entitled to obtain , and retain , the information for crime prevention purposes before allowing susannah mengesha to leave . but lord justice moses and mr justice wyn williams , sitting in london , ruled they had acted outside their powers . scotland yard will now have to delete any records of miss mengesha taken at the demo , including on film and camera . case : susannah mengesha was observing demonstrators attending an anti-cuts rally in london in 2011 when she was kettled and not allowed to leave until giving her personal details . ` the absence of any statutory power to obtain identification in the circumstances in this case establishes conclusively the unlawfulness of the police action in requiring -lrb- ms mengesha -rrb- to be filmed and give her name and address and date of birth before she was released from containment , ' justice moses said . conclusion : mr justice moses found : ` it was not lawful to require identification to be given and submission to filming as the price for release ' ms mengesha , a law graduate and caseworker at the bar pro bono unit , was corralled in a crowd of protesters for two hours on november 30 2011 at a trade union march against public sector pension cuts . she was acting as a legal observer . the march , which started at lincoln 's inn fields in central london , proceeded to piccadilly circus in the west end . some of the crowd , including ms mengesha , were blocked in at nearby panton street . police said the containment was ` necessitated by a reasonably apprehended imminent breach of the peace ' . while the judges agreed that containment was necessary , they declared being filmed and having to give the police personal details as ` the price of release ' a step too far . their ruling will be welcomed as important backing for the freedom to protest without the ` chilling ' effect of being forced to hand over particulars . the judge declared : ` it was not lawful for the police to maintain the containment for the purposes of obtaining identification , whether by questioning or filming . ` it follows that it was not lawful to require identification to be given and submission to filming as the price for release . ' ms mengesha , who is now training to be solicitor , was allowed out of the kettle some two hours later at 5.52 pm . the filming and taking of personal details occurred when the police assessed that containment was no longer necessary . ms mengesha said some 100 detainees were searched for ` offensive weapons or dangerous instruments ' before their release - but were also told they had to give their personal details to obtain their freedom . proceedings : ms mengesha was forced to take the case to the high court because the police refused to accept they acted illegally . she was ` tagged ' - filmed close up under bright lights - for identification purposes by a civilian employee of the police and gave her name , address and date of birth to a police officer . demonstrators were filmed ` individually in close-up , from front and back ' and the images linked with their personal details . in those circumstances , article 8 of the european convention on human rights , which protects private and family life , became engaged , said the judge . while the met police had a published policy of overt filming and photography , ` there is no such published policy on the retention of images and personal details ' . so the interference with the claimant 's rights enshrined in article 8 was not ` in accordance with the law ' . a metropolitan police service spokesman said later : ` we are aware of the judgment today and will now give it our full consideration and take forward any learning . ' james welch , legal director for campaign group liberty , said : ` it should n't have needed a court to tell the police they ca n't require personal details and compulsory filming before releasing people from a kettle . any law student could have worked that out . the courts have been clear that kettling is a last resort - it should never be abused as a tool for bullying demonstrators .
