{"text": "thousands of a-level students who hoped to secure university places last year could have been given the wrong marks , a whistleblower has claimed . senior exam board supervisor david leitch found that 10 per cent of pupils should have received a higher grade when he checked papers where schools had queried their results . another 10 per cent should have been given a lower grade because final scores were added up wrongly by examiners , mr leitch said . cheated ? senior exam board supervisor said 10 per cent of pupils should have received a higher grade when he checked papers queried by schools . the claims are the latest in a long line of controversies relating to britain 's chaotic exams system , which have raised grave concerns about standards . mr leitch said that , following requests from schools in august 2011 for re-marking , he and his team spotted basic clerical errors in 100 papers . this led them to carry out extended checks on other papers marked by the same examiners and found a further 200 errors . mr leitch said he emailed 30 schools to alert them to the problem affecting a-level and gcse papers after he was dissatisfied with a review ordered by the exam watchdog ofqual . he has been suspended by exam board ocr . mr leitch claimed that , when he spotted the mistakes , he was told by ocr to stop the checks . ` we were amazed , he told channel 4 news . ` we wanted the candidates to receive the correct results and if these checks were not brought to light they would n't get the correct results . ' ` it 's so bizarre , it should be of paramount significance to all of us who work within an awarding body that we issue correct results to our candidates . ` it 's the number one priority that we have . to tell people that have uncovered mistakes that you must discontinue these checks is outrageous . ' ocr say their assessors checked the scripts of over 1,100 examiners and in only a few cases did this affect the overall grade that had been awarded . whistleblower : david leitch claims he was told to stop checking exam papers after he spotted mistakes . but that view is disputed by mr leitch , who claims that he has uncovered an additional 50 to 100 papers with marking errors in the last few weeks . he said : ` we checked 50,000 scripts and found 700 errors . ' i believe there would have been thousands . not thousands of incorrect grades , but thousands of incorrect results issued . ' a spokesman for ocr said : ` ocr 's top priority at this time is to reassure those taking exams now that our systems have been significantly improved . ' the exam board has introduced new stages into the checking of manually marked scripts , which it says ` will ensure a high level of clerical accuracy ' . it said it was processing the disputed exam papers and would make grade changes , if required . the spokesman added : ` we confirm that a supervisor has been suspended pending investigation . ` to say anything more would prejudice the investigation . ` we support ofqual 's planned review of examination marking and will be glad to share any lessons learnt from last year 's mistakes . ' an ofqual spokesman said : ` mr leitch is now making two serious allegations about last summer 's exam series : that ocr did not properly do the checks that it claimed to have done , and also that it misled the regulator . ` we need to establish as a matter of urgency whether these allegations are true . ` we have written to ocr seeking an urgent explanation . ` we would ask that mr leitch also shares all the documents he has with us . ` we will not comment further on this case until we have seen ocr 's full response . ` if we find ocr has acted improperly we will take the matter further and if appropriate use our enforcement powers . ' in a statement , the department of education said : ` the level of error here is simply unacceptable . ` we have been crystal clear that exam boards must produce papers that are error-free , and award the correct grades to students . revision : ocr has changed the way it checks papers to ensure a high level of clerical accuracy ' ` it is exactly these kinds of issues that have led us to strengthen ofqual 's regulatory powers and introduce a new power to allow them to fine exam boards in the future . ` we are continuing to look at whether even stronger powers are needed . ' mr leitch 's claims were revealed less than 48 hours after the head of the uk 's largest exam board cast doubt over a-level and gcse standards . rod bristow , president of pearson uk , which owns edexcel , said that boards should be ` worried ' about the pattern of ever improving results . he stopped short of agreeing there had been grade inflation but admitted it was ` indisputable ' that grades in a-levels and gcses had improved . exam board officials have previously defended standards , insisting that year-on-year grade improvements were due to students ' hard work . a newspaper investigation last december revealed how seminars were giving teachers vital information about papers . it also exposed one of the chief examiners at edexcel boasting about how the board had managed to clear easy exams with ofqual . steph warren , a senior official at edexcel , told an undercover reporter , posing as a geography teacher considering using the firm 's gcse exams , that ` you do n't have to teach a lot ' . another edexcel english official boasted about how , thanks to easy coursework , ` weak kids ' could get through ` on anything really ' . ofqual later announced it was banning thousands of exam seminars , which posed ` unacceptable risks ' to the integrity of the system . some teachers expected to receive ` privileged information ' about exams , it claimed .", "summary": " senior exam board supervisor found that 10 per cent of pupils should have received higher grade .   david leitch claims final scores were added up wrongly by examiners and has alerted schools to mistakes .   level of error is ` simply unacceptable ' , department of education says .
