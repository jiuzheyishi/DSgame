{"text": "the lack of universities in some parts of england is depriving pupils of the chance to gain a degree -- despite achieving good grades at school , according to a new study . these middle-class higher education ` cold spots ' can be found in the border areas between england and wales , along the cumbrian coast , in humberside and north yorkshire , from kent to the wash and in the south-west , the higher education funding council for england -lrb- hefce -rrb- said . in corringham and fobbing , thurrock , essex , for instance , it would be expected , based on academic performance at school , that 43.4 per cent of school leavers would go to university -- but the actual figure was just 25.6 per cent . scroll down for video . there are middle-class higher education ` cold spots ' in the border areas between england and wales , along the cumbrian coast , in humberside and north yorkshire , from kent to the wash and in the south-west . the interactive hefce map below shows the cold and hot spots in england for university participation : . the report painted a similar picture in dorchester east , dorset , where 48.1 per cent of school leavers would be expected to go on to higher education , but just 31.3 per cent actually did . the picture , however , is fairly complex . for example in leeds and birmingham , where there is a relatively high number of higher education institutions , the proportion of young people progressing to higher education is lower than expected in relation to their gcse attainment . with a few exception , much of lincolnshire has a low proportion of students entering higher education . red denotes low numbers , moving up through orange , yellow , turquoise and dark blue -lrb- the highest -rrb- . south wales also has a high number of regions where students are largely not progressing to university . likely due to free university places , scotland has a high proportion of students entering higher education . the report is the first time that school and higher education data together with employment and mobility data has been meshed to give a comprehensive and detailed picture of higher education participation and provision , employment and graduate mobility . professor madeleine atkins , hefce chief executive , said that the report , which includes an interactive map of the education cold spots , could be used to identify areas where new campuses could be built . she said : ` the data shows us that the issues associated with higher education cold spots can often be complex . ' coastal regions of the north-east also suffer from low number of those heading to university . she added : ` higher education providers , working collaboratively with their local enterprise partnerships , will be able to use this powerful new toolkit to establish a detailed picture of higher education in their localities , enabling them to identify any gaps in provision , participation and the supply of graduates . ` this provides a strong evidence base to explore potential solutions for delivering local economic recovery and growth . ` universities and colleges play a key role as economic and social anchors in their local and wider communities . working with local partners in this way to reach a joint understanding of the issues that affect them collectively , they can make an important contribution to the ongoing development of strategic economic plans , and also , of course , to decisions about where and when to invest different forms of funding . ' the lack of universities in some parts of england is depriving some pupils of the chance to gain a degree . earlier this year research showed that the number of students who are satisfied with their degree hit a record high , although thousands still said they are not happy with the overall quality of their course . it revealed the vast majority of undergraduates are content with the teaching and learning resources on their course , but less happy with the assessment and feedback they receive . undergraduates at bath university , keele university , st andrews university and st mary 's university college are among the happiest with their degree , according to the annual national student survey .", "summary": " there are large areas of england that lack university provision , a study said .   these ` cold spots ' mean many teens are missing out on university places .   areas lacking higher education opportunities include cumbria and humberside .
