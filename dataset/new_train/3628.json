{"text": "controversial gas drilling did cause a series of earthquakes along the lancashire coastline , a report today confirmed . gas company cuadrilla resources , which is extracting shale gas in the region , commissioned the independent study after two tremors shook fylde coastline in april and may this year . energy chiefs have now sent a stark warning to the firm - either stop the earthquakes or be shut down . how shale gas is being extracted from deep beneath lancashire . british energy consortium cuadrilla resources has discovered that lancashire is sitting on one of largest reserve of ` shale gas ' in europe . according to results from its test wells , there are 200trillion cubic feet of natural gas under the ground , trapped in a layer of compacted mud . if the gas can be recovered , it could provide britain with enough fuel to last 50 years , plug the looming energy shortfall caused by reduced north sea gas supplies and create 5,600 jobs . and it could turn blackpool from the leisure capital of the north , to the centre of england 's oil and gas industry - a texas-by-the-sea . two hundred trillion cubic feet is an unimaginably vast amount of gas . it is ten times more than all the gas known to be left under the north sea . it 's one-fifth the size of the biggest gas field in the world , and the volume of 66,666 royal albert halls . the prospect of 400 gas wells across lancashire and thousands of new jobs - not to mention all those tax revenues - could n't have come at a better time for the chancellor . but there is one problem - in gas and oil exploration , if something sounds too good to be true , it usually is . it comes after cuadrilla held urgent . talks with the department of energy and climate change -lrb- decc -rrb- to . consider the report into the risk of earthquakes associated with . ` fracking ' - the process used to extract shale gas . the meetings followed the british . geological survey 's conclusion that the two tremors felt nearby were . most likely to have been caused by fracking . on april 1 , a magnitude 2.3 earthquake . shook the north-west . it originated less than two miles from an . experimental shale gas well near blackpool run by cuadrilla . a second tremor occurred on may 27 with a magnitude of 1.5 . the epicentre was within 500 yards of the well . the bgs said the correlations between . the earthquakes and the time of fracking operations , and the proximity . of the quakes to the site , all pointed towards the earthquakes being a . result of the fracking process . seismologist brian baptie said : ` these . were still very small earthquakes , even by uk standards and wo n't cause . any damage . if fracking continued i could n't see the tremors getting . much bigger . ` but it is obviously a concern for . local residents and i 'm sure the report commissioned by cuadrilla will . be greeted with interest . ' cuadrilla has came under fire from . activists for its drilling technique , which involves pumping high . volumes of water and sand into drill holes to crack the rocks so gas can . be extracted . soon after the quakes were felt the . firm halted the fracking process after admitting the low magnitude . tremors felt in poulton in april and may , close to cuadrilla 's singleton . site , could be linked to them . experts today said cuadrilla 's . operations could be shut down permanently if proposed methods to reduce . the risk of earthquakes fail . toni harvey , a senior decc . geoscientist , said : ` if we allow fracking to continue and their . mitigation did n't work , then we would shut them down again , without a . doubt . ` there is a lot of concern in the media and from ministers about public safety . resort town : could the discovery of a huge amount of shale gas beneath lancashire turn blackpool into texas-by-the-sea ? fracking is a mining technique commonly used to get gas or oil from under land rather than under the sea . to get the gas out , companies drill down into shale and form a well . they then inject wells with water , small amounts of chemicals and sand to create tiny cracks in the rock , allowing natural gas and sometimes oil to flow upwards into the well . the technique could add about 40 per cent to previous estimates of global recoverable gas resources , with the largest known reserves are in china , the united states , argentina and mexico . however , it is now feared the process could be the cause of small earthquakes . critics such as the green party say that it is environmentally unsafe because the chemicals could contaminate soil and get into drinking water . ` decc has requested a detailed report . from cuadrilla , which we understand they are close to finalising . when . the report is received , it will be carefully considered , with input from . british geological survey and other experts . ` we will also be discussing the report . with other regulators before any decision is made on resuming hydraulic . fracturing operations for shale gas . ' last month cuadrilla , the first . company to explore for shale gas in britain , announced the fylde coast . holds a total potential resource of 200trillion cubic feet of gas . it estimated the discovery - between . blackpool and southport - could be worth # 6billion to the uk economy and . create 1,700 jobs locally . however , protesters are campaigning to . stop the drilling and anti-fracking group frack off - london rallied . outside the decc headquarters on thursday as cuadrilla presented its . study . philip mitchell , the chairman of the . blackpool and fylde green party , called on the government to halt all . british hydraulic fracturing industry activity until there has been a . thorough and robust evaluation of the risks related to future activity . he said : ` any suggestion of an acceptable level of earthquakes caused by fracking should be rejected . ` the government must realise it must . stop treating our communities like guinea pigs and accept these . techniques carry unacceptable risks to the british public . ` ministers must stop the industry . activity at least until parliament and the public can be guided by a . full and robust appraisal of the total risk to the themselves and to the . environment . ' mark miller , ceo of cuadrilla . resources , said : ` we met with officials from decc and their technical . advisors and had a useful , in-depth working session on the initial . findings of the report . ` there is some considerable work still . to do and we absolutely share with decc the need to have the complex . issues involved addressed dealt with satisfactorily .
