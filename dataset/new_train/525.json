{"text": "a former fitness trainer who ballooned to 27 stone after becoming addicted to crisps has lost half his body weight - after kicking the 20 packet-a-day habit . james quinn , 44 , devoured the cheese and onion flavoured snacks along with four burgers , bacon , fried eggs , countless biscuits , an entire loaf of bread and two litres of irn bru or coke every 24 hours . mature student james struggled to walk and could not climb a flight of stairs to make it to his college classes to study for a higher national diploma -lrb- hnd -rrb- in multimedia technology and web design . former fitness trainer who ballooned to 27 stone after developing an addiction to crisps that saw him eat 20 packets every day . when doctors told him his lifestyle would kill him , he finally shed 14 stone - and now weighs in at 13st 10lbs . but after being told by doctors his lifestyle would kill him james , with the help of staff at slimming world , shed 14 stone and a year later weighs in at 13 stone 10 pounds . james said the weight loss also meant james graduated from college and is now studying for a degree in the same subject . father-of-four james said : ' i loved cheese and onion crisps . i could easily go through 20 packs in a day on top of all the fried food . ` it got to the point where i could n't walk up the flight of stairs to get to class , i think it would have killed me and i definitely would n't have finished the first year , never mind be doing a degree . at his largest , james weighed almost 28 stone and could not climb a flight of stairs at the colelge he attended . ' i feel fantastic now , absolutely great . i 'm a totally different person and i have n't touched a bag of crisps in over a year . ' i ate one to celebrate hitting my weight loss target and it was horrible , i did n't like the taste at all . ' grandfather-of-one james , who lives with his wife joyce , 46 , in irvine , north ayrshire , began to pile on the pounds after leaving his job as a fitness instructor at the scottish sports council , to manage a video rental shop in the early 1990s . the slow-down in activity and hours spent sat behind a counter saw james eat more and exercise less . over the next 20 years he moved from job to job in various high street shops until he hit the age of 40 when he left to study at college . as well as the crisps , james ' diet consisted of four burgers , bacon , fried eggs , biscuits , an entire loaf of bread and two litres of irn bru or coke every 24 hours . the student lifestyle meant james gained weight even quicker as his diet deteriorated into a sea of fast food , fried breakfasts and salty snacks . at his heaviest james weighed 27 stone seven pounds and struggled to walk . james began to realise the seriousness of the situation when he tried to buy a kilt to attend a wedding and found his bulging 62 inch waist was one inch short of needing a specially made garment . but even that was n't enough for him to ditch his snack filled diet . james said : ' i would buy the big multi-packs of crisps and they would all disappear . ' i would get annoyed and ask my family who had eaten them all , but then i realised all the empty packets were down the side of my chair , because i had eaten the lot . ` my diet was dreadful , breakfast would be four pieces of bread , two eggs and three sausages followed by biscuits and crisps . ` for dinner i would have four burgers , half a plate of chips and a tin of beans or a large curry . ' i had visited doctors who told me that if i did n't lose weight i would probably die but that did n't stop me . ` the turning point came when i started going to college . i would take the lift because i could n't manage the stairs . ' in march last year james decided to change his life and ate his last bag of crisps . he joined a weight loss class at irvine 's old parish church and began to exercise . in just six months he lost seven and a half stone , by nine months he had shed another five in time for the completion of his hnd course in november last year . he reached his target last month and said he is determined to continue his healthy lifestyle and shed a few more pounds before his graduation from the university of the west of scotland in paisley , renfrewshire , later this year . james added : ` it just shows what you can do . ` i 'm no longer on blood pressure tablets and i 'm really happy with the way i look . ` it 's given me a new lease of life , some people walk by me and do n't realise it 's me . ` and i do n't miss crisps at all .
