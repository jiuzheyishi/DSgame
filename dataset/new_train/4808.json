{"text": "the dog photos are difficult to view . of course . they show man 's best friend being stuffed into wire cages and trucked , illegally , across borders in southeast asia . the destination : restaurants in vietnam . that thought alone -- that someone would sit in a public restaurant and order dog from a menu -- is likely enough to get most  dog people  to stop reading this column , much less look at the photo essay featured this week by cnn 's photo blog . here in the untied states , we will spend $ 58.5 billion on pets this year , according to one industry projection . we pamper dogs with christmas presents ; send them to  doggie daycare  ; bring them on planes -lrb- more than 2 million pets and animals fly per year -rrb- ; and trot them around show rings , judging the perfection of their pedigree . eat them ? unthinkable . repulsive . cruel . we do n't even consider it . the images featured on the cnn photo blog take viewers inside southeast asia 's illegal dog-meat trade . shot by luke duggleby , who traveled to thailand , laos and vietnam for the story , they 're well worth your attention . he documents a trade that is estimated to include hundreds of thousands of dogs per year . the 36-year-old was born in the u.k. and has been living in thailand for eight years . he told me in an e-mail interview that he considers himself a  dog person  --  i got an english sheepdog for my fourth birthday and called him tom  -- and that made it difficult to see the gruesome realities of this trade , which is illegal in thailand because the exporters are n't paying taxes or getting the dogs vaccinated .  the dogs are illegally smuggled out of thailand -- that is the illegal part ,  he said .  they pay no tax or duty . the dogs are n't vaccinated nor do they undergo quarantine . but once they get to laos they are legally allowed to travel ... on the way to vietnam , as the officials are n't interested in it . and once in vietnam no part of it is illegal .  in a slaughterhouse ,  the dogs were beaten to death in front of me ,  he said . i fear you 'll see duggleby 's photos and think only one thing : how awful that people in vietnam would eat these loveable , intelligent animals . you 'll do what i did , which is to imagine your dog , or your childhood dog , in one of these cages . you wo n't think about the bigger picture . which is this : the cruelty of this trade -- the fact that dogs are smashed into cages ; suffocated ;  skinned alive , strung up and beaten ,  according to a cnn report -- is what should shock and sadden you . the fact that people are eating dog meat ? that should n't . unless you 're vegetarian or vegan -- i 'm not , by the way , although i do try to eat relatively little meat -- you do n't have any moral high ground to stand on . here in the united states , a place with an unhealthy and ridiculously hipster bacon obsession -lrb- witness : bacon donuts , bacon pie , bacon in bloody marys -rrb- , eating dog could be seen as a reasonable alternative to pig , which is another highly intelligent animal , capable of being a companion to the likes of george clooney . the united states euthanizes 1.2 million dogs per year , according to the aspca . would eating them be so different ? it actually could be seen as helpful .  -lsb- u -rsb- nlike all farmed meat , which requires the creation and maintenance of animals , dogs are practically begging to be eaten ,  jonathan safran foer , a vegetarian and novelist , writes in the book  eating animals .  euthanizing pets , he says ,  amounts to millions of pounds of meat now being thrown away every year . the simple disposal of these euthanized dogs is an enormous ecological and economic problem . it would be demented to yank pets from homes . but eating those strays , those runaways , those not-quite-cute-enough-to-take and not-quite-well-behaved-enough-to-keep dogs would be killing a flock of birds with one stone and eating it , too .  but wait : dogs are companions , right ? pigs -lrb- mostly -rrb- are not . true , in america . in parts of vietnam , not so much . in india , remember , cows are sacred . and eating pig is off limits for many muslim and jewish people . plus , there 's an inherent danger in thinking that  the value of an animal depends on how you treat it ,  writes slate 's william saletan .  if you befriend it , it 's a friend . if you raise it for food , it 's food ,  he says in a 2002 essay , hilariously titled  wok the dog .   this relativism is more dangerous than the absolutism of vegetarians or even of thoughtful carnivores . you can abstain from meat because you believe that the mental capacity of animals is too close to that of humans . you can eat meat because you believe that it is n't . either way , you 're using a fixed standard . but if you refuse to eat only the meat of ` companion ' animals -- chewing bacon , for example , while telling koreans that they ca n't stew dalmatians -- you 're saying that the morality of killing depends on habit or even whim .  maybe the logic of that makes sense but the thought of eating dog still does n't sit well . that 's the case for me . i went to vietnam earlier this year to report a story on the illegal trade in pangolin , which is a scale-covered mammal few people care about -lrb- except me and maybe this guy -rrb- in the way they care about dogs . i saw dog restaurants in hanoi . easily could have gone to one . i did n't . and that says less about the dog-eating that 's going on in hanoi than my own conflicted eating habits . clearly , the illegal dog trade needs to be cleaned up . but so does our thinking about what we eat and when and why . if we 're appalled by the dog trade in southeast asia , we should be similarly appalled by some of the conditions that exist in factory animal farms in the united states -- including the use of  gestation crates  to confine mother pigs , a practice activist temple grandin has criticized , saying it 's like  asking a sow to live in an airline seat .  if we think dog should n't be eaten -- like , ever , regardless of how clean the trade is and how quick the kill -- then maybe we should think about the other animals we eat , and if and why we do n't feel the same way about them . is it because we spend so much time with dogs -- looking into their eyes , talking to them , walking them , picking up their crap -- that we understand that they are living , breathing , feeling beings ? would we feel that way about other animals if we could hang out more ? or would the beak-y , frowny face of the chicken still stop us short of empathy ? for his part , duggleby , the photographer who shot the dog story , told me he was offered dog meat on the assignment but could n't eat it .  when i was photographing inside a dog meat restaurant -- claiming to be a chef studying vietnamese food -- i was offered to try it ,  he said .  it probably looked very odd for a ` chef ' to say no but i turned it down . i just could n't bring myself to try it .  i likely would have done the same thing . exactly why ? that 's a harder question . and it 's the one all of us should further examine .", "summary": " cnn 's photo blog features an essay on the illegal dog-meat trade in southeast asia .   john sutter : the graphic details of the photos , and the trade , are shocking and sad .   but , he writes , the fact that people eat dog should not seem repugnant .   he says it 's the equivalent of eating pig , which is another intelligent creature .
