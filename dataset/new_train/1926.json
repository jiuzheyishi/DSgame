{"text": "facing bankruptcy , the u.s. postal service is pushing ahead with unprecedented cuts to first-class mail next spring that will slow delivery and , for the first time in 40 years , eliminate the chance for stamped letters to arrive the next day . the estimated $ 3billion in reductions , to be announced in broader detail on monday , are part of a wide-ranging effort by the cash-strapped postal service to quickly trim costs , seeing no immediate help from congress . the changes would provide short-term relief , but ultimately could prove counterproductive , pushing more of america 's business onto the internet . save our post : nearly 100,000 postal workers could lose their jobs in an unprecedented budget cut that would also halt next-day mail . they could slow everything from check payments to netflix 's dvds-by-mail , add costs to mail-order prescription drugs , and threaten the existence of newspapers and time-sensitive magazines delivered by postal carrier to far-flung suburban and rural communities . that birthday card mailed first-class to mom also could arrive a day or two late , if people do n't plan ahead . ` it 's a potentially major change , but i do n't think consumers are focused on it and it wo n't register until the service goes away , ' said jim corridore , analyst with s&p capital iq , who tracks the shipping industry . ` over time , to the extent the customer service experience gets worse , it will only increase the shift away from mail to alternatives . ' the cuts , now being finalized , would close roughly 250 of the nearly 500 mail processing centres across the country as early as next march . because the consolidations typically would lengthen the distance mail travels from post office to processing centre , the agency also would lower delivery standards for first-class mail that have been in place since 1971 . currently , first-class mail is supposed to be delivered to homes and businesses within the continental u.s. in one day to three days . that will lengthen to two days to three days , meaning mailers no longer could expect next-day delivery in surrounding communities . periodicals could take between two days and nine days . deliver the letter : first-class mail will experience the downgrade as early as march in certain areas . about 42 per cent of first-class mail is now delivered the following day . an additional 27 per cent arrives in two days , about 31 per cent in three days and less than 1 per cent in four days to five days . following the change next spring , about . 51 per cent of all first-class mail is expected to arrive in two days , . with most of the remainder delivered in three days . ` the things i have control over here at . the postal service , we have to do . if we do nothing , we will have a death . spiral . ' - postmaster general patrick donahoe . the consolidation of mail processing centres is in addition to the planned closing of about 3,700 local post offices . in all , roughly 100,000 postal employees could be cut as a result of the various closures , resulting in savings of up to $ 6.5 billion a year . expressing urgency to reduce costs , postmaster general patrick donahoe said in an interview that the agency has to act while waiting for congress to grant it authority to reduce delivery to five days a week , raise stamp prices and reduce health care and other labour costs . the postal service , an independent agency of government , does not receive tax money , but is subject to congressional control on large aspects of its operations . the changes in first-class mail delivery can go into place without permission from congress . better late than never : time-sensitive materials like mailers and prescription drugs would take two to nine days to deliver if the new plan takes effect . after five years in the red , the post office faces imminent default this month on a $ 5.5 billion annual payment to the treasury for retiree health benefits . it is projected to have a record loss of $ 14.1 billion next year amid steady declines in first-class mail volume . mr donahoe has said the agency must make cuts of $ 20 billion by 2015 to be profitable . it already has announced a 1-cent increase in first-class mail to 45 cents beginning january 22 . ` we have a business model that is failing . you ca n't continue to run red ink and not make changes , ' mr donahoe said . ` we know our business , and we listen to our customers . customers are looking for affordable and consistent mail service , and they do not want us to take tax money . ' separate bills that have passed house and senate committees would give the postal service more authority and liquidity to stave off immediate bankruptcy . but prospects are somewhat dim for final congressional action on those bills anytime soon , especially if the measures are seen in an election year as promoting layoffs and cuts to neighbourhood post offices . industries hurt : netflix , which delivers movies to some of its customers , could potentially suffer from the lag in mail delivery . technically , the postal service must await an advisory opinion from the independent postal regulatory commission before it can begin closing local post offices and processing centres . but such opinions are nonbinding , and mr donahoe is making clear the agency will proceed with reductions once the opinion is released next march . ` the things i have control over here at the postal service , we have to do , ' he said , describing the cuts as a necessary business decision . ` if we do nothing , we will have a death spiral . ' the postal service initially announced in september it was studying the possibility of closing the processing centres and published a notice in the federal register seeking comments . within 30 days , the plan elicited nearly 4,400 public comments , mostly in opposition . among them : . maine senator susan collins , the top republican on the senate committee that oversees the post office , believes the agency is taking the wrong approach . she says service cuts will only push more consumers to online bill payment or private carriers such as ups or fedex , leading to lower revenue in the future . ` time and time again in the face of more red ink , the postal service puts forward ideas that could well accelerate its death spiral , ' she said , urging passage of a bill that would refund nearly $ 7billion the postal service overpaid into a federal retirement fund , encourage a restructuring of health benefits and reduce the agency 's annual payments into a retiree health account . that measure would postpone a move to five-day-a-week mail delivery for at least two years and require additional layers of review before the agency closed postal branches and mail processing centres . ` the solution to the postal service 's financial crisis is not easy but must involve tackling more significant expenses that do not drive customers , ' miss collins said . in the event of a shutdown due to bankruptcy , private companies such as fedex and ups could handle a small portion of the material the post office moves , but they do not go everywhere . no business has shown interest in delivering letters everywhere in the country for a set rate of 44 cents or 45 cents for a first-class letter .", "summary": " post office set to close 250 of nearly 500 mail processing centres as early as march .   usps would also lower delivery standards in place since 1971 .   roughly 100,000 postal workers could lose their jobs , saving usps around $ 6.5 b .   agency says it must cut $ 20b by 2015 to be profitable .   small-town mayors and legislators in states including illinois , missouri , ohio and pennsylvania cited the economic harm if postal offices were to close , eliminating jobs and reducing service . small-business owners in many other states also were worried .   espn the magazine and crain communications , which prints some 27 trade and consumer publications , said delays to first-class delivery could ruin the value of their news . their magazines are typically printed at week 's end with mail arrival timed for weekend sports events or the monday start of the work week . newspapers , already struggling in the internet age , also could suffer .   at&t , which mails approximately 55million customer billing statements each month , wants assurances that the postal service will widely publicize and educate the public about changes to avoid confusion over delivery that might lead to delinquent payments . the company is also concerned that after extensive cuts the postal service might realize it can not meet a relaxed standard of two-to-three day delivery .   netflix , which offers monthly pricing plans for unlimited dvds by mail , sent one disc or two at a time . longer delivery times would mean fewer opportunities to receive discs each month , effectively a price increase . netflix in recent months has been vigorously promoting its video streaming service as an alternative .
