{"text": "princeton , new jersey the republicans have an authenticity problem . after many decades of enjoying huge political power , elected officials are struggling to energize voters about the party 's brand name . even the troubles faced by president barack obama do n't seem to help . the recent interest in governors such as new jersey 's chris christie or national politicians who are relatively new to washington , such as sen. rand paul or sen. marco rubio , reflects a thirst in the electorate to find republicans who will stand for something and mean what they say . according to the new york times , the koch brothers are pouring money into rebuilding the party around candidates who stand for their libertarian ideals . the challenge that republicans face is captured in a new pilot airing on amazon instant video ,  alpha house ,  written by doonesbury creator garry trudeau and starring john goodman . the comedy focuses on the life of a group of four gop senators who room together on capitol hill in what the producers call a  man cave .  the pilot shows republicans in washington who are essentially faking it , putting on theater for constituents despite what they really believe . the show begins with one of the senators , played by bill murray , oversleeping on the morning he was supposed to turn himself in to the department of justice for some kind of unspecified wrongdoing . one of the senators , a closeted homosexual , tries to bolster his heterosexual credentials by castigating gay marriage in front of a conservative group and trying to learn to shoot a gun for a possible photo op . goodman plays a south carolina senator who is grudgingly forced to campaign in his state even though he has little interest in dealing with voters . the parody , with an admittedly liberal slant , conveys the essential dilemma that the party faces : the growing skepticism about a number of arguments that the gop continues to make about itself . the party of fiscal restraint : republicans claim to be the party of fiscal responsibility , the people who will balance the budget and constrain the budget in contrast to the reckless democrats . yet the gop now has a long history of running up the deficit . when republicans are presidents , spending has continued to rise and deficits have gone up . the presidency of george w. bush burst any illusion that republicans would maintain a tight fiscal order . bush inherited surpluses from president bill clinton but as a result of the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 , combined with military and domestic spending , he turned them into a deficit . even with all the rhetoric coming out of congress today about republicans who desire to control spending , a close look at the plans of individuals such as congressman paul ryan shows that deficits would remain alive and well if their policies went into effect . the party of outsiders : this has been a favorite trope for the gop , with republicans still acting as if they live in an era dominated by the democrats . but nothing can be further from the truth . republicans have enjoyed a strong run in the white house since richard nixon 's victory in 1968 and they have maintained control of congress for much of the period since 1994 . during this time , republicans have formed close connections with the k street lobbying community and become accustomed to the benefits of pork barrel spending . goodman 's character reflects an image that too many , on the right and left , have of republican elected officials . belying the notion that they are not part of life inside the beltway , republicans have also been implicated in many scandals involving the abuse of power , such as all the politicians who fell as a result of their connection to the lobbyist jack abramoff in 2006 , making it difficult for many americans to hear republicans blast away at the very washington in which its members thrive . the party of morality : this remains a chestnut for many republicans who want to appeal to notions of social and cultural conservatism . although this position has come under fire as out of touch with where many americans are on issues such as gender rights and gay rights , the party 's leaders are generally standing firm . yet scandals in recent decades have rocked the image of the party . in south carolina , former gov. mark sanford 's congressional campaign has stumbled as voters were reminded of the affair that brought him down from power . the party of national security : this was one of the most important claims for the party since world war ii . the republicans had made significant political gains , arguing that they were better equipped to handle national security than the democrats . they used this argument to devastate their opponents . but the memory of the war in iraq under president george w. bush continues to haunt the party . the recent opening of bush 's presidential library brought up memories of the controversy , as does the current debate over whether to send arms to syrian rebels following evidence that the government used weapons of mass destruction . the deployment of military resources based on faulty intelligence and the enormous failures of the post-reconstruction period in iraq have put republicans on the defensive . the party of opportunity : republicans have always argued that their policies would offer the greatest opportunities to the largest number of americans . through trickle down economics and the expansion of markets , republicans said , all americans would gradually prosper . yet many of the party 's economic policies have proved to benefit a small portion of the population , bolstering critics who claim that the gop does not support the middle class . when 2012 gop presidential nominee mitt romney was secretly taped talking about 47 % of the nation consisting of people who did n't pay taxes , he perpetuated this image , which was damaging to his campaign . for many voters , the rhetoric of the gop does not reflect the recent history of the party . until republicans put forth more compelling ideas and offering politicians who stand for something , they will have trouble regaining strength . until they do , shows such as  alpha house  will continue to ring true . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of julian zelizer .", "summary": " a pilot show ,  alpha house ,  depicts gop senators in unflattering light .   julian zelizer says show makes republicans out to be hypocrites .   he says the party is perceived to lack authenticity in pushing conservative values .   zelizer : gop has n't shown it is party of fiscal restraint , national security , morality .
