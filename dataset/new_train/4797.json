{"text": "more than half of the ballot boxes from last weekend 's mexican presidential election -- 54.5 % -- will be individually recounted , the executive secretary of mexico 's federal election institute said wednesday . that represents 78,012 ballot boxes , edmundo jacobo molina told reporters . the political parties will supervise , review and watch over the recount , which will be carried out by the election institute , he said . the announcement came as the official ballot count in mexico 's presidential elections began wednesday and as the presumptive president-elect sought to consolidate his reported victory even as a challenger refused to concede . enrique peña nieto received the most votes , according to preliminary results released the night of sunday 's balloting , and according to a quick count released by the election institute , known by its spanish acronym ife . the quick count gave peña nieto a margin of victory of between 6.07 and 7.65 percentage points . but andres manuel lopez obrador , the candidate for a progressive coalition , has said he has evidence of irregularities at most of the 143,000 polling stations and wants a full recount . lopez obrador demands recount in mexican election vote . lopez obrador made a similar demand after losing in 2006 to felipe calderon . the process that started wednesday is intended to check all election returns recorded in each district and can carry out recounts in certain cases . ife predicted a final count on sunday . officials have called this election the most transparent in mexico 's history . it was the first election in which scanned copies of district-by-district election returns were posted on the internet . but accusations have arisen of electoral manipulation by peña nieto 's party -- the institutional revolutionary party , or pri . the party , which was in power for 71 years before being voted out in 2000 , was known for being corrupt and authoritarian . its apparent victory last weekend would mark a triumphant return after 12 years of rule by the right-wing national action party , known by the acronym pan . but supporters of lopez obrador accused the pri of having returned to its old ways of corruption . political tensions flare after mexican presidential vote . daniel avila , a representative for the anti-peña nieto student movement #yosoy132 -lrb- i am 132 -rrb- , told cnn en español that his group had already received 1,100 allegations of vote-buying , stuffed ballot boxes and intimidation . the group has photos , video and audio proof of these violations , the group said .  what we 're going to try to do is find all these people to get testimonies , and then take that evidence to the ife ,  avila said . lopez obrador supporters pointed to long lines that were reported at the soriana chain of supermarkets . voters flocked to the stores to use gift cards handed out by the pri in exchange for votes , some allege . calls to pri offices were not returned . mexican election regulators said they were investigating the allegations related to the gift cards . the electoral authorities should question the owners of the chain , said irma erendira sandoval , a political analyst at the national autonomous university of mexico . wednesday 's count will help determine whether there was fraud , she said .  this is a fundamental stage where the transparency and cleanliness of the entire election is at stake ,  she told cnn en español . according to the group alianza civica -lrb- civic alliance -rrb- , which seeks to ensure elections are free and fair , a poll of mexican voters found that nearly 30 % reported being exposed to at least one example of vote-buying or coercion . taking advantage of the fact that election returns are available online , critics began circulating copies of what they described as suspicious returns . one such document shared by pri opponents is an electoral return from a district in michoacan . it appears to show that 362 of 732 registered voters cast ballots , but that the pri won 945 votes . for his part , peña nieto , in an interview with  newshour  on pbs , praised mexico 's democratic system and said he was putting his trust in the electoral authorities .  we have electoral tribunals that will be responsible for addressing these issues and attending to these complaints , the ones filed by candidate lopez obrador ,  he said . ballots will be recounted in cases where the difference between the top two finishers is 1 percentage point or less ; where the number of annulled votes is greater than the difference between the top two ; where all the votes go to one party ; and where there are obvious irregularities such as the votes not adding up . lopez obrador must wait until sunday to formally submit any application for a recount to the federal election tribunal . avila , the youth activist , acknowledged that peña nieto will likely be confirmed as president , but contended that that was because of pri 's alleged maneuverings .  the amount of evidence we present does not matter . it is a fact that enrique peña nieto will remain ,  he said .  we have had a position since before the election that this was being imposed by fraud , and it 's what we 've been seeing .  opinion : is peña nieto good news for mexico ?", "summary": " the political parties will supervise , review and watch over the recount , ife chief says .   the official ballot count began wednesday .   preliminary results give victory to pri 's peña nieto .
