{"text": "military-style ` boot camps ' are a byword for the extreme fitness regimens that celebrities and the public alike flock to in an effort to shed their wobbly bits . but for all their assault courses , quick marches and rigorous fitness standards , it appears that britain 's soldiers are facing the same obesity crisis as the rest of the country . scores of soldiers have been booted out of the british army because they are too fat to fight and hundreds more have been branded unfit , raising fears over their ability to defend out country . not for fatties : officer recruits make their way around a sandhurst assault course . at least 50 soldiers have been booted out of the army in a decade for being obese , while hundreds more have failed fitness tests . tam fry , a board member of the national obesity forum , described the latest findings ` deeply worrying ' . figures gleaned from the ministry of defence thanks to freedom of information laws show at least 50 extreme cases where soldiers have been discharged because of obesity between the start of 2002 and march 31 last year . there are concerns the true figure could be even higher , after defence chiefs refused to reveal the data for the past 14 months . a spokesman said the latest information on those released on medical grounds would be made public next month . according to the available data , in 2011 alone 13 soldiers were let go after obesity contributed to their poor health . the figures were published just months after it was revealed scotland 's super regiment is blighted by unfit soldiers . tired : a ministry of defence spokesman said it is a condition of service that all solders are healthy and fitter than the general public . troops serving with the royal regiment of scotland have failed fitness tests 630 times in the past three years . the royal highland fusiliers were the worst , with soldiers failing tests involving timed runs , press-ups and sit-ups , 170 times . the black watch were the next worst affected , with soldiers failing the two-minute tests 120 times . the mod says troops who fail are told to take more physical training . only in extreme cases does failure result in discharge from the army . mr fry said he feared british troops were facing the same problems as the u.s. military . there , nearly half of all soldiers on active duty are overweight - and 19 per cent obese - according to an official report published last year . he said : ` it should be as concerning to the taxpayer as to the military that british personnel are being discharged because of obesity . ` after news earlier this year that troops of the royal regiment of scotland were branded too unfit to fight the latest discharge figures are deeply worrying . ` the forces have every opportunity to keep their men and women in shape - that 's what boot camps are for - but they appear no better than civilian governments in maintaining their population 's fitness . ` it should be no comfort to us either that , from figures released this month , the same problem confronts the us military . ` in washington generals are dubbing the crisis a national emergency . ' an mod spokesman said it is a condition of service all solders are healthy and fitter than the general public . she said : ` overall obesity levels within the army are consistently lower than in civilian life . all individuals are assessed on their ability to carry out military activities rather than on their weight . '", "summary": " at least 50 soldiers discharged in a decade for being obese .   hundreds more have failed fitness tests and been told to train harder .   crisis matches similar problems seen in the u.s. military .   mod have held back the most recent data until next month .
