{"text": "dozens of australian babies are infected by a virus that has no cure , doctors say . professor theo sloots says 46 babies are currently infected with parechovirus , which has spread to queensland . at least 11 cases have been confirmed in the state since december . ` the outbreak is australia-wide now and we believe there are at least four types of the virus , ' the queensland paediatric infectious diseases -lrb- qpid -rrb- laboratory director told reporters in brisbane . dozens of australian babies have become infected with an incurable virus . ` we do n't know what type is in queensland compared to other states . ' parechovirus is a respiratory and intestinal disease that causes fever , irritability , rash and diarrhoea . severe cases can develop into hepatitis or encephalitis , and can also cause seizures . qpid associate professor michael nissen said the virus infected mainly infants , but no one was sure where it came from , how often it occurred or how to fight it . ` this virus does not respond to common antibiotics , ' he said . but prof nissen said humans must have been able to fight it because it has been around for a long time - doctors just were not able to detect it . the qpid laboratory has recently developed a test to identify the virus in patients within a day . doctors say outbreaks have already occurred at two brisbane hospitals , as well as other parts of the country . ` it is important to diagnose the infection early and distinguish it from other possible causes , ' prof nissen said . the next natural step would be developing a vaccine , but he said until then the best way for parents to avoid parechovirus was good hygiene around babies . this included washing hands after going to the toilet , before eating , after wiping noses and after changing nappies . ` it 's really common-sense stuff , ' prof nissen said . according to the abc , the first case in queensland was reported in the northern city of bundaberg . dr leisha callaghan from brisbane 's royal children 's hospital told the publication they have already experienced outbreaks at two major brisbane hospitals . ` viruses overall are generally often milder infections than bacterial infections , but this one can be pretty nasty , ' she said . doctors are looking to develop a vaccine but there is not much known about the long-term effects of the virus . ` but certainly when little babies contract the virus they are very sick when they present , ' dr callaghan said . ` there 's the risk of death and certainly long-term morbidity , with the possibility of significant brain damage .
