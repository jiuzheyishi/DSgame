{"text": "it 's a truth of warfare in the digital era : bullets and bombs often are augmented by status updates and tweets . the bloody conflict taking place in iraq is no different . and islamic state of iraq and syria , or isis , a terror group so extreme that al qaeda has denounced it , is taking the lead with a social media propaganda war the likes of which has never been seen . from recruiting fighters to spreading word of their violent attacks , isis is taking to the web in what analysts say is a more sophisticated manner than previous combatants . perhaps as a result , iraqis have been reporting widespread outages of social sites , a common refrain during recent unrest in the middle east and elsewhere . cnn 's nick paton-walsh in turkey interviewed a defector from isis who said he used to recruit westerners for the cause through direct messages on twitter . opinion : will isis brutality backfire ?  there was special treatment for the europeans . one british guy said he was called ibrahim , then told me he was from manchester ,  said the man , who said he left the movement after it killed two of his relatives .  one asked my boss if he should fight in his own country or come to syria . he was told , ` if god does n't give you martyrdom in syria , ' then he could wage war in his own country .  the man , now in hiding , said he was part of a team that ran an online chat welcoming new recruits to isis .  there are things i am allowed to answer and things i must ask my supervisor about ,  he said .  specific questions about religion -- i have to get their permission to message anyone . i ca n't talk on skype . everything is written down so they can monitor everything .  as the islamist group 's fight has moved from syria to iraq , that savvy web strategy has expanded to include online video posts much slicker than the grainy , shaky clips that have popped up from al qaeda and other terror groups . recently , a slickly produced , hourlong isis video titled  the clanging of the swords  surfaced , showcasing killings , roadside bombings and other acts of terror for which isis claimed credit . the video vividly displays these scenes in a style reminiscent of hollywood efforts like  the hurt locker  and  zero dark thirty ,  complete with elaborate aerial shots .  this is funded ,  said nadia oweidat , a middle east analyst .  this is geopolitics . there is money behind it . it 's not just idiots ; these idiots have somebody controlling them and providing them with equipment that is very expensive . you ca n't just get it in a cave .  on another front , at least one analyst says isis was recently using a mobile app made available in google 's play store to inflate its presence on social media . called the dawn of glad tidings , or just dawn , the app was promoted as a way to keep up to date with news from isis . according to j.m. berger , editor of national-security blog intelwire , the dawn app would post updates to users ' twitter feeds . by midafternoon tuesday , google appeared to have removed the app from its store . google did not immediately reply to a message seeking comment for this story . with the digital assault accompanying a ground offensive that saw isis fighting tuesday just 40 miles north of baghdad in the city of baquba , access to social media has been disappearing across much of iraq . there has been no confirmation that the iraqi government is behind a blackout . but both facebook and twitter have reported a precipitous drop in the number of people in iraq using their products in the past few days .  users in #iraq are reporting issues accessing our service . we 're investigating their reports and we hope service will be restored quickly ,  twitter said on its global policy team 's account friday . facebook has issued a similar statement .  we are disturbed by reports of access issues in iraq and are investigating . limiting access to internet services -- essential for communication and commerce for millions of people -- is a matter of concern for the global community ,  read a facebook statement sent to cnn . facebook 's internal numbers show that , since june 12 , the volume of visits to its site and apps were as low as 30 % of their normal volume in iraq . there are no technical problems on its end , facebook said . web software firm akamai reports that visits to twitter in iraq dramatically plummeted early saturday . a twitter spokesman said its internal traffic reports mirror akamai 's . iraqis have increasingly turned to whisper , a mobile app that lets users post anonymous images , in an apparent effort to get around the social-media issues . neetzan zimmerman , whisper 's editor in chief , told cnnmoney that whisper usage in iraq more than doubled between june 12 and june 15 . during arab spring uprisings in places like egypt and iran , as well as more recent conflicts in places like syria , unrest has been met with internet outages and the blocking of social media sites . in virtually all cases , the opposition has accused sitting governments , who control their nation 's internet infrastructure , of blocking access to make coordination more difficult and keep news of the conflicts from spreading . maps : crisis in iraq .", "summary": " a well-orchestrated social media war is accompanying fighting in iraq .   islamic state of iraq and syria recruits terror fighters on twitter .   online videos showing group 's attacks are glossy , high-quality .   google appears to have banned app used by isis to spread news .
