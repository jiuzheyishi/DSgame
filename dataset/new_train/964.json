{"text": "brainwave-controlled robot radiation suits could be used to protect engineers working in the disaster zone around the crippled fukushima nuclear plant . researchers in japan showed of the latest incarnation of hal - hybrid assistive limb - a full-body suit that allows wearers to don heavy radiation protection without feeling the burden . hal -- coincidentally the name of the evil supercomputer in stanley kubrick 's 2001 : a space odyssey -- has a network of sensors that monitor the electric signals coming from the wearer 's brain . it uses these to activate the robot 's limbs in concert with the worker 's , taking weight off his or her muscles . poised : hal on display at the japan robot week exhibition yesterday . the new type of robot suits are to be used by workers at nuclear disaster sites and will be field tested at tepco 's fukushima power plant . yoshiyuki sankai , professor of engineering at the university of tsukuba , said this means the 130lb -lrb- 60kg -rrb- tungsten vest workers at fukushima have to wear is almost unnoticeable . he said the outer layer of the robot suit also blocks radiation , while fans inside it circulate air to keep the wearer cool , and a computer can monitor their heart-rate and breathing for signs of fatigue . the robot is manufactured terminator in the 1984 film of the same name . hal . was on display yesterday as part of japan robot week , which also featured small . robots that run on caterpillar tracks designed to move across difficult . terrain and gather information in places where it is not safe for . humans . strong : hal picks up on traces of nerve signals to move in concert with its user , enabling him or her to carry heavy objects more easily , left . right , yoshiyuki sankai , cyberdyne president , shows off the pioneering suit . cyberdyne have developed the technology for a range of purposes , including also as an assistive device for disabled people . the company described the suit as a ` cyborg-type ' robot that can supplement , expand or improve physical ability . hal works by scanning the user 's skin to detect very weak traces of nerve signals sent by the brain to the muscles via motorneurons . based on the signals it receives , the device moves its joints in unison with wearers ' muscle movements , supporting their daily activities . nuclear disaster zone : the rubble of the fukushima dai-ichi nuclear power plant pictured shortly after the earthquake , tsunami and subsequent meltdown that crippled it last year . size . weight . power . continuous operating time . motions . working environment . inventor eiji koyanagi of the chiba institute of technology said the devices could be deployed very close to the damaged reactor core at fukushima . ` we have to think of ways to protect nuclear workers , otherwise fukushima wo n't be sorted out , ' he said . a huge tsunami in march 2011 smashed into the power plant , sparking meltdowns that forced the evacuation of a huge area of northeastern japan . the decommissioning of the crippled plant is expected to take several decades .", "summary": " hal detects traces of nerve signals to move in concert with its user .   strength-multiplying technology can make heavy gear almost unnoticeable .   unveiled at japan robot week yesterday .
