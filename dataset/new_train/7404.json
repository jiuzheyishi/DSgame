{"text": "updated : . 08:07 est , 20 may 2012 . scotland 's justice secretary told the lockerbie bomber to drop his appeal to smooth the way for him to be released on compassionate grounds , it was claimed today . kenny macaskill allegedly told abdelbaset al-megrahi indirectly that he would be let out of jail in 2009 if he dropped his court case after he was given just three months to live . shortly before the official announcement al-megrahi did mysteriously abandon the appeal against his conviction - even though he was under no legal obligation to do so . the bomber , who has terminal prostate cancer , is still alive in libya two-and-a-half years after his release , to the embarrassment of the scottish government . the scottish government has denied claims that justice secretary kenny macaskill , pictured left , suggested that abdelbaset al-megrahi , pictured at a tripoli hospital in december 2009 , drop his appeal against his conviction to smooth the way for being released on compassionate grounds because of his prostate cancer . copies of megrahi : you are my jury , which contains exclusive interviews with the convicted lockerbie bomber , at the book launch in edinburgh today . the allegations - strongly denied by the scottish government - appeared in a new book published today about the release entitled megrahi : you are my jury . it claims abdelbaset al-megrahi was the ` innocent victim of dirty politics , a flawed investigation and judicial folly ' . al-megrahi is the only person to ever be convicted of the bombing of a pam am flight on december 21 , 1988 , which killed 270 people when it crashed in lockerbie , scotland . he repeatedly proclaimed his innocence and launched several appeals against his conviction . however , he abandoned the case just days before mr macaskill announced he would be released from jail . abdelbaset al megrahi on his sick bed at his home in tripoli , libya , speaking exclusively about his compassionate release and the lockerbie case . an undated court photo of abdelbaset ali mohmed al megrahi , before he was diagnosed with prostate cancer . the new book claims that mr macaskill met a delegation of libyan officials ten days before announcing his decision to release megrahi , including foreign minister abdulati al-obedi . al-megrahi , now 59 , claims in the new title : ` after the meeting , the libyan delegation came to the prison to visit me . ` obedi said that , towards the end of the meeting , macaskill had asked to speak to him in private . ` once the others had withdrawn , he stated that macaskill gave him to understand that it would be easier to grant compassionate release if i dropped my appeal . ` he said he was not demanding that i do so , but the message seemed to me clear . ' i was legally entitled to continue the appeal , but i could not risk doing so . it meant abandoning my quest for justice . ' a scottish government spokesman branded the book , published today , as ` third-hand hearsay ' . he stated : ` we can say categorically that neither the scottish government had any involvement of any kind in mr al-megrahi dropping his appeal , or indeed any interest in it . ` that was entirely a matter for mr al-megrahi and his legal team . ' the book 's author john ashton , who spent three years as a researcher with megrahi 's legal team , also recounts a report in the herald newspaper four days before the meeting citing ' a growing expectation he would be encouraged to first drop legal proceedings ' . mr ashton stated : ` the source of this information was not stated , but it seems likely that it was someone within the justice department .

' the msp added : ` these are very serious allegations . if these reports are true , then kenny macaskill will have knowingly misled parliament . it is only proper that he comes before parliament as a matter of urgency to spell out exactly what happened at greenock prison and in the alleged private meetings with col gaddafi 's ministers . ` the families of the victims deserve to know whether this secret meeting took place , and if so , exactly what was discussed . ' scottish rescue workers and crash investigators search the area around the cockpit of pan am flight 103 in a farmer 's field east of lockerbie , scotland , on december 23 , 1988 . bringing out the dead : one of the 270 victims is carried away from the wreckage of the bombing of flight 103 that exploded over lockerbie on december 21 , 1988 . scottish lib dem leader willie rennie said : ` it is important that the justice secretary answers serious questions . ' today a spokesman for david cameron said that the lockerbie bomber should never have been released . he said : ` this is yet another reminder that alex salmond 's government 's decision to free the uk 's greatest mass murderer was wrong . ` writing a book three years after he was released is an insult to the families of the 270 people who were murdered . ' but speaking at the launch of the book in edinburgh this morning , mr ashton described these comments as ` outrageous ' . he said : ` the prime minister knows nothing about this case . he should read the book , and if he read the book he would know that this conviction was not safe . ' i think it is pretty outrageous that he would comment on something that he knows nothing about .
