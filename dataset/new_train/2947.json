{"text": "moscow , russia young women in bright miniskirts and high heels line up to sell themselves in the dingy back streets throughout the russian capital . moscow 's illegal flesh markets are flourishing , with up to 30 women at each pickup point , or tochka , standing in order of price for the night . russian police acknowledge that human trafficking for sexual exploitation is a major problem . customers light up the lines with their car headlights and are asked to pay between $ 100 and $ 700 for a woman . aid workers for groups fighting for women 's rights say moscow is witnessing a surge in prostitution , including forced prostitution , as a result of russia 's booming economy . they say thousands of young women are made to work as sex slaves on the city 's streets , unable to escape from the ruthless and violent criminal gangs who traffic them . watch moscow 's thriving sex trade   it 's because of the economic boom they are brought here ,  said afsona kadyrova of the angel coalition aid agency , which rehabilitates trafficked women and children .  the fast pace of development in moscow has fueled demand for a range of cheap workers , including prostitutes .  to investigate the thriving trade , cnn went undercover posing as potential customers and gained access to speak directly to the prostitutes and their pimps .  take your pick from any of the girls ,  the female organizer said at one location , lines of women all around .  the expensive ones are on the right , for $ 600 and $ 700 a night . the women on the left are $ 100 .  aid agencies say many of the women working here are tricked into coming to moscow on the promise of an education or a good job . they say others are simply kidnapped from their hometowns and forced to work as prostitutes in moscow . watch one woman describe how her uncle duped her into prostitution  russian police acknowledge that human trafficking for sexual exploitation is a major problem , saying they do what they can to fight it by raiding brothels suspected of forced prostitution and arresting gang members who run them . but the problem , they say , lies elsewhere .  first of all , we have virtually open borders , and badly controlled migration flows from nearby countries ,  said alexander krasnov of russia 's interior ministry police .  secondly , we still do n't have a basic law that defines victims ' rights . at the moment , it 's mostly aid agencies that deal with it .  aid agencies say they are handling a growing number of deeply traumatized victims rescued from brothels and pimps in the moscow area . one u.n. organization , the international organization for migration , recently opened a treatment and rehabilitation center to cope with the large numbers of sexually exploited and trafficked women who come for help . at this center , christine , a 27-year-old nigerian woman , tells how she acquired a painful 4-inch scar across her right cheek . she says she was lured to russia from nigeria four years ago by her uncle . he promised to give her a college education , she says . but instead , she says , he sent her to a moscow brothel . he told her  the kind of job i 'm going to be doing is prostitution .   i ask him , ` why prostitution ? why not another job to pay the money ? ' he says i did n't speak the language . i can not do any other job .  she added ,  it made me feel very bad . i felt that i 'm not going to do it over my dead body .  but when she tried to run away , her uncle cut her face , says christine , who asked that her last name not be used .  he made me know that if i do n't cooperate with him , something bad will happen to me -- that if i made an attempt to run away , it would end in taking my life . so i was really scared about that ,  she said . aid workers say russia has become a prime destination for trafficked women from africa , the far east and former soviet states . there are no exact figures , but aid agencies estimate that thousands of trafficked women are on moscow 's streets .  before , it was just a country of origin for europe and the u.s. and elsewhere in the world ,  kadyrova said .  but right now , we see that russia has become a destination country also .  according to the group 's web site , human traffickers  prey on the dreams of impoverished women seeking employment and opportunities for the future .  most women are young and single with little education ; some are orphans and college students ; others are married with children .  all of them are lured by advertising images of a beautiful life beyond the borders of their homelands -- making them easy prey to the thousands of traffickers advertising in newspapers , on radio , television , in the metro and on the streets for wonderful work abroad with no experience necessary ,  the group says . for millions , russia 's new economic prosperity has been a blessing . but for those caught up in the sex trade , it 's a curse . christine managed to escape after meeting a woman from a church who helped her .  i was crying all the time , telling her , ' i do n't want this kind of job , '  she said .", "summary": " aid groups say booming economy has fueled demand for prostitutes in moscow .   nigerian woman forced into prostitution says her uncle lured her to moscow .    he made me know that if i do n't cooperate ... it would end in taking my life    russian police admit human trafficking for sexual exploitation is a major problem .
