{"text": "most of the new pieces of gold and silver unearthed in the field where the staffordshire hoard was found three years ago has been declared treasure trove . the 81 items , which date back to the 7th century , will now be handed to the british museum 's valuation committee , which will value them , an inquest in stafford was told . staffordshire county council will then be charged with raising the money to buy the new items for the nation . unearthed : most of a collection of new items , including this helmet , has been declared treasure trove . around 90 new pieces of gold and silver were found near where the staffordshire hoard was found in 2009 . eighty-one of the items were declared treasure trove . they include part of a helmet , an eagle and a cross . if the money is raised , the pieces are likely to be displayed in museums alongside the original staffordshire hoard , which was found in a field near lichfield in 2009 by metal detectorist terry herbert . mr herbert and landowner and local farmer fred johnson will divide any proceeds from the sale of the new find in the same way they did with the original hoard . the second haul was discovered by a team from archaeology warwickshire . but mr herbert and mr johnson will benefit because they were were behind the original discovery , the coroner said . the original hoard , which contained 3,900 items , was bought for # 3.3 million with the help of public donations and has since been seen by tens of thousands of people . original find : this strip of gold bearing a latin biblical inscription was part of the original staffordshire hoard found in 2009 by terry herbert . the new find is only expected to cost a fraction of that figure . evidence was given in the coroner 's court by dr kevin leahy , an archaeological finds specialist who catalogued the original hoard and the new items , and principal archaeologist for staffordshire stephen dean . mr dean said the new finds were ` closely related ' to the original contents of the staffordshire hoard . he said : ` it all fits very tightly with the staffordshire hoard . ' he described how a team of archaeologists returned to the field in november last year and in two phases recovered the pieces from the ground , including gold and silver items , hilt rivets and pommel caps from swords and small fragments of metal discs , made of either copper alloy or base silver . the most interesting finds included an eagle mount - whose use is not known - and a cheek piece from a helmet . if enough money is raised , the new discoveries will go on display in museums with the original staffordhire hoard -lrb- pictured -rrb- . mr haigh asked mr dean why these pieces had not been found with the main hoard three years earlier . he said : ` it is thought a lot of ploughing has brought material up , but i think we are now in the diminishing returns . ` in 2009 , we uncovered 3,900 items and now this time 90 items - i believe we have now recovered everything in the topsoil . ' dr leahy agreed there was little chance of any more finds coming from the field . he was asked to comment on three items which were eventually ruled not be treasure , because they were all found some distance from the staffordshire hoard site . dr leahy said one of those pieces - a metal fragment with a stylised design - was similar to a piece found at the sutton hoo excavation in suffolk and was of ` high status ' . dr leahy said that the finds had ` roused the public 's interest ' in a period of history which had until recently been considered the dark ages . the discovery , circled in red , was made in the same field where the staffordshire hoard , the largest collection of anglo saxon treasure was recovered in 2009 . he said : ` this is a period which runs for twice that of the roman period , and which shows anglo-saxons were highly cultured . ' some of the gold in the pieces from the original staffordshire hoard could be traced to istanbul in modern-day turkey , and the gems to india and eastern europe , showing the anglo-saxons to be accomplished traders . at the end of the hearing , mr haigh ruled 10 of the total of 91 items discovered in phased investigations starting on november 19 , 2012 , were not to be considered treasure because they were modern ` waste ' material . these items will all be returned to the owner and finder . mr haigh concluded : ` the staffordshire hoard was a magnificent find and i very much hope these items can be saved for the nation and added to the hoard . ' philip atkins , staffordshire county council leader , said the council together with the owners of the original hoard , stoke-on-trent and birmingham city councils , would now have to look at raising money to buy the new items . he said : ` i am hopeful the public will step in as they did previously . ` we did have to raise # 3.3 million in 12 weeks last time , and on that occasion the public came forward with nearly # 1 million . ` i think there will be the same hunger this time around .
