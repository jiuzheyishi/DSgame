{"text": "washington for political junkies , 2013 was expected to be a quiet year following the presidential election and it basically followed the script . nonetheless , there were some interesting developments at the ballot box . new jersey , as expected , returned gov. chris christie to office and also sent cory booker to the u.s. senate . bill de blasio became the first democrat elected new york city mayor in two decades , and democrats , led by terry mcauliffe , swept the top three executive offices in virginia for the first time in recent memory . were these outcomes isolated or do they mean anything for 2014 , when candidates will heat up the campaign trail big time ahead of next november 's congressional midterms and key gubernatorial elections ? in the new year , 435 house seats are up as are 35 in the senate . there will be 36 gubernatorial races as well . most of these campaigns wo n't be nail biters , but there could be collective power shifts in washington and in state houses . here , cnn politics focuses on the senate , where republicans aim to retake control . republicans must pick up six seats to claim the majority and key races are wide open at this point . the top 12 campaign questions of 2014 . five key races : . kentucky . the incumbent is senate minority leader mitch mcconnell , who is under pressure from two fronts : democrats , naturally , and from a tea party challenger within his own republican party who says he 's not conservative enough . while mcconnell is likely to defeat his primary opponent , matt bevin , he is expending money and other resources he 'd rather use in a general election campaign against kentucky secretary of state alison lundergan grimes . the kentucky race is likely to be one of the most expensive nationally . as a leader of the gop , mcconnell has access to major donors and party members do n't like to see their leaders lose . democrats want mcconnell out and are investing heavily , too . 2014 : the year of the blame game in washington . alaska . sarah palin put alaska politics on the national map in 2008 but her republican party lost a senate seat that year . democratic incumbent mark begich is running again , but the gop sees the seat as winnable . begich is n't unpopular but a democratic senator in the reliably red state is just about as rare as a 70-degree winter day in nome . the gop aims to demonstrate that begich 's election was a fluke and not the start of a trend , and he is fully aware that the road to reelection will be tough . he is already trying to dissociate himself from the democratic party with the self-defining tagline :  as independent as alaska .  begich is also distancing himself from president barack obama , who 's struggling in polls , and the affordable care act , the president 's health care reforms that are unpopular with republicans . three republicans are vying for the chance to take on begich : lt. gov. mead treadwell , dan sullivan , a former state official , and joe miller , who sought to unseat alaska 's other senator , lisa murkowski , in 2010 . she lost to him in the republican primary but prevailed as an independent in the general election . louisiana . for sen. mary landrieu , it 's deja vu . as a democrat in an increasingly red state , landrieu narrowly won her 1996 , 2002 and 2008 elections , and her 2014 bid should be just as challenging . republicans are already hammering landrieu over the airwaves for her vote in favor of the affordable care act . but the candidate preferred by the gop establishment , rep. bill cassidy , must also contend with rob maness , a retired u.s. air force colonel , in a primary . maness is a tea party favorite .  this race has a long way to go , particularly since cassidy is n't well known outside his district , but it is safe to say that this may end up being the most difficult race of landrieu 's senate career ,  wrote jennifer duffy , senior editor at the non-partisan coook political report . in louisiana , all candidates run on a single  primary  ballot in november . if someone breaks the 50 % mark , there 's no general election . but if that threshold is not broken , the top two finishers head to a run-off in december . wyoming . wyoming 's senate seat should remain safely in gop hands in the general election , but an already very contentious contest for the republican nomination should keep the race in the spotlight for much of 2014 , since the primary 's not until august 19 . things got ugly immediately after liz cheney , the eldest daughter of former vice president dick cheney , announced in july that she would mount a primary challenge against three-term gop sen. mike enzi , who faced no republican opposition in his last re-election bid . both sides have attacked each , from claims of carpet bagging to whether the senator and the former vice president were actually fishing buddies . liz cheney even got into a very public squabble over same-sex marriage with her younger sister , who 's married to another woman . while polls indicate enzi is the front-runner , cheney has some advantages .  liz cheney does n't appear to be getting much traction against enzi , but she will be well-funded and enzi ca n't afford to take her for granted ,  cautioned duffy . while entertaining , wyoming 's primary race does n't appear to be following the typical grassroots vs. mainstream script .  wyoming is somewhat of a misfit race , not only because it is last on the calendar but the gop race between sen. mike enzi and liz cheney does n't fit neatly into the establishment vs. anti-establishment narrative . anyone with the last name of cheney is n't exactly a political outsider in a republican contest ,  writes nathan gonzales , deputy editor of the non-partisan rothenberg political report . georgia . the georgia senate seat up for grabs is held by a republican who decided not to seek reelection . that leaves a wide open battle for fresh faces . in a traditionally republican state , which mitt romney won by 7 points in 2012 , democrats are making a play in what cook political report sees as  one of the democrats ' few opportunities  to pick up a seat . the democratic candidate has never run for office before but her well-known family name could help her cause . michelle nunn , the daughter of former sen. sam nunn ,  has run a very strong campaign  for a first-time candidate duffy wrote . the republican side of the race is interesting as well with eight candidates battling to win the nomination . they include three sitting members of congress and a former georgia secretary of state . reps phil gingrey , jackson kingston and paul broun are all trying to outdo each other on the conservative side . a far-right platform could result in electoral success in the primary but make it more difficult for the nominee to beat nunn in the general election . the biggest campaign moments of 2013 . those are the five big ones , but there are some other races to watch , too . new hampshire : . democratic sen. jeanne shaheen , a former governor , appears as of now to be on the road to re-election in the granite state . but all eyes are on former republican sen. scott brown , who 's been flirting with a run . if brown does go , this contest would immediately land in the national political spotlight . brown represented massachusetts in the senate but lost his reelection bid in 2012 and his move to new hampshire is raising eyebrows . iowa : . longtime democratic sen. tom harkin 's retirement gives the gop a prime pickup opportunity in this midwestern swing state . but while democrats have rallied around four-term rep. bruce braley , the battle for the republican nomination is wide open among candidates without strong name recognition . arkansas and north carolina : . like begich and landrieu , democratic sens kay hagan of north carolina and mark pryor of arkansas face tough re-elections in republican friendly states . montana , west virginia , and south dakota : . the retirements of longtime sens max baucus of montana , jay rockefeller of west virginia , and tim johnson of south dakota could put democrats in a bind . all three states are considered red , and all , especially south dakota , present the gop with prime pickup opportunities . a white mayor for the ` chocolate city ' ?", "summary": " there are 435 house seats and 35 senate seats up in november midterms .   republicans must pick up six seats to win control of the senate .   additionally , there are 36 gubernatorial races , a number of them with national implications .   kentucky could be the most expensive race with senate minority leader mitch mcconnell up .
