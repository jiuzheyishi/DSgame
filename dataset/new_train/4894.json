{"text": "it sounds like advice offered by parents to teenagers on prom night : do n't do stupid stuff . but it also is an important guiding foreign policy principle of the president of the united states . ever since the president uttered the phrase during an off-the-record discussion with reporters earlier this year -- the actual words were a bit saltier and later confirmed privately by administration officials -- foreign policy critics have seized on  ddss  as a crystallization of the obama doctrine . former secretary of state hillary clinton is only the latest critic of the  ddss  comment , describing the remark in an interview with the atlantic magazine as too simplistic .  great nations need organizing principles , and ` do n't do stupid stuff ' is not an organizing principle ,  she said . clinton called obama on tuesday , to  make sure he knows that nothing she said was an attempt to attack him ,  her spokesman nick merrill said in a statement . the two will meet at a party hosted by democratic party adviser vernon jordan on martha 's vineyard on wednesday evening , after she holds a book signing on the island . in an interview with cnn , deputy national security adviser ben rhodes insisted that  ddss  is not the  entire foreign policy  of the obama administration . but he maintained the expression has substance .  it means think carefully before you get into military interventions ,  he said .  i think that 's a lesson of the last 10 years that the american people have internalized -- that we have to be very careful when it comes to the application of military force , that we 're not putting u.s. troops in harm 's way without a clear plan and limited objectives for that effort .  opinion : hillary clinton pummels obama 's foreign policy . rhodes said the president did not take the criticism from clinton personally .  i think their relationship is very resilient . they 've been through so much together ,  he said . what hand will al-maliki play in iraq . shaped by more than a decade of war . clinton 's apparent support for a more hawkish u.s. posture comes as obama 's foreign policy has absorbed withering criticism in recent weeks . but her potentially more interventionist approach carries its own set of risks , diplomatic and political analysts caution .  ` do n't do stupid stuff ' ought to be emblazoned on the foreheads of all future presidents and secretaries of state ,  said aaron david miller , a former state department adviser during both democratic and republican administrations . miller said  ddss  is less a doctrine than it is a presidential mission statement that is shaped by more than a decade of war .  stripped to its essence , after protecting the homeland , it should be u.s. foreign policy 's second commandment ,  he added .  i view that as a political summary ... much like ` it 's the economy , stupid , '  rep. adam schiff , d-california , said , comparing  ddss  to the middle-class battle cry coined by bill clinton strategist james carville during the 1992 presidential election . schiff said the former secretary of state 's comments do not reflect a political break from the president , arguing the perception of a conflict just makes  good copy .  opinion : clinton , obama both wrong . the president 's strategy on crises ranging from syria to iraq and ukraine offers a sharp contrast to republicans who  act first and think last ,  schiff said .  the risks of becoming fully entangled in iraq are tremendous ,  he added . the president 's cautious approach is nothing new . a line can be traced from  ddss  to the anti-iraq war speech he delivered as an illinois state senator in 2002 .  what i am opposed to is a dumb war . what i am opposed to is a rash war ,  obama said at the time . scars from 2008 primary still remain . it was that 2002 speech that endeared obama to the liberal base of the democratic party , in part because of then-sen . clinton 's support for the iraq war . the policy battle over iraq that later erupted between obama and clinton in their fight for the party 's nomination ultimately resulted in a democrat returning to the white house . but the divide left deep scars between the two camps that were still healing even as clinton unleashed her critique of obama 's worldview . that difficult history is why clinton 's comments to the atlantic 's jeffrey goldberg came as a shock to one senior democratic strategist , who spoke on condition of anonymity . specifically disturbing , the strategist said , was the former secretary of state 's insistence that obama 's lack of support for the syrian opposition gave rise to the isis militants in iraq .  why you 'd want to do that , i have no idea ,  the prominent , non-obama affiliated strategist said of clinton 's plea for more direct u.s. involvement in syria . citing the nation 's reluctance to plunge back into middle east conflicts , the strategist added ,  politically , obama 's right .  in a flashback to ' 08 , obamaworld lunged to the president 's defense tuesday , in a tweet that appeared to tweak clinton .  just to clarify : ` do n't do stupid stuff ' means stuff like occupying iraq in the first place , which was a tragically bad decision ,  former obama adviser david axelrod tweeted . better job communicating its strategy . still , even the president 's own advisers acknowledge that obama has had a difficult time clearly articulating his foreign policy doctrine . during his overseas trip to asia this year , obama used a baseball metaphor to explain his reluctance to intervene militarily against a variety of threats , including syrian president bashar al-assad , who crossed a  red line  set by the president barring chemical weapon use . that caution  avoids errors ,  obama said .  you hit singles , you hit doubles ; every once in a while , we may be able to hit a home run .  after much of washington pounced on the sports analogy , white house aides began plotting out a more thoughtful speech on american leadership that would be delivered at west point . before that address , rhodes conceded to the new york times that the administration could do a better job of communicating its strategy .  people are seeing the trees , but we 're not necessarily laying out the forest ,  rhodes said . obama told the cadets at west point the u.s. should be willing to intervene , but not overreach , acting alone only when necessary .  just because we have the best hammer does not mean that every problem is a nail ,  obama said , opting to switch metaphors . the apparent struggle to neatly encapsulate the president 's strategy is not lost on his critics .  i do think the administration is showing some signs of a little bit of fatigue ,  brookings institution analyst michael o'hanlon said in a recent interview with cnn .  it 's time for a little more ambition frankly because the world senses that this president is too disengaged ,  o'hanlon added . a now more ambitious obama is engaged in iraq , risking what his aides have long described as his post-bush legacy of  ending wars , not starting them .  as past presidents have learned in iraq , it is  easy to get in , hell to get out ,  schiff said .", "summary": " hillary clinton called obama 's guiding foreign policy principle too simplistic .   obama did n't take the former secretary of state 's criticism personally , an adviser says .   those within his inner circle admit the president has had problems articulating his policy .
