{"text": "the families of trayvon martin , michael brown , tamir rice , eric garner and other unarmed black men felled by bullets or police force filled a podium in the nation 's capital .  this is a history-making moment ,  said garner 's mother , gwen carr .  it 's just so overwhelming to see all who have come to stand with us . look at the masses -- black , white , all races , all religions . ... we need to stand like this at all times .  invoking the familiar names of black men who died at the hands of police , tens of thousands marched throughout the nation on saturday to protest what they see as rampant racial injustice . the throngs -- young and old , black and white -- took to the streets in major cities , including new york , washington , boston , san francisco and oakland , california . in washington , a crowd of thousands snaked up pennsylvania avenue to the capitol in a protest that evoked memories of past civil rights marches . the crowds appear to represent a burgeoning movement sparked by the decisions of grand juries in missouri and new york not to indict white police officers in the deaths of two unarmed black men . garner died in july when new york police officers on staten island wrestled him to the ground , with one of the officers wrapping his arm around garner 's neck . ` sea of people   what a sea of people ,  said lesley mcspadden , the mother of michael brown , who was fatally shot by a ferguson , missouri , officer in august .  if they do n't see this and make a change , then i do n't know what we got to do ,  thousands marched in boston , starting at the massachusetts state capitol . police arrested 23 people on disorderly conduct charges , according to the massachusetts state police . one man was charged with assault and battery on a police officer . from new york 's washington square park , thousands marched to police headquarters chanting  i ca n't breathe  -- garner 's last words -- and  how do you spell racist : nypd .  the march was largely peaceful , although a protester from a splinter group hurled a garbage can through the window of an nypd traffic car .  i stand here as a black man who is afraid of the police ,  said marcher ahmad greene-hayes ,  who is afraid of never knowing when my life might end , never knowing when i might be ... gunned down by a vigilante or a security guard or a police officer .  michaela angela davis , a writer and frequent cnn guest who participated in the march , said the demonstrations signal a lasting movement .  the collective self-esteem that 's happening with these young people is really powerful ,  she said .  they know they are part of history .  protesters demand change . in washington , many carried signs with now familiar messages :  black lives matter ,   hold cops accountable  and  i ca n't breathe .   it 's systematic racism that is instilled in our government ,  said shanna lawrie , her hands in the air as she marched to the capitol .  we come in peace but we come strong ,  said ashley sharpton , daughter of the rev. al sharpton , an organizer of the washington march .  we come with demands . we want the government to get involved .  protesters are demanding a more aggressive federal response to racially charged incidents involving police . another marcher was samaria rice , whose 12-year-old son , tamir , was carrying a toy gun when a cleveland police officer fatally shot him in a park . the local medical examiner ruled his death a homicide . marc morial , head of the national urban league , said protesters are demanding body and dashboard cameras for police , special prosecutors to investigate police misconduct and laws against racial profiling . new york city councilman jumaane williams , who marched in washington , said the protest needed to move beyond police brutality and focus on issues such as housing , unemployment and better schools .  that 's where we need to steer the conversation ,  he said .  that 's where the anger is .  what the officers say . daniel pantaleo , the new york police officer shown on video wrestling garner to the pavement with his arm around his neck , spoke with internal affairs investigators this week . his attorney says pantaleo did not use a chokehold but a  takedown technique  he learned in the police academy .  he said he never exerted any pressure on the windpipe and never intended to injure mr. garner ,  attorney stuart london said . police had confronted garner on the sidewalk for allegedly selling loose cigarettes . ferguson police officer darren wilson resigned from the department last month . he testified to a st. louis county grand jury that he shot brown after the 18-year-old tried to take his gun and then charged at him . the results of autopsies , including one by a justice department medical examiner , showed that among brown 's multiple gunshot wounds was one to his hand at close range . that supports wilson 's account of a struggle at his patrol car but does n't explain why wilson continued shooting at least five more times . cnn 's faith karimi , nick valencia , dave alsup , alexandra field , chris welch and camille cava contributed to this report .", "summary": " protests take place in major cities including new york and d.c.   eric garner 's mother says marches are  a history-making moment    one protester
