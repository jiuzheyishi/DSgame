{"text": "within the next decade , the online video market as we know it could be turned on its head with no more adverts , no more channels , and no more menus . that 's according to netflix 's chief product officer neil hunt who made the statements at the internet week event in new york . he predicts that by ` 2025 or sooner ' services such as his own , will have mastered personalisation to the point where sites know what users want to watch before they sign in . netflix 's chief product officer neil hunt predicts that within the next decade , grid-style menus of titles will be replaced by highly personalised choices , including guessing what viewers will want before they sign in . hunt also claims standard channels will be replaced by a ` different channel ' for each of its 50 million subscribers . in april , netflix signed a deal with three small cable-providers in the u.s. to become a regular tv channel . the agreements with atlantic broadband , rcn telecom services and grande communications gives the internet streaming site 's subscription service a channel on tivo boxes that the companies provide their customers . it debuted on atlantic and rcn before expanding on to grande 's service at the end of april . and everyone will get their own , dedicated channel . ` our vision is , you wo n't see a grid and you wo n't see a sea of titles , ' said hunt . instead , netflix will show viewers up to four tv shows or films it thinks they will want to watch , based on previous shows , the time of day , the day of the week , and more . by linking to social networks , netflix could even learn a viewer 's mood based on their most recent posts , or suggest films following a change in relationship status . however , this is still a little way off as netflix 's ceo reed hastings admitted at today 's recode conference that only ' a few people ' are sharing netflix views on facebook , but ` auto-sharing has n't yet panned out . ' in terms of channels , hunt believes that as personalisation improves , fewer people will watch standard channels created by networks . hunt , pictured , made the comments at the internet week event in new york . he said that adverts in online videos could be ditched completely , and brands would need to find alternative methods to promote their goods . alternatively , there could be fewer , but more personalised and targeted adverts . by linking to social networks , netflix could learn a viewer 's mood based on their most recent posts , or suggest shows , such as its own house of cards starring kevin spacey , pictured , based on political beliefs . in terms of channels , hunt believes as personalisation improves , fewer people will watch standard channels . instead , each netflix subscriber - which at the end of april was approaching 50 million - would be served an individual channel , built specifically for them . hunt also said that adverts could be ditched completely following customer feedback , and brands would need to find alternative methods to promote their goods . alternatively , there could be fewer , but more personalised and targeted adverts that generate the best conversion . when asked about the controversial topic of internet fast lanes for web traffic , hunt said netflix was in support of net neutrality . he added netflix should be the leading provider because it offers the best service , not because it can afford to pay for faster access . at today 's event , hastings said net neutrality would n't be an issue if cable companies had competition for internet in the home . until 2010 , at&t and verizon invested tens of billions of dollars to compete with cable , but ended the project when they admitted they could n't compete . hastings added he is concerned cable operators will begin raising the prices for services such as netflix , and this could impact on the prices they charge .", "summary": " neil hunt made the claims at the internet week event in new york .   he predicts that ` by 2025 or sooner ' the online video market will look drastically different .   grid-style menus of titles will be replaced by highly personalised choices .   this includes guessing what viewers want and presenting minimal options .   hunt claims standard channels will be replaced by ` channels for everyone '   social networks will also play a role in improving personalisation .   but , speaking earlier today , ceo reed hastings said ` auto-sharing on facebook has n't yet panned out ' "}
