' pop singer dencia , who created a skin-bleaching cream called whitenicious , has attempted to defend the product 's name in an interview , saying ` white means pure ' the nigerian and cameroonian singer insist that the cream is only intended as a dark spot remover , despite an advertising campaign featuring her looking several skin tones lighter . asked whether the message behind the product was that being white is more beautiful than being black , dencia replied : ` if -lsb- customers -rsb- think that their whole body is a dark spot then fine , because that 's not how i feel ' critics have branded the product an ` abomination ' saying it teaches young ` girls of colour ' to be ashamed of their skin . in an interview with channel 4 , dancia was asked whether she thought the message behind the product was that being white looked better than being black . she replied : ' i was not selling that message , the media are selling that message . i did n't say , buy the cream and look like dancia . ' i said seven day , fast acting dark spot remover . it 's called reading comprehension . if people missed that class then it 's not my fault . ` if they think that their whole body is a dark spot then fine , because that 's not how i feel . ' among dancia 's critics is oscar-winning actress lupita nyong ' o who spoke out against racism in beauty and fashion and warned young black girls not to use bleaching products . nyong ` o , star of 12 years a slave , admitted that when she was younger she wanted to wake up ` just a little bit lighter ' , because she was ashamed of her dark skin . critics have branded the cream an ` abomination ' saying it will make ` girls of colour ' ashamed of having dark skin . when asked whether she accepted the point made by nyong ` o , dancia responded : ' i do n't accept that . i do n't care about her story . i do n't know her . ` i 'm an adult and if i lighten my skin then that 's my choice , the same as bleaching my hair .

' dencia insists that skin-bleaching should be a free choice for adults , and is no different to bleaching hair . however , phinniah ikeji , from black role models uk , said : ` this is about the young girls.they see you , they love your music , they love you as a person and they have seen that you were darker before and now you 're much lighter , what 's the message going to be to them ? ` they 're going to think , ok i want to be like her as well and then that affects their self esteem . ' commenting on the video on youtube , user ac mc said : indians and africans and people of colour need to stop trying to be white and be happy with themselves . this woman needs mental help .
