{"text": "las vegas judging by a preview event at this year 's consumer electronics show , one big gadget trend this year will be sensors that track almost everything in your daily life . there are sensors to track your home , your security systems , your pets , your plants , your weight and , in the case of a new  smart fork ,  even how fast you eat . ces , the world 's biggest electronics trade show , officially opens its doors tuesday and runs through friday . but at sunday 's preview event here , select companies offered the first real peek at what kinds of products we 're likely to see the most over the week . here are five of the more fun gadgets we spotted . the smart fork that slows you down . the hapifork from hapilabs is smarter than your typical eating utensil . in addition to the standard stabbing of meat and ferrying of food from the plate to your mouth , this fork tracks how many bites you take , how fast you take them and the length of your meal . if you are eating too fast , the fork will let you know with a vibration and a blinking light , eventually training you to take your time . eating more slowly can help people lose weight -lrb- there 's more time to feel full -rrb- , and also help them digest food better . french engineer jacques lepine invented the connected eating implement after his family chided him for eating too quickly . he spent three years searching for the right sensor , eventually settling on one that completes a circuit every time your mouth closes over the end of the fork . naturally , the hapifork comes with a mobile app and webpage for tracking your noshing habits . a hapispoon is also in development . the fork will cost $ 99 when it becomes available in april , and the founders are planning a kickstarter campaign for february . trends to look for at ces . a hub for your connected home . there are seemingly no limits to the things in your home , such as temperature and lights , you can track and control remotely with sensors . but there are not many good ways to coordinate all of that data , short of having an app for each and every device . the iris system from lowe 's acts as a hub for a connected home . with the one mobile app you can control and check all your household sensors , or you can program iris to send you text-message alerts when , say , your back door is open . in addition to thermostat and security sensors , iris will help you monitor carbon monoxide levels , water heaters , pet doors and the moisture levels of your house plants . lowe 's promises more sensors to come from such third parties as verizon , whirlpool and petsafe . if you doubt the need for a connected home , check out the iris care service . it lets you monitor an elderly family member 's home and sends you a text message if anything unusual is detected . there 's also an emergency alert button your relative can wear around his or her neck . toyota reveals self-driving car . track your lost luggage anywhere . trakdot is like find my iphone for your luggage . the small black and orange box is preprogrammed with your phone numbers and dropped into a piece of checked luggage . if you arrive at an airport but your duffel does n't , you can check its location online with the trakdot app , or get its location sent to you via text message or e-mail . the device transmits the location using a sim card , so a few special features had to be worked in to make it faa compliant . the trakdot automatically goes into sleep mode when it hits 100 knots and wakes up when the plane is at the destination gate . the trakdot costs $ 50 , plus an annual $ 13 service fee and a one-time $ 9 setup fee . if you 're a frequent flier who has been wronged by incompetent airlines , you may find it a good investment to let you know if your bag is in frankfurt when it 's supposed to be in rome . iphone case is all touch . sure , the front of your iphone is touch sensitive , but all that other surface area is just boring old metal , right ? not anymore . the sensus case from canopy adds touch features to the sides and back of your iphone , turning it into one big touchtastic device . when used with compatible apps , the case adds some interesting navigation and scrolling options . it shines most with games , allowing more interactive play without your big fingers blocking the touchscreen . the device will need more dedicated apps to be truly useful , but canopy has released a few of its own apps to show off its features and potential . there 's a glut of iphone cases out there , so it 's nice to see a new entry that adds to the smartphone experience instead of just dressing up the phone . the case starts at $ 59 , and the company says it is working on ipad versions . the history of ces celebrity gadgets . smart glasses , but not google 's . the vuzix m100 smart glasses bring the power and features of a smartphone directly to your eyeballs . the company has been working on a prototype of these specs for a year and is now showing off a working model at ces . vuzix says it 's close to what the final version will be . the glasses run android 4.0 and can be used to make calls , watch videos and navigate a computer interface . the device has all the fixings , including gps , bluetooth , wi-fi and 720p video recording . vuzix hopes to have the glasses available by this summer for android and ios .", "summary": " tech companies and gadget startups show new products at the consumer electronics show .   there was a glut of home and health sensors , but a few products stood out .   a  smart fork  tracks how fast you eat to help you lose weight .   a gps-based device will track your lost luggage .
