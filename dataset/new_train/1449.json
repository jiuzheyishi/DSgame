{"text": "david attenborough is accused of not covering homosexuality in the animal kingdom . gay rights campaigners were delighted when the commons approved same-sex marriage this week . but it appears there is another fight on the horizon -- for equality in sir david attenborough 's nature documentaries . an academic has criticised the bbc star for failing to cover homosexuality in the animal kingdom . dr brett mills , head of media studies at the university of east anglia , said that while he doubted sir david was deliberately ignoring the issues , homosexuality is ` pretty much everywhere ' in the animal world . he said that by ignoring or sidelining the issue , wildlife documentary makers are skewing the audience 's view of what is natural . dr mills -- who has previously criticised such documentaries for invading animals ' rights to privacy -- said : ` these programmes make a valuable contribution to environmental awareness and how people think about the world around them . they are highly regarded and educational but they should also be offering alternative interpretations of animal behaviour . ` the central role in documentary stories of pairing , mating and raising offspring commonly rests on assumptions of heterosexuality within the animal kingdom . ` this is despite a wealth of scientific evidence which demonstrates that many non-human species have complex and changeable forms of sexual activity , with heterosexuality only one of the many possible options . ' dr mills 's criticisms come after watching hours of sir david 's documentaries , spanning two decades . in one example from 2003 's the life of mammals , two male chimps are shown embracing . the narrator describes it as an act of friendly affection -- but dr mills says alternative explanations should also be given . dr brett mills , head of media studies at the university of east anglia , . said that while he doubted sir david was deliberately ignoring the . issues , homosexuality is ` pretty much everywhere ' in the animal world . in the life of birds in 1998 , viewers were treated to male sandpipers circling one another in an ` aggressive ' manner . again , dr mills suggests another interpretation should have been addressed by the programme . the academic also complains that sir david 's programmes place too much emphasis on traditional family values and monogamy while ignoring promiscuity and single parenting , which are also rife among many animals . he highlighted footage of emperor penguins from 1993 that suggests ` family is an essential unit for the success of the offspring ' . similarly , the description of blue manakins , south american birds which have multiple mates , as ` neglectful of their parental duties ' feeds the idea that one type of family is better than others , it is claimed . the researcher chose sir david 's documentaries to illustrate his point because of the ` perceived authority and reverence ' lent to them by the veteran broadcaster -- but he stressed that other wildlife documentaries are just as guilty . dr mills , who airs his arguments in the european journal of clinical studies , said : ` the research now suggests that -lsb- homosexual -rsb- behaviour can be found in pretty much every species to different extents . ` anywhere people have actually looked , it will be found .
