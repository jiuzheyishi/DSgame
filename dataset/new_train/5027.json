{"text": "must change : more foreign prisoners should be sent home to serve their time says justice secretary chris grayling . britain was hit by a fresh foreign prisoner fiasco last night after it was revealed that a much - trumpeted eu transfer agreement has spectacularly backfired . ministers had pinned their hopes on the deal between member states leading to a dramatic fall in overseas inmates clogging the uk 's jails . it allows eu prisoners to be forced to serve their sentence at home . but farcically , the two countries with the most inmates in britain -- poland and ireland -- were given opt-outs by the previous labour government . as a result , not a single prisoner from a fellow eu country has been sent back to their homeland by the uk since the agreement came into force in december 2011 . at the same time , britain has been sent two inmates by our eu partners -- meaning the number behind bars is going up . to make matters worse , a further 38 british citizens were sent to our packed jails by our eu neighbours under pre-existing voluntary transfer deals . only 32 britons went in the opposite direction , according to figures released by prisons minister jeremy wright . at the heart of the fiasco is a decision made by labour three years ago , to grant poland an effective opt-out from the new eu arrangement . there are more poles -- 861 -- in the uk 's prisons than citizens of any other eu nation . it has echoes of labour 's infamous decision not to place any restrictions on poland when the country joined the union in 2004 . it led to one million travelling here from the former eastern bloc country , compared to government estimates of 13,000 . poland 's exemption from the deal lasts for five years , leaving little prospect of any improvement until 2017 at the earliest . ministers in the last government also allowed ireland an opt-out , formalising a long-standing arrangement between the two countries . no fair : no eu citizen has been sent from britain to serve their jail-time in their native country whilst 38 british citizens have been returned to be imprisoned here -lrb- file photo -rrb- . the news is likely to cast new doubt on how much benefit britain receives from signing up to eu directives . justice secretary chris grayling told the mail : ` this is an aspect of our prison system that has to change . more foreign prisoners must serve their sentences in their own countries . there are far too many in our prisons . ` prisoners are being transferred out of our prisons under various transfer agreements but i am determined to do more and will investigate every possible avenue to reduce their numbers and unburden british taxpayers . ' the prime minister had personally put the agreement at the heart of his blueprint for cutting the 11,000 foreign nationals behind bars , which costs taxpayers an estimated # 420million a year . uk prisons contain inmates from 156 . different countries . there are 193 member countries in the united . nations , meaning all bar 37 are represented in the british prison . system . labour 's strategy was to offer inmates a bribe of thousands of . pounds to go home voluntarily to complete their sentence . however in recent years the strategy has shifted towards trumpeting the introduction of the eu prisoner transfer agreement . prisoners do not have to give their consent before they can be sent to a fellow member of the eu . in reply to a question from tory mp therese coffey , mr wright admitted : ` to date no prisoners have been transferred from england and wales to other eu member states under the eu prisoner transfer agreement . ` a small number of requests for transfer to other member states have been made and decisions are awaited . ' he added : ` it remains government policy that , wherever possible , prisoners should serve their sentences in their own country . ` all of those prisoners from member states which have implemented the eu prisoner transfer agreement , and who it is considered may be eligible for transfer . . . will be transferred at the earliest possible opportunity . '", "summary": " since december 2011 prisoners from within the eu can be forced to serve their sentence in their home country .   previous government allowed opt outs for poland and ireland , the two countries with the most inmates serving time in britain .   meanwhile 38 prisoners were returned to the uk .
