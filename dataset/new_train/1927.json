{"text": "banks are revolutionizing the way you withdraw money . instead of using a traditional debit or credit card at an atm , you will be able to log into a banking app on your cell phone and order cash up to 24 hours before a transaction . financial services giant fis announced the innovative mobile banking technology at the money2020 conference in las vegas this week . three banks have already begun testing the app and hope to launch the services in their atms by the end of 2014 . the three participating banks thus far are wintrust in illinois , bmo harris in chicago , and city national in los angeles . fis announced this week that they have been gaining attention from a number of other large banks as well as smaller institutions about the mobile banking app . mary monahan , of javelin strategy & research , believes that using a cell phone to make cash withdrawals is much safer than using a debit card . by the end of 2014 , you will be able to use your cell phone as a debit card at participating banks . a receipt will be automatically saved on your phone making it easier to keep track of your transactions . not only is it safer , it 's faster . the fis mobile technology only takes approximately nine seconds to make a transaction . using a traditional bank card can take up to 40 seconds . to use the app , simply open it on your cell phone when you are at a participating atm . your phone will display a code which you then scan on the atm screen . the machine then immediately dispenses the money . according to monahan , cell phone transactions are safer than debit card ones because they protect card holders from fraudsters seeking to catch images of a card and pin number on camera . the quick transaction time and the privacy of the phone code make it more difficult for others to steal your identity . in order to use the atm you will need to scan a personalized code on to the screen . even if your phone is stolen , hackers would need to know your security code , banking information , and pin number in order to proceed with a withdrawal . the mobile technology is expanding beyond atms . some restaurants plan to create apps that allow patrons to pay the bill with a cell phone . ` the phone is becoming a security blanket , ' said monahan . ` the more you can do with it , the better . ' one possible issue with the mobile app is phone connectivity . no cell phone service means no atm cash withdrawal . no atm withdrawal means no customers . to overcome the service issue , fis said it is working on an ` offline mode ' that would allow for transactions even without cell reception . not only is technology becoming more advanced , it 's becoming more human . bank of america , chase , and other financial institutions have been experimenting with virtual tellers , atms that provide almost all the same services as a human teller would -- including exact change , video conferencing and loan and credit card payment capabilities .", "summary": " using your phone to make an atm withdrawal is faster than using a debit card .   mobile atm transactions are more secure than traditional debit card withdrawals .   soon you will be able to use your phone to pay at restaurants and other participating establishments .
