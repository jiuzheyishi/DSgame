{"text": "kezia and mike fitzgerald wish they had never seen the need to start their own business . they wish kezia had never been diagnosed with hodgkin 's lymphoma . they wish their daughter , saoirse , had not joined kezia in the hospital , to fight her own battle against an aggressive tumor . they wish saoirse had won . but wishing to change the past , the fitzgeralds know , is useless .  when our daughter died , kezia and i took some time away and re-grouped our life ,  mike said in a cnn ireport .  we made the decision that we were going to focus on positive things and do positive things in our lives .  double diagnoses . during her pregnancy in 2010 , kezia noticed swollen lymph nodes in her neck . she ignored them , because she had experienced swelling before during allergy season . they did n't ache , she said , just made her neck appear uneven . in june 2010 , the massachusetts couple became first-time parents to a healthy seven-pound baby they named saoirse . but the swelling on the right side of kezia 's neck persisted . by january , her doctors determined the cause : stage three hodgkin 's lymphoma . the cancer had spread to kezia 's chest , neck and abdomen . through her monthly chemotherapy , kezia dealt with nausea and fatigue . but her treatment was going well , and the side effects were mild , so she thought the worst would soon be over . then one april morning , she and her husband noticed that saoirse was n't wandering around as she normally would . even more startling , her eyes were swollen and her eyelids were black , blue and yellow .  it looked like she had been in a fight ,  kezia said . saoirse was also cranky and vomiting . she had swelling in both her ears and a bulge the size of an egg on her right temple .  her head looked like it was exploding ,  mike said . they rushed her to the emergency room . for three weeks , pediatricians and neurosurgeons focused on her head , taking ct scans to see whether she had bleeding there . the scans came out clean . finally , doctors found a neuroblastoma tumor in saoirse 's abdomen . she was in stage four . neuroblastoma is one of the most common types of cancer for infants and children , behind leukemia and brain cancer . there are about 700 new cases of neuroblastoma diagnosed each year in the united states , according to the american cancer society . it is an aggressive malignant tumor that develops in infants and kids when their immature nerve cells turn into tumors instead of cells and fibers . a woman and her toddler fight dual cancers . when her father heard the news , he went numb .  i thought , ` my god , i 'm at risk of losing both of my family members , the two most important people in my life . '  the cancer had spread throughout her tiny body , to her adrenal glands , bone marrow and ears . saoirse needed chemotherapy right away . now she and kezia shared more than their blonde hair , bright blue eyes and love for peaches . a simple solution . cancer did n't slow saoirse down much . in between needles and diaper changes , the toddler wandered the halls of boston children 's hospital , toting her stuffed purple gorilla named grape ape . but the peripherally inserted central catheter , or picc line , doctors placed in saoirse 's arm to administer treatment kept getting in the way . the long flexible tube that was giving saoirse essential nutrition and medications kept getting tangled .  this new attached toy was now a drumstick , teething toy and something to tug on ,  mike said .  when we asked the nurse how to secure the lines and caps the only suggestion they had was to use a sock or tape .  when saoirse developed a bad rash from the medical tape , her mother knew they needed a better option . kezia loved to sew -- winter hats , diaper bags , you name it -- but her projects had fallen to the wayside with the family 's hospital schedule . one night kezia went home and dug out her sewing machine , grabbed some cotton knit fabric and created a sleeve that would hopefully secure saoirse 's line comfortably . it worked . the wrap held saoirse 's line in place without letting it dangle , causing any itchiness or pain . saoirse went back to playing with her toys and ignored the picc line . a few weeks later , when a doctor inserted a central chest line , kezia replicated her efforts to create a chest wrap for the toddler . the wraps became a hit in the hospital ward . nurses loved that they could access saoirse 's lines easily without taking off a bunch of tape . parents asked kezia to create more wraps for their kids . mike filed a provisional application for a patent on the popular product , then went back to caring for his wife and child .  kezia would have much rather designed and sewed something else besides the wraps ,  mike said .  but she did what she had to do to help our child . it worked and we solved a problem .  kezia 's cancer went into remission in september 2011 . saoirse passed away a few months later . ' i love my carealine ' the fitzgeralds took some time after saoirse 's death to grieve . but they knew they wanted to help other patients with the wraps kezia had created . they spent most of 2012 finding a sewing contractor in massachusetts and a fabric producer in california before launching carealine products , llc . they now offer the wraps on their website and on amazon.com . patients can purchase individual wraps ; hospitals and treatment facilities can buy them in bulk . so far two hospital groups have purchased carealine products for their patients , mike said .  breaking into the medical product community is challenging ,  he said .  but with every challenge there seems to be an equal reward . ... while we still have a long way to go before we can call ourselves a success , we feel like we are headed in the right direction .  the fitzgeralds are working on developing more products , mike said , so that every patient with a catheter can be given a wrap to keep their line in line .  we know how stressful it is when that line is first put in , and how much you have to learn to take care of it ,  he said .  we do n't think that any patient should have to search for their own solution like we did .  the couple wishes they never saw the need to start this company , but they 're glad they did . they know it 's the best way to honor their daughter , and her courageous battle against cancer . a little boy walked up to the fitzgeralds ' conference table in cape cod this summer and said ,  i love my carealine .  it 's still mike 's favorite  review .   it made us feel like we had truly made a different in that little boy and his family 's life .
