{"text": "britain is less able to keep track of its visitors than disney world , it was claimed last night , as a scathing report exposed the failings of official immigration statistics . crucial estimates of arrivals from overseas rely on random interviews carried out with just 12 people passing through ports and airports each day -- and even they may be lying , mps said . ministers were warned they should not base their controversial immigration target -- to limit population growth to the tens of thousands every year -- on such shaky figures . failings : the risk of error in the random interviewing system is so great that annual migration could be 35,000 higher or lower than is estimated . the public administration select committee urged the home office to combine its visa figures with forthcoming electronic data on visitors to build up a far more accurate picture of foreigner numbers . committee chairman bernard jenkin said : ` most people would be astonished to learn that there is no attempt to count people as they enter or leave the uk . ` they are amazed when they are told that the government merely estimates that there are half-a-million immigrants coming into the uk each year . ' philippa roe , leader of westminster city council , said : ` when i gave evidence to this committee i said disney world has better technology to keep track of its visitors than we do . i 'm pleased this report accepts the current system is a blunt instrument which is patently not up to the job . ' the coalition vowed to cut net migration -- the number of new arrivals each year minus those who leave the country -- from more than 150,000 a year to the ` tens of thousands ' by granting fewer visas to foreign students and making it harder for families to settle here . unimpressed : councillor philippa roe said ` disney world has better technology ' but today 's report reveals that the policy and the figures are not based on methodically counting everyone who arrives in the country or leaves it . instead , officials rely on a sample of just under 5,000 migrants interviewed each year as they travel through uk air and sea ports , in what is known as the international passenger survey . the risk of error in this poll is so great that annual net migration could be 35,000 higher or lower than is estimated . some advisers believe that , as a result , the government should aim to reduce net migration to 50,000 rather than 100,000 in order to achieve its goal . but the committee warned : ` the government should not base its target level of net migration on such an uncertain statistic as doing so could lead to inappropriate immigration policy . ' the passenger survey also relies on immigrants telling the truth about where they have come from and where they plan to settle . a new system called e-borders will record more detail on the identity of passengers travelling through british ports . but it will not be integrated into immigration statistics until 2018 . the home office counts the number of visas issued and asylum applications granted or received -- but not people leaving unless they have broken the rules . the committee urged ministers to integrate visa figures with port data ` as rapidly as possible ' . last night a home office spokesman said : ` we disagree with the report 's conclusions . government reforms on immigration are working and the statistics show that migration is at its lowest level for a decade . ' oddly quiet : shadow home secretary yvette cooper . yvette cooper has been criticised by labour mps for refusing to condemn a controversial new poster campaign telling illegal immigrants to ` go home ' . ethnic minority mps in the party say ms cooper , the shadow home secretary , was asked to speak out but declined . they said it was ` embarrassing ' that attacks on the campaign were then led by ukip 's nigel farage , who described the posters as ` nasty and unpleasant ' . labour mps also accused ms cooper , below , of making a ` misguided ' attempt to ` pander to the right ' . the giant billboards , which are being driven around on the back of vans , say : ` in the uk illegally ? go home or face arrest . ' illegal immigrants are offered a number to text for ` free advice and help with travel documents ' . reaction from the liberal democrats , backbench labour mps and ukip was swift and critical . but ms cooper remained quiet . one labour mp said last night : ` we hoped she would come out strongly against this nasty campaign , but she did n't want to . ` it is ridiculous if we are so worried about alienating right-wing voters that we end up being outflanked on the left by farage , the most right-wing party leader , in a misguided attempt to pander to his supporters . ' liberal democrat president tim farron condemned the billboards as the ` politics of division ' . and mr farage , who campaigns on an anti-immigration ticket , said : ` i think the tone of the billboards is nasty , unpleasant , big brother . ' a labour spokesman insisted that one of ms cooper 's frontbench team had criticised the poster campaign . taxpayers are shelling out # 21 million a year to fund interpreters for nhs hospital patients who can not speak english , the mail on sunday has discovered . the amount has shot up by 50 per cent -- # 7 million -- in just five years , according to figures obtained under the freedom of information act . five years ago each hospital trust was on average spending # 87,000 on interpreters , but by last year that had grown to # 130,000 . large-scale immigration from eastern european countries , in particular poland , appears to have driven the massive demand for interpreters . alp mehmet , vice-chairman of pressure group migration watch , said : ` i am a first-generation immigrant myself . those arriving here need to make much more of an effort to learn the language .
