{"text": "at 5ft 2  tall and tipping the scales at just under 6st , laura davison , now 30 , from weston-super-mare , thought she would never become a mother . diagnosed with anorexia in her teens , she endured two stints in therapy before meeting her partner , del , in 2004 . much to her surprise , she soon became pregnant but despite her happiness , her anorexia never completely went away , with laura surviving on just two pieces of toast a day during her third and most recent pregnancy . happy family : laura , holding her daughter katie , with son michael , partner del and oldest son daniel . unwell : laura , pictured while pregnant with katie , was living on just two slices of toast a day . now mother to daniel , eight , michael , seven and baby katie , laura says she hopes the birth of her youngest child will help her turn the corner and become the mother she 's always wanted to be . ' i was first diagnosed with anorexia when i was about 16 but had issues long before that , ' explains laura , who appears on tonight 's episode of one born every minute . ` although i was never fat , i used to eat a lot and i do remember a girl at school saying to me if you carry on eating like that , you 're going to get fat . ` so i cut out chocolate and crisps and lost a little bit of weight and it spiralled from there . ` at my worst , i was eating one rich tea biscuit a day . ' although dangerously ill , laura managed to pass her gcses and combined school work with a demanding weekend job , which she says was ` like exercise ' . at 18 , she was hospitalised and spent time at the priory in bristol before being transferred to the birmingham branch . doctors , horrified by her inability to fight off the disease , warned her that she risked being unable to have children . but even that was n't enough to stop laura . ` it upset me , the thought of it , ' she remembers . ' i was n't getting periods because i was so underweight but at the time , i was so in the grip of the eating disorder , i did n't care . ' not well : laura first became ill in her teens and is pictured on the left at 15 and on the right aged 16 at her prom . first recovery : laura pictured aged 17 after being discharged from the riverside unit - a clinic for unwell teens . as with any illness , anorexia can result in problems during pregnancy . ` the are a number of potential effects of . anorexia , ' explains jane munro of the royal college of midwives . ` among them are a low birth weight baby , miscarriage and . stillbirth , premature birth and an increased chance of having a . caesarean section . ` the mother is also more likely to develop postnatal depression if she suffers from anorexia . ' a healthy diet is vital for both the baby and mother throughout pregnancy and after the birth . ' but laura 's life was about to change dramatically - and for the better - when she met and fell in love with her partner del. . much . to the couple 's delight , within months of striking up a relationship . and against all the odds , the 20-year-old found herself pregnant . ` we were only together for five months . before i fell pregnant , ' says laura . ` we thought there was no point using . contraceptives because we thought i would n't be able to have children . ' and with her maternal instincts kicking in , laura found herself eating properly for the first time in years . ' i would eat chips for breakfast , ' she chuckles . ` potatoes were my craving . my eating disorder was never about hurting . anyone else , just myself , and my maternal instincts took over . ' but six months after daniel was born by emergency caesarian , the anorexia returned . by now pregnant with her second child , the stress of juggling the demands of a tiny baby and a pregnancy left laura struggling . ` from the outside , i looked like a happy . mum , ' she reveals . ` but because of the caesarian , i found it harder to bond with daniel and although i did fall in love with him when he was about three months old , the stress of being pregnant again so soon led to it coming back . looking up : laura with her partner del , who she met aged 20 . she credits him with helping to beat the illness . not easy : laura aged 19 in the priory just before she met del. . she weighed just 5st 8lb at the time . ` it was n't all the time but it was there . the clothes i was wearing . were maternity but a size 10 . i think i was ok . i was small but not too bad . ' by the end of her pregnancy , laura , who says she spent most of the nine months on a diet of a breakfast of bran flakes with milk and a dinner of spaghetti bolognese , weighed just 9st 5lbs . although at 7.5 lbs baby michael was smaller than her older son , he was healthy and laura was besotted . but once again , her anorexia returned - this time triggered by the stress of juggling two small sons with an increasingly busy job . ' i was working in a solicitors office in bristol and i can remember throwing up in the office toilet , ' she remembers . ` we were dealing with home repossessions which went up from 20 to 100 in a week after the recession began . ' i felt like i was n't giving 100 per cent at home or work - compounded by feeling awful for leaving the boys and for not being able to do my job as well as i wanted . ' weighing just 6st 6lbs , laura 's problems were made worse by a litany of health problems that included foot surgery and having a lump removed from her breast . ' i started with two slices of toast , the one flapjack at lunch and i would try and eat evening meal , ' says laura . ' i started throwing that up and then the same with flapjack at work . once i was signed off work , i would vomit up to 20 times a day . ` the children were never around when i did it and i would eat meals with everyone but del would do most of the parenting . ' happier : laura is determined to beat anorexia for the sake of all three children and for partner del . high hopes : laura wants to be a wonderful mother to her children and says she will beat anorexia . the pressure proved too much for the couple to handle and they split up for two years before getting back together again in 2012 . but anorexia was still casting its shadow over laura 's life and when she became pregnant for a third time , dealing with it became more difficult than ever . this time , the trigger was a court case . following an assault by a former boyfriend . unable to cope with the . stress , laura was living on a single slice of toast and peanut butter a . day . ' i did have a lot of support from the midwife , ' says laura , ` but i was under . a lot of stress and pressure and i felt bad that i was n't able to eat normally . for her . ` later she found me a dietician and i increased what i was eating to two . slices of toast and peanut butter and one apple a day . ' by the end of her pregnancy , laura weighed just 8st 3lb , much of it baby , and was warned that she faced a riskier than normal birth as a result . luckily , daughter katie was born healthy , although at 6lb 12oz , she weighed considerably less than her older brothers had . although laura says she is still struggling with her eating and is currently back on her pregnancy routine of two slices of toast and peanut butter a day , she is positive that she 'll find a way to beat the disease . ` i 'm maintaining my weight , ' she says . ' i feel positive that i 'm keeping my weight on and i 'm . not getting worse . if i start the day good and i end the day good , . that 's enough . ` the healthier i am , the more i can do with the children , ' she adds . ` they are my motivation . if i did n't have them , i might not still be here . laura appears on one born every minute , tonight at 9pm on channel 4 .", "summary": " laura davison , 30 , struggled with anorexia throughout her pregnancies .   during the last one , she ate just two slices of toast and peanut butter a day .   katie was born healthy but at 6lb 12oz weighed less than her brothers .   laura says she is determined to beat the illness for her children 's sake .
