{"text": "when claire weller found she was pregnant , just a few months after suffering a miscarriage , she felt joy and anxiety in equal measure . while delighted to be expecting again , she was also worried her unborn baby might suffer the same sad fate as the one she had lost 16 weeks into her previous pregnancy . so , when a friend offered to lend her a foetal doppler - a handheld ultrasound listening device used by midwives at antenatal appointments - to check her unborn baby 's heartbeat , she leapt at the opportunity , never imagining the panic it would induce . twice as nice : claire weller with her partner james reeves and their one-year-old twins jack and bobby . ' i thought being able to hear my baby 's heart beating would be hugely reassuring , ' says claire , 32 , of chessington , surrey . ` but i did n't bargain for the terror i 'd feel when i was unable to detect a heartbeat . ` this happened several times . once , seven months into my pregnancy , i got into such a state that my partner , james , had to race me to kingston hospital for an emergency scan . ` everything was fine , but it took a few hours for me to calm down - not ideal when stress in pregnancy poses such a risk to you and your baby . ' indeed , as foetal dopplers become a must-have piece of kit for mums-to-be , the royal college of midwives has issued a warning about the risks they pose . they urge pregnant women to seek medical advice if they are worried about their baby , rather than attempting to self-diagnose with a doppler . ` we advise against personal dopplers as it takes considerable training to use them properly , ' says jane munro of the rcm . ` it can cause needless stress to a pregnant woman when she can not pick up her baby 's heartbeat . it can lead to raised blood pressure in the mother and premature births . 12 weeks : claire weller used a personal doppler to listen to her unborn children 's heartbeats . ` more worrying , we 've had cases where there has been something wrong with a baby and the mother has been wrongly reassured after hearing her own heartbeat , or the sound of blood pumping through the placenta , leading to a dangerous delay in her seeking medical attention . in at least one instance , sadly the baby died . ' so the message from midwives is loud and clear : leave the job to the professionals . although dopplers for home use can be picked up for as little as # 30 from online retailers including amazon , the # 250 model claire borrowed from her friend was identical to ones used in hospitals . in fact , it was so sensitive that , at ten weeks pregnant , claire detected two foetal heartbeats and realised she was expecting twins . ` at my first antenatal appointment i said to the midwife :  i think it 's twins ,  ' recalls claire , whose partner , james , 38 , is a chauffeur . ` she could n't believe how early i 'd picked up the heartbeats . ' claire then used the doppler every other day , and fought the urge to listen in more often . ` it sometimes took me 40 minutes to find a heartbeat and even longer to pick up two , because you do n't know whether you 're hearing the same heartbeat twice . i 'd get anxious checking and double checking , ' she says . ` later in the pregnancy one of my twins was breech and the other head down , so it was a real struggle locating both of their little hearts . ' i got into a terrible state seven months into the pregnancy because my breech baby was not moving very much and i could n't pick up a clear heartbeat . realising how worried i was , james took me to hospital . ` thankfully the obstetrician who scanned me was able to reassure me that both our babies were fine . ' the twins , bobby and jack , were born in march last year , each weighing a robust 7lb . happy families : bobby and jack were born in march last year , each weighing a robust 7lb . although there are no official figures on the number of mums using dopplers , midwives have reported a huge increase in pregnant women who admit to listening to their babies ' heartbeats at home . dr thomas aust , an obstetrician at the wirral 's arrowe park hospital , first raised the alarm in the summer of 2009 after a 27-year-old woman was admitted to his antenatal ward due to reduced foetal movement 32 weeks into her first pregnancy . the unnamed woman told doctors that she had first noticed her baby had become less active two days previously , but had been reassured that all was well after using her own doppler to listen to its heartbeat . however , concerned by a lack of movement during monitoring , doctors performed an emergency caesarean later that evening . the baby was so unwell it spent its first eight weeks on the special care unit . while recognising the inevitable anxiety women experience during pregnancy , jane munro , of the rcm , questions the ethics of companies which sell and loan personal dopplers . ' i think it 's unethical for retailers to overstate their usefulness , ' says jane . ` it 's far more important for mothers-to-be to tune into any changes they notice in their baby 's movements than to encourage them to rely on a gadget . ' pregnant : kayley boden -lrb- left -rrb- takes a selfie of her pregnancy bump , and used a foetal doppler in the hopes of reassuring herself . that 's a lesson that julie hainsworth , an nhs receptionist from leeds , learnt the hard way . while pregnant with her fourth child , toby , now six months old , she bought a prenatal foetal doppler for # 30 on ebay . ' i bought it so that our older children could hear the heartbeat and feel more involved , ' recalls julie , 32 . ` but it was such a worrying pregnancy because i discovered early on that his heart rate was quite irregular . ` i 'd creep off and listen while my husband , christopher , was supervising the children 's teatime . when i told my midwife about my concerns , she advised me to stop using the doppler because it was likely to be more stress-inducing than reassuring . ' i could n't resist the temptation to listen in . however , i could n't make sense of what i was hearing . ' as the pregnancy progressed , julie was unable to hide her fears from christopher , 31 , a landscape gardener . from the 26th week of pregnancy , julie was admitted to st james 's hospital in leeds no less than 12 times for monitoring after she raised concerns about her baby 's heart rate . the first prototype ultrasound system was developed in glasgow in the fifties . toby was born at 37 weeks , three weeks before his due date , weighing just 4lb 6oz , but otherwise healthy . ` after all those months of worry , of not knowing whether his irregular heart rate symbolised some underlying problem , it was such a relief to finally hold toby , ' says julie . when a year later , she became pregnant with her youngest child , arya , now five months old , she was far more cautious about using her doppler . ' i picked up her heartbeat nine weeks into the pregnancy , ' recalls julie . ` but then i only used the doppler a handful of times . yes , it was hugely tempting , but i could n't put myself through all that worry again for another nine months . ' kayley boden is another mother who succumbed to home monitoring , much to her midwife 's disapproval . she bought a doppler for # 40 , but struggled to detect her baby 's heartbeat . ' i finally heard something at 24 weeks , but even then it was hard to detect , ' says kayley , 21 , a trainee teacher . ' i thought the doppler was going to reassure me but in fact it did the opposite . ' i rang my midwife in a state when i could n't hear anything . she said they do n't recommend personal dopplers . ` she said it did n't help for me to be worried because the baby would become stressed and the heartbeat would be even harder to find . after that , i did n't dare call her again when i could n't detect a heartbeat so i 'd just keep trying and fretting . ' pretty in pink : kayley boden with her daughter , six-month-old erica grace . eight months into her pregnancy , kayley 's baby became worryingly still , but she decided not to seek immediate help when her mind was put at rest after checking for the heartbeat herself . ` because i 'd heard the heartbeat , i decided to hold on until the following day when i had an antenatal appointment , ' says kayley . ` but towards evening time , she still was n't moving so i called my midwife who told me to go straight into the assessment unit . ' kayley 's daughter , erica , was born five days past her due date at warrington hospital , weighing 8 lb 2.5 oz . ` she 's healthy so there was no need for all that angst , ' says kayley . ` if i have another baby , i wo n't use the doppler again - it 's not worth all the stress it causes . ' how ironic , then , that this is a device marketed with the promise of alleviating anxiety in pregnancy .", "summary": " foetal dopplers become a must-have piece of kit for mums-to-be .   royal college of midwives has issued a warning about the risks they pose .   urge pregnant women to seek medical advice if they are worried about their baby , rather than attempting to self-diagnose .   gadget makes many women feel stressed out .
