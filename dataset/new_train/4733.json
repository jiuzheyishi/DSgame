{"text": "going to the academy awards has been dangerous for jennifer lawrence . for two years , the actress could n't seem to stay upright at the event , tripping once in 2013 when walking to the stage to accept her oscar for  silver linings playbook ,  and then falling again when arriving for the ceremony this march . so is lawrence really that accident-prone , or are her repeat tumbles some sort of scheme to become more relatable , and thus more likable ? well if it is a plot , lawrence tells marie claire in its june issue , she 'd be smarter about executing it . at the 2014 oscars , lawrence says she was  trying to do the right thing  as she got out of her limo . she was  waving to fans , trying to be nice , and there 's a traffic cone ,  she recalls .  the second i hit it , i was laughing , but on the inside i was like , ` you 're f **** d. they 're totally going to think this is an act ... ' but trust me if i was going to plan it , i would have done it at the golden globes or the sags . i would have never done it at two oscars in a row . i watch ` homeland ' -- i 'm craftier than that !  that kind of answer is exactly the reason fans adore lawrence ; she 's uber-talented but also down-to-earth enough to freak out on a reporter who spoiled the last season of  homeland .  yet the kentucky-bred star insists that becoming famous has worn off some of her average jane charm , telling marie claire that these days , she 's  a lot more closed off and frankly probably rude .   i mean , i 'm from kentucky . i used to be very personable and make eye contact and smile at people , and now all i do is look down ,  the 23-year-old says .  when i 'm at dinner and one person after another keeps interrupting to take pictures , it 's like , ' i ca n't live like this . '  but one thing lawrence has learned to live with is a long-distance relationship . both the actress and her boyfriend ,  x-men : days of future past  co-star nicholas hoult , are busy building their careers , and they 've agreed it 's ok to  mutually ignore each other  for a bit when necessary .  neither of us gets mad when the other does n't text back or call . life 's super-busy ,  the actress says .  obviously you know what they 're doing , and you trust them . we 're so young that it would almost be like if we lived in the same city , what would happen ? we 'd be living together . at least this way he 's in the same boat as i am : we can go out and have our own lives and know that we have each other .  it 's not an overstatement that lawrence keeps a busy schedule ; for the next two years she 's committed to wrapping up  the hunger games  franchise with  mockingjay  parts 1 and 2 , plus filming another  x-men  movie ,  x-men : apocalypse ,  all of which comes on the heels of the highly touted david o. russell movie  american hustle .  the latter earned lawrence another raft of praise and an oscar nomination for best supporting actress , a nod that some prognosticators thought she might cinch . in the end , the gold went to  12 years a slave  actress lupita nyong ` o , and lawrence says she could n't have been more thrilled .  i was very happy i voted for lupita ,  lawrence said .  it 's beautiful when you watch something good happen to somebody when it 's well deserved .
