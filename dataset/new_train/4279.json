{"text": "the food and drug administration said monday that it was loosening restrictions on the controversial diabetes drug avandia  to reflect new information regarding the cardiovascular risk .  an advisory panel voted in june to recommend loosening restrictions put in place in 2010 , when the fda limited avandia use to patients with type 2 diabetes who could not control their illness with other medications . that decision was based on studies showing an increased risk of serious heart problems in patients taking avandia , most notably a 2007 analysis by dr. steven nissen , a cardiologist at the cleveland clinic , showing a 43 % increase in heart attacks . the finding led the fda to order glaxosmithkline , the drug 's maker , to conduct a thorough study of its safety . the full results of that study , known as record , were made public in 2009 . results from record  showed no elevated risk of heart attack or death in patients being treated with avandia when compared to standard-of-care diabetes drugs ,  the fda said in a statement monday .  these data do not confirm the signal of increased risk of heart attacks that was found in a meta-analysis of clinical trials first reported in 2007 .   our actions today reflect the most current scientific knowledge about the risks and benefits of this drug ,  said dr. janet woodcock , director of the fda 's center for drug evaluation and research , in the statement .  given these new results , our level of concern is considerably reduced ; thus , we are requiring the removal of certain prescribing restrictions .  video : fda restricts diabetes drug avandia . although glaxosmithkline said the safety data were reassuring , the study was heavily criticized by dr. thomas marciniak , an fda scientist who reviewed the data and said the company ignored several cases of patients who suffered severe adverse effects . because there were multiple conflicting signals of cardiovascular risk associated with the drug , woodcock recommended that glaxo commission an outside independent group to review record 's results . gsk chose the duke clinical research institute to re-examine the data and held a june hearing on the results . the institute 's associate director , dr. kenneth mahaffey , said that it performed a comprehensive review and that its data were consistent with the record results . in june , some members of the fda panel questioned the severity of the current restrictions and the scope of cardiovascular events caused by taking the drug .  i am considerably reassured ... that the magnitude of risk is not great ,  said dr. dale hammerschmidt , one of the panelists who voted to modify the warning . he added that he thought the current warning was more severe than necessary but should not be removed entirely . as of june , only 3,000 patients in the united states were registered to take avandia , according to glaxosmithkline spokeswoman mary ann rhyne . that 's compared with the 120,000 patients taking the drug in 2010 before the restrictions were put in place .", "summary": " restrictions on avandia were put in place in 2010 .   studies showed an increased risk of serious heart problems .   additional research shows no additional cardiovascular risk with avandia .
