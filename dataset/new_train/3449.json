{"text": "kim kardashian may be one of the most sought-after women in the world - but one man ca n't stay far enough away from the reality tv star . retail assistant mike amess has an unusual phobia : he is absolutely petrified of the kardashian family . he breaks out in a cold sweat whenever he sees or hears the famous family and says the sight of a semi-naked kim even makes him vomit with disgust . mike says that his phobia has got worse since kim 's fame skyrocketed and his fear now extends to the whole kardashian family . mike breaks out in a cold sweat whenever he sees or hears the famous family and says the sight of a semi-naked kim even makes him vomit with disgust . the 24-year-old from exeter explains , ` just hearing the sound of the kardashians ' nasal voices or catching a glimpse of them on screen makes me feel nauseous and shaky . ` my hands get clammy , my breathing gets heavier and i start sweating . sometimes , i get teary and want to retch . ' mike , who is gay , says his fear of the kardashians started when he watched kim 's now notorious sex tape at the age of seventeen . mike says , ' i was raised catholic and growing up , i tried to repress my sexuality and deny that i was gay . ` loads of the boys at school were going on about how good kim kardashian 's sex tape was . i thought i 'd give it a watch in the hope it would turn me on . ' i downloaded the video and watched it secretly in my bedroom . but the sight of kim writhing around with her huge bum and the sound of her horrible high-pitched wailing repulsed me . ' i really wanted to be aroused by her so i kept watching it but she made me feel more and more upset . mike 's most recent ordeal saw him throw up after accidentally seeing kanye west 's music video , ` bound 2 ' -lrb- pictured in the background -rrb- , which features a topless kim straddling the singer on a motorbike . ` by the end of the tape , i had burst into tears . the experience left me terrified and i never wanted to see kim 's face again . ' i have come to terms with my homosexuality now but my dread towards her has never left . ' mike says that his phobia has got worse since kim 's fame skyrocketed and his fear now extends to the whole kardashian family . he explains , ` kim and her sisters look and sound so similar - they 're a mess . they make my stomach churn , i hate it . ' i dislike everything about them , especially their physical appearance . i do n't understand how anyone could find them attractive . ' i ca n't stand their voices either . they 're so whiny and shrill - it really gets under my skin . ' the kardashians ' prominence in the media means that mike 's phobia blights his everyday life . mike says his friends tease him about his reaction to the family and his fear has even cost him a relationship . ` it 's impossible to get away from kim , let alone her whole family . every website or magazine you read has them plastered all over . ' i really enjoy reading the news but if i see kim on the cover of a newspaper or a big picture of her across a website , i wo n't go near it . mike has never sought medical help as he is embarrassed of his condition . ` it makes life really difficult . sometimes , i miss out on a lot of important news or celebrity gossip because i have to avoid anything which features the kardashians . ' mike 's most recent ordeal saw him throw up after accidentally seeing kanye west 's racy music video , ` bound 2 ' , which features a topless kim straddling the singer on a motorbike . he says , ` one day , i was lazing about on the sofa in front of the tv . i was skipping through music channels and that video came on . ` seeing kim naked , with her boobs bouncing about like that brought back memories of that horrendous sex tape . it was like reliving that incident all over again . ` before i knew it , i was sweating like a pig and throwing up . when i hear ` bound 2 ' on the radio now , i have to switch the station immediately . ' mike 's fear of the kardashians has also had disastrous effects on his love life and he was forced to break up with a former boyfriend because of it . mike , who is now single , says , ' a lot of the gay community love the kardashians so it makes dating tough sometimes . i 've been romantically involved with several people who like them and each one of these relationships have ended badly . ` my last boyfriend watched all of their shows and kept up with the celeb gossip surrounding them . he thought the kardashians were fascinating . ` at first , he found my fear funny and kind of cute . but over time , he wanted to talk about the kardashians with me and of course , that 's not something i was really up for doing . ` we had a big argument once when he demanded to watch the latest episode of ` keeping up with the kardashians ' whilst i was with him . ` we had a blazing row in which he called my phobia immature and attention-seeking . i ended up storming out of his flat . ` in the end , it became difficult spending time with him and definitely played a role in our break-up . ' despite the daily afflictions of his phobia , mike has never sought medical help as he is embarrassed of his condition . mike often goes to extreme lengths to avoid the kardashians and relies his friends to check magazines and newspapers before he reads them . he explains , ' i do n't know how i could face a doctor about it . i can just see them laughing in my face the minute i told them about my fear of the kardashians . it would be totally mortifying . ' mike often goes to extreme lengths to avoid the kardashians and relies on the support of his friends . he says , ' i have to get my friends to go through a newspaper or magazine before i read it and rip out any pages which contain pictures of the kardashians . ' mike says he is constantly mocked by his friends who think his phobia is amusing . he explains , ` although my mates are supportive , they always make fun of my fear and play practical jokes on me . ` once , my friend put a picture of kim kardashian on his bathroom door so i could n't go to the loo all night . it was unbearable ! ` another time , one of my mates got drunk at a party and chased after me with a photo of kim 's ` belfie ' on his mobile phone . ` they find it hilarious but they do n't realise how traumatic it is for me . i wish i was n't scared of the kardashians . ' dr slaney , a priory group consultant at priory hospital woking , says : ` it is unusual for someone to have this type of phobia . ` the common phobias are social phobia , agoraphobia and fear of spiders , snakes or aircraft flights . ` it is possible to develop a phobia of almost anything . there does not necessarily have to be a well-defined traumatic experience as there has been in this case . ` usually the main treatment is cognitive behavioural therapy . this helps the person unlearn the unhelpful thinking patterns which are causing them to get so anxious in the relevant situation . ` the patient can be shown practical ways of reducing anxiety when it starts to occur . avoidance of the situation only makes matters worse and needs to be discouraged . ` it is important that things are done step by step . for example therapy here might start with seeing a picture of the celebrity briefly and learning how to limit the anxiety it causes . watching a programme with the celebrity in it would be a task towards the end of therapy . ` we only have a snippet of information here . depending on the full picture , it may be that an antidepressant is appropriate . antidepressants are all anti-anxiety as well so you do not necessarily have to be clinically depressed to benefit from one . ` usually discussing the origins of a phobia is not useful . it is a bit like coming upon a car crash and studying the skid marks rather than helping the injured driver . this particular case is unusual . it sounds as if the patient 's own sexuality may be an issue and it probably does need to be discussed .
