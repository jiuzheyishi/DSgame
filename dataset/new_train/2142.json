{"text": "as 2013 comes to a close , the conventional wisdom is grim : immigration reform is dead . expectations ran high ; this was supposed to be the year . the president promised action , and the 2012 elections drove home the political imperative . but then , after struggling mightily , congress failed to get it done -- again . it hardly matters whether you blame the president , house republicans or the immigration-reform movement . there 's still nothing to show for the year . â $ Žbut once again , as so often with immigration , the conventional wisdom is wrong . politics is n't baseball . the end of the year is n't the end of an inning , wiping out all gains that do n't deliver a man across home plate . passing landmark legislation is more like long-distance running : momentum builds over the long haul , and progress is cumulative . from that perspective , 2013 was a banner year for immigration reform , and we could still win . congress could pass a far-reaching immigration overhaul -- in 2014 . start with the progress made in 2013 . most important was the sea change in the republican party . it started with the 2012 election and the difference latino voters made for president barack obama , but the ferment spread and deepened as the truth sunk in among party regulars over the course of the year . marquee figures like new jersey gov. chris christie showed that the gop can appeal to latinos . he won 51 % of their vote is his reelection bid in november . many , if not most , republicans in congress now grasp that they need to be part of the solution on immigration -- for the good of the party and the country . just look at pronouncements in recent months by house speaker john boehner , house majority leader eric cantor , house gop favorite paul ryan and many others , including some of congress ' most conservative republicans . the pro-immigration-reform movement also looks completely different today than it looked just 12 months ago . a who 's who of american business leaders has come forward to endorse change : from facebook 's mark zuckerberg to the wall street journal 's blue chip ceo council . unlike in years past , when most employers hid from the debate , or at best worked the issue quietly behind the scenes , many companies are now eager to link their names with immigration reform : well-known national companies like caterpillar , marriott and state farm insurance , but also local mom-and-pop businesses like the 100 small business owners from clark county washington who organized this summer to post pro-reform flyers in their shop windows . along with business , there has been an outpouring of support from evangelical ministers . one washington-based group , the evangelical immigration table , claims to have more than 200,000 christian  prayer partners  lined up nationwide . the broader immigration-reform movement does n't always act in its own self-interest : why , for example , the recent capitol hill protest aimed at eric cantor -- one of the leading republican champions of an immigration overhaul ? but together , business and faith voices make a powerful case for reform that combines the economic rationale with a moral imperative . most important , neither of these changes -- in the republican party or the pro-reform movement -- is reversible . this is a shifting of tectonic plates . when much of the national gop , the business establishment and the evangelical movement want something done , it 's probably going to get done eventually . the question is n't if , it 's when . so what 's blocking reform ? the obstacles have little to do with immigration . the problem is the same-old-same-old that 's been blocking virtually all movement in washington this year . it falls under the general rubric of partisan gridlock , but the real sticking points are more localized : bitter mistrust between house republicans and the white house , and a divide within the gop driven by a relatively small handful of lawmakers and outside groups who oppose compromise of any kind on any issue . the good news is that this month 's budget deal suggests that the logjam may be breaking up . together , speaker boehner and rep. ryan defied the  hell no  holdout wing of their party and delivered a compromise budget , even at a time of peak republican mistrust and antipathy for the president . this does n't mean the gop divide has healed -- there were plenty of republicans who opposed the budget deal or went along despite their better judgment . but the vote has raised hope among immigration reformers . can speaker boehner and rep. ryan pull off a similar deal next year on immigration ? many signs suggest they could , including what 's going on behind the scenes among house republicans . it 's well known that two different gop lawmakers are working , separately , on bills that would create a path to citizenship for young people brought to the u.s. illegally as children , the  dreamers .  and several other republicans are working on proposals that would grant legal status to the dreamers ' parents . in other words , more than a half dozen gop congressmen are preparing to sponsor -- or compete to sponsor -- what many in the party would once have called  amnesty  bills . some caveats : house leadership is not going to pass immigration reform over the heads of conservative republicans . it will pass it only with them -- with their support . the house is not going to take up the senate immigration bill . any movement in the house will be piecemeal , smaller measure by smaller measure , each addressing a different aspect of what 's wrong with the immigration system . leadership is not going to waive what 's known as the hastert rule , under which every bill that passes must command a majority of the majority -- at least 118 republican votes . and there will be no path to citizenship for most unauthorized immigrant adults -- it 's going to be enough of a stretch for the house to deliver a path to legal status that stops short of citizenship . even this will be difficult in an election year . the windows to act will be narrow . members will be even more cautious and calculating than usual . and getting reform over the finish line will be a test for democrats as well as republicans . the challenge for the gop will be to pass a package of bills out of the house . the challenge for democrats , in congress and the white house , will be coming together for a deal on legal status rather than citizenship for most unauthorized immigrants . it 's going to be a long year . nothing is guaranteed . but what makes me optimistic is a growing sense of momentum . it 's still slow and low-key , more apparent behind the scenes than in public or in the media . but there 's no question : momentum is building in the house -- 2014 could be the year . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of tamar jacoby .", "summary": " tamar jacoby : at 2013 end , immigration reform seems dead , but it 's not .   she says the year brought big progress , support from ceos , evangelicals , even gop .   she says change slow , but tectonic , likely wo n't include citizenship , but legal status .   jacoby : can house gop , dems compromise ? it will be tricky , but momentum building .
