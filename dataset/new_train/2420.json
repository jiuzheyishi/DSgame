{"text": "with the one-track mind of a 6-year-old , logan interrogated his mother , jenny spencer . why are the other moms skinnier than you ? he asked at the park . if you took weight loss pills , would you be skinny ? he wondered during a tv infomercial . spencer brushed off his questions . he was 6 and curious about the world around him . she was exhausted , trying to care for two young boys and her husband , who had chronic health issues . her own health had fallen to the bottom of the to-do list . but logan 's last question hit her like , well , the elephant in the room . if you got skinny , would you be able to play with me ?  my heart broke ,  spencer wrote on ireport .  and from that moment forward , i began the transformation into a healthier lifestyle for my children .  when spencer stepped on the scale in june 2012 , the number 200 came as no surprise . more than a dozen people had asked her over the past few years whether she was pregnant . two had rubbed her belly when there was no baby at all . the extra weight caused pain in spencer 's hips when she walked , and the doctor warned that she was on the verge of type 2 diabetes . she had tried dieting after her second son , brody , was born . weight watchers helped her drop 10 pounds , but she quickly gained 20 back . her sister ,  a health nut ,  encouraged her to try different cleanses . all left her feeling like a failure . she was depressed , anxious and overwhelmed .  you know , i started every monday dreaming i could change my life ,  spencer remembered .  it was nearly a decade of that .  logan 's question made her realize she was missing her sons ' lives -- and her own . spencer started counting calories , keeping her daily total under 1,500 . she also began going on short walks around the block and parked her car in the farthest spot from the grocery store door . a few months later , spencer and her husband separated . but instead of using food to cope with the rush of emotions as she once would have , spencer turned to exercise .  i used that as more motivation to stay healthy for the boys ,  she said .  my goodness , if i 'm going to have to do this on my own and be an example for them , i have to be strong .  working out was difficult at first ; the pain in her hips prevented her from moving very far , very fast . but over time she joined a walking club at work and started strength training one or two days a week . she focused on losing just 5 pounds at a time , because the thought of losing 60 pounds to reach a healthy bmi was intimidating . reaching each smaller goal inspired her to keep going . by march 2013 , she had lost 64 pounds .  when you 're that heavy , you feel like you 've lost hope ,  spencer said .  when you finally reach your goal , it 's the most amazing thing .  every sunday , the spencer family goes on a 10-mile bike ride near their home in aurora , colorado . they eat no-sugar cereal and skim milk for breakfast , lean cuisine meals or veggie smoothies for lunch , and lean protein with vegetables and brown rice for dinner . water is spencer 's  secret weapon .  her diet has become a lifestyle . she 's careful about what she eats but allows herself treats in moderation . deprivation is not the way to keep the weight off , she knows . spencer 's energy is up , and her pain is gone . but the happiness she feels ca n't compare to the joy on her sons ' faces when she joins them on the playground .  i am able to take my kiddos to the park and actually play with them instead of sitting on the sidelines .
