{"text": "madrid pro-independence parties in catalonia defied the spanish government thursday by announcing in barcelona that they plan to hold a referendum in november on whether the wealthy northeast region should be independent . madrid staunchly opposes the referendum and catalan independence , and a spanish government official rejected the announcement .  the vote will not be held ,  justice minister alberto ruiz-gallardon told reporters thursday in the hallways of spain 's parliament . even supporters admit that there is much to be done before the vote can take place on november 9 , 2014 .  we expect to open negotiations with madrid . the spanish state ca n't be blind about it ,  said joan maria pique , a top aide and spokesman for catalan regional president artur mas , who had a prominent role thursday when his convergence and union party announced the plan with three other parties . they had previously said only that the vote would be sometime in late 2014 . and they also announced the two-part referendum question : . do you want catalonia to become a state ? and if the voter answers yes , then comes this : do you want that state to be independent ? that 's a different formula from the single question that scottish voters are due to get on september 18 : should scotland be an independent country ?  pique said the two-part question in catalonia was the result of negotiations among the four pro-independence parties , but he noted that great britain has agreed to allow the scottish vote on self-determination , while spain has not followed suit yet for catalonia . the spanish government says that catalonia , with 7.5 million people , already has broad home-rule powers , including its own parliament , police force and control over education and health . and madrid insists that the spanish constitution does not allow any of spain 's 17 regions to unilaterally break away , even one like catalonia that has its own flag and language . the four pro-independence catalan parties hold a majority in the catalan regional parliament . there have been mass demonstrations in favor of self-determination on the past two catalan national days on september 11 . this year , hundreds of thousands of people formed a human chain -- from northern catalonia , at the french border , to its southern border with the valencia region -- to drive home the point . last year on september 11 , an estimated 1.5 million people demonstrated in barcelona , the regional capital and spain 's second-largest city , for self-determination . various opinion polls show a very large majority of catalans want the right of self-determination . but if independence makes it to the ballot , polls show the result could be tighter , with some predicting a victory in the 50 % range .", "summary": " referendum is set for november 9 , 2014 , pro-independence parties say .    the vote will not be held ,  justice minister alberto ruiz-gallardon responds .   madrid says nation 's constitution does n't allow regions to unilaterally break away .   there have been mass demonstrations in favor of self-determination .
