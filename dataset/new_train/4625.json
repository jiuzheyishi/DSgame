{"text": "on new year 's day , after months of suffering from debilitating headaches , i learned that i had brain cancer . i was 29 years old . i 'd been married for just over a year . my husband and i were trying for a family . our lives devolved into hospital stays , doctor consultations and medical research . nine days after my initial diagnoses , i had a partial craniotomy and a partial resection of my temporal lobe . both surgeries were an effort to stop the growth of my tumor . in april , i learned that not only had my tumor come back , but it was more aggressive . doctors gave me a prognosis of six months to live . because my tumor is so large , doctors prescribed full brain radiation . i read about the side effects : the hair on my scalp would have been singed off . my scalp would be left covered with first-degree burns . my quality of life , as i knew it , would be gone . after months of research , my family and i reached a heartbreaking conclusion : there is no treatment that would save my life , and the recommended treatments would have destroyed the time i had left . i considered passing away in hospice care at my san francisco bay-area home . but even with palliative medication , i could develop potentially morphine-resistant pain and suffer personality changes and verbal , cognitive and motor loss of virtually any kind . because the rest of my body is young and healthy , i am likely to physically hang on for a long time even though cancer is eating my mind . i probably would have suffered in hospice care for weeks or even months . and my family would have had to watch that . i did not want this nightmare scenario for my family , so i started researching death with dignity . it is an end-of-life option for mentally competent , terminally ill patients with a prognosis of six months or less to live . it would enable me to use the medical practice of aid in dying : i could request and receive a prescription from a physician for medication that i could self-ingest to end my dying process if it becomes unbearable . i quickly decided that death with dignity was the best option for me and my family . we had to uproot from california to oregon , because oregon is one of only five states where death with dignity is authorized . i met the criteria for death with dignity in oregon , but establishing residency in the state to make use of the law required a monumental number of changes . i had to find new physicians , establish residency in portland , search for a new home , obtain a new driver 's license , change my voter registration and enlist people to take care of our animals , and my husband , dan , had to take a leave of absence from his job . the vast majority of families do not have the flexibility , resources and time to make all these changes . i 've had the medication for weeks . i am not suicidal . if i were , i would have consumed that medication long ago . i do not want to die . but i am dying . and i want to die on my own terms . brittany maynard , advocate for ` death with dignity , ' dies . i would not tell anyone else that he or she should choose death with dignity . my question is : who has the right to tell me that i do n't deserve this choice ? that i deserve to suffer for weeks or months in tremendous amounts of physical and emotional pain ? why should anyone have the right to make that choice for me ? opinion : when assisted suicide is not the answer . now that i 've had the prescription filled and it 's in my possession , i have experienced a tremendous sense of relief . and if i decide to change my mind about taking the medication , i will not take it . having this choice at the end of my life has become incredibly important . it has given me a sense of peace during a tumultuous time that otherwise would be dominated by fear , uncertainty and pain . now , i 'm able to move forward in my remaining days or weeks i have on this beautiful earth , to seek joy and love and to spend time traveling to outdoor wonders of nature with those i love . and i know that i have a safety net . dying young and on her own terms . i plan to celebrate my husband 's birthday on october 26 with him and our family . unless my condition improves dramatically , i will look to pass soon thereafter . i hope for the sake of my fellow american citizens that i 'll never meet that this option is available to you . if you ever find yourself walking a mile in my shoes , i hope that you would at least be given the same choice and that no one tries to take it from you . when my suffering becomes too great , i can say to all those i love ,  i love you ; come be by my side , and come say goodbye as i pass into whatever 's next .  i will die upstairs in my bedroom with my husband , mother , stepfather and best friend by my side and pass peacefully . i ca n't imagine trying to rob anyone else of that choice . share your personal essays with cnn ireport .", "summary": " married for a year , brittany maynard , 29 , found she had aggressive brain cancer .   she had six months to live , and she did n't want her family to watch her dying in pain .   maynard and her family moved to oregon to take advantage of the death with dignity law .   she says nobody has the right to take away the option from someone who is terminally ill .
