{"text": "it was a frigid june night at pickstone mine in zimbabwe when 67-year-old angela campbell -- soaking wet , her arm broken and a gun to her head -- signed a document vowing to give up the fight for her family 's farm . angela campbell , 67 , was beaten and kidnapped days after zimbabwe 's runoff election . the kidnappers demanding her signature at gunpoint were  war veterans  from president robert mugabe 's heyday as a liberation hero , and they made it clear that her refusal would mean more beatings . though campbell signed the document , her son-in-law said she has no intention of giving up her battle ; campbell 's family will be in windhoek , namibia , on wednesday to present arguments to a southern african development community tribunal . in pursuing the case , the campbells and 77 fellow zimbabwean farmers are risking theft , torture and death for what may be their only remaining chance to save the homes and farms so coveted by mugabe and his loyalists . mugabe blames the west for his nation 's soaring inflation and poverty . but analysts say mugabe 's 2000  resettlement  policy , in which property was snatched from white farmers and redistributed to landless blacks , is more to blame for the country 's turmoil . watch a report from the time of the campbell attack   all i want to see is justice ,  said richard etheredge , 72 , a white farmer who was evicted from his farm last month .  the world can not carry on with criminals .  on june 15 , etheredge , who has joined the case , and his family received word that a zimbabwean senator planned to take over his chegutu farm , a process known as  jambanja .   we 're going to murder you if we catch you ,  etheredge recalls an assailant yelling from outside his son 's house two days later . the senator bused  criminals  to his property , etheredge said . etheredge , his wife and one of his twin sons escaped , but the other twin and etheredge 's daughter-in-law were later beaten , he said . looters stole his computers , farm equipment , antiques , custom gun collection and a safe with billions in zimbabwean currency -lrb- hundreds of thousands in u.s. dollars -rrb- . etheredge said he watched the thieves abscond with his possessions in vehicles belonging to the senator . the looters also caused about $ 1 million in damage to his property , which includes three houses and a fruit-packing plant that was once among the most sophisticated in southern africa . the etheredges have been farming for 17 years and , before the attack , were producing 400,000 cartons of navel oranges and kumquats a year , he said .  the destruction is absolutely incredible ,  etheredge said . mugabe 's cronies visited the adjacent mount carmel farm about two weeks later , just days after mugabe won a majority of votes in a runoff denounced as a  sham  by the international community . watch how violence persists after the election  like the etheredges , mike and angela campbell were warned that mugabe loyalists , members of his zimbabwe african national union-patriotic front , were planning to invade their farm . the government had given the 1,200-hectare -lrb- 2,965-acre -rrb- tract to a zanu-pf spokesman who also served as mugabe 's biographer , according to the campbells ' son-in-law , ben freeth . two nuns went to mount carmel on june 26 , the day before the runoff , wanting to buy sweet potatoes , freeth said . but their quest for tubers was a ruse ; they actually wanted to tell freeth that zanu-pf members were planning to raid the campbell land , where the campbells and freeth and his wife , laura , live . on june 29 , freeth received a phone call :  war veterans ,  as the clans of pro-mugabe thugs call themselves , were heading to his in-laws ' house . laura and her brother , bruce , gathered their children . laura fled with the children through a fence on the northern boundary of mount carmel farm , freeth said . freeth jumped in his car and sped 1 1/2 kilometers to the campbell house .  these guys had already arrived , and they started shooting at me as soon as i drove through the gate ,  he said . the bullets missed , but one of the war veterans hurled a rock through the driver 's side window , smashing freeth 's right eye shut .  they dragged me out of the vehicle and began beating me over the head with rifle butts ,  freeth said . the men tied up freeth , he said , and took him to where his in-laws were lying bound on the gravel outside their home . angela campbell was still conscious . the men had caught her on her way to feed a calf . they had beaten her and broken her upper arm in two places , freeth said . mike campbell was in bad shape ,  just groaning on the ground ; in fact , he remembers nothing .  the heavily armed men threw the three in the back of mike campbell 's toyota prado truck , and  the next nine hours were quite a nightmare ,  freeth said . freeth and the campbells were driven about 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- to pickstone mine . their captors stopped at a dairy farm on the way and killed a white farmer 's dogs , freeth said . night had fallen by the time they arrived at the mine to find about 60 men in zanu-pf regalia waiting for them .  they were pointing guns at us the whole time , telling us they were going to kill us ,  freeth said . freeth and the campbells were doused with cold water and left  shivering in the dust on the ground ,  freeth said . they received more beatings , and freeth said one of their captors thrashed the bottom of his feet with a shambock , a whip made of hippopotamus hide . it was during this time that their captors made angela sign a document promising to drop the case scheduled this week before the tribunal . mike campbell moved in and out of consciousness , as ben and angela prayed -- not for their lives , but for their captors . freeth said he had never understood luke 6:28 --  bless those who curse you  -- until that moment , and a  supernatural  peace came over him . freeth told god ,  if i 'm going to be with you today , then i 'm ready .  it was almost midnight when freeth and the campbells -- still bound -- were tossed in the back of the prado . they bounced around the sport-utility vehicle as their captors drove 30 kilometers down a craggy dirt road to kadoma , where they were dumped in the streets .  i managed to walk toward a light and knocked on the door of a house and used the phone to phone my wife ,  freeth said . the campbells were released from the hospital last week . both remain weak and still bear considerable scrapes and bruises . angela has a pin in her arm . mike , 75 , suffered four broken ribs , a broken collarbone and a dislocated finger . mike is recovering just enough to sit up , and  he can walk a few paces ,  freeth said monday , complaining that his hands were  still tingly  from being bound so tightly . the hospital released freeth at the weekend after neurosurgeons had to drill a 4-centimeter -lrb- 1 1/2 - inch -rrb- hole in his skull to relieve pressure from a hematoma stemming from the rock and rifle-butt blows to the head . one thing not battered is the farmers ' resolve to remain on the land that the campbells have owned for 34 years .  we intend to be there on wednesday , and we just hope for an outcome that is good for everyone , an outcome for justice ,  freeth said of the hearing , which is slated to last through friday . freeth said he believes that the tribunal will carry more clout with mugabe than do western nations and the african and european unions . many of its member nations are led by mugabe 's contemporaries , and mugabe is aware that his status as an african hero is waning , he said .  i think it means a lot to him whether sadc is going to isolate him or continue to support him ,  freeth said .  once we get to the sadc tribunal and we get a judgment and it 's basically binding in black and white , it 's going to be difficult for mugabe to say , ` we 're abiding by our own law . ' it 's going to be very difficult for him to defend what he 's doing .
