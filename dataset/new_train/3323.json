{"text": "the mysterious properties of asteroids have long confounded astronomers , despite the billions spent in research . scientists believe they the materials deep within an asteroid 's core could help unlock the secrets to how planets , like earth , form . now a group of researchers has come one step closer to understanding these enigmatic objects by finding the first ever evidence that asteroids can have a highly varied internal structure . scroll down for video ... scientists have found the first evidence that asteroids can have a highly varied internal structure . pictured here is a schematic view of asteroid itokawa . the asteroid surface has two distinct surface types : a smooth zone with a layer of sand or gravel on the surface , and a bumpy zone , covered with a great number of rocks . the discovery was made by a team of astronomers at kent university who found that different parts of a near-earth asteroid - called itokawa - have different densities . using telescope images from 2001 to 2013 , dr stephen measured the speed peanut-shaped itokawa spins and how its spin rate is changing over time . they combined these delicate observations with new theoretical work on how asteroids radiate heat . this provided the space scientists with a unique opportunity to explore its interior , revealing the complexity within its core and secrets about its formation . using images taken over 12 years , astronomers at kent university have found that different parts of a near-earth asteroid - called itokawa -lrb- pictured -rrb- - have different densities . the itokawa asteroid was discovered in 1998 by the linear mission . in august 2003 , it was officially named after hideo itokawa , a japanese rocket scientist . the asteroid surface has two distinct surface types : a smooth zone with a layer of sand or gravel on the surface , and a bumpy zone , covered with a great number of rocks . in 2000 , it was selected as the target of japan 's hayabusa mission . the probe arrived in the vicinity of itokawa on 12 september 2005 . the probe collected samples from the surface and returned them to earth for analysis . scientists were able to piece together the impact history of itokawa , showing that that the asteroid had been shaped by collisions with objects ranging in size from 10 kilometers down to a nanometre . ` this is the first time we have ever been able to determine what it is like inside an asteroid . we can see that this asteroid has a highly varied structure , ' said dr lowry . ` this finding is a significant step forward in our understanding of rocky bodies in our solar system . ' the spin of an asteroid and other small bodies in space can be affected by sunlight . this phenomenon , known as the yorp effect , occurs when absorbed photons from the sun are re-emitted from the surface of the object in the form of heat . when the shape of the asteroid is very irregular the heat is not radiated evenly and this creates a tiny , but continuous , torque on the body and changes its spin rate . dr lowry 's team measured that the yorp effect was slowly accelerating the speed at which it spins . the change in rotation speed is tiny -- only around 45 milliseconds per year - and was far from expected . scientists suspected itokawa 's ` bi-lobed ' or ` peanut-like ' appearance is the result of two bodies of very different densities , that came together at some point in its ancient history . this research is the first time that astronomers have found evidence for the highly-varied internal structure of asteroids . the itokawa asteroid , which looks like a peanut , was discovered in 1998 by the linear mission . in august 2003 , it was officially named after hideo itokawa , a japanese rocket scientist . up until now , asteroid interiors could only be inferred using rough overall-density measurements . this rare glimpse into the diverse innards of asteroid itokawa has led to much speculation regarding its formation . one possibility is that its origins lie within the catastrophic collapse of a double asteroid , also known as a binary asteroid system . ` finding asteroids which do n't have homogenous interiors has far-reaching implications , particularly for models of binary asteroid formation , ' said dr lowry . ` it could also help with work on asteroid mitigation , or to plan future trips to these rocky bodies . ' this new ability to probe the interior of an asteroid - without the need for a visiting spacecraft with penetrating radar - is a significant step forward , and may unlock many secrets of asteroids in the future . this rare glimpse into the diverse innards of asteroid itokawa has led to much speculation regarding its formation . one possibility is that its origins lie within the catastrophic collapse of a double asteroid , also known as a binary asteroid system .", "summary": " using images taken over 12 years , astronomers found that different parts of a near-earth asteroid - called itokawa - have different densities .   images were combined with theoretical work on how asteroids radiate heat .   when the shape of the asteroid is irregular the heat is radiated unevenly .   this creates a continuous , torque on the body and changes its spin rate .   the findings could help scientists plan better predict an asteroid impact .
