{"text": "thousands of soldiers -- including some recently back from action in afghanistan -- were axed yesterday . as almost 4,500 service personnel received redundancy letters , the head of the army admitted the biggest round of defence cuts yet was straining morale . only troops recuperating from a serious injury or preparing for , serving on or recovering from operations were exempt from the cuts . cuts : a total of 4,480 soldiers have been told their job is being axed under deep cuts to the army . but soldiers who were serving on the battlefield as recently as last month could find themselves booted out of the military . but the government was accused of a . ` failed strategy ' as it launched a recruitment drive to find 10,000 . extra troops , many as reservists . defence secretary philip hammond yesterday insisted there will be no further reductions in manpower in the next round of spending cuts for 2015-16 . the latest tranche of 4,480 job cuts was lower than the 5,300 soldiers expected , as mr hammond sought to blame the last labour government for the reductions . he said : ` it is with great regret that we have had to make redundancies to deliver the reduction in the size of the armed forces , but unfortunately they were unavoidable due to the size of the defence deficit that this government inherited . cuts : by 2018 there will be 82,000 regulars and 30,000 reservists in the army , under government plans . ` although smaller , our armed forces will be more flexible and agile to reflect the challenges of the future with the protection and equipment they need . ` they will continue to be the bedrock of our society and provide extremely rewarding and exciting careers for future recruits . ' the mod said personnel selected for redundancy would be told face to face by their commanding officer . it said it had done everything to avoid ` non-applicant ' redundancies , and 84 % of those losing their jobs in the latest tranche had applied for redundancy . those who applied for voluntary redundancy will leave on or before december 17 this year , and those who did not will leave on or before june 17 2014 . soldiers who did not apply and are currently serving , preparing for or recovering from operations where they receive an operational allowance , such as afghanistan , are exempt , as are those recovering from serious injuries sustained on operations . the mod said the army will need to make further reductions to reach its final target of 82,000 , likely to involve a further tranche for army personnel , and a small number of medical and dental personnel from the royal navy and royal air force . chief of the general staff general sir peter wall said : ` this redundancy scheme is a difficult but essential step towards our a2020 structure . we owe our sincere gratitude to those leaving the army for their service over such a demanding period of operations . ` we will support them and their families as best we can on their path to civilian life . meanwhile we continue to need plenty of young and talented recruits to ensure the army is fit to meet the challenges of the future . ' today 's losses are the third instalment of job cuts arising from the 2010 strategic defence and security review and confined to the army . last week , david cameron was forced to respond to fears raised by military top brass over defence cuts , after general sir peter wall said any gap between military resources and planned capabilities caused by spending cuts ` could become quite dangerous , quite quickly ' . but mr cameron insisted that britain 's forces are among the best-funded in the world , saying that ` difficult decisions ' were being taken under the coalition 's austerity programme and no department is immune from making savings . the latest round of cuts come after the army launched a recruitment drive last month to help find 10,000 personnel , with a television campaign and army jobs advertised in job centres . reservists : labour accused the government of pursuing a ` failed strategy ' which failed to replace sacked regulars with enough reservists to ensure britain 's military capabilities . ahead of today 's announcement , shadow defence secretary jim murphy said the redundancy notices issued today ` represent not just broken promises but a failing strategy ' to reform the british army . he said : ` the government has a flawed plan for reforming the british army . there is a huge effort going into sacking soldiers but nowhere near as much is being done to plug the gap by recruiting new reservists . ` these redundancies represent not just broken promises but a failing strategy , and the level of voluntary applicants will be a signal of morale . ' seizing on sir peter 's comments , mr murphy said : ` senior army figures are right to warn that ministers ' decisions could lead to a mismatch between capability and ambition . ` labour knows that difficult decisions need to be made , and accepts this means smaller services than in 2010 . far from having balanced the defence budget , however , ministers ' failed economic plan means long-term decisions in defence will be required . ` despite their claims , ministers have failed to put defence on a stable footing . ' answering questions in the commons yesterday , mr hammond said savings demanded of his department in this month 's spending review would not require further cuts to the size of the armed forces . mr hammond said the mod would meet its share of the # 11.5 billion in cuts across government demanded by chancellor george osborne through efficiency savings . the defence secretary told the commons the mod was ` not looking at changes that will reduce military manpower ' .", "summary": " ministry of defence issues redundancy notices to 4,480 troops .   ministers blame labour for leaving finances in a mess .
