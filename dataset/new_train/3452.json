{"text": "like many of those facing a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis , barry rudd was willing to try anything to be well again . the property developer from huntingdon , cambridgeshire , had been an avid three-times-a-week gym-goer when , in 2004 , he was given the devastating news . just 53 at the time , he had started feeling tired , and his foot began dragging when he walked . after being referred to a neurologist in june 2005 , the diagnosis was finally given : primary progressive multiple sclerosis . ms sufferer barry rudd , pictured with his wife lorraine at their home in cambridgeshire , who has been refused the cannabis spray sativex . one of the more uncommon forms of the disease , affecting only 15 per cent of sufferers , it causes a steady decline as symptoms worsen . the condition , in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system , slowly robs sufferers of their balance , movement and speech , causing stiffness , numbness , insomnia , pain and exhaustion . there was little doctors could do to help barry and he was drawn by desperation into the murky world of alternative medicine -- paying more than # 20,000 for bogus treatments in holland and poland that had no effect on his condition . finally , in late 2010 he saw an article online about a new drug called sativex . the oral spray is derived from the cannabis plant -- but without any of the associated dangers or side effects -- and works by dampening down the over-activity in the nervous system that damages the muscles , inhibiting movement . ` i mentioned it to my neurologist , who said ,  you ca n't get it in this area . if you want it you have to buy it privately .  so he gave me a private prescription . i went to my local chemist who charged me # 550 . ' the supply lasted just six weeks , but the effects were almost immediate . ` within a few days i could feel the benefit and after a couple of weeks my symptoms were almost completely gone . i 'd say i was 80 per cent better , ' says barry . but , unable to get an nhs prescription , . after three months barry could no longer afford the treatment . his . symptoms flooded back . to add to his misery , he found that a few miles . away at addenbrooke 's hospital in cambridge , ms patients with symptoms . similar to his are being prescribed the drug . the cannabis spray sativex has n't been assessed by the national institute for health and clinical excellence so funding decisions for the drug are not uniform across the nhs . according to dr willy notcutt , consultant in pain management at james paget hospital in great yarmouth , sativex can not only alleviate existing problems but could hold back the progression of ms. ` sativex is licensed only for the relief of spasticity -lsb- tightness in the muscles that affect movement -rsb- and found effective in half of cases , ' he says . ` many patients have discovered what barry did : it also relieves other symptoms , such as chronic insomnia . ' a major review of trials last december concluded there was insufficient evidence to warrant sativex 's routine use with ms , yet dr notcutt is convinced of its effectiveness . ` we found that patents have substantially improved sleep , ' he says . ` studies on animals have shown some reduction in disease progression . we know it has an effect on protecting the nervous system . ' the problems have arisen because of the way certain clinical commissioning groups -lrb- ccgs -- the bodies that have replaced primary care trusts -rrb- do their sums . a single bottle costing # 125 will contain 90 sprays . the drug has not yet been assessed by the nhs guidance body , the national institute for health and clinical excellence -- which means funding decisions are not uniform across ccgs . the result is that it is not being prescribed widely . earlier this year , british charity the ms society found that just two in 100 patients were using a symptom-reducing treatment such as sativex . laura weir , head of policy and campaigns at the ms society , says : ` we know that sativex is not being prescribed in some areas and in other areas it is . we think this is down to ccgs making their own decisions at a local level . ' in 2011 the midlands therapeutic review and advisory committee -- an independent advisory group that provides guidance on pharmaceutical treatments in the west midlands -- recommended against prescribing sativex , stating there was ` inadequate evidence for efficacy and/or safety ' . weir insists : ` their decision , which has triggered similar ones elsewhere , is based on inaccurate analysis of the data , and on the cost impact of the treatment rather than cost effectiveness . we wrote to them to highlight this but the committee has not reviewed the policy . ` prescription rates for sativex in the uk are low . it is a licensed treatment for ms and has undergone extensive clinical testing that found it to be safe and effective . we strongly believe eligible people should be given the opportunity to try treatments that could benefit them . ' barry turned to a nurse for advice . ` she told me other patients buy cannabis and mix it into cakes . ' he refuses to consider this option . ` if there 's a drug that 's legal -- sativex -- and that works for me , why ca n't i get it on the nhs ? the future for me looks grim . ' dr notcutt is equally angry . he says : ` when you find patients , as i have , whose lives are transformed by this drug you 're left wondering : are we prepared as a society to leave people in often agonising pain ? or do we provide them with a medicine that might help them ? ' the virus trigger . ms is believed to be genetic -- but not necessarily inherited -- and triggered by environmental factors such as viruses and a lack of vitamin d. only two per cent of britain 's 100,000 ms sufferers have a parent with the disease .", "summary": " barry rudd was just 53 when he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis .   his uncommon form of the disease affects just 15 per cent of sufferers .   mr rudd was refused sativex on the nhs while sufferers living a few miles away are being prescribed the cannabis spray .   the drug has n't been assessed   excellence -- meaning funding decisions are not uniform across nhs .   mssociety.org.uk .
