{"text": "david gauke said he is ` pleased ' with how things were going despite the confusion . tory voters will be the hardest hit when child benefit is axed for higher earners . figures obtained by the daily mail reveal that the conservative heartlands in the south east will be the biggest losers when the changes come into force on monday . nine of the top ten constituencies where most letters have been sent out warning that families will lose the benefit are in conservative safe seats in london and the home counties . the revelations will reinforce the concerns of some tory mps that the government is gratuitously offending its own supporters with the raid on child benefit . yesterday , the treasury admitted more than 300,000 taxpayers -- out of an estimated 1.2 million who are affected -- have not yet been informed by her majesty 's revenue and customs that they are set to lose out . despite the confusion , treasury minister david gauke insisted he was pleased with the way things were unfolding . he insisted there is no obligation to contact people and said they could always get the information from the hm revenue and customs website instead . the treasury has sent out 750,000 warning letters to families saying they could be affected by the cut and warning them that they have to complete a self-assessment tax form . but with just days to go before changes to the system on january 7 , only 182,199 of those affected have opted out of receiving the benefit altogether , rather than fill in self-assessment forms . yet mr gauke , exchequer secretary to the treasury , told sky news that this was a ` good response ' and ` slightly more ' than expected . he said : ` so far we are getting a good response -- slightly more people have opted out of child benefit than we had expected and that suggests the message is getting across even though not everyone will have got a letter . ' but another 316,000 families , where one parent earns at least # 50,000 , may have no idea that they will be stripped of part or all of the benefit . at present , all parents with young children are given the benefit worth # 20.30 a week for the first child and # 13.40 for each subsequent child . for a couple with two children , it is worth # 1,752 a year . but from sunday , families where one parent earns between # 50,000 and # 60,000 will have the handout reduced . families where one parent earns more than # 60,000 will lose the benefit entirely . unless parents opt to stop receiving the benefit entirely , those losing all or part of it will have to fill in a tax form . of the 750,000 letters sent out the most -- 169,000 -- went to households in the south east , with another 132,000 to homes in london , 92,000 to families in the east of england and 62,000 to households in the north west . at the other end of the scale , just 13,600 were sent to homes in northern ireland and 18,000 in the north east . two of the top ten constituencies with most people hit by the child benefit cut are home to tory cabinet ministers , health secretary jeremy hunt in south west surrey and home secretary theresa may in maidenhead . the constituencies of jeremy hunt and theresa may are among those that will be most hit by the cut . the only non-conservative seat in the top ten is twickenham , held by lib dem business secretary vince cable . the first constituency outside the south of england to appear on the list of 651 constituencies , in 30th place , is altrincham and sale west , near manchester , which saw 3,080 letters delivered . at the bottom of the list is glasgow north east , where just 110 homes received letters . speaking about the households who have not yet received letters , mr gauke said hmrc does not have the information necessary to contact people whose circumstances have changed over the past year . chuka umunna said one third of recipients who will lose out on child benefit will not be told and will get a ` horrible surprise ' the minister , who has previously accused critics of the child benefit cut of ` fiscal nimbyism ' , added : ` hmrc does n't normally write to everybody , every time there is a tax change that affects them . if people have n't received a letter , that does n't mean they ca n't visit the hmrc website . ` after sunday , if people have n't opted out then they 'll need to make sure they are in the self-assessment system . ' a treasury spokesman insisted the cuts were necessary , adding : ` we have always been clear those with the broadest shoulders should carry the greatest burden when it comes to balancing the nation 's books . ` those liable for the removal of child benefit fall in the top 15 per cent of earners and nearly half of the households affected by this change have a household income of more than # 100,000 . ' but labour business spokesman . described it as ` extraordinary ' that a third of current child benefit . recipients who will lose out this year will not be informed by hmrc and . are ` going to get a horrible surprise ' . he . added : ` you 've still got this ridiculous situation where if you are a . one-earner family where one person is earning # 50,000 you lose all of . your child benefit , but if you 're a two-earner family where each of you . is earning , say , # 40,000 , a combined income of # 80,000 , you get to keep . your child benefit . this is an extraordinary state of affairs . '", "summary": " families with one parent earning more than # 60,000 will lose child benefit .   those with one earner of # 50,000 will see cut in the benefit from sunday .   tory voters will be the hardest hit by the changes .   treasury admits 300,000 people have not yet been told they will be affected .   but treasury minister david gauke insisted he was pleased with progress .
