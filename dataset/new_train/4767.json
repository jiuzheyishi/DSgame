{"text": "this was a not a normal reserve team fixture for english second-tier club doncaster rovers . for a start , a bevvy of teenage girls started arriving ahead of their development squad 's clash with rotherham around midday . and when the teams finally took to the field , a crowd of around 5,000 fans had amassed for a fixture that would usually attract only a handful of diehard supporters . but then , it is n't every day that louis tomlinson -- one fifth of the most popular boy band on the planet -- is the star attraction . a mixture of applause and high-pitched screaming greeted the one direction singer , who signed a deal with his home-town club last august , when he was introduced as a substitute . try as he might , the 22-year-old could n't break the deadlock as the match petered out into a goalless draw .  just pulling on the shirt is just a boyhood dream ,  he told the club 's official website after getting 25 minutes of action in the match that helped support a local charity .  it 's absolutely amazing , those boys get to do that every week and it really is such an honor to be involved in a club , where i spent most of my childhood going down to the games .  one direction were formed through british talent show x-factor in 2010 and have broken record after record since -- their success stateside even being compared to that of the beatles . tomlinson stars alongside zayn malik , harry styles , niall horan and liam payne in the band , who are managed by music mogul simon cowell . they are the only uk band to have had their first two albums reach no. 1 in the u.s and have a combined 98 million followers on twitter . tomlinson 's hectic schedule with the band had prevented him making his debut before now , and he spent a month training with the club before wednesday 's bow . one previous high-profile appearance in an all-star charity match ended prematurely when he was tackled strongly by gabriel agbonlahor -- leading to a wave of abuse on social media for the aston villa star .  i had to get fit first , because a few people saw what happened last time when agbonlahor nobbled me and that was a bit of a mare and i had to try and avoid that ,  tomlinson added .  i did alright in the end i think . i think its really important that when we are lucky enough to be in the position that we are in , to use that for the greater good .  it is really important to spread the word about -lrb- children 's hospice -rrb- bluebell wood because they are such a great , great charity .  so could tomlinson be persuaded to put his pop career on hold in a bid to try and make it full time with doncaster ? when asked if it was easier being a pop star than a footballer he replied :  physically it is much easier is being on stage and singing because those boys are proper athletes -- football is harder .  to get an insight into the football world has been fascinating and to be invited into that is such an honor .  i have really enjoyed it and i ca n't thank the people enough at doncaster rovers for having me .
