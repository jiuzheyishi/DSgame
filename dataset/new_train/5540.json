{"text": "the uk independence party could help form the next government , leader nigel farage claimed today . despite not having a single mp in parliament , mr farage claimed his party 's trajectory could mean he plays the role of deciding who becomes prime minister in the event of another hung parliament . the extraordinary boast comes as david cameron tries to see off the electoral threat posed by the eurosceptic party with a landmark speech in the netherlands on tory policy for britain 's future relationship with brussels . ukip leader nigel farage claimed he could help form a coalition in the event of another hung parliament in 2015 . tensions have been growing between the conservatives and ukip after mr farage 's party 's poll ratings soared , reaching 16 per cent in a poll yesterday -- up from 4.5 per cent a year ago . mr cameron yesterday branded ukip ` pretty odd people ' in a fresh attack which mr farage had suggested would make an electoral pact before polling day impossible . but the ukip boss said that if the progress in the polls continues , he could help form the next government if there was another hung parliament . ` do n't think about ukip forming the government in 2015 but if we continue at anything like our current progress , who knows ? ` the  first-past-the-post  system is brutal to a party like us , we 've got a lot of work to do on that and to build up our stronger areas , but who 's to say that in 2015 ukip may well be needed in a coalition ? ' however , he warned against getting carried away by good poll ratings . ` when david steel said to the liberal party  go home and prepare for government  , it made him a laughing stock and people are still laughing at him about that now . ` we 've got to keep our feet on the ground . we are making progress , we 're not yet a party that is poised to take government in this country , ' he told bbc radio 4 . ` we are a voice for good , ordinary people in this country , we are not hidebound by political correctness , we 've proved ourselves to be great campaigners , let 's see how the ukip story evolves . ' david cameron took a swipe at ukip supporters , branding them ` pretty odd people ' as former labour minister lord mandelson warned putting a question mark over britain 's eu membership was ` economically insane ' ukip are predicted to win the european parliament elections in 2014 and beaten both tory and lib dem candidates in by-elections . a survation survey for the mail on sunday put labour on 38 per cent , the tories on 29 , ukip on 16 and the lib dems on 11 . translated . into votes at the next general election , that would cost the . conservatives 51 seats and present labour with a thumping victory and an . overall majority of 94 . mr cameron renewed his attack on ukip yesterday , saying it contains some ` pretty odd people ' . he spoke as a poll suggested that the anti-brussels party is enjoying record support , at 16 per cent , taking third place from the lib dems . asked yesterday on the bbc about his previous description of ukip supporters as ` fruitcakes , loonies and closet racists ' , mr cameron said : ` there are some pretty odd people . ' but mr farage hit back : ` do i want a party where we 've got some eccentrics and occasionally someone causes us an embarrassment -- or do i want a party made up of a bland lot of ghastly people whose names i do n't even know ? ` i 'm in politics , and i 've never heard of half the mps who come on the telly . i meet them at cocktail parties and after 30 minutes i ca n't remember their name , ' he told the guardian . the prime minister is expected to give a major speech on repatriating powers from brussels in the netherlands before the end of the month . he will rule out the idea of leaving the eu to become a trading partner , like norway , and instead advocate using moves by eurozone countries towards closer integration to bring powers back to london . the ` fresh settlement ' would then be put to british voters in a referendum . but today former labour business secretary lord mandelson , an ex-european commissioner , warned the prime minister not to think he can '  put a gun ' to the heads of eu leaders over repatriating powers . in an article for the guardian he wrote : ` the prime minister seems to think he can only pacify his party by conceding to anti-europeans their long coveted referendum . ' i think his hopes for buying peace will be disappointed . the tories risk dividing into irreconcilable factions , those who want to adjust the terms of britain 's eu membership in order to stay in , and those who will do everything they can to get britain out . ` that 's what happens when madness takes over a political party . ask anyone who was in the labour party in the 1980s . ` beginning 2013 by placing this large and indefinite question mark over our membership of the eu , and all the trade and investment privileges it brings us , can only be described as economically insane .
