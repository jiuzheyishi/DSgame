{"text": "google has filed a patent that could let users unlock their smartphones and tablets using facial expressions rather than typing in passwords . the latest google android devices already have a built-in face unlock feature that uses facial recognition to unlock their handsets , but this patent would take the technology a step further adding additional ` liveness ' features . when google launched face unlock in 2011 , as part of android ice cream sandwich , it was criticised by security experts because it could be bypassed by holding static photos up to the phone or tablet 's camera . if a patent filed by google is approved , it could mean users would be able to unlock their smartphones by pulling faces such as frowning , smiling , poking out their tongue , wrinkling their nose , blinking and so on . the technology would compare the facial expression pulled with a previously captured photo and if the expressions matched , the user would be allowed access to their device . in the update to android jelly bean in july 2012 , google added a ` liveness ' check in an attempt to prevent these static images being used to gain access to devices . this meant a user would have to blink while using face unlock to prove they were alive . however , even this could be bypassed using clever photo editing tricks . according to google 's latest u.s patent , the new system would require users to pull a specific , predeterminded facial expression . to get access to a device the user would have to pull a specific predeterminded facial expression . the expression would then be scanned and compared to a previously captured photo to confirm the user 's identity . facial expressions listed include blinking , frowning , smiling , sticking out a tongue , wrinkling a nose and raising an eyebrow . the patent explains there would be a . small margin of error but the user 's expression would have to match the . original photo as closely as possible . the technology would then check for ` liveness ' - a signal that shows the user is alive and moving and not a static image . it would scan for changes in pixels and light to monitor and recognise the changes in the location of the facial features . for example , if a blink is used to gain access the . technology would record the light from the eye and then monitor if this . light changes , suggesting the eye has been closed . this ` live ' movement is then given a score based on how similar it is to the original image . if the score reaches the minimum security threshold , the phone is unlocked . if it does n't the user is denied access and has to try again . the expression would then be scanned and compared to a previously captured photo to confirm the user 's identity . the patent said : ` the anti-spoofing techniques herein may use . facial gestures such as blinks , . winks , and other gestures that may be performed within the confines of a . human face . ' -lsb- the device -rsb- may detect facial gestures associated . with various facial features . examples include one or both eyes -lrb- e.g. , . for blinks , winks , etc. -rrb- , the mouth area -lrb- e.g. , for gestures including . smiling , frowning , displaying a user 's teeth , extending a user 's tongue , . etc. -rrb- , the nose -lrb- e.g. , for a nose wrinkle gesture , etc. -rrb- , the forehead . -lrb- e.g. , for a forehead wrinkle gesture , etc. -rrb- , one or both eyebrows -lrb- for . eyebrow raise and compression gestures , etc. -rrb- , and various others . ' google already lets its users enable two-step verification for their online accounts , and offers face unlock on android . with face unlock , pictured , android users can use their face to unlock their smartphone or tablet , in place of a pin or a pattern . the patent explains there would be a small margin of error but the user 's expression would have to match the original photo as closely as possible . a chart in the patent shows that the technology would capture the first facial image and compare it to the photo on file . it would then check for ` liveness ' . according to the patent : ` in the example of the . blink gesture , corresponding pixel locations of the . first and second sub-images may represent portions of the corneas and . the eyelids , respectively . ` additionally , the eyelids may include less . pixel transitions than the corneas . ` more specifically , a cornea may . display pixel transitions -lrb- e.g. , contrasting colors -rrb- with respect to two . or more of the sclera , iris , and pupil . images in the google 's patent , pictured , filed to the u.s patent and trademark office , show that the technology scans the eyes and other features for changes in pixels and light fluctuations . these changes can be used to track movement . if the changes caused by the facial expression do n't match the photo on file the user will be denied access to their device . ` conversely , an eyelid may . display pixel transitions only at its upper bound -lrb- relative to the . eyebrow -rrb- and lower bound -lrb- relative to the eyelash -rrb- . ' this means the device would check for the location of light and pixels relative to a person 's face and their facial features . if a blink is used to gain access , for example , the technology would record the light from the eye and then monitor if this light changes , suggesting the eye had been closed . google added a ` liveness ' check feature to android jelly bean . this means users have to blink when using face unlock to prove they are not a photo in order to get access to their device . this ` live ' movement is then given a score based on how similar it is to the original image . if the score reaches the minimum security threshold , the phone is unlocked . if it does n't the user is denied access and has to try again . the patent does n't explain how many times a user can try to access the device before it is permanently locked , not does it say if there is a failsafe technique if the user ca n't get in . the patent is still waiting for approval and google declined to comment on the plans , including when its likely to be available if it gets approval . motorola announced in may it was also looking at alternatives to the traditional passwords using physical authentication . among the ideas discussed at the d11 . conference in california were electronic tattoos and . pills that people swallow . the . tattoos , developed by massachusetts-based engineering firm mc10 , . contain flexible electronic circuits that are attached to the wearer 's . skin using a rubber stamp . motorola . claimed that the circuits , which also contain antennae and built-in . sensors , could be adapted to work with mobile phones and tablets . this image shows the various parts that make up the mc10 electronic tattoo called the biostamp . it can be stuck to the body using a rubber stamp , and protected using spray-on bandages . the circuit can be worn for two weeks and motorola believes this makes it perfect for authentication purposes . the mobile devices could then be used to confirm the owner 's identity and log them in to accounts automatically . another idea presented during the keynote talk at the wall street journal conference with head of motorola dennis woodside and . senior vice president for advanced technology and products , regina dugan , was a swallowable pill . the proteus digital health pill has . already been approved by the u.s. food and drug adminstration and was given european regulatory approval in 2010 . it contains a computer chip that can be powered like a battery using the acid in the wearer 's stomach . once . swallowed the ` vitamin authentication pill ' creates an 18-bit ecg-like . signal inside the wearer 's body that can be picked up by mobile devices . and authentication hardware outside . this could be used verify the wearer is the correct owner of the device or account . a similar idea teased by motorola during talk last year was a swallowable pill -lrb- picutred -rrb- . it contains a computer chip powered like a battery using the acid in the wearer 's stomach . once swallowed the ` vitamin authentication pill ' creates an 18-bit ecg-like signal that can be picked up by mobile devices .", "summary": " google has filed a patent that could let phones recognise its owner using facial expressions .   the technology can register blinks , frowns , wrinkled noses and smiles .   it has been filed to stop people being able to bypass facial recognition passwords using photos .
