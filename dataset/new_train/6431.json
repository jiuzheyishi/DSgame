{"text": "nasa 's latest solar observatory has captured footage of the sun belching out a stream of charged particles at 1.5 million miles per hour . the curtain of radiation , which erupted on may 9 , was the first coronal mass ejection -lrb- cme -rrb- observed by the interface region imaging spectrograph , or iris . the footage reveals the cme in ` extraordinary detail ' showing a field of view about five earths wide and seven-and-a-half earths tall . scroll down for video . the line moving across the middle of the animation is the entrance slit for iris ' spectrograph , an instrument that can split light into its many wavelengths -- a technique that ultimately allows scientists to measure temperature , velocity and density of the solar material behind the slit . cmes are a mass of charged particles and magnetic field energy that bursts from the sun like a volcanic eruption . material from a coronal mass ejection takes two to three days to reach . earth , but in this case , the coronal mass ejection did n't affect our planet . coronal mass ejections interact with earth 's magnetic field to generate auroras and magnetic storms . the cme 's magnetic fields peel back . the outermost layers of earth 's fields changing their very shape , . distortions which can can degrade communication signals and cause . unexpected surges in power grids . they . also can cause aurora . storms are rare during solar minimum , but as the . sun nears solar maximum , large storms occur several times per year . because the observatory has to position itself a day in advance , it was a stroke of luck that the eruption happened just as the probe was pointing the right way . ` we focus in on active regions to try to see a flare or a cme , ' said bart de pontieu , the iris science lead at lockheed martin solar and astrophysics laboratory in california . ` and then we wait and hope that we 'll catch something . this is the first clear cme for iris so the team is very excited . ' during a cme , changes in the sun 's magnetic fields cause a large section of the surface of the sun to expand rapidly , ejecting billions of tonnes of particles out into space . iris must commit to pointing at certain areas of the sun at least a day in advance , so catching a cme in the act involves some educated guesses and a little bit of luck . pictured is the solar flare captured by iris -lrb- right -rrb- and the same flare later seen by the solar dynamics observatory -lrb- left -rrb- . material from a coronal mass ejection takes two to three days to reach earth , peeling back the outermost layers of the planet 's magnetic field . cme 's can degrade communication signals and cause unexpected surges in power grids . however , this cme is not thought to have made a significant impact on earth . cme 's often accompany a solar flare -- a solar eruption that pushes out waves of light all across the spectrum . iris can observe both types of eruption . it was launched in june 2013 to study what 's known as the interface region , which is a layer between the sun 's surface the corona that has long baffled scientists . solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost . astronauts . are not in immediate danger because of the relatively low orbit of this . manned mission . they do have to be concerned about cumulative exposure . during space walks . the charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the earth 's magnetic field . very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies . a positive aspect , from an aesthetic point of view , is that the auroras are enhanced . geomagnetic . storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater . dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric . currents . by capturing light emitted by atoms of . different temperatures , iris can looks at different heights above the . sun 's surface to analyse this obscure layer . the line moving across the middle of the movie is the entrance slit for iris ' spectrograph , an instrument that can split light into its many wavelengths -- a technique that ultimately allows scientists to measure temperature , velocity and density of the solar material behind the slit . while the strength of this cme is yet to be revealed , it follows on the heels of the most powerful type of solar flare that 's ever been recorded by the space agency . the huge event on the sun occurred on 29 march 2014 , but nasa has only now analysed the data from their fleet of observatories . this fleet consisted of four telescopes in space and one observatory on earth . the flare observed was an x-class flare , the biggest and highest-energy solar flares that have ever been observed . this close-up of the sunspot underneath the march 29 , 2014 , flare shows incredible detail . the image was captured by the g-band camera at sacramento peak in new mexico . this instrument can focus on only a small area at once , but provide very high resolution . this combined image shows the x-class flare as seen through the eyes of different observatories . the sdo is on the left , which helps show the position of the flare on the sun . the darker orange square is iris data . the red rectangular inset is from sacramento peak . the violet spots show the flare 's footpoints from rhessi . in particular it was an x1 flare , which is the lowest intensity within the x category but significantly more powerful than the majority of flares . coordinated observations like this are crucial to understanding such eruptions on the sun and their effects on space weather near earth . such research can help scientists better understand what catalyst sets off these large explosions on the sun . perhaps they may even some day be able to predict their onset and forewarn of the radio blackouts solar flares can cause near earth - blackouts that can interfere with airplane , ship and military communications . this is an artist 's concept of the interface region imaging spectrograph , or iris , satellite in orbit . by capturing light emitted by atoms of different temperatures , iris can look at different heights above the sun 's surface to analyse this obscure layer .", "summary": " the huge curtain of solar radiation erupted on may 9 but did n't affect earth .   it was the first ever coronal mass ejection -lrb- cme -rrb- observed by the iris probe .   during a cme , changes in sun 's .   magnetic fields can cause a section of the solar surface to .   expand , ejecting billions of tonnes of particles into space .   cmes can disrupt communication signals and cause surges in power grids .
