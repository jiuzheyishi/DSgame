{"text": "mogilnoye , ukraine in the ukraine house where she grew up , oksana balinskaya 's hazel eyes transfixed on television images of moammar gadhafi . he was now a fallen leader , a fugitive sought for justice . he had been known as the ruthless leader of a pariah state , a butcher , a delusional man divorced from reality . but balinskaya , 25 , who served as one of gadhafi 's five ukrainian nurses for nearly two years , had always seen him in a different light . she had checked his blood pressure , monitored his heart , stuck him with a needle to draw blood , gave him vitamins and pills for his ailments , though he did n't seem to have many . he was a healthy man . she even called him  daddy .  all the ukrainian nurses did . it was a nickname they used to speak about him among themselves , without attracting attention .  daddy gave us jobs , money and a good life ,  she said . far removed now from the sands of libya , balinskaya sat at the kitchen table with her serbian husband , looking upward at the boxy tv set atop the refrigerator . images of gadhafi 's fiery defiance flashed in the face of ouster . she would feel sorry for him if he were killed or captured , she said .  gadhafi was quite considerate to us ,  she said .  he would ask us whether we are happy and whether we have everything that we need .  every september , on the anniversary of his rise to power , gadhafi presented souvenirs to his ukrainian nurses and other members of his inner circle . balinskaya received a medallion and a watch etched with his picture . she took turns with the other nurses accompanying him on foreign trips , sometimes sparking rumors spread in the media about gadhafi 's harem . all of what was being said about gadhafi seemed contrary to what she knew about the man -- including the allegations by gadhafi family nannies and domestic staff that they were tortured and abused . gadhafi , she said , always treated her very well . her job now lost to libya 's civil war , she pitied the nation .  if it were not for gadhafi , who else would have built it ?  she said .  it was he who constructed it . he has transferred libyans from camelbacks into cars .  the rules were strict : no lipstick . by the time gadhafi visited ukraine in october 2009 , balinskaya had graduated from nursing school in kiev and been working in the area of her native mogilnoye for three years . but life was not easy in ukraine ; she was making only $ 125 a month . she knew of opportunities in libya and had already submitted an application for work there . it was an opportunity to make a better life for herself . salaries were higher in libya and she would receive housing and other perks . she had been waiting for about a month to hear back when gadhafi arrived on his state visit to ukraine . a meeting was arranged for him to meet six personal nurse candidates . balinskaya was one of them . she knew little about gadhafi then and felt nervous at their first meeting . three of the six nurses had already worked in libya and knew arabic . balinskaya thought she did not have a chance . gadhafi greeted them but balinskaya found nothing special in the selection process .  i do n't know how he made the choice ; perhaps he was a good psychologist ,  she said . she learned later that he understood people from that first handshake , from that first gaze into their eyes . soon , she was on her way to tripoli . her job was solely to treat gadhafi and his large family . the rules were strict . the attractive ukrainian nurses wore no flashy makeup or revealing clothes .  our appearance was very humble so as to not attract anybody 's attention ,  she said .  we would never put on lipstick going to his house and have vivid colors in our clothes .  she was always surrounded by others -- gadhafi 's wife , children , grandchildren , officials within his inner circle .  none of us had ever been one on one with him ,  she said .  there was n't even a single room in his household where we could have possibly been left alone with him .  that 's why she was shocked by the gossip that gadhafi had sexual relationships with his foreign nurses . veteran ukrainian nurse , galina kolonitskaya , 38 , who had worked with gadhafi for nearly a decade , was described in a u.s. diplomatic cable posted by wikileaks as a  voluptuous blonde  who  knows his routine .  it said the libyan dictator was deeply attached to her .  galina was the same kind of nurse as we all were ,  balinskaya said .  she is of course a glamorous and very kind woman with a big heart . she helped me a lot .  i do n't know who created this image about us nurses , as well as about his female bodyguards ,  she said .  how could anyone in sane mind assume that we could have had any intimate relationship with gadhafi ?  hoping to return to libya . both balinskaya and kolonitskaya left libya in february when the uprising against gadhafi took root . but it was not just the threat of war that prompted balinskaya to leave . she was pregnant then and had started showing . she returned to her native mogilnoye , a village south of kiev . her husband dejan , a 38-year-old serbian businessman , joined her there . a month ago , as gadhafi 's regime teetered , balinskaya gave birth to a baby boy . journalists were also eager to hear kolonitskaya 's tales of gadhafi , lining up at her apartment door . but she has avoided publicity .  all that gossip about her is untrue ,  balinskaya said .  she was totally fed up . there was too much attention on her for no reason .  the nurses , she said , had no personal relationship with gadhafi .  i can only say good things about him ,  she said , thinking of the comfortable life she had in libya , dreaming of how to make it happen again .  i very much hope that we will return to libya ,  she said , flipping through an album with photographs of herself in libya . only , it will be a different libya now . one without gadhafi . without  daddy .  cnn 's maxim tkachenko reported from mogilnoye , ukraine , and moni basu reported from atlanta .", "summary": " oksana balinskaya worked as a personal nurse to moammar gadhafi .   she says he treated her well ; was kind and considerate .   talk of a sexual relationship between gadhafi and his foreign nurses is untrue , she says .   gadhafi gave her a good life , one she dreams about having again .
