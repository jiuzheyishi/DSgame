{"text": "google has been accused of racism after allegedly linking names usually associated with black people to adverts related to criminality . a harvard university professor found ` significant discrimination ' after comparing the adverts which appear when searching a typically black name compared with those for typically white names . findings showed that names typically associated with black people were 25 per cent more likely to bring up adverts related to criminality . racist ? a new study claims that adverts linked to google search results for typically black american names are more likely to be suggestive of criminality - like services offering to check arrest and criminal records . the study by latanya sweeney contrasted online searches using names such as ` ebony ' and ` deshawn , ' with those such as ` jill ' and ` geoffrey . ' she found that adverts posted alongside search results for names likely to belong to black people were more likely to offer services like background checks for arrests and criminal records . searches using white-sounding names were less likely to result in advert results which suggested criminality , professor sweeney 's research indicated . the findings are significant since google searching the names of potential employees , clients or even friends and dates has become commonplace . ` advantages of knowing such information when hiring or engaging with a person relate to trustworthiness , ' professor sweeney writes in a paper published online in the journal arxiv . consequences : the findings are significant since google searching the names of potential employees , clients or even friends and dates has become commonplace -lrb- file photo -rrb- . professor sweeney gathered evidence by collecting more than 2,000 names which were suggestive of race . she then entered these names plus . surnames into google and news agency reuters ' google-powered search . engine and looked at which adverts the search results returned . while most names brought back adverts . for public records , typically black names were much more likely to . bring back those that included the word ` arrest ' . all the results came from background-checking service instantcheckmate.com . in one particular case highlighted farrell , latanya sweeney and latanya lockett all brought up adverts for . arrest checking services . however , subsequent investigation showed only one of the names , latanya lockett , had an arrest record linked to it . sample ad and criminal reports for ` latanya farrell ' -lrb- a , b -rrb- , ` latanya sweeney ' -lrb- c , d -rrb- , and ` latanya locket ' -lrb- e , f -rrb- appearing on google.com and reuters.com . typically white names : sample ads and criminal reports for ` kristen haring ' -lrb- a -rrb- , ` kristen sparrow ' -lrb- b -rrb- , and ` kristen lindquist ' -lrb- c -rrb- . criminal reports from instantcheckmate.com -lrb- b , d , f -rrb- . brain scans could soon be used to detect whether or not people are racist , scientists say . researchers found that brain scans were able to pick up on differences in the way that people with implicit negative racial attitudes viewed black and white faces . racial stereotypes have previously been shown to have subtle and unintended consequences on how we treat members of different race groups . but the new research published in psychological science , a journal of the association for psychological science , shows race biases also increase differences in the brain 's representations of faces . psychologists from the university of geneva in switzerland and new york university examined activity in the brain while participants looked at pictures of white and black faces . afterwards , participants performed a task that assessed their unconscious or implicit expression of race attitudes . by examining patterns of brain activity in the fusiform face area -- which is involved in face perception -- researchers were able to predict the race of the person the participant was viewing , but only for those with strong , negative implicit race attitudes . this , the researchers said , implies that people with stronger , negative implicit race attitudes may actually perceive black and white faces to look more different than others who held no such prejudice . ` in comparison , searches for  kristen haring  ,  kristen sparrow  and  kristen lindquist  did not yield any instantcheckmate.com ads , only competitor ads , even though the company 's database reports having records for all three names and arrest records for  kristen sparrow  and  kristen lindquist  , ' professor sweeney wrote . she added : ` together , these hand-picked examples describe the suspected pattern -- ads suggesting arrest tend to appear with names associated with blacks and neutral ads or no ads tend to appear with names associated with whites , regardless of whether the company has an arrest record associated with the name . ' in the uk , black people are 3.3 times more likely than white people to be arrested for a crime and those from the mixed ethnic group 2.3 times more likely . the findings raise ` questions as to whether google 's advertising technology exposes racial bias in society and how ad and search technology can develop to assure racial fairness , ' professor sweeney said in a blog post . advertisers bid on terms , or key words , with high bidders getting their ads posted alongside corresponding search results . google defends the process as race-neutral , saying outcomes are driven by decisions by advertisers . a spokesman said : ` adwords does not conduct any racial profiling . ` we also have an  anti  and violence policy which states that we will not allow ads that advocate against an organisation , person or group of people . ` it is up to individual advertisers to decide which keywords they want to choose to trigger their ads . ' instant checkmate contacted mailonline in response the the issues raised in the study . a spokesman said : ` as a point of fact , instant checkmate would like to state unequivocally that it has never engaged in racial profiling in google adwords . ` we have absolutely no technology in place to even connect a name with a race and have never made any attempt to do so . ` the very idea is contrary to our company 's most deeply held principles and values . ' the study was funded in part by the national science foundation and a grant from google .", "summary": " professor finds ` significant discrimination ' in ad results , with black names 25 per cent more likely to be linked to arrest record check services .   she compared typically black names like ` ebony ' and ` deshawn ' with typically white ones like ` jill ' and ` geoffrey ' "}
