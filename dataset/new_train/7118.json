{"text": "the crisis in a&e departments is being fuelled by a shocking rise in the elderly and frail being rushed to hospital in ambulances because there is no-where else for them to go . shocking new figures reveal that more than two thirds of the extra 330,000 patients admitted taken to casualty by ambulance are aged 80 or over . and among the over-90s , there was a 66 per cent increase from 2009-10 to 2011-12 , sparking claims that deep cuts in social care totalling # 1.7 billion were piling pressure on emergency departments . rise : in two years the number of people aged over 90 take to hospital by ambulance rose from 165,910 to 275,883 . row : shadow health secretary andy burnham who unearthed the figures , called on health secretary jeremy hunt to take urgent action to address the problem . health ministers were challenged over the statistics from the health and social care information centre in the commons yesterday . shadow health secretary andy burnham claimed they ` put a human face on the a&e crisis and paint a very sad picture indeed ' . he added : ' i am today calling on health secretary jeremy hunt to take decisive action to improve care for the most elderly people in our society . ' cuts to social care budgets across england mean elderly people and their relatives have little choice but to dial 999 to call an ambulance for help . there are also warnings that once older people are admitted to hospital they can not be discharged because of a lack of care available in communities . jeremy hunt did not visit an a&e department until seven months after becoming health secretary , it has emerged . he took up the post on september 4 last year but only went to st thomas ' hospital - opposite parliament across the river thames - on april 3 this year . in the commons today shadow health minister jamie reed said that hospital waiting times in england were at the worst levels seen for a decade . he asked mr hunt : ` do you actually regret waiting for six months before visiting an a&e unit and finding for yourself what damage your policies were doing to the frontline of the nhs ? ' but mr hunt hit back at labour 's own health failures , pointing out that the mid staffordshire hospital scandal , which witnessed unusually high mortality rates , took place on their watch . he added : ` we 'll take no lessons on being connected with the frontline from the party that missed 50 warning signs about what was happening in mid staffs . ' this so-called bed-blocking creates a backlog which means a&e departments can not admit new people . the chaos in a&e this year has been blamed on patients struggling to access out-of-hours care and the bungled introduction of the new 111 nhs advice line . but official statistics reveal the dramatic increase in the elderly and their relatives dialling 999 has been building for the last three years . in 2009-10 there were 165,910 people aged over 90 taken to a&e by an ambulance . two years later the number had rocketed by 66 per cent to 275,883 . over the same period , the number of patients aged 80-89 rose by 19 per cent from 635,834 to 757,555 in 2011-12 . the rises were in stark contrast to other age groups , notably among children where the numbers fell by four per cent among the under-10s and almost 20 per cent for 10-19-year-olds . mr burnham , who unearthed the ` deeply . troubling ' figures , said they show how ` that something has gone . seriously amiss with the way we care for very frail and very elderly . people ' . he told mailonline : ` the question we have to ask is why are 100,000 more over-90s coming into a&e by ambulance . ` in . many of these cases older people end up in ambulances simply because . there is n't better or more appropriate care available at home.the . thought of someone over 90 coming into hospital via ambulance and what . that must entail should make any politician pause for thought . ` the . sheer disorientation of the whole experience of going to a&e , it is . the worse place really for them to be yet they are ending up there in . ever greater numbers . ' crisis : the government has been urged to act over the crisis in a&e , triggered by delays in out-of-hours care , the 111 nhs advice line and cuts to social care . among all people turning up at a&e , the increase in attendance was also highest amongst the over 90s . mr burnham pointed to figures showing how the total social care budget had fallen by # 1.7 billion from 2009-10 to 2011-12 . ` further cuts are planned this year and this problem will only get worse if no action is taken , ' mr burnham added . in the commons he urged ministers to investigate the dramatic increases urgently and work to ` prevent the collapse of social care ' . health minister dan poulter said both parties ` recognise quite rightly that there is a long-term challenge in providing more integrated joined up care to look after older people ' . but he claimed that labour had ` failed to adequately invest in this area throughout its time in government ' . last week a damning report revealed waiting times for a&e patients are at their highest point for nearly a decade . the influential king 's fund think tank said more than 300,000 patients waited for four hours or longer during the first three months of this year -- nearly 6 per cent of all patients . chaos in out-of-hours care and the botched launch of the government 's 111 non-emergency number have been accused of pushing many hospitals to breaking point , with senior a&e doctors warning they can no longer guarantee safe care for patients .", "summary": " there were an extra 100,000 emergency 999 calls for people aged over 90 in 2011-12 , compared to 2009-10 .   number aged 80-89 also rose by 19 % after social care budgets cut .   labour says figures ` paint a very sad picture indeed '   casualty departments under fresh pressure over crisis in out-of-hours care .
