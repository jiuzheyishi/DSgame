{"text": "in the aftermath of the presidential election , republicans have been inundated with advice to moderate , equivocate , and even abandon their core principles as a necessary prerequisite for winning future elections . that is absurd . america already has one liberal political party ; there is no need for another one . make no mistake : despite losing an election , conservative ideals still hold true . government spending still does not grow our economy . american weakness on the world stage still does not lead to peace . higher taxes still does not create prosperity for all . and , more government still does not grow jobs . politics : jindal stays quiet on 2016 house bid . the republican party does have a lot of work to do . but changing our principles is not a winning strategy . we need to modernize , not moderate . here are seven lessons republicans should learn in order to move forward . 1 . stop looking backward . we have to boldly show what the future can look like with the free market policies that we believe in . conservative ideals are aspirational , and our country is aspirational . 2 . compete for every single vote . the 47 % and the 53 % . and any other combination of numbers that adds up to 100 percent . president barack obama and the democrats can continue trying to divide america into groups of warring communities with competing interests , but we will have none of it . we are going after every vote as we try to unite all americans . 3 . reject identity politics . the old notion that ours should be a colorblind society is the right one , and we should pursue that with vigor . identity politics is corrosive to the great american melting pot and we reject it . we will treat all people as individuals rather than as members of special interest groups . 4 . stop being the stupid party . it 's time for a new republican party that talks like adults . it 's time for us to articulate our plans and visions for america in real terms . we had a number of republicans damage the brand this year with offensive and bizarre comments . enough of that . opinion : it was n't only minorities voting obama . 5 . stop insulting the intelligence of voters . we need to trust the smarts of the american people . we have to stop dumbing down our ideas and stop reducing everything to mindless slogans and tag lines for 30-second ads . we must be willing to provide details in describing our views . 6 . quit  big .  we are not the party of big business , big banks , big wall street bailouts , big corporate loopholes , or big anything . we must not be the party that simply protects the well off so they can keep their toys . we have to be the party that shows all americans how they can thrive . we are the party whose ideas will help the middle class , and help more folks join the middle class . we are a populist party and need to make that clear . 7 . focus on people , not government . we must stop competing with democrats for the job of  government manager ,  and come up with ideas that can unleash the dynamic abilities of the american people . we need to lead the way with policies that can create prosperity . we believe in organic solutions , not big government solutions . we need a bottom-up government that fits the digital age . right now we have an outdated centralized government trying to manage a decentralized economy . politics : jindal slams romney for ` gifts ' comment about minorities , young voters . there are many challenges facing our country . for example , our education system seems to be in the stone age and miserably outdated . it 's time to update traditional public schools , charter schools , home schools , online schools and parochial schools . let the dollars follow the child instead of forcing the child to follow the dollars , so that every child has the opportunity to attain an education . our energy policy is outdated as well , stuck in old ideological arguments which harm our ability to create a more sustainable future where energy independence can actually be achieved . we have to change that . we need an equal opportunity society , one in which government does not see its job as picking winners and losers . where do you go if you want special favors ? government . where do you go if you want a tax break ? government . where do you go if you want a handout ? government . this must stop . our government must pursue a level playing field . at present , government is the un-leveler of the playing field . this is a pathway forward for the republican party , one that honors our principles , the american people , and also , will help us win elections .", "summary": " bobby jindal : republicans have been inundated with advice to abandon core values .   jindal : despite losing an election , conservative ideals still hold true .   he offers 7 lessons that can help his party to move forward and win future elections .   jindal : gop must compete for every vote , reject identity politics , be more smart .
