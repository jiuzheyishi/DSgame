{"text": "london , england treating flu-stricken children with anti-viral medication including tamiflu and relenza could do more harm than good , a new report has warned . researchers say not enough study has been done into the long-term effects of anti-virals on children . researchers from the university of oxford found that while the anti-virals reduced the duration of illness by up to one day and a half , they had  little or no effect  on the likelihood of the children developing complications . the researchers conceded that they did n't know the extent to which their report applied to the current swine flu pandemic , but said ,  based on current evidence , the effects of anti-virals on reducing the course of illness or preventing complications might be limited .  in compiling their report , published in the british medical journal , the oxford university researchers searched the world for trials of tamiflu and relenza on children under 12 . they found seven in total ; four relating to flu treatment , and three to prevention . they say none offered a big enough study to determine whether anti-virals have any effect on the chances of children developing serious flu-related complications .  we 've got very little data to go on . these drugs have been used on tens of thousands , in fact millions of children worldwide , and we 've found only four trials of treatments involving less than two thousand children ,  said the report 's author , dr matthew thompson , a senior clinical scientist at the department of primary health care , the university of oxford .  we did n't find any trials of children under one . and none of the trials was big enough to show if there 's any effect on serious complications like pneumonia or being hospitalized ,  he said . the report found that while anti-virals reduced the duration of flu in children , they had little or no impact on the likelihood of the child developing ear infections or any other condition that may require antibiotics . a review of one study into the effect of anti-virals on asthmatic children , who are considered to have a higher risk of developing complications from the flu virus , found that they did not reduce the risk of the asthma attacks . the report said that one in 20 children who take tamiflu suffer nausea and vomiting , as indicated in warnings from the drug 's manufacturer .  that obviously can be a particular problem in young children and infants where getting dehydrated is a complication of influenza ,  thompson said . the three studies that focused on the use of anti-virals to prevent influenza taking hold , showed that their potential to stop the spread of flu was  fairly small .   we 'd need to treat 13 children with the preventive course of one of these drugs to prevent one of them from getting flu ,  thompson said . the report 's authors suggested governments were too quick to recommend anti-virals as the first defense against the spread of swine flu . in the united kingdom , people who suspect they have the virus are urged to phone a government helpline . if enough symptoms match the operator 's list , they 're given an online voucher so a  flu friend  can collect a course of tamiflu .  we 're not criticizing the current department of health policy , but we hope they 'll inform perhaps a slight shift in policy in terms of use of these drugs ,  thompson told cnn . the british department of health said the report was right to suggest bed rest and over the counter remedies for people with mild cases of flu , but added that it was potentially dangerous to deter people with severe cases of flu from taking tamiflu , including children . in a statement , a spokesman said :  whilst there is doubt about how swine flu affects children , we believe a safety-first approach of offering anti-virals to everyone remains a sensible and responsible way forward . however , we will keep this policy under review as we learn more about the virus and its effects .  the british medical association -lrb- bma -rrb- also adopted a cautious stance . the chairman of the bma 's general practitioner 's committee , dr laurence buckman , said doctors always have to balance the risk of major complications from swine flu with the potential side-effects of anti-virals .  while we know they are safe , we do know that vomiting and diarrhea can occur in some children and adults who take them ,  he said , adding  the more we learn about these drugs the more we will know how to treat patients with the most up-to-date clinical evidence . ", "summary": " researchers examined studies into effects of anti-virals on children .   found  little or no effect  when used on children suffering influenza .   anti-virals were found to shorten duration of flu-like symptoms .   british department of health said it had  a safety-first approach  "}
