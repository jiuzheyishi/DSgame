{"text": "an nhs campaigner has fled her home town following death threats , abuse and the desecration of her mother 's grave . julie bailey , who helped expose the horrific neglect at stafford hospital which cost up to 1,400 lives , says ` vipers ' have victimised her ever since she set up cure the nhs . she started the pressure group in her own cafe following the death of her mother at the hospital . but yesterday she handed over the keys to the business , having agreed a cut-price sale on ebay . vile : stafford hospital campaigner julie bailey has quit the town after her mother 's grave was desecrated as part of a campaign of intimidation . breaks cafe , the business the mother-of-two has been forced to sell in a cut-price sale . ` people have been coming into the cafe shouting that nothing happened at stafford , that i am lying and there were no unnecessary deaths , ' she said last night . ` i have been run out of town by small minded people , leaving my home , my livelihood and my friends because a few misinformed local political activists have fuelled a hate campaign based on lies . ` this is a classic case of shooting the messenger . ' she said the final straw was the ` desecration of my mum 's grave ' that continued for six weeks . the 50-year-old mother of two says her troubles began in 2009 when a healthcare commission report into the failings at mid staffordshire nhs put the future of its casualty department under threat . miss bailey said residents boycotted her café , reducing takings to as little as # 40 a day . she became a hate figure after local party activist rolfe pearce posted a video on youtube in which a man signing a labour petition to save the unit expresses a hope that miss bailey would die . the video , which provoked a torrent of hateful emails and telephone calls , was posted by mr pearce in a personal capacity and was later taken down . the 49-year-old said the comments were tongue in in cheek . miss bailey 's plight became worse when another labour party activist claimed she had said at a public meeting : ` let 's shut the hospital , let 's sack all the staff ' . that demand , the activist , diana smith , said , was ` met by loud cheers from her band of followers ' . this year the campaign against her took a sinister turn when the grave of miss bailey 's mother , bella , who was 86 when she died at the hospital after ` being dropped ' by a nurse , was vandalised . this was followed by a postcard saying : ` thank you for closing stafford hospital , ha , ha , ha , you better now spend more time watching your mother 's grave . ' last month , emergency call handler roy guest , 54 , was sacked by west midlands ambulance service after comments appeared online about a wish for miss bailey to suffer ` a life-threatening illness ' . miss bailey said residents have been boycotting her café , reducing takings to as little as # 40 a day . she is moving out of her rented home in stafford this weekend , initially to live in a static caravan at an undisclosed location . she sold the café for # 14,000 and now plans to devote more time to turning cure the nhs into a national charity . miss bailey told last month how damage had been caused to her mother 's grave over a six-week period . julie bailey 's mother bella bailey , . who died at stafford hospital . her grave was desecrated and a note left on it reading ` ha ha ha ' speaking at the time , she said : ` the momentum seems to be growing when i go out onto the streets of stafford . people come up to me and say  it 's not true , you were lying . you brought shame on the town and nobody died  . ` it just drains the strength from you and you 're back grieving again . but the one thing i do say is ,  have you read any investigations ? did you go to the inquiry ?  ' paramedic roy ` murph ' guest , 51 , who launched a facebook attack on julie bailey and wished a terminal illness on her , was sacked . last night , mrs smith , who was a volunteer assistant to david kidney , the former labour mp for stafford , stood by her blog post and accused miss bailey of forgetting what she had said at the public meeting in 2009 . she said : ` i have notes of what julie said and witnesses who also heard her comment . ' mrs smith , who is involved in the support stafford hospital campaign which organised a march through the town attended by 30,000 people in april , said : ` barely anybody will have read that blog until its contents were picked up and disseminated by cure the nhs members and supporters . ' cheryl porter , one of the founders of the support stafford hospital campaign , insisted : ` we have had absolutely nothing to do with any of the problems julie bailey has faced . ` we condemn the abuse julie bailey has received -- the desecration of her mother 's grave , the abusive emails and phone calls . ` but these incidents are nothing to do with us . ` we were set up as a campaign group fighting against night-time plans to close the accident and emergency department at the hospital , two years ago . ` we are thankful for what julie and cure the nhs have done in exposing what went on at the hospital . but we are now one of the top 20 hospitals in the country for safety and julie is part of the reason why . ` we simply want to secure the long-term future of acute services at stafford . we all need to work together to achieve this . ' she said it was sad that miss bailey had felt compelled to leave her home town . in february sir robert francis qc published his final report into mid staffordshire which said the trust had put corporate self-interest ahead of patients . the public inquiry cost # 13million . a west midlands labour party spokesperson said : ` we utterly condemn any abusive actions or comments made towards julie bailey or the cure the nhs group .
