' i still have to live with the consequences everyday but he does n't - he can just pick up where he left off . there is no way that he should be allowed to work again . i worry for other people . i know that anybody who knows me or knows him would never allow themselves into his care but if he moves out of the area then he will be able to do this again . ' i know that i would n't be suffering these difficulties if it was n't for him . ' among other conditions , mr el-barghouty will not be able to work as a locum or work out-of-hours , or undertake thyroid surgery . ` that is a little victory , ' she added . ` he had carried out seven thyroidectomies in three years and two of us ended up with a tracheotomy . the odds of something going wrong should be one in 1000 . ` still , you feel sorry for people living in a different area who do not know what he has done .

' the pickups ' case is currently under investigation by the gmc . back in july , a spokesperson for scarborough hospital said that while they could not discuss individual cases , ` dependent on the individual circumstances , if an employment has been terminated it would be very unlikely that the staff member would be reappointed ' . a spokesperson this week said : ` mr el-barghouty 's contract with the trust was terminated in august 2011 following the outcome of the gmc fitness to practise hearing . as he is no longer employed by the trust it would not be appropriate for us to comment further .
