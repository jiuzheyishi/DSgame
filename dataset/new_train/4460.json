{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- as claims of responsibility go , it is remarkably complex and perhaps asks more questions than it answers , hinting at the messy rivalry perhaps engulfing the jihadi world . al qaeda in the arabian peninsula commander nasr ibn ali al-ansi 's 12-minute message declares brothers said and cherif kouachi to be -- in the group 's eyes --  heroes  who  were assigned and accepted and fulfilled  a task . it claims that much of what remains of al qaeda 's command was somehow involved in choosing the charlie hebdo magazine as a target . several times , it evokes the name of osama bin laden , and his successor , ayman al-zawahiri -- names that , in the current focus on isis ' rampage across the middle east , seem almost to hail from a time of jihad past . a vital part of the claim is its insistence that amedy coulibaly , the gunman who attacked the kosher grocery store , was not part of their operation , but his attack coincided with theirs as  good fortune .  coulibaly left a long video in which he pledged bayat , or allegiance , to abu bakr al-baghdadi , the head of isis . this hints at the growing and deeply troubling  rivalry  of sorts between isis and the older brand of jihad -- al qaeda . while it seems at first bizarre that two groups with fundamentally similar goals would conflict , the differing worlds of al qaeda and isis have been apparent for some time now . al qaeda 's franchise in syria , al-nusra front , is hit by u.s. airstrikes along with isis , and both are described as terror groups by the u.s. government , but the al qaeda affiliate does at times clash with isis for territory and resources . last spring , al qaeda 's leader , al-zawahiri , distanced himself from the newer , more savage hotheads of isis , a move that guaranteed -- for now -- their paths would continue to diverge . al qaeda in the arabian peninsula 's message wednesday does n't spell out how to connect the dots concretely between the kouachi brothers ' disturbed cries they were working for al qaeda in yemen and the yemeni jihadis themselves -- that 's something investigators have to work on to prove . are there real and genuine logistical links between that paris street and the radical cells training in the desert ? but it does make some intriguing claims that are partially backed up by suggestions from some officials . the al qaeda in the arabian peninsula statement claims that the late anwar al-awlaki was somehow involved operationally in the plan to target charlie hebdo . that is a hugely potent statement . al-awlaki , a recruiter and radical preacher for al qaeda and an american citizen of yemeni heritage , has long been dead -- killed by an american drone strike in 2011 . said and/or cherif kouachi were in yemen in 2011 , according to witnesses and officials , although investigators are still working out their exact movements , with said possibly there as early as 2009 when it is alleged he roomed briefly with umar farouk abdulmutallab , the  underwear bomber  who targeted a plane to detroit in 2009 . were al-awlaki the organizer of the attack -- someone who laid on the logistical support , financing or chose the target as the al qaeda in the arabian peninsula statement suggests -- then the kouachi brothers would have been dormant for three years before launching their attack on january 7 . investigators will be desperate to know if there was any further contact between 2011 and the paris attacks -- whether the orders and logistics were in place by 2011 , or further assistance or instructions came closer to the moment . were it the former , this would be a truly chilling sleeper cell -- idle for years , and then , at a moment 's notice , deadly . above all , wednesday 's long and florid statement shows an al qaeda desperate not to be eclipsed by its newer -- and at times , in the gruesome jousting of this world -- more radical cousin , isis . the names and faces of their leaders , alive and dead , live on , particularly that of al-awlaki , who , it is said ,  threatens the west both in his life and after his martyrdom .  it 's a chilling sign al qaeda may very much be a current and real danger .", "summary": " al qaeda in the arabian peninsula claims responsibility in charlie hebdo attack in paris .   differing worlds of al qaeda and isis apparent for some time now , nick paton walsh says .   claim in attack hints at the messy rivalry perhaps engulfing the jihadi world , he says .
