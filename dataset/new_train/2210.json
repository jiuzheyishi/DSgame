{"text": "washington the u.s. army is recalling 44,000 combat helmets -- some of which are being used by u.s. troops in afghanistan and possibly iraq -- after they failed to meet ballistics testing standards , an army official announced monday . brig. gen. peter n. fuller , who 's responsible for buying and testing equipment for soldiers , told reporters at the pentagon the recall was issued thursday . tests showed the advanced combat helmet -lrb- ach -rrb- , which is standard issue for all soldiers , did not meet service requirements . fuller said he was not aware of any injuries or deaths related to the recalled helmets . the move was triggered after the justice department informed the army about an ongoing investigation into the company that makes the helmets , armorsource llc , formerly rabintex usa llc .  there is evidence that armorsource and rabintex achs were produced using unauthorized manufacturing practices , defective materials and improper quality procedures which could potentially reduce ballistic and fragmentation protection ,  said an all army activities message released may 14 to soldiers around the world . after the justice department 's notification , the army conducted ballistic tests on the helmets and found they did n't meet service standards . it is unclear why the helmets failed the most recent tests but passed initial testing when the army first contracted with armorsource in 2006 . the army has an additional 55,000 helmets in storage . those are also part of the recall and will be destroyed to ensure they are not distributed , fuller said . the army refused to accept delivery of another 3,000 helmets recently , bringing the total of problem helmets to 102,000 , fuller said . the helmets cost $ 250 each , and fuller said the army is investigating whether it can recover funds already paid to the company . the 44,000 recalled helmets had been sent to locations all over the world for distribution . some 24,000 of them were sent to a distribution center that gives them to other services as well .  we do n't know where they are , so they could be on a soldier 's head in iraq or afghanistan ,  fuller said .  we are seeing some getting returned in bagram -lrb- afghanistan -rrb- .  a statement posted on the armorsource website says the army has not notified the company about the recall .  armorsource was not informed of this recall before we saw the press release on friday evening . we have not heard from the government regarding the recall and have no additional information ,  the statement said . army officials said they were not required to tell the company about the recall because the military owned the helmets . fuller said the army had already broken its contract with armorsource earlier in the year because of other problems with the helmets , including paint chipping off . army officials could not discuss details about the problems with the helmets because of the justice department investigation , but they said the ballistics tests showed they would not protect a solider against a worst-case scenario strike on the helmet . fuller said general ballistics tests showed that while a bullet would not penetrate the helmet , they still failed to meet stringent army requirements and  fell short of the required ballistics test .  three other companies also make the helmets , and replacement helmets are already being distributed , an army statement said . the recall affects about 4 percent of the more than 1 million achs in the army 's inventory , according to army statistics .", "summary": " brig. gen. peter n. fuller : advanced combat helmets did n't meet ballistics standards .   some helmets in afghanistan have already been turned in .   army has additional 55,000 helmets in storage ; total of 102,000 helmets to be recalled .   justice department told army about investigation into helmet maker armorsource .
