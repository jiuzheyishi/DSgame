{"text": "robotics has the potential to revolutionise human life by freeing people from many difficult and dangerous tasks . there are robots to fight fires , to perform operations , to build cars and even to explore space . now a vietnamese company has developed a truly useful automaton - one that will free us forever from the indignity of dancing to popular music . he 's perhaps not the greatest dancer : but mrobo could revolutionise human life by freeing us from the indignity of dancing to the latest pop hits . walk like an egyptian : or , alternatively , get mrobo to do it for you . dubbed mrobo , the dancing robot turned heads this week at japan 's ceatec 2012 technology trade show by strutting its stuff to the music of maroon 5 and , that late dancer extraordinaire , michael jackson . the compact android , which incorporates a high-quality compact speaker in its midriff , amazed crowds with its decidedly camp dance moves - even donning a jacko-style sparkling fedora to complete the look . tosy , the company behind the mrobo , claim it is the ` recipe for the ultimate party ' . ` you can have it all with mrobo , the one-of-a-kind gadget that is a unique fusion of a high quality portable speaker and a dancing robot , ' the company says . ` once the music starts , the mrobo will come alive and transform into a full-body dancing robot with his signature moves . ' slightly camp : but tosy , the company behind the mrobo , claim it is the ` recipe for the ultimate party ' high tech : mrobo contains 2gb of flash memory to store all your favourite music . it 's is capable of analysing beats and rhythms to bust a move to ` virtually any ' genre of music . according to reports , the mrobo weighs just 3.3 lb and boasts 2gb of onboard memory that can be stocked up with you favourite tunes via a usb connection . in an echo of the classic transformers villain soundwave , mrobo folds for compact , easy storage . but as soon as you press play it transforms from mundane portable stereo into a raving robot . it can even do voguing : any resemblance to transformers decepticon villain soundwave is purely coincidental . it dances with pre-programmed routines , but tosy say mrobo is capable of analysing beats and rhythms to bust a move to ` virtually any ' genre of music . the integrated speaker has a claimed frequency response as low as 40hz - not quite deep enough for those bassy dub reggae jams but more than capable of handling bubblegum pop . the mrobo was first unveiled in its prototype stage in january by none other than pubescent pop star justin bieber . it 's still in development , but tosy say its expected to ship early in 2013 .", "summary": " mrobo 's makers claim it is the ` recipe for the ultimate party ' "}
