{"text": "seventy-six suspected paedophiles , including a scout leader , a retired teacher and government employees , have been arrested across the uk in a major police investigation into sickening child sex images on the internet . members of the armed forces , a pathologist and a firefighter were also among those detained in the 48-hour operation , which involved more than 40 police forces nationwide . about 80 children have been taken to safety as part of the investigation , including 20 who were found to be living at the properties searched by officers . raids : police led by the child exploitation and online protection centre executed at least 141 search warrants and arrested 76 suspects . police led by the child exploitation and online protection centre -lrb- ceop -rrb- executed at least 141 search warrants , as experts warned that images being downloaded by paedophiles are becoming more extreme , sadistic and violent . most of the warrants related to image offences , including the possession and distribution of indecent images of children , ceop said . others arrested include a referee , an outdoor activities instructor , a computer programmer and known offenders who had breached the conditions of the sex offenders ' register . ceop today published a report warning that anyone caught downloading child abuse images online poses a risk of committing physical sex attacks on children . the report said that one analysis showed 55 per cent of paedophiles who possess indecent images also commit sexual offences against children . the report also warned that detectives investigating online indecent images of children faced an ` unprecedented caseload ' at a time when police budgets are being cut . kate fisher , a principal analyst at ceop , said : ` the images being downloaded are increasingly becoming more extreme , sadistic and violent and feature increasingly younger children . ' however , the severity and number of images held by offenders are not enough alone to assess the risk they pose or the sentence they should receive , the report said . ceop urged police forces to prioritise the investigation of anyone caught with child abuse images who has easy access to children . andy baker , deputy chief executive at ceop , said : ` it is clear that those who possess indecent images also pose a significant risk to children and understanding and managing that risk is not an easy undertaking . disturbing : experts warned that images of children on the internet were becoming more extreme , sadistic and violent . -lrb- file photograph -rrb- . ` however , when we bring together the latest intelligence picture , nationally co-ordinated police action and operational support from our colleagues in the serious organised crime agency , we are making the uk a more hostile place for those who are seeking to exploit our children . ' ceop called for the authorities to look beyond the quantity and severity of the images , adding that a full risk assessment should be considered before a judge hands down any sentence . ms fisher said the dramatic increase in images being downloaded , and the cuts to police resources , meant officers struggled with the workload but stressed that the notion that any case may result in the identification of a victim should be at the forefront of every investigation . she added : ` the levels of austerity and the caseload of indecent images of children is unprecedented . ' a quick and timely investigation for each case is increasingly unrealistic . victim identification is the key element . ' almost 100 case studies from 34 forces found offenders who both possessed child abuse images and attacked children were ` almost exclusively white males ' , most aged between 19 and 45 . one offender was found with 2.5 million still and moving images . mr baker said : ` this is an exceptional number of images but it does not necessarily mean that person will go on to commit contact offences . ' those not in work , and possibly therefore those with high levels of internet usage , those working in schools or care work , and those in manual and manufacturing jobs made up most of the sample , the report said . in 85 per cent of cases , offenders looking at indecent images of children did so at home , with the rest looking at images mainly at work . the majority lived with a spouse or partner and of that group , more than half were living with children . from the 97 offenders in the study , 246 victims of contact abuse were identified . referrals to ceop increased by 181 per cent between april last year and march , figures showed . the report said : ` this point in time has the potential to be a golden age for child protection , but the evolution of technology is likely to make the internet an increasingly difficult place to investigate . ` the predicted dramatic rise in work volumes will require a fresh look at policing priorities and the resources allocated to this area of policing . ' under pressure : a report warned that detectives investigating indecent images of children faced an ` unprecedented caseload ' at a time when police budgets are being cut . west midlands police said it raided six addresses over the past two days as part of the nationwide sting operation . three people were arrested and four children ` safeguarded ' after 35 officers executed warrants across the force area in wolverhampton , birmingham , solihull , sandwell and dudley . a 47-year-old man was arrested in wolverhampton , a 37-year-old man was arrested in dudley and a . 38-year-old man was arrested in sandwell , all on suspicion of downloading indecent images of children . all three have been released on police bail with strict conditions pending further enquiries , a spokesman said , and computers were seized from all addresses . the raids related to suspected offences involving images , including the possession and distribution of indecent images of children , a spokesman said . the force said operation tharsley was a joint operation between 42 police forces and officers from the serious organised crime agency -lrb- soca -rrb- , targeting people thought to be in possession of child abuse images . suspects in the west midlands were identified through local investigations as well as intelligence received directly from ceop . detective inspector kay wallace , from the force 's child online safeguarding team , said : ` this type of work is going on every day across the west midlands as we seek to tackle those who use the internet as a vehicle to offend against children be it grooming for sexual activity or making , possessing or distributing indecent images . ` we are committed to arresting suspects , seizing images and ensuring our children are protected from abuse . ' gloucestershire police confirmed that its officers also took part in the raids . a 68-year-old man , from newent , near gloucester , was arrested on suspicion of the making , possession and distribution of indecent images of children . a force spokesman said the man was released on bail to attend gloucester police station on september 4 . jon brown , head of the nspcc 's sexual abuse programme , said : ` this supports research the nspcc carried out last year which revealed one in three of those convicted of possessing child abuse images has also committed other serious sexual offences against children . ' he added : ` it 's a very worrying situation and more research is needed on the most effective punishment and treatment of offenders caught viewing child abuse pictures . ` trying to stop the terrible trade in these images is obviously a huge task . ` but it must n't be seen in isolation . it 's part of a much bigger sexual abuse problem . ` and we must never forget that these images are abuse in themselves and often very young children , including babies , are being assaulted and raped so these pictures can be produced . '", "summary": " some 80 children were taken to safety as part of the sting operation , which was led by the child exploitation and online protection centre .   more than 40 police forces carried out at least 143 raids between them in the space of 48 hours .   ` safeguarded ' children included 20 who were living at properties searched by police .   child abuse images online are becoming more extreme , sadistic and violent , experts warn .   detectives investigating child sex images face ` unprecedented caseload ' while police budgets are cut , report finds .
