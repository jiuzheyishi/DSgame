{"text": "the latest space tourism venture aims to send paying customers to the edge of space and give them the same awe-inspiring view that adventurer felix baumgartner stared down upon last year - all for $ 75,000 a ticket . depending more on hot air than rocket science arizona start-up , world view , has unveiled plans for a balloon ride to the stratosphere , offering passengers about two hours of space-like views from 19 miles above earth . while it 's not quite space -- that starts at 62 miles -- the plan requires approval from the federal aviation administration , which oversees commercial space . scroll down for video . to the edge of space : world view enterprises announced plans tuesday to send people up in a capsule , lifted 19 miles by a high-altitude balloon . jane poynter , ceo of the tucson , ariz.-based company , said the price for the four-hour ride would be $ 75,000 . the company expects to begin flight tests of a demonstration vehicle this year in arizona and plans to start selling tickets at $ 75,000 per person within a few months , said chairwoman and president jane poynter - with commercial flights by 2016 . ` there are balloons this size that have already flown up many , many times for decades , ' poynter said . ` from a technical point of view this is incredibly doable , low risk . ' the selling point is the view of the earth and seeing its curve , she said . the venture is n't designed for passengers to experience weightlessness . indeed , the flight will be more like that of red bull daredevil felix baumgartner , the austrian adventurer who leapt from a balloon 24 miles above the earth , smashing the sound barrier during his descent and landing safely . dream flight : the selling point is the view of the earth and seeing its curve , she said . the venture is n't designed for passengers to experience weightlessness . lift-off : initially , six passengers and two pilots would be aboard a pressurized capsule that is still under development . ` we promise we wo n't open the door and have you jump back to earth , ' poynter joked . the flight would take 90 minutes to go up at about 1,000 feet a minute , set sail up high for 2 hours with an emphasis on smooth riding , hit an altitude of 19 miles and then come back down in 40 minutes , poynter said . the capsule 's interior will be roomy enough for its eight passengers to walk around and even get a drink at an on-board bar - but unfortunately there will be experiencing of weightlessness . ` seeing the earth hanging in the ink-black void of space will help people realize our connection to our home planet and to the universe around us , and will surely offer a transformative experience to our customers , ' jane poynter , world view 's chief executive officer , said in a statement . the flight would take 90 minutes to go up at about 1,000 feet a minute , set sail up high for 2 hours with an emphasis on smooth riding , and then come back down in 40 minutes . pilot felix baumgartner of austria jumps out of the capsule during the final manned flight for red bull stratos on october 14 , 2012 in space . ` we look forward to pioneering this new , accessible and affordable spaceflight regime , and to sharing the breathtaking , once-in-a-lifetime experience with people from around the globe . ' by comparison , rides aboard spaceshiptwo -- a suborbital six-passenger , two-pilot vehicle owned by virgin galactic , an offshoot of richard branson 's london-based virgin group -- is expected to reach about 68 miles . at that altitude , passengers will experience a few minutes of weightlessness in addition to seeing the curvature of the earth set against the black sky of space . world view capsules would be propelled by a 40 million cubic-foot -lrb- 1.1 million cubic-meter -rrb- helium balloon and a steerable parafoil , an inflatable wing-shaped parachute - which would steer them gently to the ground once they disconnected from the giant helium balloon . outside magazine space expert scott pace , a former nasa associate administrator now space policy director at george washington university , agreed that this is technically feasible . pole position : virgin galactic 's spaceship two flies over the mojave desert in california as it continues its test flights ahead of its first commercial flight next year . entrepreneur richard branson takes a press conference on his decade-old virgin galactic space project in 2012 . he said the issue is whether there 's enough of a market for it to be financially doable , calling it ` an interesting market test . ' pace said the while there are many space tourism ventures , it is not quite right to call the field growing . it is still embryonic . a few people have paid tens of millions of dollars to fly to the international space station and others have paid to fly in high altitude jets . but how many people will pay for near space experiences , he asked . poynter said she has no doubt that there 's a market with other firms like virgin galactic selling so many tickets for yet-to-fly rides . ` space tourism is here to stay , ' said poynter , who also runs the space firm paragon space development corporation . virgin galactic : . headed by the charismatic british billionaire and adventurer richard branson , virgin galactic and their space ship 2 became the highest commercial winged vehicle in september . the spacecraft shot to 69,000 feet above the earth 's surface and the company claims it is on track to put paying customer 's into space in 2014 . the ss2 is launched from a large aeroplane , giving the spacecraft more initial speed and altitude than if it were launched from the ground . sir richard branson first unveiled the rocket plane on december 7 , 2009 and 18 months later took selected people on short-hop trips just above the atmosphere . the ss2 is 18 metres long and has two pilots and room for six passengers . tickets cost $ 250,000 per person and 600 have been sold up to june this year . celebrities who have snapped up tickets , include stephen hawking , tom hanks , brad pitt , angelina jolie and katy perry . passengers will experience approximately six minutes of weightlessness during the two-hour flight.xcor aerospace : . the california based firm are in developmental stages of a jet which will take its passengers from new york to shanghai in 2 hours . xcor aerospace claims its lynx spacecraft can travel at a speed of more than 2,500 mph - and dozens of miles above the earth - before safely landing at an airport . the lynx 's main engines run with the help of flight weight rocket piston pump hardware and liquid oxygen . xcor coo andrew nelson has said that flights between tokyo and new york are likely to be available within the next 20 years . while the view may not be as expansive as what spaceshiptwo can offer , it will last longer . project developers expect the capsule to linger in the middle of the stratosphere for about two hours before returning to the ground . the descent should take 25 to 40 minutes . a world view ride would cost less than one-third of the $ 250,000 it will cost to fly on spaceshiptwo . so far , about 650 people have put down deposits or paid for rides on the latter , which is undergoing testing at manufacturer scaled composites ' facility in mojave , california . virgin galactic aims to begin passenger service next summer , branson said last month . virgin galactic and others have shown that the luxury market has shifted from high-end goods to high-end experiences , paragon co-founder and chief executive taber maccallum told reuters . ` we found we could put together a business plan that closed in a ticket price that is not too different from other luxury experiences , like a high-end safari and things like that , ' maccallum said . the faa letter describes world view 's initial launches as taking place from new mexico 's spaceport america , a commercial port whose anchor tenant is virgin galactic . poynter said the firm is looking at several u.s. launch sites . for added safety and for landing , a steerable parafoil will remain deployed and attached to the capsule throughout the ride , poynter and maccallum said . ` the balloon you 're under is the thickness of a dry cleaner bag . it 's very thin material by necessity to get you so high . that 's where the technical risk lies . the risks of decompression of the spacecraft or life-support systems failures are really pretty small . we 've got lots of redundant systems and we can return to lower altitudes pretty quickly , ' maccallum said . ` there is a chance -- and every once in a while you see in scientific ballooning -- of a balloon failure . that 's really what took us to having this para-wing , or parafoil always open so that from just about any altitude the vehicle could safely glide back , ' he added . she and her husband earlier this year proposed a private venture to send a married couple to mars in 2018 . in the early 1990s she and her husband taber maccallum , who serves as world view 's chief technology officer , spent two years as ` bionauts , ' sealed inside biosphere ii , a huge , greenhouse-like structure built in the arizona desert .", "summary": " world view enterprises announced plans tuesday to send people up in a capsule , lifted 19 miles by a high-altitude balloon .   the flight would take 90 minutes to go up at about 1,000 feet a minute , set sail up high for 2 hours .   the luxury capsule will allow passengers to walk around and get a drink from the bar .
