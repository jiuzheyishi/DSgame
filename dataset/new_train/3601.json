{"text": "a woman has been left scarred for life after a beautician botched a laser hair removal treatment - on her face . mum-of-two vanda thomas , 55 , has terrible scarring under her chin after she spent # 50 to get some wispy hairs removed at her local salon . but instead of leaving her with a smooth chin , vanda is forced to cover up her scars daily with heavy make-up , after the unqualified beautician scored her face with deep burns by using the powerful laser on its highest setting . scroll down for video . vanda thomas -lrb- left -rrb- shows the burns she suffered after she underwent laser hair removal treatment -lrb- right -rrb- . vanda , a healthcare worker from ilford , north london , went to the salon in february to treat herself to a confidence-boosting treatment , after she began noticing a small number of hairs sprouting from under her chin . she said : ' i had been there before for facials and massages , and the woman was really nice and friendly . ' i thought long and hard about having laser hair removal treatment , and then decided i should go for it , ' she says . ` when she put the laser on , it hurt so much i jumped out of the chair . it was such an intense burning . ` the woman said it was normal , and did another patch , but that hurt just as bad . ` then she said that maybe she should turn the laser down . i have a high threshold for pain , but that was absolutely agonising , ' adds vanda . left : the burns straight after the treatment ; right : how they look 6 months later . after completing the 20-minute treatment , vanda left the salon with a burning sensation in her face . it was only the next day that she realised something was seriously wrong , when her skin broke out in sores and blisters . her doctor told her the laser had caused first degree burns in her skin , which would leave permanent scarring . now vanda has teamed up with a trade body , to call for tougher regulations for laser hair removal treatment . the association of independent healthcare organisations is lobbying the government to introduce an official register of approved practitioners to prevent further injuries like vanda 's . vanda said : ` it was only afterwards that i realised these people did n't need any training , or licencing , to operate quite dangerous machinery . ` my face felt like it was on fire for days - all because she did n't know how to operate the machine . ' i want nobody else to go through what i 've had to endure , and that 's why we need to make a change in the law to make certain these people have proper training . ` at the moment we are unprotected by rogue beauty therapists with powerful lasers . ' mum-of-two vanda spent # 50 to get some wispy hairs removed at her local beautician . aiho operational director sally taber explained : ` there is n't any regulation at the moment and that puts people at risk , so always background check a practitioner and ask if they have had the training before considering treatment . ` it was found that there has n't been as much risk with lasers , hence why the government does not support regulation - yet this is a problem but it 's the responsibility of the patients to find out about the practitioner . ' laser hair removal , which involves high-powered laser lights killing hair follicles at the root , was regulated by the care quality commission until 2010 when it stopped approving licences for non-surgical procedures . a department of health spokesman said : ` we want to make sure everybody who undergoes laser hair removal receives good standards of care and is aware of the risks . ` we are working with health education england to review training and qualifications for providers of non-surgical interventions - including laser hair removal . ' sk : n are the uk 's leading laser hair removal providers , who have held a partnership with the nhs for more than 20 years . the lasers used at sk : n are safe to use with all skin types and treatment is delivered according to strict medical protocols , as monitored by in-house medical directors . only practitioners who have completed months of intensive , supervised training and have achieved medical sign off are allowed to treat . watch a treatment at sk : n in action in the video below .", "summary": " mum-of-two vanda thomas , 55 , has been left with terrible scarring .   she suffered from deep burns by using the powerful laser on its highest setting .   now vanda is fighting for tougher regulations for laser hair removal treatment .
