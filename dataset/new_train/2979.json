{"text": "no , there may not be an nba season this year . but there is another installment of  nba 2k ,  the top-rated basketball video game for 11 years running . this year 's version ,  nba 2k12 ,  will let you end the debate about what historical team is the greatest by offering 15 classic teams and players to battle on the court . the enhancements to the my player mode , which allows you to create your own player and guide his career through the nba draft , his rookie season and beyond , are what really make this an engaging game . like in previous versions of the game , you start off by creating your player 's physical attributes -lrb- height , weight , age , etc. -rrb- . the game then assigns your abilities based off what type of player you want to be -lrb- perimeter shooter , post player , etc. -rrb- . in theory , you could create a 7-foot point guard with zero post abilities , but i 'm guessing the high dribble would make you susceptible to steals . after finalizing your player , you immediately play in a rookie showcase game that helps determine where you are selected in the  nba draft . this game shows off  nba 2k12 's  improvements over previous versions in replicating players ' movements and facial features . the game 's announcers also do a good job of mixing your player 's performance into their play-by-play chatter . in the game , you try to play flawlessly while improving your teammate grade by making good passes , playing transition defense and demonstrating other skills that lead to victory . meeting these goals help increase your skill point totals , which translate into improved attributes . i created a 6-foot-6 shooting guard from marshall university -lrb- my alma mater -rrb- and picked up 18 points and a b-minus on my teammate grade in the rookie game . after the game , your player has to answer two questions from teams that will be interested in drafting him . how you answer is taken into consideration prior to the draft . the charlotte bobcats -lrb- no. 9 pick -rrb- , golden state warriors -lrb- no. 11 -rrb- and utah jazz -lrb- no. 12 -rrb- were interested in my shooting guard . i answered the questions in a way that i hoped would get me selected by each team , but there was an answer choice ,  i do not want to play for your team ,  that would have automatically dropped me off that team 's list . then it 's time for the draft . just like in real life , the draft starts off with nba commissioner david stern -lrb- yes , it was really his voice -rrb- announcing the first pick and continuing on until your player gets selected . if you do n't get picked early , this can be a rather drawn-out process since there is no way to skip to your selection . -lrb- developers say the highest any created player can be selected is no. 3 -lrb- utah jazz -rrb- , so do n't set your sights on being the top pick . -rrb- . after walking to the podium and signing your rookie contract , your team 's public relations department contacts you and shows you a new billboard touting you as the future of the franchise . having been selected by the bobcats , it was pretty cool to see my player on some outdoor advertising in charlotte . now it 's time to earn that contract . your player 's skills can be improved through buying skill points with your contract money or by doing individual and team drills -- most of which are new to this game . my shooting guard took advantage of the new arsenal of moves in  nba2k12  to put up 33 points in 16 minutes in his first game . -lrb- oh , you did n't think your rookie was going to be in the starting lineup , did you ? -rrb- . after every game , there is a press conference where you are asked about the game action . your answers impact what your teammates think of you , your league-wide reputation and how you are perceived by your hometown fans . the answers were tough to interpret , and i came off as a jerk sometimes when i was trying to praise my teammates . one flaw with this game : my player still looked awkward when he was speaking . his bottom lip did n't seem to move , making him appear frightening when he addressed the media . as your season progresses , you can earn more playing time and more endorsements depending on your skills and reputation . -lrb- those press conference answers are important . -rrb- . later in your career , you can request trades , negotiate contracts and guide your player to the nba hall of fame . how long that takes depends on how fast your avatar becomes one of the best players in the league . thanks to this my player mode ,  nba2k12  has the depth and versatility to challenge even the best gamer to achieve basketball immortality . this improved feature personalizes pro hoops in a way that will have you cheering your player on -- maybe even to greatness .", "summary": "  nba2k12 ,  the top-rated pro-basketball video game , goes on sale tuesday .   game 's my player mode lets you create your own basketball player and guide his career .   nba commissioner david stern announces each draft pick , including your player .   game announcers do a good job of mixing your player 's performance into their chatter .
