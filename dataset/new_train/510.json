{"text": "a crooked bank worker stole # 80,000 from a customer 's account and transferred the money to struggling businesses which were failing to repay the loans he had agreed . former hsbc worker peter nudd has been jailed after stealing thousands of pounds from the bank . peter nudd , 50 , also took nearly # 50,000 from the same account to spend on takeaways and butlin 's holidays . nudd dragged a total of 51 businesses into his crooked scheme . in the worst case , he plundered # 131,000 from one customer and moved # 80,000 into the accounts of ailing businesses who were failing to repay the loans he had rubber-stamped . hsbc 's total losses are estimated at more than # 200,000 . nudd was a high-flying commercial manager at hsbc 's offices in meridian business park , norwich . the crook kept some of the businesses affected in the dark by sending them false bank statements . nudd , of martham , norfolk , was jailed for two years at norwich crown court yesterday . he admitted one charge of theft and three of false accounting . nudd also asked for 46 other crimes of false accounting to be dealt with by the court . the devastated married father-of-one released a statement afterwards saying that his crimes would ` haunt him for ever . ' he said : ' i never thought it would continue for this long and i have struggled to come to terms with this whole chapter in my life . ` i 'm glad to be out of the bank and will draw a line under this to move on with my future . he added : ` we have had little if any benefit from this and are in a very difficult financial place . ' i love my family and i hope they forgive me for putting them under huge financial strain . ` nudd began moving money around the bank 's clients in 2004 , thinking he would soon be detected . but his false accounting continued until february 2011 when a firm called enviroserve queried why # 18,164 had been taken out of its account in three payments . hsbc brought in an investigator . they found nudd had moved thousands of pounds from wealthy to failing firms who he had approved for loans , but could not pay the bank back . when questioned , nudd , who joined the bank in 1980 , admitted he had been ` spinning plates ' by moving the sums around the bank 's clients . hsbc 's loss is estimated at # 222,000 . ross burrows , defending , told the court : ` it does have hallmarks of a robin hood story , but i think it is more a case of banking pressures which mr nudd found himself put under . ' mr burrows said nudd had been out of his depth after being promoted to commercial manager in 2002 and had contemplated suicide after being caught . peter nudd treated his family to trips to butlin 's using the stolen cash . ` this is an extremely unusual case , ' he said . ` he just assumed from the outset when he transferred these funds that it would be picked up immediately . ' nudd had not flaunted the # 49,000 he had banked and continued to live in a terraced house and drive a humble vauxhall astra . but martin ivory , prosecuting , branded his behaviour ` misguided , very foolish and unnecessary . ' mr ivory said : ' a lot of the money moved round is either to cover his own incompetence or his own concerns . ' judge nicholas coleman told nudd : ` you were in a position where you assumed a high level of trust . ` we know only too well in this day and age the public expects confidence in those responsible for the management of their financial affairs . ' despite the deception lasting for seven years , hsbc insisted last night it had ` processes in place ' to uncover fraud . a bank spokesman said : ` as soon as any fraudulent activity is identified , we always inform the relevant authorities and in this case the bank has worked closely with norfolk police and provided appropriate support . ` the bank also has a number of processes in place to enable members of staff to raise and discuss any concerns they have about their role . ' the court ordered nudd to pay a nominal sum of # 1 under the proceeds of crime act .", "summary": " hsbc costs estimated at # 200,000 .   nudd stole money for seven years without detection .   he took # 130,000 from one account and transferred the money to struggling firms he had secured loans for .
