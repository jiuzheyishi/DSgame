{"text": "one in four schools and colleges fail to secure good grades for any of their pupils at academic a-levels . for the first time , schools are being ranked according to how many sixth-formers achieve aab grades at subjects preferred by leading universities . the list includes maths , english literature , physics , biology , chemistry , geography , history and languages . magdalen college school in oxford was joint top of the league table for the number of students who achieved the preferred university entry grades aab . but tables published yesterday show that 600 sixth-forms had no pupils at the required level . nationally , 6.5 per cent of students achieved the aab benchmark . private schools fared significantly better , prompting warnings that a new educational divide was ruling poorer pupils out of the race for sought-after university places . st paul 's girls in london and magdalen college school in oxford -- both fee-paying -- topped the 2012 table in having 70 per cent of pupils at aab level . private schools took 150 places in the top 200 , the remaining 50 largely being grammars . chris skidmore , a tory member of the commons education select committee , said league table measures which highlighted performance in traditional subjects ` shone a torch ' on under-performance . warning : tory mp chris skidmore , who sits on the commons education committee , said the tables demonstrated an ` educational divide ' between the achievements of poorer and better off students . ` they will force schools to move into the 21st century and wake up to the fact that universities will require these rigorous qualifications , ' he said . ` these results clearly show an educational apartheid , effectively an educational berlin wall , between some of the most affluent schools in the country and the most disadvantaged . ` we must raise standards in the poorest areas . it would be wrong to level down our universities , which are some of the most respected in the world . ` every pupil , regardless of their background , must be encouraged to study the subjects that matter . ` too many pupils are not being put in a position of being allowed to take these subjects in the first place . ' the russell group -- the university alliance that devised the aab benchmark -- advises sixth-formers to pick at least two key subjects to keep their course options open . wendy piatt , director general of the group , said : ` a-level choices really matter . too few students realise that some subjects and subject combinations can keep open wider degree course options at leading universities . ' the number of schools facing intervention over poor results has doubled to 215 after targets were raised . separate figures revealed that the drift away from core academic subjects begins much earlier than sixth form in many state schools . of 176,538 high-achieving pupils at primary school , more than half were not entered for gcses in five basic subject areas . instead they were steered toward subjects seen as less rigorous such as dance and media studies .", "summary": " schools ranked nationally by how many get aab university requirement .   600 sixth-form schools and college had no pupils which met the benchmark .   private schools made up 150 of top 200 places .   league table demonstrates ` educational divide ' warns tory mp .
