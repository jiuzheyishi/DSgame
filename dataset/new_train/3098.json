' however , mr gillick has received the backing of ukip , which is the third largest group on the authority . group leader peter reeve said : ` as long as he 's being honest and transparent and saying what he believes , i 've no problem with that . ` it may or may not be that i agree with him or that people find his views offensive , but i would rather a councillor is honest than cover up their beliefs because they are worried about it not being politically correct . ' mr gillick , a former teacher , artist and theatre designer , was unable to comment on the case . but his wife victoria told mailonline : ` he is very , very popular with young people . he has 15 teenage grandchildren . ` none of the county councillors have ever been inside a classroom . their understanding of how you talk to 17 and 18-year-olds is you patronise them . ` the tendency is to regard looked-after children as somehow retarded when in fact that is not the case . ` his approach is to challenge them . he was doing a jfk :  ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for the country  . ` he was asking them : have you thought of working and doing things for other people ? for young people that 's an open challenge which starts a discussion .
