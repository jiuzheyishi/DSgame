which of these headlines came first ? here we go ! was it : a -rrb- earthquake strikes japan , b -rrb- revolution in egypt , c -rrb- chilean miners rescued or d -rrb- u.s. holds midterm elections ? three seconds on the clock -- go ! the chilean miners were rescued before any of these other stories happened . that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! top stories of the school year . azuz : those were some of the biggest stories that made headlines during this school year . we 're going to take a look back now at the top stories from 2010 - 2011 , and we 're including some of your comments along the way . set your clocks back to august , and here we go . -lrb- begin video -rrb- . azuz : from grace : being a military child myself , i know that many families across america have been affected by the wars in iraq and afghanistan . it is really hard to go through a deployment when you have a loved one fighting in the war . unidentified female : daddy ! u.s. vice president joe biden : our goal , our goal is not just a physically secure iraq , but an economically and prosperous and stable one as well . azuz : from megan : the rescue of the chilean miners was one of the most touching stories reported during the whole year . the rescue was so breathtaking and the reactions of everyone were so sincere . tom foreman , cnn national correspondent : august 5th ; 2 in the afternoon ; 2,300 feet underground , a shaft collapses in the san jose copper and gold mine . 33 miners are somewhere behind the rubble , their condition unknown . the chilean president promises every effort to rescue them . finally , after more than 2 months buried alive , salvation . anderson cooper , cnn anchor : never has a man been underground so long and gotten out alive . group : chi ! le ! chi chi chi ... le le le ! viva chile ! azuz : from ryan : during the u.s. midterm elections , i started to wish i could vote . i got excited to see who would win or lose the elections . rep. john boehner , -lrb- r -rrb- ohio , house speaker : let me just say this : it 's clear tonight who the winners really are , and that 's the american people . sen. harry reid , -lrb- d -rrb- nevada , majority leader : this race has been called , but the fight is far from over . the bell that just rang is n't the end of the fight , it 's the start of the next round . azuz : from danielle : in my honest opinion , i think that our country has not improved in the economy . gas prices have continued to rise , and your everyday tools prices are soaring . many prices on things are unbelievable . from mo 's class : we believe that the upheaval in arab nations was a top story because it affected the whole world . after these events , our class started to pay more attention to the news . unidentified male : we will die for our freedom ! moammar gadhafi , libyan leader : we will be victorious in this fight . azuz : from kazumi : i live in tokyo , so the tsunami was really shocking to me . japan is getting over the damage . we are so grateful for the help and prayers from all over the world . unidentified male : oh , my god ! azuz : from lexi : every night i pray that the people whose lives have been impacted from the natural disasters get better . cooper : we 're talking about the deadliest tornado season since 1953 , that 's what we 're experiencing right now . unidentified male : it 's something you do n't want to experience . you do n't want to experience nothing like this . it ai n't a good feeling , it ai n't nothing you can do about it . azuz : from juliana : when osama bin laden died , i thought it was probably the biggest story reported this year . considering he was the starter of a terrorist group and the cause of 9/11 , i do think justice was done . u.s. president barack obama : i can report to the american people and to the world that the united states has conducted an operation that killed osama bin laden , the leader of al qaeda , and a terrorist who 's responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men , women and children . -lrb- end video -rrb- . before we go . azuz : okay , before we go , you know we always like to have a little pun at the end of our show . i 've chosen my top 5 favorite puns of the school year . and right now , you get to sit through every punful one of them again . let 's goose this up ! when a bird joined a couple canines on their walk through the park , we had to give it wings on the air . after all , what 's good for a goose is good for a gander . okay , then , there was this zip-line over a reptile pit . to protect the people , you 'd think they 'd have a gate or something . to protect the reptiles , you 'd need a little gator aid ! when a retriever took some ducklings under her wing -- or paw -- you could see she did n't duck any responsibility . it would n't fit the bill . and as far as duck puns go , you 've got to admit they quack you up . and after a group of presidential mascots took off running -- that 's running a race , not ` running a race ' -- you want a clean match . anything less elects a commander-in-cheat . my favorite had to be this one , though . back in august , we showed a butterfly causing a bunch of penguins to flip out . now , we could 've talked about the butterfly effect , said this was frightless versus flightless , said the butterfly ruled them like a monarch . but instead , we settled on this : the pupa becomes the master . goodbye . azuz : sure , they might bug you from time to time , but you know we larva good pun here at cnn student news . all right . as we sign off for the summer , we want to thank all of you who watch and use our show . especially those of you who have sent us ireports , shoutout requests ; those of you who 've posted on our blog ; those of you who 've visited our facebook page . we hope you 'll check out cnnstudentnews.com over the summer . we 'll be putting some special shows up every week while we 're on break . from all of us here at cnn student news , have an amazingly awesome summer , and take care .", "summary": " hear about the impact of deadly tornadoes that hit massachusetts .   find out why u.s. nutrition guidelines are getting a new icon .   look back at some of the biggest stories from this school year .   use the weekly newsquiz to test your knowledge of stories you saw on cnn student news .
