{"text": "the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- will not appeal banned american sprinter tyson gay 's controversial one-year doping ban , it said on tuesday . the global agency said the ban , which has been widely criticised in europe as too lenient , was ` compatible with the world anti-doping code . ' gay , the world 's joint second fastest man , last month had accepted the one-year suspension by the u.s. anti-doping agency -lrb- usada -rrb- after a 2013 positive test for an anabolic steroid . dope : us sprinter tyson gay received a one-year ban after testing positive for anabolic steroids in 2013 . the ban was backdated to june 23 , 2013 , making the u.s. 100 metres record holder eligible to return to running later this month . his first race will be a 100 metres at lausanne 's diamond league meeting on july 3 , organisers said on monday . normally athletes receive a two-year suspension for their first major doping offense but under anti-doping rules the ban can be reduced for substantial cooperation . the u.s. agency said gay was eligible for such a reduction because the sprinter offered what it termed substantial assistance in his case . on tuesday , wada said it was satisfied with the decision . tyson gay has returned the silver medal he won at london 2012 . ` after careful review and scrutiny of the full case file , wada is satisfied that mr. tyson gay provided substantial assistance to usada in an appropriate fashion , ' the global agency said in a statement to reuters . ` wada will therefore not appeal usada 's decision which is compatible with the world anti-doping code . ' officials of the international association of athletics federations -lrb- iaaf -rrb- , which also can appeal the u.s. decision , declined comment , saying the matter remains in the hands of its doping review board to assess . iaaf president lamine diack , however , told reuters last month he supported the world anti-doping code rule that allows athletes to receive reduced sentences if they provide substantial assistance to anti-doping agencies . ` in the fight against doping we have to use this , ' diack said in an interview at the inaugural iaaf world relays in the bahamas . ` if someone gave really very good cooperation and give us the possibility to do more to fight doping , we have to do something . ' in addition to the ban , gay has returned the silver medal he won as a member of the u.s. 4x100 metres relay team at the 2012 london olympics . his former coach jon drummond has filed a defamation lawsuit against the sprinter , usada and usada chief travis tygart , claiming drummond was falsely accused of supplying gay with performance-enhancing drugs .", "summary": " wada have confirmed they will not appeal tyson gay 's doping ban .   us athlete received ban after testing positive for steroids in 2013 .   he received a reduced ban after ` substantial co-operation '   gay is set to return at lausanne 's diamond league meeting on july 3 .
