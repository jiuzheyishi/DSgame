{"text": "nasa has revealed a huge new gully on the martian surface - and says it formed in just three years . the mars reconnaissance orbiter snapped the area in 2010 and 2013 - and today revealed the before and after images that show the gully appearing . they say it was probably formed by carbon-dioxide frost . drag the slider bar below to see the before and after pictures . since its arrival in orbit in 2006 , mro . and its high resolution imaging science experiment -lrb- hirise -rrb- telescope . have been mapping the martian surface . it completed its primary science phase in 2008 and continues investigations of mars ' surface , subsurface and atmosphere . the orbiter sports a dish antenna 10 feet in diameter and uses it to pour data earthward at up to 6 megabits per second . it has a number of instruments including three cameras - one of which is hirise , a spectrometer for identifying minerals , a ground-penetrating radar and an atmosphere sounder . gully or ravine landforms are common on mars , particularly in the southern highlands , ' nasa said . ` this pair of images shows that material flowing down from an alcove at the head of a gully broke out of an older route and eroded a new channel . ' the dates of the images are more than a full martian year apart , so the observations did not pin down the martian season of the activity at this site . before-and-after hirise pairs of similar activity at other sites demonstrate that this type of activity generally occurs in winter , at temperatures so cold that carbon dioxide , rather than water , is likely to play the key role , the team believe . the area is home to several large gullies and channels . mro has observed other martian features that do seem associated with liquid water -- dark streaks known as recurring slope lineae , for instance . since its arrival in orbit in 2006 , mro . and its high resolution imaging science experiment -lrb- hirise -rrb- telescope . have been mapping the martian surface . the . hirise team released preliminary , black-and-white images in march of . that year , and have since collected hundreds more . this pair of before -lrb- left -rrb- and after -lrb- right -rrb- images from the high resolution imaging science experiment -lrb- hirise -rrb- camera on nasa 's mars reconnaissance orbiter show the new gully forming on a martian slope between nov. 5 , 2010 , and may 25 , 2013 . since 2006 , the mars reconnaissance orbiter has been charting the red planet 's terrain . this image shows defrosting of the crests of ` inca city ' . this is the informal name given to a set of intersecting ridges that are located among the layered materials of the south polar region of mars . their origin has never been understood .", "summary": " images captured by mars reconnaissance orbiter in 2010 and 2013 .   believed it was formed by carbon-dioxide frost .
