{"text": "clemson university student nathan weaver set out to determine how to help turtles cross the road . he ended up getting a glimpse into the dark souls of some humans . weaver put a realistic rubber turtle in the middle of a lane on a busy road near the south carolina campus . then he got out of the way and watched over the next hour as seven drivers swerved and deliberately ran over the animal . several more apparently tried to hit it but missed . cruel intentions : clemson university student nathan weaver holds a fake turtle he placed in a busy road to see how many drivers would intentionally swerve to hit it . ` i 've heard of people and from friends . who knew people that ran over turtles . but to see it out here like this . was a bit shocking , ' said weaver , a 22-year-old senior in clemson 's . school of agricultural , forest and environmental sciences . to seasoned researchers , the practice was n't surprising . the number of box turtles is in slow decline , and one big reason is that many wind up as roadkill while crossing the asphalt , a slow-and-steady trip that can take several minutes . sometimes humans feel a need to prove they are the dominant species on this planet by taking a two-ton metal vehicle and squishing a defenseless creature under the tires , said hal herzog , a western carolina university psychology professor . ` they are n't thinking , really . it is not something people think about . it just seems fun at the time , ' herzog said . ` it is the dark side of human nature . ' waiting : as the orange-shelled turtle rests in a road near the south carolina campus , nathan weaver , right , talks with his professor , rob baldwin , left , as they wait to see if any cars will hit it . herzog asked a class of about 110 . students getting ready to take a final whether they had intentionally . run over a turtle , or been in a car with someone who did . thirty-four . students raised their hands , about two-thirds of them male , said herzog , . author of a book about humans ' relationships with animals , called ` some . we love , some we hate , some we eat . ' weaver , who became interested in animals and conservation through the boy scouts and tv 's ` crocodile hunter ' steve irwin , wants to figure out the best way to get turtles safely across the road and keep the population from dwindling further . among the possible solutions : turtle underpasses or an education campaign aimed at teenagers on why drivers should n't mow turtles down . the first time weaver went out to collect data on turtles , he chose a spot down the road from a big apartment complex that caters to students . he counted 267 vehicles that passed by , seven of them intentionally hitting his rubber reptile . he went back out about a week later , choosing a road in a more residential area . he followed the same procedure , putting the fake turtle in the middle of the lane , facing the far side of the road , as if it was early in its journey across . the second of the 50 cars to pass by that day swerved over the center line , its right tires pulverizing the plastic shell . ` wow ! that did n't take long , ' said weaver . shattered : the shattered plastic shell rests beside the rubber turtle after seven drivers swerved and deliberately ran over the animal in the first half hour . several others tried and missed . other cars during the hour missed the turtle . but right after his observation period was up , before weaver could retrieve the model , another car moved to the right to hit the animal as he stood less than 20 feet away . ` one hit in 50 cars is pretty significant when you consider it might take a turtle 10 minutes to cross the road , ' weaver said . running over turtles even has a place in southern lore . in south carolina author pat conroy 's semi-autobiographical novel ` the great santini , ' a fighter-pilot father squishes turtles during a late-night drive when he thinks his wife and kids are asleep . his wife confronts him , saying : ` it takes a mighty brave man to run over turtles . ' the father denies it at first , then claims he hits them because they are a road hazard . ` it 's my only sport when i 'm traveling , ' he says . ` my only hobthat hobby has been costly to turtles . it takes a turtle seven or eight years to become mature enough to reproduce , and in that time , it might make several trips across the road to get from one pond to another , looking for food or a place to lay eggs . a female turtle that lives 50 years might lay over 100 eggs , but just two or three are likely to survive to reproduce , said weaver 's professor , rob baldwin . snakes also get run over deliberately . baldwin wishes that were n't the case , but he understands , considering the widespread fear and loathing of snakes . but why anyone would want to run over turtles is a mystery to the professor . ` they seem so helpless and cute , ' he said . ' i want to stop and help them . my kids want to stop and help them . my wife will stop and help turtles no matter how much traffic there is on the road . i ca n't understand the idea why you would swerve to hit something so helpless as a turtle .
