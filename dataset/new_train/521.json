' however unite 's general secretary said the union was simply trying to establish ` minimum standards ' . diana holland said : ` these votes send a clear message throughout the industry and should prompt all the major companies to get around the table to establish minimum standards . ` this is not about pay - this is about ensuring that high safety and training standards are maintained , so that our communities are safe . ` it is about a simple measure , the creation of an industry-wide bargaining forum . it is about bringing fairness and stability back to an essential national industry . ' the union is led by the militant len mccluskey , who has also called for strikes to disrupt the olympics . those comments were labelled ` unacceptable and wrong ' by mr miliband - but the labour leader has not commented on his latest vote . ghost of 2000 protests : tankers blockaded ports in order to prevent fuel reaching stations in protest at the government tax on fuel . unite , the country 's largest trade union , is also the biggest donor to the labour party , handing over around # 3million a year . it gave # 10,000 to ed miliband 's leadership election campaign -- which only succeeded because of his backing from trade unions . tricky position : a ballot by the drivers ' union unite is likely to pile pressure on the labour leader , pictured , to condemn the threat of action . the government said it had ` robust resilience and contingency plans ' to deal with a strike and had already started to put these in place to minimise any disruption to the public . energy secretary edward davey said : ` the unite ballot result is disappointing . ` the government is strongly of the view that strike action is wrong and unnecessary . the union should be getting round the negotiating table , not planning to disrupt the lives of millions of people across britain . ` this is an industrial dispute and we strongly urge unite to resolve it by getting back to the negotiating table , not by threatening the nation with economic and social disruption . ` our economy is just getting back on its feet and any action that makes that harder is totally unjustified . ` with the london 2012 olympics approaching , it is unacceptable and selfish to behave in this manner and jeopardise our international reputation . ` unite has committed to ensuring that essential services are not disrupted . we trust it will live up to this commitment and not put anyone in harm 's way . ` the government stands ready to take whatever action we can to minimise the impact of any strike . ` if we have to , we will use emergency powers to make sure supplies for emergency services are prioritised and we will work to ensure trained military personnel are available to drive oil tankers . ` the police will be on hand to ensure that strike action does not intimidate or prevent drivers that wish to work from doing so . ` while their main concerns are pay and conditions , which are matters for their employers , they have also raised health and safety . we take health and safety very seriously and will be looking carefully at what unite is saying . ` ensuring people are safe at work is a priority for us and we are committed to resolving any issues around this . ` but we are clear - first and foremost - the parties must get back around the table . there is no justification for this . it 's the wrong action at the wrong time . ' ministers say the training of army drivers will begin . next week . thorn in labour 's side : the union is led by the militant len mccluskey , pictured , who has also called for strikes to disrupt the olympics . cabinet office minister francis maude said the government had learned from 2000 , when many petrol stations ran out of fuel and the nhs was placed on red alert . he said : ` we are calling on the trade . union unite and the employers involved to work together to reach an . agreement that will avert industrial action . ` widespread strike action affecting . fuel supply at our supermarkets , garages and airports could cause . disruption across the country . ` the . general public should not and must not suffer from this dispute , and . strike action is manifestly not the answer . although we are pushing for . an agreement , we have learnt the lessons of the past and stand ready to . act to minimise disruption to motorists , to industry and , in particular , . to our emergency services . ' the . contingency plans have been drawn up by mr maude , transport secretary . justine greening , home secretary theresa may , health secretary andrew . lansley and energy secretary ed davey . however , the petrol retailers . association , which represents about 5,500 forecourts , said it did not . think the government was prepared for a strike . chairman . brian madderson said : ` we have had no word from the department of . energy and climate change whatsoever , so we have not been asking our . members to keep their stocks at a high level . ' on . its online ballot form , unite says : ` while the oil industry rakes in . multi-billion-pound profits , the drivers who supply fuel to forecourts . across the country are being squeezed ... the major employers have been . slashing drivers ' terms and conditions and cutting corners on training . and safety in a bid to win contracts . ' tanker drivers earn around # 45,000 a year for 37 hours of work a week .", "summary": " reminder of fuel protests in 2000 as unite fuel drivers vote to strike .   around 7,900 forecourts may be forced to close if unable to receive fuel .   government prepares to train soldiers to replace drivers to keep fuel moving .   ed miliband stays silent over unite - one of labour 's biggest donors .
