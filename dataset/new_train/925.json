{"text": "a campaign aimed at preventing bullying in schools across the u.s. is being boycotted by a conservative christian group that claims it promotes homosexuality among students . mix it up at lunch day , which sees schoolchildren encouraged to sit with fellow pupils they would n't normally spend time with , is designed to break up social cliques and stop students feeling isolated , organisers say . but the american family association , a conservative evangelical group , has branded the project a ` nationwide push to promote the homosexual lifestyle in public schools ' . mix it up : organisers of the event say it is designed to help break down social barriers and curb bullying in schools . around 200 schools have cancelled plans to hold mix it up at lunch day on october 30 after the association e-mailed parents urging them to keep their children at home on the day of the event . maureen costello , from the southern poverty law center , which launched the programme 11 years ago , said the christian group had lied to parents about the aims of the event and reverted to a ` cynical , fear-mongering tactic ' . the southern poverty law center recently added the american family association - which describes itself as acting to ` restrain evil by exposing the works of darkness ' - to its national list of active hate groups , which also includes neo-nazis and holocaust deniers . but bryan fischer , director of issue analysis for the association , said it was not a hate group but rather ' a truth group ' . he said that , while mix it up day does not specifically address homosexual students , the law center promotes equal treatment for gay and lesbian pupils and that philosophy informs the event . ` it 's just another thinly veiled attempt to promote the homosexual agenda , ' mr fischer told the new york times . ` no one is in favour of anyone getting bullied for any reason , but these anti-bullying policies become a mechanism for punishing christian students who believe that homosexual behaviour is not something that should be normalised . ' ` truth group ' : bryan fischer has accused organisers behind mix it up day of trying to promote ` the homosexual agenda ' ms costello , director of the law center 's teaching tolerance project , told the newspaper mix it up day was not about sexual orientation but rather about breaking up fixed social cliques , which can be especially evident in school cafeterias . she said pupils who are gay or perceived to be gay can often be on the receiving end of bullying at school , but insisted any suggestion the programme was intended as a means of homosexual indoctrination was totally wrong . ` we 've become used to the idea of lunatic fringe attacks but this one was complete misrepresentation , ' she said . only one of around 200 schools that have cancelled planned mix it up days agreed to comment . the chattahoochee county education center in cusseta , georgia , said it decided to cancel because teachers were too busy trying to meet state teaching requirements , and not because it wanted to take a position on gay rights . ` complete misrepresentation ' : the southern poverty law center said the christian group had lied to parents about what mix it up day stands for . the avon grove charter school in rural pennsylvania is still planning to hold mix it up at lunch day for its 1,600 students , despite complaints from parents . headteacher kevin brady said the e-mail from the american family association described an event that bore ` absolutely no resemblance to what we do ' . he said that once parents understood how the programme actually worked , they saw no reason not to allow their children to attend school . on mix it up at lunch day students are each assigned a number and then paired up by school officials to sit together at lunch time .", "summary": " mix it up day was launched as a means of breaking up cliques and preventing bullying at schools in the u.s.   sees pupils encouraged to sit with somebody they would n't normally choose to at lunchtime .   conservative group the american family association has described it as a ` nationwide push to promote the homosexual lifestyle ' in public schools .   around 200 schools have cancelled the event after the evangelical group urged parents to keep their children at home on the day of the event .
