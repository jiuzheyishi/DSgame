{"text": "he 's an 82-year-old  redneck hillbilly from west north carolina  who 's been scratching an itch to go fast his whole life . finally , after decades of racing high-performance speed boats and winning world-class endurance car competitions , preston henn got his hands on the fastest executive jet on the planet : the g650 . cnn caught up with henn by cell phone between practice laps at daytona international speedway .  as long as the cars here do n't crank up , we can talk !  he said . from then on , henn -- florida 's flea market kingpin -- sounded like a giddy schoolboy as he told his story about how he put down a $ 1 million deposit in april 2012 to become the first person to buy a gulfstream g650 --  the hottest airplane out there  -- with its distinctive , sweeping , curving wings and its roomy , swanky interior . it made him  feel like a million dollars ,  he said gleefully . for a plane that costs $ 65 million , feeling like $ 1 million might seem like a disappointment . but you get the picture . the jet 's top speed : 704 mph -- nearly the speed of sound -- makes it arguably the world 's fastest civilian aircraft .  i was just amazed at how quick it took off ,  says henn .  and then it just went zoom -- straight up . i just sat back and drank a glass of wine and enjoyed it .  henn knows speed . he 's been around the track a time or two -- winning the checkered flag during the '80s at the 24 hours of daytona and the 12 hours event at florida 's sebring international raceway . he does n't compete anymore . but he still travels around the world to race his friends . a super-fast g650 that can fly 8,000 statute miles -- farther than just about any other executive class jet -- might save him a lot of time and hassles . saving time and avoiding hassles are the main reasons the rich and famous want to fly private . oprah winfrey and bill gates reportedly each own a bombardier global express . tom cruise is said to have a gulfstream iv . jackie chan has an embraer legacy 650 . and jay-z reportedly received a bombardier challenger 850 from his wife , beyonce , as a father 's day gift . but none of these planes can smoke the g650 . speed aside , it 's got goodies like no other jet in its class . in the cockpit : an infrared night-vision system projects a pilot windshield display , increasing safety during landings . in the cabin : bigger 28-inch-tall windows and a ceiling height of 6-and-a-half feet .  if you fly from here to tokyo , you have to fly with two crews ,  henn explains . the g650 has  a complete crew quarters and restrooms and galley and everything they need . so it 's a different breed of cat from what i 'm used to .  speed flows through henn 's family bloodline , dating back to his boyhood in western north carolina . his father raced speed boats and cars when he was n't running movie theaters . as an adult in 1963 , henn bought a drive-in theater of his own in fort lauderdale , florida . during the next half-century , that drive-in grew into the swap shop -- an 88-acre flea market and cash cow . of course , henn 's not the lone lover of the g650 . reportedly , the plane has caught oprah 's eye as well . also said to be interested are hollywood media mogul david geffen , designer ralph lauren and financial wizard warren buffett . keep in mind that  very few celebrities own their own jets ,  says doug giese of embraer executive jets . owning a plane is still expensive , even if you 're rich . giese says most celebs fly private by using brokers or buying memberships in fractional share programs . brokers . new hampshire-based pjs private jet services group brokers private jets -- hooking planes up with passengers for a one-time , up-front price .  private aviation is becoming more commonplace because there are more programs now ,  says pjs ceo greg raiff , a 23-year top broker whose business includes several college and professional sports teams .  thanks to the internet , there are now 500 companies that can arrange something for you .  typically , an aircraft that can fly about 10 passengers round trip from new york city to los angeles could cost about $ 54,000 . a smaller jet that seats about seven might cost $ 26,000 round trip from philadelphia to austin , texas . split the cost among the passengers , and it 's comparable to the price of some luxury cruises -- and a possible option to celebrate an important life-event such as a golden anniversary or a retirement party . fractional shares . fractional share programs such as netjet have been around for a while , offering travelers the less expensive option of buying shares of a jet instead of buying the whole thing . share programs often come with  jet cards .  prepay tens of thousands of dollars onto your card in exchange for the convenience of dialing an 800 number and ordering a jet .  that was a real industry game-changer ,  says raiff .  it made booking a jet as easy as ordering a pizza .  one downside , says raiff : you have to pay well in advance . many jet cards start at a minimum of $ 100,000 , but delta private jets offers a more affordable $ 25,000 card . give them at least 48 hours notice , and they 'll get you a plane , says dpj president cyril turner . one upside , says turner : you 're protected against rising prices .  people can lock in today 's rate even if there are future increases ,  turner says .  with the cost of jet a fuel approaching $ 6 a gallon and a burn rate approaching -- depending on the plane type -- 200 gallons an hour , that gets pretty costly .  delta private jets charges about $ 5,000 per hour for jets seating up to eight people . rates start at $ 9,800 per hour for jets seating up to 14 people . blackjet offers an even more creative idea :  semi-private  flying , cnnmoney reports . blackjet books business class planes from carriers such as jetselect and sells the seats individually . a blackjet seat on a challenger 300 from new york to l.a. might cost around $ 3,500 . cnnmoney : blackjet offers private jet seats for less . development of the g650 survived a crisis in 2011 , when one of the jets crashed during a takeoff performance test in new mexico , killing two gulfstream pilots and two flight test engineers . federal investigators blamed gulfstream 's testing process . during the investigation , gulfstream temporarily shut down its g650 test planes . but 17 months later , the g650 received faa certification . now , gulfstream has more than 200 customers waiting to get their hands on a g650 . so far , only about a half dozen have been delivered to customers . as they roll out , plane spotters are on site , snapping photos and posting them online .  if you call gulfstream and ask , ` when can i get a g650 ? ' it 's four or five years off ,  says henn . unfortunately for henn , enjoying his g650 wo n't be an option for the time being . ultimately , he says , he 's a businessman , and the plane is an investment . he leased the jet back to gulfstream so the company can use it as a demonstration model .  it 's on its way to china ,  henn says .  it 's supposedly going to set a round-the-world record .  there 's a hint of disappointment in henn 's voice , above the sounds of revving engines at the daytona track .  sorry , it 's time to get back to it ,  he explains . his enzo ferrari is beckoning .  i 'm going to take my enzo back out on the track , and then i 'm finished for today ,  he says .  then i 'm going back to work .
