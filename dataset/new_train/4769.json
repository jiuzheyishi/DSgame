{"text": "if you want to scare them away from drugs , this is the cartel you tell your children about . los zetas revolutionized mexican drug trafficking with their brutality , and that unprecedented level of savagery could mean the end of the cartel 's nightmarish reign .  this is probably the beginning of the end of the zetas as a coherent , cohesive organization ,  said alejandro hope , a former executive for mexico 's civilian intelligence agency who now serves as security policy director for the mexico competitiveness institute , a mexico city think tank . take the group 's leader , miguel angel treviño morales , aka  el 40  or  z-40 ,  who was taken into custody this week during a marine operation south of his hometown of nuevo laredo . treviño had a reputation for punishing his foes with  guisos ,  spanish for  cookouts  and the term used for burning someone alive . with the zetas , it is n't about murder or torture . it 's about making a statement . that statement resounds so effectively that non-zetas , members of other cartels , dress like the group and claim to be them simply to instill fear .  los zetas is a powerful brand ,  hope said .  it is identified with extreme violence . it is identified with a complete absence of scruples .  though los zetas have long been known for their violence , especially after their suspected 2010 massacre of 72 migrants who refused to mule their drugs , two incidents got the attention of u.s. and mexican authorities , hope said . for cartels , business as usual in small-town usa . in february 2011 , two u.s. immigration and customs enforcement agents were ambushed in the state of san luis potosi . agent jaime zapata was fatally shot . about six months later , several men -- thought to be los zetas ' extortion enforcers -- torched the casino royale in monterrey , killing 52 people .  there are many types of drug trafficking ,  hope said .  this one is particularly toxic .  george grayson , a professor of government at the college of william & mary and co-author of  the executioner 's men ,  which focuses on los zetas , said in an e-mail that while u.s. and mexican authorities have zeroed in on los zetas , other factors have helped fracture the group . among them is los zetas ' massive expenditures on weaponry to defend their turf .  over the years , los zetas have evolved from a vertical organization with effective command-and-control mechanisms to mcdonald 's - like franchises ,  grayson said , explaining that as los zetas ' leadership has been eviscerated , the group has relied on groups of  green-as-grass newcomers  who lack the operational savvy of the original los zetas . as have the authorities , the sinaloa , gulf and knights templar cartels have all turned their attention to taking down the group , and los zetas have chosen weak allies in the beltran-leyva organization and juarez cartel , grayson said . the group also lost a key military strategist in heriberto lazcano lazcano , who was killed by mexican marines last year , he said . former operatives have turned informant , grayson said , and lazcano 's ally , ivan  el taliban  velazquez caballero -lrb- now imprisoned in mexico -rrb- , has accused trevino of  betraying his comrades in order to get better treatment for his family members captured in the united states .  hope said many of the top - and second-tier leaders have been killed or arrested , also assisting in los zetas ' fragmentation . los zetas got their start as enforcers for one of mexico 's oldest drug trafficking groups , the gulf cartel , which traces its roots to the 1930s , said university of texas-el paso anthropology professor howard campbell , who has written extensively on drug trafficking . the cartel was in disarray until the 1990s , when osiel cardenas guillen , now imprisoned in the united states ,  made the gulf cartel really super-powerful again , bringing huge loads of cocaine and other drugs into the u.s. ,  campbell said . by the late 1990s , cardenas found himself at the cartel 's helm .  one of the most innovative tactics he used was co-opting a lot of highly trained military people . he was the first to openly recruit a swat-like enforcement wing ,  campbell said .  -lrb- cartels -rrb- were violent before , but then all of a sudden you have this trained paramilitary wing .  massacres ensued . killings were posted on the internet . leaving bodies and body parts in public places was a hallmark of los zetas ' work , as was torture , especially dismemberment . or as campbell put it ,  chopping up bodies as you would meat in a butcher shop .  theories abound about what led to the rift between the gulf cartel and los zetas , but several years ago -- campbell estimates it was about 2008 -- los zetas broke off ,  unleashing a tremendous wave of violence all over northeast mexico .  where other cartels , including the rival sinaloa cartel , took part in a  patronage network ,  paying police and government officials for their assistance in illicit enterprise , los zetas preferred brutal takedowns of entire towns and regions , campbell said .  -lrb- los zetas -rrb- therefore became public enemy no. 1 in mexico ,  he said . they did n't stick solely to drug trafficking , either . their criminal resume includes extorting business for  protection fees ,  charging other cartels for passing through their extensive territory , gun and human smuggling , kidnapping and money laundering .  violence was a key tool for these guys to obtain all kinds of streams of income ,  hope said . their turf includes the lucrative drug plaza of nuevo laredo and southern tamaulipas , piedras negras , tuxpan , coatzacoalcos , la huasteca san luis potosi , zacatecas and parts of sinaloa , tabasco and nuevo leon states , grayson said . with treviño 's capture , several scenarios could enfold . his brother could take over , but campbell , hope and the geopolitical intelligence firm , stratfor , all question whether he has the respect or capabilities to head a national criminal outfit .  i would n't bet on that ,  hope said . more violent prospects include the sinaloa and gulf cartels attacking los zetas in northern mexico in a bid to control nuevo laredo ,  the crown jewel for cross-border flows for goods , services , guns , money , drugs and illegal aliens ,  grayson said . also , the professor postulated the gulf cartel could move to take over the matamoros and reynosa border crossings . another possibility is that the small gangs helping to fill out los zetas ' ranks could begin operating independently or be absorbed by other cartels , several experts said . this would be similar to what happened after colombia broke up the medellin and cali cartels .  ` cartelitos ' emerged that were violent and successful in shipping cocaine , but did not pose a threat to the nation-state ,  grayson said . whatever happens , do n't expect much impact on the u.s. side of the border , said author charles bowden , whose books on the mexican drug war include  murder city : ciudad juarez and the global economy 's new killing fields .   his arrest means nothing ,  bowden said .  none of the arrests under -lrb- former president felipe -rrb- calderon affected the shipment of drugs to the u.s. or the price of drugs in the u.s.  added hope ,  to affect the volume of drugs going into the u.s. , there needs to be a reduction in the demand for drugs in the u.s.
