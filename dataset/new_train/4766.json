{"text": "when karl-heinz rummenigge speaks , you listen . and his advice , if you want to be the best club in the world , is : never , ever sell your best players .  i believe a very important point in our history came in 2008 ,  rummenigge , a legend in german football and executive board chairman of the all-conquering bayern munich , told cnn .  we received big offers from england and spain for the transfer of franck ribery to big clubs and we decided not to accept ,  added the 58-year-old , referring to an official bid from chelsea and an inquiry from real madrid for the player who had cost bayern $ 40 million in 2007 .  that was very important . i believe because from that point onwards all clubs in europe understood that bayern munich was not a selling club . it 's a buying club and that 's it .  rummenigge is all too conscious that it could have been so very different for his beloved bayern , where he spent the first decade of his senior playing career and won numerous honors . back in 2004 , the bavarians finished second in the german bundesliga behind werder bremen and were knocked out of the uefa champions league in the last-16 by real madrid . not since 2001 had bayern lifted europe 's most coveted trophy , as teams from the english premier league , italy 's serie a and spain 's la liga dominated . for a club that enjoyed such glorious years in european cup football between 1974-76 , winning the title on three consecutive occasions , the prospect of being left behind by the continent 's elite was frightening . rummenigge -- who played in the 1976 success and was an unused substitute in the previous year 's final -- was all too aware of bayern 's precarious position . it was n't just the interest other more avaricious clubs had in bayern 's leading players ; the new money flooding into european football also potentially threatened the germans ' status .  about 10 years ago i thought we had no chance when gentlemen from russia and from the arab countries came into the business ,  said rummenigge , referring to the various takeovers of major european clubs by middle east groups and also roman abramovich 's investment in england 's chelsea .  then we found a very good philosophy at the club -- being a bit patient , and buying good players .  the story began in 2007 when we bought ribery , luca toni ... and we continue this story to today .  a buying club indeed -- bayern has become a european power to rival barcelona and real madrid by attracting some of the world 's top players . that it is able to do so owes much to the commercial model rummenigge has created along with club president uli hoeness . helped by the presence of so many of its great players on the board , bayern is a club which understands not just what happens on the pitch , but off it too . according to the deloitte money report , bayern is the third richest club in the world , with its revenue growing by 17 % over the past year to $ 592 million . it is the first time in 11 years that bayern has been in the top three of the money league and comes following a champions league triumph from which it gained a 31 % increase in broadcast revenue . its average home attendances of 71,000 led to matchday revenue of $ 4.6 million -- more than any other bundesliga club and less than only four others in europe . commercial revenue , merchandise , sponsorship and advertising have all increased markedly , while deals with partners have also boosted the coffers . extensions to deals with coca-cola and lufthansa , on top of the club 's longstanding partnerships with adidas and allianz , which holds the naming rights to the stadium , have put bayern miles ahead of its domestic rivals . that is part of the reason why it has been able to raid the likes of borussia dortmund for talents such as mario gotze , who joined at the start of this season , and robert lewandowski , who will arrive in munich when it finishes .  that is not our will ,  rummenigge says when asked about poaching from rival clubs .  our will is where you find the best players in the german bundesliga . in england it 's not different that the big clubs like chelsea , manchester united are interested especially in players from arsenal , from liverpool and so on . i believe that is the normality of the business .  such is the talent at bayern that pep guardiola , who took over from treble-winning coach jupp heynckes at the end of last season , was able to name germany internationals such as bastian schweinsteiger and thomas muller as substitutes for last week 's 2-0 win at arsenal in the champions league . already 19 points clear at the top of the bundesliga , unbeaten in 47 league games , bayern looks set to win a record 24th championship without much hassle . sunday 's 4-0 victory over hannover -- its 14th successive league win -- means only an absolute disaster can prevent bayern from coasting to a successful title defense , making dortmund 's two-season reign seem long ago . even more impressive is that bayern 's fans can enjoy this success while paying prices which english premier league counterparts could only dream of . bayern 's 225,000 members hold an 82 % share of the club , and rumenigge has made football accessible to all supporters with some season tickets available for just over $ 200 . indeed , the low-cost deals offered by all bundesliga teams are the envy of many within the european game . bayern , the 2013 club world cup champion , is seeking to extend its dominance and will reportedly open the club 's first overseas office in new york from april 1 to help break into the north american market . guardiola 's team will begin a u.s. tour in late july , including a match against the major league soccer all-star lineup . under the guidance of the spaniard , the possibilities appear endless for bayern -- a heavy favorite to become the first team to retain the european title since the advent of the champions league in 1992 . it makes bayern 's acquisition of the former barcelona coach even more frightening for those who are trying to compete within the same sphere .  from the very first meeting , i had a feeling that he was something special ,  rummenigge said of guardiola .  he 's different . obsessed by football in a very , very nice and good way . when i talked to our players six months ago they said this guy does n't stop our success story . this guy brings us ahead .  if they move any further ahead , then the others will only look on with fear .", "summary": " bayern munich chairman karl-heinz rummenigge opens up to cnn .   reveals his fears that german team would slip from football elite .   he says club 's refusal to sell franck ribery was pivotal moment .   bayern on course for record 24th bundesliga title and european defense .
