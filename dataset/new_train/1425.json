step 2 -- lined lips . firstly , take a lip pencil in a shade slightly warmer than your natural lip colour -- i 've gone for clarins lipliner pencil in bay rose -- and frame the outline of your lips to give them dimension and shape . kylie jenner revealed recently that her fuller looking lips were down to nothing more than ` clever make-up ' binky sees if she can achieve the same effect . take the pencil just outside your natural lip line to create a trick of shadow , making your lip shape appear fuller . once you 're happy with the shape you 've outlined , gently blend the pencil inwards into your lips with a small brush so the effect remains natural looking . focus the lipliner on the outer corners of your lips to ensure the centre of your pout looks as full as possible . feel free to reinforce the line with another layer of pencil after blending until you achieve the desired fullness . step 3 -- trick of light . next , apply a very light pink-toned lip pencil -- or a cream concealer such as bareminerals correcting concealer in light 1 -- onto the central area of your upper and lower lips , making sure not to go over the lip line you 've already applied . this sneaky trick creates the illusion of light and will make your pout look extra plump . similarly , adding a touch of pearlescent highlighter such as too faced candlelight softly illuminating translucent powder to your cupid 's bow will further accentuate your pout . step 4 -- add lipstick . lighter lip colours close to your natural lip shade tend to work better than darker hues when it comes to faking fuller lips -- think peachy nudes , pinks and browns . dior rouge dior nude lip blush in grege , clarins rouge eclat lipstick in nude rose and dhc premium lipstick in petal pink are three of my favourite lippy options for creating a plumped-up pout . binky recommends using a concealer in order to create an illusion of light . using a small lip brush , apply your chosen lip colour onto the lips . blend the light concealer in the centre outwards slightly -- without totally covering it -- so it merges seamlessly into your lips . this should result in a natural looking yet gorgeously voluptuous pout ! step 5 -- get glossy . finally , if you want to go all out , there 's no better product to add volume to the lips than a plumping gloss . givenchy gloss interdit ultra-shiny plumping effect lipgloss in impertinent nude provides the perfect shimmering veil to complement your plumper pout , imparting spectacular shine while instantly adding volume to the lips with its expert plumping formulation . what 's more , it does n't leave your lips feeling sticky or gloopy like some glosses can -- plus its fruity flavour will leave your pout feeling deliciously kissable as well as looking plumped-up to the max . all the products used to create my plump pout this week are available at escentual.com . you can really have fun with these tips , trying out different products , shades and textures for a wealth of lip looks . remember though , make-up exists to enhance the natural beauty you already have -- so do n't go overboard !
