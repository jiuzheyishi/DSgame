{"text": "carlsbad , california charity has always been a part of every spiritual tradition , and learning to give is an essential part of everyone 's inner growth . however , charity has a dirty little secret that few of us want to face . it can fail or backfire . our gifts can be squandered . a dollar given with compassion may wind up lining the pockets of someone who does n't deserve it . it 's a healthy sign that the public has become more aware of these drawbacks . yet we have to be careful to ward off cynicism . to stop giving would be the wrong choice . here 's how i empower my own giving while at the same time bringing the compassionate gift closer to the right receiver . first of all , fuel an aspiration . the most hopeless people in the world are n't the poorest ; they 're the ones who can never fulfill even a tiny dream . as a group , women are the largest population of the helpless , so i look to help them any way i can . invest in the future , which means directing your gift to young people . ask for accountability . know exactly where your money is going , and demand progress reports . take advantage of the multiplier effect . the reason micro-financing has taken off like wildfire is that small loans to individuals to help them buy their own land or start their own businesses turn out to pay off handsomely . the businesses get started and flourish . the loans are repaid quickly and thus multiply the effect of your gift . i participate in start fund , started by philanthropist fred matser of the netherlands . but there are now many online resources for directing your gift into micro-financing . give generously of your spirit . if you can do this , money is secondary . personal guidance , mentoring and encouragement happen on a one-to-one basis . if you can bring your spirit into contact with someone else 's , your gift can change a life . these are simple , basic guidelines , but i believe in them wholeheartedly . i hope they come to mind the next time you get one of those annoying phone calls from a fast-talking , impersonal fundraiser who works for a cut of the money raised . there 's a better way to give , and it 's open to all of us . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of deepak chopra .", "summary": " deepak chopra : giving part of inner growth , but corruption in charities makes us pause .   do n't stop giving , just be smart about it . seek accountability ; ask where your money goes .   chopra : help people reach aspirations . invest in future .   give of your spirit . helping someone in person can do more than money to change a life .
