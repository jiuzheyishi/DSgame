' he . said the party 's stated mission could not be reconciled ` with this . government 's attacks on the most vulnerable people in society ' . mr clegg insisted the party had . delivered on promises to raise the income tax threshold and introduce a . pupil premium for poorer children . ' i . am immensely proud that , facing the biggest crisis this country has . seen in a generation , the liberal democrats took a big , collective and . brave decision - at some political cost - to say we are going to step up . to the plate ... and fix this mess while also trying to make society . fairer . ' later mr doran told mailonline he had not been able to tackle mr clegg over claims he made about the cuts being fair . ` he did n't cover all the things that the coalition is doing to damage people on benefits . . this is the moment john doran told mr clegg why he had torn up his lib dem party membership card . mr clegg revealed he had been given a ` big green onesie ' but insisted he had not worn it . john doran told mailonline the lib dems should get rid of mr clegg as lib dem leader . mr doran added : ` i . am not talking about the proverbial scrounger . i am talking about the . vast majority of the working poor who are having benefits cut at every . opportunity . ` neither party got a majority so neither has a mandate to do all this stuff . ` there . are lots of different places there money could come from . i spend more . on wine than jobseekers allowance in a week . i live in a nice big house . ` my . lifestyle has not been impacted by this government . we have lost a bit . around the edges but compared to people who are struggling , worrying . about feeding their kids , heating their homes .

' i . know there was a men 's london fashion week event this week but i 'm not . not going to get into the habit of discussing those kinds of things , ' he . told reporters . asked . whether mr cameron listened to his deputy on the radio , the spokesman . said : ` he was scheduled to be in meetings at that point . ' lib dem strategists hope the weekly show will help turn around the party 's dire poll ratings . mr . clegg was also asked if pledging to cut tuition fees was ` the biggest . regret of his political life ' . but he would only concede it is . ` certainly ' a big regret . another caller , a sheffield university student called lauren , dismissed measures like the pupil premium as ` tokenistic ' and accused the government of discouraging young people from gaining qualifications by abolishing the educational maintenance allowance and increasing tuition fees . ` it seems as if the coalition is trying to tell them that higher education is not for them , ' said lauren - a charge mr clegg did not accept . the deputy prime minister repeated his apology for committing the lib dems not to raise tuition fees when they were not in a position to deliver on the promise . and he admitted that coming eighth in the rotherham by-election was ` woeful ' . mr clegg admitted that his party 's result in the rotherham by-election , coming eighth , was ` woeful ' but insisted the lib dems were right to join the coailtion . but he said it was always going to be ` monumentally controversial ' for them to enter coalition with any other party , and said voters were willing to give their support when they had a chance to explain their actions . ` where we can get on to people 's doorstep or in front of a radio mike and explain to people what we are doing , why we are sticking to our guns on some of the big decisions , why the country has to go through this difficult process , i 'm finding that people - perhaps not with bunting and wild-eyed enthusiasm - recognise that what we are doing is the right thing , ' he said . ` what i 'm trying to do is build a strong economy and a fair society . ' in a wide-ranging 30-minute slot , mr clegg also revealed ken clarke to be the top tory he would most like to go for a drink with . his first phone-in comes in the week of . the government 's mid-term review , which was seen as an attempt to . relaunch the coalition at the halfway point in its planned five-year . term . he emerged largely unscathed from the first encounter but party strategists will be worried if every week is dominated by angry former lib dems . lbc 97.3 broadcasts in greater london but is available online across the uk .", "summary": " deputy pm makes ` radio history ' to launch weekly radio show taking calls from listeners .   ex-party member john doran tells mailonline party should axe clegg .   lib dem challenged over decision to join coalition and defended cuts .   names ken clarke as the top tory he would most like to have a drink with .   reveals he owns a ` big green ' onesie - but has never worn it .
