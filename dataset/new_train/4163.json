{"text": "hours after a sudanese court sentenced his pregnant wife to death when she refused to recant her christian faith , her husband told cnn he feels helpless .  i 'm so frustrated . i do n't know what to do ,  daniel wani told cnn on thursday .  i 'm just praying .  this week a khartoum court convicted his wife , meriam yehya ibrahim , 27 , of apostasy , or the renunciation of faith . ibrahim is christian , her husband said . but the court considers her to be muslim . the court also convicted her of adultery and sentenced her to 100 lashes because her marriage to a christian man is considered void under sharia law . the court gave her until thursday to recant her christian faith -- something she refused to do , according to her lawyer . during thursday 's sentencing hearing , a sheikh told the court  how dangerous a crime like this is to islam and the islamic community ,  said attorney mohamed jar elnabi , who 's representing ibrahim .  i am a christian ,  ibrahim fired back ,  and i will remain a christian .  her legal team says it plans to appeal the verdict , which drew swift condemnation from human rights organizations around the world . in the meantime , ibrahim , who is eight months ' pregnant , remains in prison with her 20-month-old son .  she is very strong and very firm . she is very clear that she is a christian and that she will get out one day ,  elnabi told cnn from sudan . ibrahim was born to a sudanese muslim father and an ethiopian orthodox mother . her father left when she was 6 years old , and ibrahim was raised by her mother as a christian . however , because her father was muslim , the courts considered her to be the same , which would mean her marriage to a non-muslim man is void . the case , her lawyer said , started after ibrahim 's brother filed a complaint against her , alleging that she had gone missing for several years and that her family was shocked to find she had married a christian man . a family divided . the court 's ruling leaves a family divided , with ibrahim behind bars and her husband struggling to survive , elnabi said . police blocked wani from entering the courtroom on thursday , elnabi said . lawyers appealed to the judge , but he refused , elnabi said . wani uses a wheelchair and  totally depends on her for all details of his life ,  elnabi said .  he can not live without her ,  said the lawyer . the couple 's son is having a difficult time in prison .  he is very affected from being trapped inside a prison from such a young age ,  elnabi said .  he is always getting sick due to lack of hygiene and bugs .  ibrahim is having a difficult pregnancy , the lawyer said . a request to send her to a private hospital was denied  due to security measures .  there also is the question of the timing of a potential execution . in past cases involving pregnant or nursing women , the sudanese government waited until the mother weaned her child before executing any sentence , said christian solidarity worldwide spokeswoman kiri kankhwende . rights groups , governments ask for compassion . amnesty international describes ibrahim as a prisoner of conscience .  the fact that a woman could be sentenced to death for her religious choice , and to flogging for being married to a man of an allegedly different religion , is abhorrent and should never be even considered ,  manar idriss , amnesty international 's sudan researcher , said in a statement .  ` adultery ' and ` apostasy ' are acts which should not be considered crimes at all , let alone meet the international standard of ` most serious crimes ' in relation to the death penalty . it is a flagrant breach of international human rights law ,  the researcher said . katherine perks with the african centre for justice and peace studies said the verdict goes against sudan 's  own constitution and commitments made under regional and international law .   meriam has been convicted solely on account of her religious convictions and personal status ,  she said . foreign embassies in khartoum are urging the government there to reverse course .  we call upon the government of sudan to respect the right to freedom of religion , including one 's right to change one 's faith or beliefs , a right which is enshrined in international human rights law as well as in sudan 's own 2005 interim constitution ,  the embassies of the united states , united kingdom , canada and netherlands said in a statement .  we further urge sudanese legal authorities to approach ms. meriam 's case with justice and compassion that is in keeping with the values of the sudanese people ,  it read . ` egregious violations of freedom of religion ' attempts to contact sudan 's justice minister and foreign affairs minister about the ibrahim case were unsuccessful . sudan is one of the most difficult countries in the world to be a christian , according to international religious freedom monitors . under president omar al-bashir , the african nation  continues to engage in systematic , ongoing and egregious violations of freedom of religion or belief ,  the u.s. commission on international religious freedom said in its 2014 report . the country imposes sharia law on muslims and non-muslims alike and punishes acts of  indecency  and  immorality  by floggings and amputations , the commission said .  conversion from islam is a crime punishable by death , suspected converts to christianity face societal pressures , and government security personnel intimidate and sometimes torture those suspected of conversion ,  said the commission , whose members are appointed by congress and the president . the 8 worst places in the world to be religious . the sudanese government has arrested christians for spreading their faith , razed christian churches and confiscated christians ' property , the commission said . since 1999 , the u.s. state department has called sudan one of the worst offenders of religious rights , counting it among eight  countries of particular concern .   the government at times enforced laws against blasphemy and defaming islam ,  the state department said in its most recent report on religious freedom , from 2012 . the state department 's other countries of concern , all of which impose strict penalties on christians or other faiths , are : myanmar -lrb- also known as burma -rrb- , china , eritrea , iran , north korea , saudi arabia and uzbekistan . among all religious groups , christians are the most likely to be persecuted worldwide , according to a 2014 report by the pew research center . between june 2006 and december 2012 , christians were harassed by governments in 151 countries , pew reported . islam was second , with 135 countries . together , christians and muslims make up half of the world 's population , pew noted . lawyer says he 's gotten a death threat . elnabi says he got a death threat a day before the controversial court hearing , with an anonymous caller telling him to pull out of representing ibrahim or risk attack .  i feel very scared ,  he said .  since yesterday , i live in fear if i just hear a door open or a strange sound in the street .  still , the lawyer said he 'll continue representing ibrahim .  i could never leave the case . this is a matter of belief and principles ,  he said .  i must help someone who is in need , even if it will cost me my life .  wife : saudi blogger recommended for apostasy trial .", "summary": " meriam yehya ibrahim 's lawyer says she refused to recant her christian faith in court .   husband tells cnn :
