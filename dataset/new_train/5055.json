{"text": "celebrated physicist , sir bernard lovell , was asked by soviet officials to defect during his trip to the ussr at the height of the cold war . after he refused , he believes members of the kgb tried to wipe his memories of the visit using radiation , extracts from his diaries released yesterday reveal . his cold war diaries , kept hidden for 50 years , were promised only to be published upon his death . they reveal a fascinating story of kgb brainwashing , radiation weapons and an astronomer 's secret role at the centre of britain 's nuclear defences , being told in full for the first time . sir bernard lovell , the astronomer behind the jodrell bank observatory , reveals in his diaries that the soviets may have tried to remove memories from his brain using radiation . released by the family of sir bernard , after his death last month , they are an account of his visit to observatories in the crimea in the 1960s . if mi6 suspicions at the time were correct , his tale is one of the most fascinating revelations of the cold war . his son , bryan lovell , speaking to mailonline today said : ` they are an account of an extra-ordinary exchange at the height of the cold war . ' in 1963 sir bernard , who died aged 98 , went on a scientific visit to the soviet union . on his return and for a month afterwards the celebrated physicist felt inexplicably unwell . doctors could not explain why and his illness was left a mystery . but he believed until his death this august that someone did - the russian security services . sir bernard led the construction of the jodrell bank radio telescope which launched in 1959 and tracked the ussr 's sputnix satellite - the first of many achievements . secret : this section of his diaries shows an insert from the summer of 1963 , when he went to visit moscow . details of lovell 's flight ticket to moscow in the archived diaries , which were released yesterday . ink stained with scribbles , the incredible diaries detail an extraordinary account during the height of the war . his visit to crimea , written about his his diary extracts , pictured , was shortly after the cuban missile crisis . in an earlier interview the scientist said it was then used as the first ` early warning device ' of a soviet nuclear attack . this , he said , put him in the front line and prompted the russian military to try and harm him during a visit behind the iron curtain in 1963 . the diaries , which were kept in the archive at manchester university 's john rylands library and at last set out his suspicions , were released yesterday by his family and have been seen by mailonline . the kgb , he claimed , had tried to wipe his memories with a beam of focused radiation . his visit , as part of a british delegation , to observatories in the crimea , included a surprise trip to an unexpectedly advanced radio telescope at yevpatoria . after the visit to the telescope , he . claims soviet officials tried to persuade him to defect . he refused , . saying : ' i am an englishman and i wish to return to england . ' but . when he returned home all was not well . ` after a few days at home i . became mysteriously ill ' , he explains in a foreword to the diaries . ` there has never been an explanation of this sudden hiatus . ' debriefed by m16 , he heard an astonishing theory . the yevpatoria rt-70 radio telescope in yevpatoria , crimea . lovell 's visit , as part of a british delegation , included a visit to the advanced device . he wrote : ` the intelligence agents thought that by some means - probably radiation , the soviets tried to removed from my brain all memories of my visit to yevpatoria . ' sir bernard was so disturbed by the illness and its explanation , that he considered quitting astronomy altogether . he said : ' i visited the bursar and told him that i was proposing to resign from jodrell and go . into the church ... he did not dissuade me but my family did so , for . which i am everlastingly grateful . ' he said in a later memorandum : ` in retrospect , i should not have accepted that invitation to visit the ussr ... in the summer of 1963 and furthermore the joint intelligent burreau in london should have advised me not to visit moscow . ' sir bernard lovell , pictured in front of the telescope at jodrell bank observatory , said after a visit to the ussr , soviet officials tried to persuade him to defect . bryan lovell , the astronomer 's son , who is president of the geological society , told mailonline : ` what is fascinating about these diaries is the details of my father carrying out this scientific research right through the most dangerous part of the cold war . ` my father was one of the leading scientists in the west at the time . he was at the front line of defence during the height of the cold war . ' i remain to this day angry that he was sent to russia so soon after the cuban missile crisis , when he was obviously a key person in british defence . ' speaking about his illness following the trip to the ussr , he said : ` you and i will never really know what happened . ' he believes that the stress of the responsibility he carried for britain 's safety could have been an explanation for his sheer exhaustion upon his return to the uk . he said : ` there is the spooks explanation and then there is the mundane explanation -- that he was so exhausted due to tremendous strain . at the time , unknown to the public , . jodrell bank was not simply a astronomical establishment , but also one of . the most important military tools in the free world . bryan added : ` the reason for the embargo on the papers is that he wanted the context of the cold war to be published before his diary entries were released . ' sputnik 1 , the first artificial earth satellite . the soviet union launched it in 1957 and the jodrell bank telescope tracked it . the diaries also detail a discussion sir bernard had about the space race - which experts say effectively began with the soviet launch of the sputnix 1 artificial satellite in 1957 - a device lovell radio telescope tracked . sir bernard wrote in 1963 : ` they see great technical diffciulties which still have to be solved . ` the president said it was impossible to foretell if it would be . possible to arrive there quickly although one must remember the contrast . between today and the sputnix of 1957 . then he asked me to explain why . i thought it was necessary to get a man on the moon . the discussion . which followed clearly indicated that the president is thick in the . middle of the same kind of arguments which are taking place in the west . ` at least i realise now that to talk of a russian moon landing in 1968 . or 1970 means nothing more than guessing at dates which they themselves . are not even doing . ` although jodrell bank was built for scientific endeavour , nato very quickly realised that it was the only mechanism available to them for tracking soviet inter-continental ballistic missiles . through its huge radio telescope , they would be able to give seven minutes ' warning to london of approaching missiles -- enough time , intelligence chiefs believed , to save a million lives . the celebrated physicist in front of the lovell telescope , which was used for tracking soviet inter-continental ballistic missiles . 1913 sir bernard was born in oldland common , gloucestershire . he went on to study at bristol university . 1936 bernard lovell gained his phd and . was persuaded to join university of manchester physics department . 1939 drafted into war work , he was . involved in the hs2 radar-assisted bomb project that targeted . submarines . hitler said that the ` setback in our u-boat campaign is due . to a single technical invention of our enemies ' . sir bernard worked on the . development of radar , which gave the raf a vital edge over the . luftwaffe . 1946 appointed an obe for his radar . work , lovell tested a theory that echoes seen by coastal defence radar . might be reflections from cosmic rays . he learnt instead that they were . from meteors , but it created interest in radio astronomy . 1952 signed a contract with a . sheffield company to build 250ft steerable radio dish -- the start of a . project whose costs led to threats of imprisonment for lovell . its debts . were settled when the british and us governments started paying for its . military surveillance capabilities and lord nuffield wrote a cheque for . # 80,000 . 1955 after returning to the university of manchester following the war , lovell began planning the jodrell bank observatory . in the 1955 the construction began for the 249ft lovell radio telescope which remains the defining feature of jodrell . bank and is the world 's third largest steerable telescope . 1957 the new jodrell bank telescope . tracked sputnik 1 -- the first of many achievements . later it helped to . study pulsars , quasars and gravitational lenses around black holes . lovell said of it :  i had difficulty convincing anyone that it would be . of use astronomically for 15 years and the engineers said i 'd be lucky . if it lasted for 15 years . it has lasted 50 . 1961 sir bernard earned his knighthood principally in recognition of his role in founding the university 's jodrell bank observatory . 2008 the telescope was saved from closure august . august 2012 sir bernard lovell died aged 98 .", "summary": " celebrated physicist requested diaries to be published only on his death .   sir bernard lovell had secret role at centre of britain 's nuclear defences .   reveals theory soviets tried to remove from brain all memories of ussr visit .   son ` angry ' that father , ` front line of defence ' , was allowed to go to moscow .
