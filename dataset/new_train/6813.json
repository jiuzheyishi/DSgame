{"text": "forget luxury machines and expensive beans , scientists have uncovered the secret behind the perfect cup of coffee - reasonably hard tap water . coffee-loving experts used different types of water to find out how coffee flavours differed . they found water composition made a ` dramatic difference ' to coffee from the same bean - with certain types of hardness boosting the taste . scroll down for video . coffee-loving experts used different types of water to find out how coffee flavours differed . high magnesium ion levels were found to increase the extraction of coffee into water , though high bicarbonate levels were bad for flavour . sodium rich water - such as that produced by water softeners - was also not beneficial to taste , according to chemist christopher hendon of the university of bath . ` coffee beans contain hundreds of chemicals ; the precise composition depends on the type of bean and how it is roasted , ' mr hendon , a phd student at the university 's centre for sustainable chemical technologies , said . howcast.com . ` coffee beans contain hundreds of chemicals ; the precise composition depends on the type of bean and how it is roasted , ' say the scientists . ` the flavour of the resulting coffee is determined by how much of these chemicals are extracted by the water , which is influenced by roast profile , grind , temperature , pressure and brew time . ` we 've found that the water composition is key to the proportions of sugars , starches , bases and acids extracted from a particular roast . ' the coffee industry currently uses guidelines on the ideal water for coffee extraction from the speciality coffee association of europe , which puts emphasis on measuring ionic conductivity to quantify the total dissolved solids . however , the research found it was in fact the proportions of these ions that affected the extraction , and therefore the taste , of the coffee . ` hard water is generally considered to be bad for coffee , but we found it was the type of hardness that mattered - while high bicarbonate levels are bad , high magnesium ion levels increase the extraction of coffee into water and improve the taste , ' mr hendon said .", "summary": " water composition makes a ` dramatic difference ' to coffee from same bean .   softened water does not a good cup of coffee make .   java tastes analysed by scientists at university of bath .
