{"text": "maria sharapova once labeled the conditions as  inhuman  and three-time defending men 's champion novak djokovic suffered a dramatic meltdown in a quarterfinal match in 2009 so it 's with a degree of trepidation that the world 's elite go into the australian open with a heatwave forecast for melbourne . temperatures are predicted to reach a blistering 42 degrees celsius tuesday -lrb- 107 fahrenheit -rrb- and remain at that level until the weekend . while the opening grand slam of the season has an extreme heat policy -- in place since 1998 -- it is rarely invoked and players simply have to make do . djokovic , who had to retire with heat exhaustion against andy roddick when defending his 2008 crown , has become renowned for his supreme fitness levels and claims to be ready for any challenge .  i am expecting to play in big heat . you always have to expect it because you ca n't really predict melbourne 's weather , it 's changing a lot ,  djokovic told gathered reporters on the eve of his title defense .  i remember the 2008 , 2009 and 2010 tournaments , there were several days i played in extreme heat . so i know how tough it is .  but it 's the same for myself and my opponent so you have to adjust to it ,  he said . given a favorable draw , avoiding the likes of world number one rafael nadal , andy murray and roger federer until at least the final , djokovic is unlikely to be troubled by the weather or his first round opponent lukas lacko of slovakia on monday . after that the level of the opposition and the heat is expected to rise with swiss stanislas wawrinka looming large as his main threat . wawrinka extended djokovic in a five-set fourth round clash last year which many considered the outstanding match of 2013 . this time around they can not meet until the semifinals by which time forecasters are predicting a return to more manageable conditions . sharapova , playing her first grand slam since wimbledon last year , remains wary of conditions after being reminded of her 2007 three-setter against france 's camille pin , after which she made her outburst .  i do n't think anyone can prepare themselves for that type of heat ,  she told reporters .  when you try to put in that effort , that maximum effort to give as an athlete , it 's pretty difficult for a longer period of time .  murray , himself back in action after a layoff for surgery , is also not relishing extreme temperatures despite preparing for the championships in florida .  the difference between 32 degrees or whatever in florida and 40 , it 's a huge difference .  it feels very different on the court . the court gets so hot , the air is extremely hot as well ,  said the scot . if he can get the better of conditions , it is likely that both roger federer then nadal would stand in his path if he wants to repeat last year 's men 's final showdown with djokovic . defending champion victoria azarenka and top seed serena williams are strongly favored to meet in the women 's final and both claim to be unperturbed about the rising temperature gauge .  i 've been here playing for , what , last eight years . it 's not a new thing to play in the heat . i actually enjoy that ,  said azarenka .  i mean , not all the time probably , but it 's nice to get some sun .  williams tweeted earlier this week to complain about then cold conditions in the victorian state capital , but claims to be ready for whatever awaits .  i 've been training my whole life in the heat . i think i 'm pretty used to it . but obviously the heat in melbourne is just completely different than any other heat ,  said the american .  but it 's okay . i 've just got to be ready to play under any circumstances .  for the record , the hottest australian open was in 2009 when the average daily temperature was 34.7 celsius , with djokovic the most high-profile victim .", "summary": " high temperatures expected for australian open tennis championships .   temperatures set to reach 42 degrees celsius in melbourne .   tournament has an ` extreme heat ' policy .   men 's champion novak djokovic fell victim to conditions in 2009 .
