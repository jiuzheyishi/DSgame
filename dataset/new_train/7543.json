{"text": "feathered friend : the viscount circa 1935 , with blue boy the macaw perched on his shoulder at a garden party at tredegar house . he was one of the richest peers of the realm , a multi-millionaire with such a stash of inherited wealth he never needed to think about working . but evan , viscount tredegar , was more than your average spoilt aristocrat -- he was one of the most riotously outrageous and toxic eccentrics ever to emerge from the english upper classes . he studied for the priesthood , but practised black magic and befriended sinister occultist aleister crowley . even though he married an english actress and a russian princess , he was a promiscuous homosexual . he wrote poetry and dressed like shelley , yet he was so juvenile that he trained his parrot blue boy to climb the inside of his trouser-leg and pop its head out of his flies . the bizarre viscount even ran a homing-pigeon scheme for military intelligence during world war ii , but was court-martialled for revealing its secrets to two girl guides . and all around him , as he made his wayward path through life , friends had the mysterious habit of dying . ` his friendship was a kind of curse , ' says william cross , author of a new biography of the welsh peer . evan tredegar became a figure of horrified fascination to high society britain in the twenties and thirties as he pursued his twin lusts -- higher learning and sex . what else would you expect from a man whose mother believed herself to be a kingfisher and built bird 's nests big enough to sit in ? the dystopian world that evan frederic morgan , 2nd viscount tredegar , built for himself was only made possible by colossal wealth . when he came of age , the vast welsh estate his family had owned since the 14th century was bringing in the equivalent of # 65,000 a day -- or # 24 million a year . early life : evan morgan pictured with his father , the then viscount tredegar , when he was a 2nd lieutenant in the welsh guards . home was tredegar house , a ghostly , depressingly ugly pile near newport in south wales . evan 's father had made himself useful during the first world war by handing over his private yacht to the royal navy -- on condition that he was appointed its captain . money rather than service bought the gold braid with which he festooned himself -- so while he was still a schoolboy , evan learned that a title , and colossal wealth , could get you anything you wanted . at eton , he forged the friendships that were to shape his screwball life . his best friend peter churchill , a cousin of winston , spent part of his childhood in north africa and claimed to have sold sexual favours to men in return for pocket-money . w hile still at eton the pair became pageboys to the royal court at windsor at a time when , author cross claims , ` mothers of vulnerable sons were known to insist their cherished boys steer well clear of the well-known paedophiles at court ' . but it was too late -- both boys had already acquired a preference for their own sex , and before long evan was kicked out of eton under the inevitable cloud . it further counted against him that while at school he had created a circle of black-magic enthusiasts . inspired by peter churchill 's tales from north africa of temples , casbahs , souks and arcades where magicians and tricksters plied their trade , the boys dabbled in rites and rituals which were to become a central part of evan 's life . with no need to work , evan settled on becoming a poet . the first timer : despite never hiding his homosexuality and having a constant string of illicit affairs , viscount tredegar married viscountess lois sturt in 1928 . moving in the arty circle centred on the bohemian cafe royal in london , he became friends with the painter augustus john and the writer ronald firbank , a dandy with red-lacquered fingernails . during this period evan developed a taste for partying and buying sex from working-class rent boys . the viscount was no looker -- virginia woolf described him as ` a little red absurdity with a beak of a nose , no chin , and with the general likeness of a callow but student bantam cock that has run to seed ' . and in the helter-skelter world of britain after world war i , filled with flappers and cocktails and drug addicts , evan was constantly in search of newer , darker , sensations . he was fatally attracted to dangerous people . the occultist aleister crowley was known to society as ` the wickedest man in the world ' and in the twenties people were genuinely terrified by the mention of his name -- a byword for all that was mad , bad and dangerous to know . born the son of a brewer in leamington . spa , crowley , who called himself ` the great beast 666 ' , had built up a . terrifying reputation as a disciple of the devil . his stated purpose was to destroy the country 's religious and spiritual equilibrium . number two : princess olga sergievna dolgorouky became viscout evan tredegar 's second wife . little wonder then that the vicious viscount , with his schoolboy dabblings in the occult , should hasten to crowley 's side -- the pair met for the first time in paris . later crowley went to stay at tredegar house where evan proudly revealed his black magick room -- ` far greater than i thought ! ' marvelled crowley . despite his ostentatiously weird life -- in his garden he kept a boxing kangaroo , a honey bear and a baboon , while in his bed he kept rabbits -- evan morgan was still considered by ambitious mothers to be one of the country 's most eligible bachelors . only when girls got close to him did they realise how completely impossible life at tredegar house would be . however , lois sturt , daughter of the land-rich lord alington , was not so choosy . she had some of the same madness that infected evan tredegar and a whole swathe of the post-war bright young people . needy , nervy , self-centred and eccentric , she was also pretty , sexy and willing to overlook evan 's homosexuality.they married when she was 28 and he 35 . but it was doomed from the start . lois had already developed an addiction to drugs which would kill her before long . when they married in knightsbridge , the crowds had to be held back by police , but the high-society union between lois and evan was not what it seemed . each agreed the other could sleep with whom they pleased as long as it did n't interfere with their life together . but evan 's relentless all-male promiscuity and his love of rent boys soon rattled lois , and before long they parted . later . he married the shapely princess olga sergievna dolgorouky , a refugee . scarred by her escape from the russian revolution , but otherwise an . innocent abroad . the marriage was annulled , unsurprisingly , on the grounds of his non-consummation after three years . evan showed far greater devotion to his menagerie at tredegar than he did to either of his wives . easy life : lord tredegar , pictured at tredegar park near newport with writer h g wells , could live comfortably off his estate which brought in # 24million per year . birds were a big part of his life . his australian parrot , though described by evan as ` witless and uncontrollable ' , was nothing of the sort . after teaching it the trick of crawling up the inside of his trouser leg and poking its head out of his flies , the viscount promptly walked into the cafe royal and performed the routine in front of a packed house . one of the onlookers recorded that ` the effect on old ladies present can be imagined ' . periodically , evan would decide that he must do something serious with his life . when war was declared in 1939 , he managed to get himself taken on by mi14 , the secret service department detailed to handle carrier pigeons bringing back messages from frontline troops in france . so unused was he to the discipline which goes with military work , that he let two girl guides look at the map used to plan the 1942 allied attack on dieppe -- which , coincidentally , turned out to be one of the war 's greatest military disasters . such was the horror of superior . officers when they learned that he had divulged highly secret troop . deployment details -- even though it was only to a couple of teenage . girls -- that tredegar was court-martialled . story of a life : evan morgan , 2nd viscount tredegar , died in april 1949 , aged 55 , survived by his beloved parrot . he . was found guilty and banished to an honorary post in the welsh home . guard , but even that small responsibility proved too much for him . hopeless in war , the viscount remained equally rudderless in peace . throughout his life the ostensibly . high-minded evan described himself as a poet , modelling himself on . shelley and even dressing as the romantic poet , but he failed to attract . the praise of any but the most sycophantic critics . rich though he was , . evan could not buy literary success -- and rich though he remained , he . could no longer buy friendship in the way he once had . indeed , his friendship was something of a curse . those who were close to evan seemed to die in their droves -- often tragically young . first was guy colebrooke , a fellow royal pageboy , who died aged 27 . then ronald firbank died of lung cancer at the age of 40 . he was followed by fellow-drinker sir guy ` fatty ' laking , who succumbed to alcohol poisoning at 26 . one of evans 's lovers , the earl of lathom , keeled over from tuberculosis brought on by a dissipated life , while another lover , the hon james rodney , was killed in a house fire . friends peter watson , a wealthy art patron , and sir johnnie philipps both drowned in their baths . and another friend , the artist nina hamnett , plunged out of a window , impaling herself on the railings 40ft beneath . there were suicides , too : the artist kit wood , the composer peter warlock , fellow etonian brian howard and writer richard rumbold . even his first wife 's brother , the hon gerard sturt , killed himself . his sister gwyneth succumbed to drug abuse and her body was found washed up on the thames shore in 1924 . and so the party -- that gay , abandoned , reckless party of parrots , poetry and promiscuity -- eventually ended . evan morgan , whose riches so completely detached him from life , finally parted company with it on april 27 , 1949 -- a victim to cancer at the early age of 55 . the trouser-climbing parrot survived him . not behind lace curtains -- the hidden world of evan , viscount tredegar , by william cross -lrb- book midden publishing , #
