{"text": "suspicion that a norwegian citizen was involved in the deadly westgate mall attack in kenya last month  has been strengthened  but is not yet confirmed , norway 's security service said . the norwegian citizen , said to be of somali origin , is believed to have ties to mohamed abdikadir mohamed , known as ikrima , who is regarded as one of the most dangerous commanders in the somali terror group al-shabaab . the norwegian security service , pst , said its investigations in norway and kenya were ongoing , and that despite some media outlets reporting a name for the possible norwegian suspect , it was not ready to confirm his identity .  it has not yet been determined whether a named norwegian citizen actually took part in the attack or not ,  a pst statement said friday .  based on the information that we have uncovered this far in the investigation , however , the suspicion of his involvement has been strengthened .  it has also not yet been determined whether the person in question is still alive , the statement said . kenyan counter terrorism sources said norwegian intelligence services in kenya were investigating both ikrima and the norwegian citizen and have spoken to the latter 's sister in norway . but trond hugubakken , head of communications for the pst , told cnn on saturday that the two norwegian officers currently in kenya are not investigating ikrima , only the norwegian citizen and his connections with al-shabaab , as they seek to establish whether he was in kenya . he said the citizen 's name would be disclosed by norwegian authorities only if he 's confirmed to be one of the gunmen killed in the mall attack , or if they have sufficient evidence to issue an international warrant for his arrest . hugubakken said investigators were also questioning people in norway . kenyan authorities suspect ikrima , also wanted by the united states , of involvement with the westgate mall attack . al-shabaab claimed responsibility for the bloody four-day siege at the upscale mall in nairobi , where at least 67 people died . the islamist group claimed another deadly attack saturday , this time in the town of beledweyne , in central somalia . somali police officer isac ali abdulle told cnn at least 20 people were killed in the suicide blast at a cafe , although other officials gave a lower death toll . mohamed ibrahim ali , deputy governor of hiiraan province , said seven government soldiers were among the dead . al-shabaab said it was targeting somali and ethiopian army commanders in the area . target of u.s. raid . u.s. officials said ikrima was the target of a raid earlier this month by u.s. navy seals on an al-shabaab compound near the town of baraawe in somalia . it 's believed that he escaped after the u.s. troops came under heavy fire . a kenyan intelligence dossier seen by cnn alleges ikrima 's involvement with briton samantha lewthwaite , a terror suspect known as the  white widow ,  in a foiled mombasa attack in 2011 with jermaine grant , a fellow british citizen currently held in mombasa on terror charges . kenyan intelligence sources say that ikrima , who speaks six languages and grew up in kenya , is the main  point person  between al qaeda in somalia and al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , and that he has helped pinpoint kenyan targets . friends of ikrima who knew him from his time growing up on the nairobi suburb of eastleigh told cnn he traveled to norway in 2003 and grew increasingly radicalized there . the sources , who had kept up with him over the years , said ikrima traveled in 2007 to london , where they lost contact with him . in 2008 they heard he was in somalia , where he has been based since . arabic , english and swahili are among the six languages spoken by ikrima , and he studied french for two years at the alliance francais in nairobi , his friends say . al-shabaab 's growing reach . the possible involvement of the norwegian citizen in the westgate mall attack has highlighted concerns about the widening reach of al-shabaab outside somali borders . kenyan counterterror sources told cnn that security camera footage of the attackers inside the mall shows them talking by cellphone to people apparently outside the mall -- who the sources believe were giving the gunmen instructions . telephone intercepts have led all over the region , from uganda to somalia and even possibly to al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , the sources said . as for the norway connection , many people have traveled from scandinavia to somalia to join al-shabaab , cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank said . the leader of al-shabaab has been following a strategy aimed at transforming it from a regional insurgent outfit into a terrorist group , cruickshank said . ikrima , who is thought to have spent four years in norway , appears to be central to that strategy , he said . he managed to escape the raid by u.s. navy seals ,  so the concern now is that his credentials really will be burnished in the jihadist community globally , and he will be emboldened to commit more attacks potentially in the region ,  cruickshank said . ikrima told a western intelligence informant several years ago that one of his key goals was to carry out attacks back in the west , using recruits from western nations who 'd come to somalia for training . he is believed to be a key link figure between different terrorist groups including al qaeda and al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , and may have key intelligence on future plots . norwegian suspect . stig hansen , a security expert based in norway and author of the book  al-shabaab in somalia ,  told cnn that if the norwegian suspect is who he believes him to be , he lived in a small town in norway but had connections with a wider group , not all of somali origin . he came to norway at age 8 or 9 and stayed for a couple of years , during which time he gained norwegian citizenship , hansen said . he later returned to somalia . al-shabaab became quite popular among some somali community groups in norway from 2007 to 2009 , hansen said ,  because they were wrongly seen as some kind of national resistance group .  observers noticed contradictions between what the group said in its english - and arabic-language messaging , he said , which contributed to ignorance within the diaspora about its real nature .  but the terrorist attacks inside of somalia made it easier for the wider ethnic somali community to see that this was really a terrorist organization , and it distanced itself ,  he said , making it less popular now . however , this development brought its own problems , hansen said , and not just in norway .  what you have to look out for , also in the united states and the united kingdom and all these other scandinavian countries , are these small , small networks that are in one sense detached also from the somali community leaders -- radicalized groups of youths and radical preachers , sheikhs , that go traveling around the various countries to try to incite ,  he said .  that 's what we have to watch these days . ", "summary": " suspicion that a norwegian was involved  has been strengthened ,  security service says .   the norwegian citizen in question has not been named by authorities .   norway 's security service is investigating in kenya and norway .   the suspect is believed to have ties to a top al-shabaab commander , known as ikrima .
