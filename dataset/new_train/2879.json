{"text": "u.s. defense secretary chuck hagel says his afghan counterpart assured him that an important security pact will be reached with kabul in a  timely manner ,  despite a failure so far to forge a deal . hagel made the remark during a visit to afghanistan on saturday . what is known as the bilateral security agreement -- ready to be implemented but still unsigned -- initially has been front and center in hagel 's visit . hagel met with afghanistan 's officials , including the country 's defense minister , as washington works to get afghanistan to ink a bilateral security agreement to keep some u.s. and other coalition troops in the country after next year . the defense secretary said that from what he has heard in his discussions with afghan ministers , they believe it 's in the country 's interest to have such an agreement -- which lays out the u.s. military presence in afghanistan after 2014 , when the nato-led force of some 80,000 troops is scheduled to leave .  the minister of defense assured me that the bsa would be signed and would be signed in a very timely manner ,  hagel said , making reference to defense minister bismullah khan mohammadi . but failure to forge a security pact with afghan president hamid karzai has generated growing consternation among u.s. officials . the security agreement itself has been endorsed by the afghan council of tribal leaders , called the loya jirga , but karzai said he wo n't sign it until after the country 's elections in april and until certain conditions are met . these conditions include an end to u.s. raids on afghan homes and the release of afghan prisoners from the guantanamo bay detention center . washington has resisted such changes , saying karzai 's demands are new provisions added to a deal that was already reached . hagel said he had n't planned to meet with karzai and played down the significance of being in afghanistan and not meeting with the president . he said the trip had been planned for weeks and its purpose was visiting troops and meeting with afghan commanders to assess their progress . and , he told reporters , there have been many discussions at the political level with karzai during recent visits by other others , such as secretary of state john kerry . hagel emphasized the importance of the loya jirga 's decision and said  we are planning for a post-2014 presence here .  but he said nato -- which commands the multination international security assistance force in afghanistan -- will eventually need clarity on the security agreement 's status so it can properly plan its work in the country . nato warned it may be forced to withdraw all of its troops from afghanistan by the end of next year if karzai does n't sign a security agreement with the united states . karzai , meanwhile , is scheduled to make a visit to iran on sunday . iran 's semi-official mehr news said karzai will be meeting with iranian president hassan rouhani . according to state-run press tv , an iranian foreign ministry spokeswoman said tehran does n't believe the security agreement will benefit the afghan government and nation . marzieh afkham said tehran 's position is that the security pact is not  useful for the long-term expedience and interests of afghanistan .  and could have a negative impact on regional issues . cnn 's jamie crawford , joe sterling , and reza sayah contributed to this report .", "summary": " hagel visiting troops in afghanistan .   defense secretary gets assurances .   karzai visiting iran on sunday .
