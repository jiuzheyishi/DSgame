' i only stopped flying nine months ago and there are no other planes in the world that could have done what the swordfish planes did that day . ` after take-off we climbed to 6,000 ft to get above the really thick cloud and we knew when we were near because all hell broke loose with bismarck 's fire . we got the order to attack and i went down and saw the enormous bloody ship . i thought the ark royal was big , but this one , blimey . ' i must have been under 2,000 yards when i was about to launch the torpedo at the bow , but as i was about to press the button i heard in my ear  not now , not now  . ' i turned round and saw the navigator leaning right out of the plane with his backside in the air . ` then i realised what he was doing - he was looking at the sea because if i had let the torpedo go and it had hit a wave it could have gone anywhere . i had to put it in a trough . ` then i heard him say  let it go  and i pressed the button . then i heard him say  we 've got a runner  - and i got out of there . ` my navigator was a chap called john  dusty  miller and i 've spent the last 20 years trying to find out what happened to him or where he is . ' mr moffat pulled up before the torpedo hit and did n't see it strike . the following morning he flew to the ship for a second attack but there was no need . he watched as the bismarck , which had been under siege from the royal navy , rolled over . and he saw hundreds of german sailors leaping into the water as she started to sink . only 115 of bismarck 's crew of 2,222 survived . ' i did n't dare look any further , i just got back to the ark royal and i thought :  there but for the grace of god go i  , ' said mr moffat , from dunkeld , scotland . he only found out it was his torpedo that crippled the bismarck when the fleet air arm - the navy 's air force - wrote to him in 2000 . he said : ` it gave me a sort of satisfaction . ' the bismarck was built in august 1940 and was the biggest battleship made by germany . she was named after otto von bismarck , the german chancellor behind the unification of germany in 1871 . despite her fearsome reputation , the bismarck enjoyed just an eight-month career during which time she was involved in one offensive operation , when she destroyed hms hood . out nearly 3,000 shells fired at bismarck by the royal navy , about 400 hit the ship before she finally sunk . the bismarck 's sister ship the tirpitz wreaked havoc among the arctic convoys until she was sunk while at anchor in a norwegian fjord . the bismarck had a maximum weight of 51,000 tons , was 823ft long and had a top speed of 34mph .", "summary": " photo archive unearthed after 71 years .   one image taken from reconnaissance aircraft records moment the enemy battleship was first sighted off greenland .   bismarck had sunk hms hood days earlier , killing 1,415 men .   swordfish bi-planes and crew are seen on standby on deck of aircraft carrier hms victorious .   photos - made into picture postcards - given to carrier crew as souvenirs .
