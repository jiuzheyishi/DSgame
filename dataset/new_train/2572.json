' we are at a place in life where you have a job , but you ca n't afford to buy a health plan . i think this is going to be a really good thing because now it 's going to be really affordable to people .  toward the end of his visit , teklehaimanot 's smartphone still had n't connected with the maryland marketplace . he has n't signed up for a new plan yet , but he does have more information . he has until december 14 to sign up if he wants his family to have coverage starting january 1 . for many , signing up for a new policy may take several conversations or several website visits .  i know there 's some general frustration right now with the online part ,  elliott said .  i 'm confident though we 'll work the kinks out , and regardless , i know they will be happy once they get all the benefits . it can be life-changing .  obamacare open enrollment 101 : what you need to know . if you need assistance signing up for obamacare , contact your state 's insurance department . or visit www.healthcare.gov .", "summary": " $ 67 million allocated to pay for training , certification of obamacare patient navigators .   navigators help people sign up for health insurance by walking them through options .   poll shows 67 % of uninsured under 65 do n't understand how aca could affect them .
