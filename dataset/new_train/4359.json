{"text": "a militant islamist group associated with al qaeda has for the first time threatened to attack israel , far from its normal base of operations in somalia . al-shabab , which is fighting to control the east african country , accused israel of  starting to destroy  the al aqsa mosque , where standoffs have taken place recently between israeli police and palestinians . the mosque is part of the complex that jews call the temple mount and muslims call haram al-sharif .  the jews started to destroy parts of the holy mosque of al aqsa and they routinely kill our palestinian brothers , so we are committed to defend our palestinian brothers ,  said mukhtar robow abu mansur , a prominent al-shabab commander . his threat was part of a series of fiery sermons delivered after friday prayers in baidoa in southwest somalia . al-shabab controls the region , which is part of a country that has been without an effective national government for nearly 20 years . other leaders of the group also threatened israel , the first time the group is known to have done so .  we will transfer and expand our fighting in the middle east so we can defend al aqsa mosque from the israelis ,  al-shabab commander abdifatah aweys abu hamza said in mogadishu , the somali capital . he is apparently the leader of a new al-shabab armed group calling themselves  mujahedin al aqsa ,  or  al aqsa holy warriors ,  which they said is assigned to attack israel . it is not clear whether al-shabab has the capacity to carry out its threats against israel . but rashid abdi of the international crisis group , speaking last week before al-shabab issued its threats against israel , warned that the group should be taken seriously .  we should not underestimate the capacity of al-shabab ,  he said .  this is a deadly organization , a formidable foe .  abdi said the group had been mutating from a nationalist group into a terrorist organization more like al qaeda , which was behind the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the united states .  if you look at the rhetoric and language and if you look at the web sites , if you hear their preachers or their scholars speak , it is completely indistinguishable from al qaeda leaders ,  abdi said . the group has also become more vicious in somalia , a local human rights expert said .  the most gruesome and gross violations of human rights are committed by al-shabab ,  activist hassan shire sheikh said .  they have also instilled fear . they just shoot , they kill , they maim and they lash .  the group also threatened african neighbors on friday , including ethiopia , djibouti , kenya , eritrea , ghana , sudan and uganda . they have in the past threatened african nations that provide peacekeeping troops to the war-torn country . the u.s. state department country reports on terrorism from april lists al-shabab as a terrorist organization and blames it for shootings and suicide bombings inside somalia . it does not list the group as having carried out violence outside somalia , but says some members of the group have trained and fought alongside al qaeda in afghanistan . somalia has been mired in chaos since 1991 , when warlords overthrew dictator mohamed siad barre and sparked brutal clan infighting . the transitional government has struggled to establish authority , challenged by islamist groups like al-shabab that have seized control of mogadishu and much of the south . cnn 's david mckenzie in nairobi , kenya , contributed to this report .", "summary": " al-shabab accuses israel of  starting to destroy  the al aqsa mosque .    we are committed to defend our palestinian brothers ,  al-shabab commander says .   it is not clear whether al-shabab has the capacity to carry out its threats against israel .   somalia has been mired in chaos since 1991 , when warlords overthrew its dictator .
