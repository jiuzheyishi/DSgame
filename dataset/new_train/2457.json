{"text": "there are many strange jobs in hollywood . seat filler at awards show . producer on  cops  who blurs all of the naked bodies . co-star on  anger management .  here 's another : person in charge of the subtitles for tlc 's reality sensation  here comes honey boo boo  -lrb- wednesdays , 9 p.m. -rrb- . imagine trying to decipher everything that comes out of the mouths of seven-year-old beauty pageant contestant alana thompson and the rest of her fast-drawling ,  guess whose breath  - playing family from mcintyre , georgia . we asked sara reddy -- the fearless honey boo boo exec producer who counts this task as one of her responsibilities -- to take us into her strange world of tv transcription . why does the executive producer supervise the subtitles ? does she have a special skill set ? not exactly . reddy was raised in southern california , not the south . but she did develop a special ear for the family 's peculiar enunciations while working on  toddlers & tiaras ,  the show on which alana was discovered .  most people think of southern accents as having this drawl that 's really slow and deliberate , but with this family it 's the opposite ,  says reddy .  they talk incredibly fast and they just skip over consonants and entire syllables . i do n't know if it 's the region they are from or just the family .  and for some reason , she 's the one on staff who can best decode their language .  i do n't know why i have this gift , but i understand them perfectly , and i do n't think they need to be subtitled . it astonishes me when people are like , ` what is she saying ? ' i 'm like , ` you ca n't hear that ? it 's perfectly clear to me ! '  how do the show 's producers decide what to subtitle -lrb- which seems to be pretty much everything -rrb- ?  we have so many subtitles , it 's like we 're making a foreign film in english ,  she declares with some amount of pride . occasionally during the notes process , a network executive will ask for an onscreen translation of a hard-to-decipher line . but here 's the true test :  if the -lsb- family is -rsb- delivering information you need to follow the story line , we subtitle it ,  she explains .  sometimes we subtitle things that we do n't understand and put in the noises . they 're not even words . we take it seriously and make sure we 're phonetically accurate .  reality tv 's most appalling shows -lrb- so far -rrb- . what goes into the subtitling process ? the subtitles require 15 to 20 staff hours of labor per episode , estimates reddy . they are typed in and checked for accuracy ; as many as ten co-workers might weigh in on a difficult line . lip-reading is also key .  sometimes , it will come down to looking at the upper teeth meeting the lower lip and you know it 's an f or a b , and that could be a starting point .  -lrb- another trick is to isolate a family member 's microphone on high-quality speakers during the audio mix session . -rrb- the show 's online editor keeps a collection of post-it notes with spellings of the family 's made-up words , such as  smexy  and  s ` mage .  reddy recalls a particularly healthy discussion over how to spell sugar bear 's nickname shugie .  normally you would n't have to think of that ,  she says .  but when we went to subtitle it , it became this big debate . because s-u-g-e-y looks like  soogie .  it became this thing : ` how do we spell it ? two g 's ? one g ? do we spell it phonetically ? do we spell it with an s and an h ?  is n't it condescending to subtitle people speaking english ? or pumpkin saying  marannaise  instead of  mayonnaise  ? reddy insists that 's not the intention .  they make up so many interesting words and mispronounce things in pretty genius ways , and i do n't want to correct them . especially if it 's a delightful mistake ,  she says .  also , it tests your eye if what you 're reading does n't match what you 're hearing . if we put ` mayonnaise ' as it 's spelled , your brain has a little stutter . we try to put little quirks in the subtitles because that 's part of what makes them so charming . the way they handle the english language is so fascinating . if -lrb- the family members -rrb- were sensitive about it , that would be different . but part of what makes this show magical to me is that this family embraces their flaws . find anyone on the planet who knows how to pronounce everything . to me , it 's relatable .  in addition , she says that viewers may be leaning on the subtitles more than they think .  when people say it 's condescending , it 's because they 're reading the subtitles so they understand everything . if we showed it without subtitles they 'd be complaining they could n't understand enough . so it 's taken for granted . we give them the answers .  which family member is the toughest to translate ? reddy does n't even pause to think before answering . it 's mama bear .  i 'm fluent in june-ese ,  she says .  that 's the hardest dialect . she talks so fast . it 's just this rapid fire of syllables . she does these amazing combinations of words like ` beautimous . ' ` vajiggle jaggle ' is this kind of onomatopoetic word . it 's brilliant . in early edits of the show , ` vajiggle ' was spelled ` vagiggle ' which looked like ` va-giggle . ' we had to change it to a j. i was an english major and i sometimes do n't know if it 's an advantage or a disadvantage .  the 15 worst tv spin-offs . who 's the runner-up ? sugar bear claims that honor .  he has more of a slow drawl -- like most people think of the southern drawl -- but he mumbles so much that you do n't hear a lot of consonants ,  she notes .  it 's an entirely different challenge .  and the easiest ? it 's that voluble little star , alana , a.k.a. honey boo boo  she does n't talk as fast as the older girls and her mom , and she also has this very deliberate delivery that she was just born with , and she sells every line that she says ,  says reddy .  but she 's young still and she 'll probably be talking really fast by the time she 's a teenager and will be just as difficult as the rest of them .  how often is reddy stumped while trying to figure out what june & co. are saying ? only on the rarest of occasions . she recalls a line in a season 1 episode that tormented her :  pumpkin was saying , ` why do we have all this toilet paper ? ' and june turned to pumpkin and said , ` to wipe your ... ' something . i could not understand for the life of me . it sounded like ` tootay ' and i wrote down so many words . i wrote ` tube tape , ' ` toot take . ' i listened to it a thousand times and i finally just put in the subtitle ` tootay . ' i was making up a word as a placeholder . and i actually sent the clip to june and said , ` what are you saying here ? ' and she wrote back , ` yeah , i think i was saying ` tootay . ' and i was like , ` what is that ? ' , and she said ' i do n't know , i just made it up as a word for her butt . ' i had spent hours listening and trying to figure out what combination of words would have those syllables that matched this context , and sure enough it was just some word she 'd made up on the spot . i think that was a pretty big moment of realizing , ` oh , she makes up words . there are going to be times when there is n't an answer . '  did the producers ever tell the family to speak more clearly ? a few feeble and futile attempts were made in the beginning .  and then we realized what makes them so great and so great for tv is just letting them be themselves ,  says reddy .  if they were to become self-conscious about trying to speak differently than they just naturally speak , it would absolutely ruin the magic of the show . it 's the same thing with trying to get them to speak one at a time . it would be a losing battle . it 's so much better to just embrace them for exactly who they are and let them be themselves and subtitle it , so the rest of the world can enjoy them and understand them .  any subtitle spoilers for this season ?  we do have a scene coming up in one of our later episodes that could quite possibly break the world record for the most subtitles ever appearing in a short amount of time ,  teases reddy .  it 'll break the record for the world 's fastest subtitles . there might not be a record that 's ever been established but we 'll break it anyway .  has reddy ever considered subtitling the family 's pet animals ?  we toyed with the idea of giving the chicken , nugget , some thoughts when he clucks ,  says reddy .  we were thinking about subtitling what he thought of the family . but we decided we were taking too many liberties with nugget 's inner world ... . we thought about -lsb- subtitling -rsb- kaitlyn , the baby , and what her thoughts could be . but we want this to be a real world . what makes the show awesome is that it 's so real . it still is my dream to subtitle nugget someday .  and what would nugget say ?  ` save me .
