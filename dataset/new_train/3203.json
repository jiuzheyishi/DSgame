{"text": "george osborne today ordered the massive expansion of controversial shale gas exploration in britain -- known as fracking -- despite fears it could cause earthquakes and contaminate water . to the fury of environmentalists , the chancellor wants to encourage more companies to use the technique , which involves creating explosions deep underground to release valuable gas . mr osborne unveiled his ` generous new tax regime ' in the autumn statement this afternoon to encourage fracking exploration and unlock shale gas reserves that could be worth # 1.5 trillion to britain 's economy . the uk 's only fracking operation in blackpool caused two tremors from its drilling last year and is waiting to hear if it can start again . controversial : drilling in the blackpool area last year caused a small earthquake but the government wants to expand the use of fracking in britain . fracking , or hydraulic fracturing , is the process of injecting liquid . deep underground to fracture shale rock and release gas contained in it . the government is consulting on tax breaks for the unconventional fossil fuel extraction , which has been widely exploited in the us , leading to falling gas prices . but there are also fears that widespread use of shale gas wells will harm the look of the uk countryside , damage tourism and reduce house prices . opposition to fracking is intensifying in britain as the jury is still out on whether the controversial gas extraction process will poison drinking water and cause major environmental damage . in blackpool last year , fracking was found to be the ` highly probable ' cause of earth tremors . one tremor of magnitude 2.3 on the richter scale hit the area on april 1 followed by a second of magnitude 1.4 on may 27 , prompting locals and environmental campaigners to blame the fracking technique being used locally by oil and gas firm cuadrilla . energy companies have said the process is safe but environment groups warn it could pose human health risks . mark miller , chief executive of cuadrilla , has said the process does not pose a threat to uk groundwater . but horror stories have emerged from the us , where fracking is common , including reports of tap water igniting when a match is lit and claims of contaminated water making people ill . such concerns have led to bans or moratoria on fracking in some places . france has banned fracking from shale rock and new york state has introduced a moratorium . environmental groups in the uk have been calling for a moratorium at least until environmental and safety impacts have been addressed . in australia , ground water and soil contamination fears have led farmers and green groups to form an unlikely alliance against fracking . concerns have also been raised that fracking could pose a threat to bath 's world-famous hot springs . bath and north east somerset council said in september that two resource companies have applied for planning permission to test - drill for gas but the council fears that , if allowed to go ahead , it could harm the springs . despite this the chancellor today told mps : ` we must ensure we make the best use of lower cost gas power , including new sources of gas under the land . ` we do n't want british families and businesses to be left behind as gas prices tumble on the other side of the atlantic . ` we are consulting on new tax incentives for shale gas and announcing the creation of a single office so that regulation is safe but simple . ' the chancellor is desperate to boost domestic gas exploration as a way of reducing britain 's dependence on foreign gas supplies . the sharp decline in north sea gas finds makes britain more reliant on energy supplies from qatar , russia and the us . but . environmentalists attacked the move for undermining investment and jobs . which could be created in clean technology , as well as pushing up . energy costs for consumers as the uk would remain tied to increasingly . expensive fossil fuels . the . office for unconventional gas and oil will join up responsibilities . across government departments to provide a single point of contact for . investors and streamline the regulatory process . even if ten per cent of the gas in unpopulated areas is extracted , it would still be worth # 150billion . nick molho , head of energy policy at . wwf-uk , said : ` the uk 's over-reliance on gas is , environmentally and . economically , highly risky . greenpeace . political director joss garman said : ` the chancellor is misleading . people to position shale gas as the answer to uk 's energy woes .
