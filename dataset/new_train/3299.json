{"text": "the winter vomiting bug could be virtually wiped out by reintroducing brass taps and fittings , according to new research . a study has found norovirus can not survive on the metal , offering hope of a cheap and effective way of reducing the 267 million cases of acute gastroenteritis it causes each year . the highly infectious bug costs the national health service at least # 100 million annually , with up to 3,000 people admitted to hospital each year . the winter vomiting bug could be virtually wiped out by reintroducing brass taps and fittings , according to new research . the findings suggest the bug can not survive on the metal . there is no treatment or vaccine , and outbreaks require expensive cleaning , with lost working days when staff are infected adding to the burden . its impact is also felt beyond healthcare , with cruise ships and hotels suffering significant damage to their reputation when epidemics occur among guests . dr sarah warnes , of the university of southampton , said : ` the use of antimicrobial surfaces containing copper in clinical and community environments , such as cruise ships and care facilities , could help to reduce the spread of this highly infectious and costly pathogen . ' the virus can be contracted from contaminated food or water , person to person contact and contact with contaminated surfaces , meaning those made from copper could effectively shut down one avenue of infection . a study designed to simulate fingertip touch of surfaces showed norovirus in room temperature was rapidly destroyed on copper and its alloys , with those containing more than 60 per cent proving particularly effective . the rate of destruction was initially very rapid and proportional to the copper content . no such effect was found on stainless steel . the virus can be contracted from contaminated food or water , person to person contact and contact with contaminated surfaces . copper alloys have previously been shown to be effective antimicrobial surfaces against a range of bacteria and fungi . dr warnes said : ` copper alloys , although they provide a constant killing surface , should always be used in conjunction with regular and efficient cleaning and decontamination regimes using non-chelating reagents that could inhibit the copper ion activity . ' professor bill keevil added : ` although the virus was identified over 40 years ago , the lack of methods to assess infectivity has hampered the study of the human pathogen . ` the virus can remain infectious on solid surfaces and is also resistant to many cleaning solutions . ` that means it can spread to people who touch these surfaces , causing further infections and maintaining the cycle of infection . ` copper surfaces , like door handles and taps , can disrupt the cycle and lower the risk of outbreaks . what we have found is the metal destroys the genetic material of the norovirus . ` in the u.s. , 100,000 people die each year from hospital acquired infections . in the uk , i believe the figure is about 5,000 . if a healthy person gets norovirus they are sick for a couple of days , and then get over it . but for an elderly person , it can be fatal . the figures are frightening . ` if you build a hospital , a care home or a liner from scratch using copper instead of stainless steel , the cost will be about the same . ` brass fittings were used in hospitals forty or fifty years ago , since when we have gone over to stainless steel . during this time hospital acquired infections have soared . is that a coincidence ? ' earlier research has found copper fittings rapidly kill bugs on hospital wards , succeeding where other infection control measures fail . the highly infectious bug costs the national health service at least # 100 million annually , with up to 3,000 people admitted to hospital each year . in a ten week study at selly oak hospital , birmingham , copper taps , toilet seats and push plates on doors all but eliminated common bugs . it is believed the metal ` suffocates ' germs , preventing them breathing . it may also stop them from feeding and destroy their dna . lab tests show that the metal kills off the deadly mrsa and c difficile superbugs . it also kills other dangerous germs , including the flu virus and the e coli food poisoning bug . although it is usually thought to be an expensive metal , copper is actually a similar price to stainless steel .", "summary": " copper destroys the genetic material of norovirus and stops it breathing .   the norovirus is estimated to cost the nhs at least # 100 million per year .   using brass taps and fittings in hospitals , care homes and on cruise ships could prevent outbreaks .
