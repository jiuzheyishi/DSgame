{"text": "desperate for success : policeman george mcnaught falsely issued hundreds of fines to be successful at work . he made a name for himself after wrestling a gun from the hands of a woman who was pointing it at a young boy . and after his spell in the limelight , it appears pcso george mcnaught was determined to keep up the crime-fighting . but the 48-year-old 's desire for success ended in shame yesterday when the blunkett bobby was jailed for six months for issuing hundreds of false fixed penalty notices . mcnaught was the first pcso in london to be awarded the commendation of the high sheriff of london after wrestling a gun from a woman 's hands at victoria station in 2009 . he was given the award by then met police commissioner sir paul stephenson for pinning down the armed suspect after she pointed the weapon at a boy . but the westminster-based pcso was so hungry for success he began inventing bogus penalty notices , usually for cycling on the pavement . mcnaught targeted members of the public after finding their names and addresses on items of lost property . some victims paid the fines -- which started at # 45 and quickly increased to # 320 -- while others spent hours arguing about them in court . one woman who was issued a false notice had bailiffs come to her home chasing # 320 in fines . another ticket was issued to a man who had suffered nerve damage to his arm and could not even ride a bike . although the exact number of false notices issued is unknown , investigating detectives found at least 350 suspect tickets between february 2010 and september last year . mcnaught was caught out after a man fined for cycling on the pavement on the strand complained . when police searched the officer 's home they found a canister of cs gas which had been reported missing from a police locker room . humiliated victims : one woman was falsely fined # 320 by mr mcnaught and was left embarrassed and humiliated . fallon alexis , prosecuting , said : ` one woman was stopped at victoria coach station with friends and had bailiffs come to her house after she was ordered to pay # 320 in fines . ` she had to come to a subsequent court hearing , and in her own words felt embarrassed and humiliated , due to mr mcnaught . ` another man who paid a # 45 fine later told police that he had an accident in 1997 and suffered nerve damage to his left arm and shoulder . he said he could not use a bicycle if he wanted to . ' mcnaught , of paddington , admitted one count of misconduct in a public office and possession of a prohibited weapon . judge john hillen said : ` it 's an abuse of power by someone who is given power and then decides to use that power in a bad way . as a pcso he had a power and used it in a crazy way which is extremely harmful . ` you have a positively good character , for some seven years as a pcso in which i 'm told you loved , and indeed did extremely well in . ` you were serving the public but that trust placed in you , you abused . lost property : mr mcnaught targeted cyclists using personal details found on lost property . ` what motivated you is and remains entirely unclear . there was no financial gain , there was no corruption , there was no acting on behalf of criminals or friends . ` it seems to me , what you chose to do having been given power , was to abuse that power . ` the public have to be confident in the fixed penalty notice system and you undermined that confidence . ` confidence in the pcso community has also been undermined . ' ann-marie talbot , defending , said mcnaught had been sacked as a pcso and had moved back to his native scotland , where he worked as a part-time cleaner . she added : ` it would appear there was no motivation other than a desire to be successful in his job . ` i do n't think he understands himself though what led him to take these actions .
