{"text": "ethiopian prime minister meles zenawi , a strongman in the troubled horn of africa and a key united states ally , has died , his government announced tuesday . meles had not been seen in public in months , sparking intense international speculation about his health . the government revealed neither the cause nor the location of his death monday at the age of 57 . meles came to the forefront as a leader of a guerrilla insurgency against dictator haile mengistu mariam in 1991 and cemented power in the ensuing decades . seen by admirers as a force for stability in a region with islamist insurgencies in somalia and yemen and a history of famine , he was also criticized for cracking down on political opposition and the press .  he came to power at the barrel of a gun , but he made the transition from rebel leader to political leader very quickly ,  said ayo johnson , a writer on africa and director of viewpoint africa . but he never overcame his  mindset as a rebel leader ,  and his democratic credentials were  poor ,  johnson said .  the west turned a blind eye to many aspects of his game that were not up to scratch ,  he added . that 's partly because of his action against islamist movements in the region , including an invasion of somalia in 1998 , johnson said .  he supported everything that the united states wanted to do against terror ,  he explained , such as give american drones based in the region permission to use ethiopian airspace on their way to targets in somalia . and  he was able to address the fundamentals -- health care , education , reducing the poverty rate ,  johnson said . u.s. president barack obama praised meles '  unyielding commitment to ethiopia 's poor  in a statement tuesday , citing his  personal admiration for -lrb- meles ' -rrb- desire to lift millions of ethiopians out of poverty through his drive for food security .  but in june , u.s. sen. patrick leahy , a vermont democrat , highlighted a different aspect of meles ' rule -- the case of journalist eskinder nega , who was then before a court in addis ababa . while praising the prime minister 's work in  containing the real threat of terrorism in the region and making gains against the region 's recurring famines ,  leahy accused him of  trying to silence those who do not toe the official line .  his ethiopian people 's revolutionary democratic front took all but one seat in parliament in elections in 2010 , africa expert jason mosley pointed out in the wake of meles ' death .  nearly 200 people were reportedly killed , and tens of thousands detained  in the previous elections in 2005 , said mosley , who is with the chatham house think tank in london . last year , ethiopia found two swedish journalists guilty of supporting terrorism and sentenced them to 11 years in prison . meles died at 11:40 p.m. monday from an unspecified infection , spokesman bereket simon said . deputy prime minister hailemariam desalegn is now in charge . there will be no elections before the next scheduled ballot in 2015 , bereket said . meles had been scheduled to step down in 2013 as part of a transition process , mosley said , but questioned whether he genuinely intended to relinquish power . meles was out of the country when he died and members of his family were with him , according to bereket . he did not say what country meles ' body was in or when it would return to ethiopia , except that it would be soon . the spokesman acknowledged the prime minister had been sick for some time but did n't immediately seek treatment . the news came almost a week after the government said meles was  recovering well  after treatment for an unspecified illness . bloggers launched a counter of the number of days he 's been missing , while citizens took to social media to discuss his whereabouts and exchange conspiracy theories . the secretive nation had released little information about his whereabouts , prompting rumors and opposition claims that he was dead or facing a life-threatening illness . the government held a news conference last month and announced meles received treatment for an unspecified illness . his absence was more evident last month when ethiopia hosted an african union summit in its capital of addis ababa . meles , a key player in talks on the tensions between sudan and its rival neighbor south sudan , did not attend . former u.n. secretary-general kofi annan said ethiopia under meles had  played a key role in both the region and the african continent .   i hope that his successor will continue to be a driving force on a wide range of issues , from brokering peace negotiations to shaping development relationships ,  annan said . ethiopia , a key western ally often lauded for effective use of aid money , is surrounded by unstable nations such as somalia and sudan . meles has been credited with working toward peace and security in the region , and the ethiopian army sent peacekeepers to battle the islamic extremist group al-shabaab in somalia . people we 've lost in 2012 : the lives they lived .", "summary": " obama praises meles zenawi 's  unyielding commitment to ethiopia 's poor    he supported  everything
