{"text": "a # 1.5 billion rescue plan for the co-operative bank will slash the income of thousands of pensioners , it emerged yesterday . the 169-year-old bank will be floated on the stock market to plug a giant hole in its balance sheet . it hopes to raise # 1billion in a mix of shares and bonds , plus a further # 500million by selling its general insurance arm . not co-operating : the co-operative bank 's plan to tackle their # 1.5 billion losses may see thousands of britons lose out on their life savings . but the co-op group , which has 4.7 million customers and whose interests run from funerals to pet insurance , wants savers who own its bonds to help foot the bill . up to 7,000 who handed over a chunk of their life savings will lose out . as part of its grand plan , the co-op will no longer pay income to its bondholders , most of whom are retired . some were being paid as much as 13 per cent in annual interest -- or # 1,300 for a # 10,000 investment . instead , in exchange for their bonds , . investors will be offered either a cash payoff , shares in the new bank , . or new bonds . but they face losing 35p for each # 1 of co-op bonds they . hold . future : chief executive euan sutherland is hoping for financial success when co-op bank goes on the stock market . the price of many bonds has halved over the past couple of months , leaving thousands out of pocket . bonds worth # 60million are held by individual investors , paying annual interest of 5.5 to 13 per cent . these bonds are a type of investment , and not to be confused with the fixed-rate savings-account bonds offered in branches . known as retail bonds , they are simply an iou written to investors to raise funds for business growth . in return for money , the lender pays savers interest . patrick connolly , of financial adviser chase de vere , said : ` many people will have considered these co-op bonds to be safe , but this highlights just how much of a huge risk there can be when investing . i fear there will be more pain as they 'll be forced to accept further losses as part of the rescue plans . ' the bailout follows months of setbacks for the co-op . in march , it revealed a # 600million loss as a result of having to pay compensation for the mis-sale of payment protection insurance , and losses on bad loans . the following month , it pulled out of a bid for 632 lloyds branches . then in may , a downgrade from the ratings agency moody 's saw the bank 's debt being given ` junk ' status . the mail also revealed it had put a halt to new lending to small firms . analysis by alex brummer , city editor . the implosion at the co-operative bank that will wipe out the savings of thousands of smaller investors and trusts is the result of hubris and mismanagement on a mammoth scale . instead of the ultimate owners of the bank -- the wealthy co-operative movement -- digging into its own coffers , it is the bondholders who are being asked to carry the can . it is the closest britain has come to a cyprus-style rescue in which ordinary investors are made to pay for errors of management and government . the crisis at the so-called ethical bank is the result of political interference in decision-making and inadequate banking disciplines . this has left a # 1.5 billion black hole in the bank 's balance sheet , placed the whole co-operative movement at risk and created huge uncertainty for the bank 's 4.7 million customers . successive governments have contributed to the crisis . it was gordon brown 's administration that sought to back a new ` super-mutual ' bank as a challenger on the high street . the labour party 's favourite bank , the co-operative , was chosen as its preferred vehicle and the government backed a 2009 merger with the much larger britannia building society . trust gone : the implosion at the co-operative bank is the result of ` hubris and mismanagement on a mammoth scale ' dozens of labour mps , including shadow chancellor ed balls , are sponsored by the co-op movement . the britannia deal turned out to be a disaster . large numbers of mortgages on the britannia 's books were rotten and the society had become embroiled in commercial property deals that went wrong in the recession . much of this was hidden from public view until george osborne gave the nod to the co-operative bank bid for 632 lloyds branches . the former financial services authority should have stepped in and made it clear that the co-op lacked the management and balance sheet resources to enter the big league . not surprisingly the deal fell apart when the co-op revealed heavy property losses and acknowledged it lacked the systems to manage the bank . it was then that credit ratings agency moody 's downgraded the bank 's debt to ` junk ' status . that meant traditional customers , such as local authorities and non-governmental organisations , could no longer safely hold deposits with the bank . under the complex rescue package just unveiled by the co-op after extensive talks with the bank of england 's prudential regulatory authority watchdog , it is bondholders rather than the co-op movement who will bear most of the pain . that has left investors in the bonds angry , disappointed and disillusioned with both the co-op and the government that allowed this series of catastrophic errors to happen .", "summary": " plan to float the co-operative bank on stock market will hit customers .   bank needs to raise # 1.5 billion to combat annual losses .   up to 7,000 are set to lose out on their savings to save the bank .
