{"text": "the body that monitors mps ' pay and perks -- of breaching the data protection act by passing information to sir george . the mp , who has defied the whips to call for a cut in the eu budget and vote against gay marriage but asked not to be identified , told the mail on sunday : ` sir george warned me that i should play ball with ipsa , or risk personal financial details being made public . i feel that amounted to blackmail . ` i wrote to sir ian kennedy , the chairman of ipsa , to complain , and received a letter back which told me that ,  mps should not be surprised that ipsa has dealings with chief whips  . allegations : the claims have been made by tory rebels who say it is part of a campaign of intimidation to stop them speaking out against mr cameron Â¿ s policies on europe and gay marriage . ` that is why i have complained to the commissioner . ipsa should not be passing information to third parties . ' relations between mps and ipsa have become increasingly acrimonious since it introduced a rule that requires them to hand back a share of the profit on the rising value of taxpayer-funded second homes . it has left some mps facing demands for more than # 50,000 . the row has broken out amid claims that sir george has found out which rebels owe money to ipsa and then used the information to ` intimidate ' them -- an allegation that is strongly denied . another mp claimed he was told by sir george that he should settle a disputed expenses claim if ` he wanted to be an mp at the next election ' . a third mp said : ` sir george is trying to find a new way to victimise and bully the rebels , threatening to take their whip away or  tell the boss  if they do n't cough up to ipsa . ' a source close to sir george said : ` it is complete paranoid nonsense to suggest that the chief whip has in any way used mps ' expenses difficulties as a way of enforcing discipline . it 's just not his style . ` it is perfectly normal for the chief whip to discuss an mp 's expenses with them if there is an issue . ` the information about the expenses of the mp who has complained was not confidential . ' last night , an ipsa spokesman said it was ` perfectly reasonable ' for the body to ` raise concerns ' about mps with chief whips . ` where mps claimed for a subsidy from the taxpayer for their mortgage , we ask for the taxpayer 's share of any increase in the value of the property , ' he said . ` if an mp refused to comply with that rule , we would challenge that , and it is reasonable that we raise our concerns .
