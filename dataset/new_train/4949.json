{"text": "thomas perez has climbed america 's  ladder of opportunity  and now can help others do the same , president barack obama said on monday in nominating the assistant u.s. attorney general as labor secretary . the son of dominican immigrants who worked different jobs such as collecting garbage to help pay for college , perez has dedicated himself to fulfilling the promise of equal opportunity for all , obama told a white house ceremony to introduce perez , 51 . cnn 's jessica yellin reported earlier this month that obama would name perez to the cabinet position . if confirmed by the senate , the lone hispanic cabinet selection of obama 's second term so far would succeed hilda solis , who resigned in january . in brief remarks , perez thanked obama in both english and spanish for what he called the honor of the opportunity . he pledged to work with  our partners  in organized labor , the business community , grassroots organizations and congress , adding that he looked forward to meeting with senators from both parties to discuss the way forward .  true progress is possible if you keep and open mind , listen to all sides and focus on results ,  perez said . obama urged that perez be confirmed  as quickly as possible .  perez 's nomination comes as the economy continues a sluggish recovery from recession , with unemployment hovering near 8 % . the labor department , among other things , oversees analysis and reporting of unemployment statistics as well as occupational safety and other wage and employment issues . while some indicators show improvement , economists warn some fragility remains and political leaders are divided on policy prescriptions for stronger growth . obama and democrats call for a combination of stimulus spending , budget cuts and reforms to the tax system and entitlement programs to reduce chronic federal deficits and debt while maintaining government support for education , research and other areas they consider vital to economic development . republicans seeking to shrink government say that reducing its cost is the fastest and best way to prompt growth by reducing regulations and lowering taxes . they call for spending cuts and entitlement reforms , as well as changes to the tax system that would reduce rates without increasing revenue . in nominating perez , obama called on him to continue efforts by solis and her team on helping returning war veterans get jobs , improving worker safety in coal mines and other steps to strengthen workers ' rights .  like so many americans , tom knows what it is like to climb the ladder of opportunity ,  obama said , adding that perez made protecting the promise of equal opportunity for all  a cause of his life .  the labor department would likely play a role in new employment programs under any comprehensive immigration reform . perez 's nomination pleased unions and workers ' rights groups , but rankled senate conservatives due in part to his record at the justice department .  this is an unfortunate and needlessly divisive nomination . the top priority of the secretary of labor should be to create jobs and higher wages for american workers . but mr. perez has aggressively sought ways to allow the hiring of more illegal workers ,  said sen. jeff sessions , an alabama republican and a senior member of the judiciary committee .  mr. perez has also had a controversial tenure at the department of justice where he has demonstrated a fundamentally political approach to the law .  perez , who has overseen the agency 's civil rights division , has been active in several high-profile cases in recent years . in 2010 , he launched a probe into the law enforcement tactics of maricopa county , arizona , sheriff joe arpaio after the lawman 's hard line anti-immigration policies led to accusations of civil rights violations . the justice department determined that arpaio had engaged in  pattern or practice of wide-ranging discrimination against latinos and retaliatory actions against individuals who criticized  his department 's activities . arpaio condemned the investigation as politically motivated and a  witch hunt  provoked by the obama administration 's disfavor of the state 's controversial immigration law . perez also became involved in a controversial 2008 voting rights case after it drew attention from republican legislators and became the target of a justice department inspector general 's report . the watchdog concluded that that doj 's voting rights section lacked professionalism and pointed out pervasive warring between employees who disagreed politically . the case stemmed from a complaint against members of the new black panther party who stood outside a polling station in philadelphia on election day dressed in boots and berets and carrying a nightstick . civil charges for attempted voter intimidation were sought by the bush administration , but later dropped against three of four defendants after obama took office . republicans accused the doj 's political leadership of interfering in the decision . though perez had not yet been confirmed to oversee the civil rights division when the decision was made , he said in testimony to inspector general michael horowitz in may 2010 that politics played no part in the decision . horowitz was not satisfied with perez 's account of the situation , saying in his report that perez should have tried to get more information before testifying . perez was not accused of any wrongdoing , but he has been criticized for not doing enough to improve what the inspector general described as a dysfunctional department . before rising to the justice department position , perez led maryland 's department of labor , licensing and regulation . that office is charged with  safeguarding workers , protecting consumers , providing a safety net and cultivating a thriving workforce ,  according to its website . he also spent 12 years as an attorney in the justice department 's civil rights division , rising to become deputy assistant attorney general in the 1990s . perez also worked for the late sen. edward kennedy , a massachusetts democrat , and spent the final two years of the clinton administration as head of the health and human services department 's civil rights office .", "summary": " perez thanks president obama in both
