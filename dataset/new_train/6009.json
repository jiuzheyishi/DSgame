{"text": "follow @@ neilashton _ . in the search for success , tottenham are by no means unique . since joe lewis appointed his godson daniel levy as chairman in 2001 , seven permanent managers have passed through white hart lane with an eighth now confirmed . in that time they have tired of george graham -lrb- appointed pre-levy -rrb- , glenn hoddle , jacques santini , martin jol , juande ramos , harry redknapp , andre villas-boas and tim sherwood . earning his spurs : mauricio pochettino -lrb- centre -rrb- has signed a five-year deal to become the new tottenham boss . atletico madrid , la liga champions and beaten champions league finalists , are on to their 12th manager since the levy regime began . since real madrid 's ninth european cup success , in 2002 at hampden park , another nine hugely respected coaches tried and failed to win the 10th . carlo ancelotti , tottenham 's principal target to replace sherwood , finally landed no 10 . barcelona , who have won six la liga titles and three european cups since lewis bought into spurs , have fired seven managers since levy arrived . inter milan are on their 12th ; bayern munich are on to their ninth with pep guardiola . stuff happens . the problem for tottenham is that no-one can quite work out what it is that they are trying to do . levy has gone down every conceivable route and yet the manager is never safe , never secure . it never feels like they have total boardroom support . anyone who has ever received a payslip at tottenham will tell you that this is the most political club in the premier league . every member of staff is jostling for position or the ear of levy as they grind their way through the season . now that mauricio pochettino has become the manager on a five-year deal , the ambitions of this great club requires clarification . we know that fourth-placed finishes are not good enough because harry redknapp was fired in may 2012 . you could make a case that they have never recovered . they have the sixth highest wage bill in the barclays premier league behind manchester city , chelsea , manchester united , arsenal and liverpool . last season , under the very different approaches of villas-boas and sherwood , they still finished sixth , five points ahead of the deposed champions manchester united . sixth is about right . although they have some history on their side , they are only the 10th-best supported team in the barclays premier league . you have been warned : tim sherwood -lrb- left -rrb- and andre villas-boas have both been dismissed by tottenham chairman daniel levy -lrb- below right -rrb- in the past year . glenn hoddle -lrb- 2001-2004 -rrb- . jacques santini -lrb- 2004 -rrb- . martin jol -lrb- 2004-2007 -rrb- . juande ramos -lrb- 2007-2008 -rrb- . harry redknapp -lrb- 2008-2012 -rrb- . andre villas-boas -lrb- 2012-2013 -rrb- . tim sherwood -lrb- 2013-14 -rrb- . mauricio pochettino -lrb- 2014 - -rrb- . * permanent managers appointed by levy only - he sacked george graham in 2001 . tottenham are a big club , just not as big as united and arsenal , and certainly no bigger than newcastle , city , liverpool , chelsea , sunderland , everton and aston villa . all of them had bigger average attendances than spurs in the barclays premier league . it feels like they are searching for something that does n't really exist . history tells us that , but no-one can be sure what levy wants for this club . they have tried various approaches over the years and will try again with another foreign coach . pochettino just happens to be the latest . this is not an easy job to take , particularly with tottenham 's record for losing patience with their managers . graham was sacked and replaced with the . populist appointment of hoddle before the fa cup semi-final with arsenal . in april 2001 . he was sacked in september 2003 . populist appointment : but spurs hero glenn hoddle 's reign only lasted two years . ruthless streak : jacques santini -lrb- left -rrb- lasted a few months and martin jol -lrb- right -rrb- was sacked during a match . when jol was manager , levy delivered a spanking new porsche 911 to his house when all was well at white hart lane . jol later discovered he was being sacked during a uefa cup tie at white hart lane against getafe in 2007 . ramos , described as ` a proper manager ' by jonathan woodgate when the defender arrived from middlesbrough , lasted less than a year . the spanish coach was the last man to win silverware at spurs - the carling cup against chelsea at wembley in 2008 - but that was n't enough . after a poor start the following season he , too , was gone . similarly , . villas-boas was fired when he lost the players . he promised that the . 6-0 defeat against manchester city was a one-off and yet they were . beaten 5-0 by liverpool at white hart lane a few weeks later . juande you 're a hero , the next you 're gone : juande ramos won the carling cup in 2008 but was fired months later . the fourth is not with you : harry redknapp guided tottenham into the champions league for the first time but left the club after he failed to repeat the trick . tottenham hope pochettino will be able to unite a dressing room that was splintered under the leadership of villas-boas and sherwood last season . that is the hope , that the argentinian coach and his methods will be able to galvanise a group of talented players by the time the season starts on august 16 . if it does n't , then pochettino will simply become another name who tried and failed at tottenham .", "summary": " glenn hoddle , jacques santini , martin jol , juande ramos , harry redknapp , andre villas-boas and tim sherwood are levy 's others .   levy also got rid of george graham .   jol was given a porsche in good times but was sacked during a match .   pochettino has signed a five-year deal at white hart lane .   tottenham are the most political club in the country .   spurs have the sixth-highest wage bill in the premier league .   they have the 10th biggest support in the top flight .
