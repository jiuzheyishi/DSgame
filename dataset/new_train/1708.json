{"text": "a medieval book that once belonged to king henry viii will go on public display for the first time today . the lavishly illustrated aberdeen bestiary , created in england around 1200 and first documented in the royal library at westminster palace in 1542 , is part of a new exhibition at aberdeen university . bestiaries were illustrated books of animals , some real and some mythological , used to provide christian moral messages . detailed : the lavishly illustrated medieval book used animals , both mythological and real , as religious symbols to convey moral messages . the bestiary , which has been in the possession of aberdeen university for almost four centuries , includes animals such as deer and the panther -lrb- centre -rrb- . experts are still unsure whether the bestiary was commissioned for a royal client or seized during king henry viii 's reign from a dissolved monastic library . as well as lions , tigers and apes , the bestiary references a number of mythological animals : . bonnacon mythical animal from asia , that has curled horns and emits burning dung . the legend may be based on a type of bison in reality . monoceros single-horned animal such as a unicorn . crocotta mythical dog-wolf of india or ethiopia . parandrus ox-sized , long-haired , animals with antlers and cloven hooves , that could change their shape at will . yale beast from european mythology , often goat-like four-legged creature with large horns that it can swivel in any direction . satyr creature from greek mythology that were half man , half goat . they were popular in the 12th and 13th centuries but few were as lavishly produced as the aberdeen manuscript , which has been in the care of the university for almost four centuries . it is unclear whether the bestiary was commissioned for a royal client or seized during king henry 's reign from a dissolved monastic library . siobhan convery , head of special collections at the university , said : ` the aberdeen bestiary is a remarkable resource which offers a fascinating insight into the mediaeval mindset . ` we will be turning the pages of the original bestiary each week so we hope people will return time and time again to discover something new . ' professor jane geddes , academic advisor to the exhibition , said : ` the bestiary is like a medieval encyclopaedia and was written to appeal to the general public and to teach children how to read . the bestiary has been described as a ` medieval encyclopaedia ' and a ` remarkable resource ' insight : although bestiaries were widely produced , none were so lavishly illustrated as the aberdeen edition . the aberdeen bestiary includes sections on birds , including the mythical phoenix -lrb- pictured -rrb- . ` it was specifically designed to draw . you in and that appeal has stood the test of time . it is not about . nature but about moral messages and there is a story behind each . beautiful illustration . ` the aberdeen bestiary is one of the most lavish ever produced but it was never fully completed and so the edges of the pages were not finished and tidied up . ` this means that the tiny notes from those who created it still remain in the margins , revealing more to us about the method of production than most other surviving medieval books . ' the aberdeen bestiary is also extremely rare in having a ` twin ' , as it is widely believed to have been created by the same monks , in the same monastic scriptorium , as the ashmole bestiary , held at the bodleian library in oxford . professor geddes said : ` by comparing the two , we can access an unparalleled amount of information about how the scribes and artists actually worked . ' the bestiary first came to aberdeen in 1625 when it was bequeathed to the university 's marischal college by thomas reid , a former regent of the college and the founder of the first public reference library in scotland . reid , who served as latin secretary to king james vi , is said to have been given the book by his friend patrick young , son of the royal librarian to the king . the gilded beasts exhibition will be open until august 18 . on display : the book is bale to be viewed for the the first time at the university of aberdeen . ancient : the book 's pages are so precious it can only be exposed to minimal amounts light for short periods of time .", "summary": " ` aberdeen bestiary ' provided christian moral messages through illustrations of real and mythical animals .   ancient book has been in possession of university of aberdeen for four centuries .
