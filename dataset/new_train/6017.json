' i was in plane no. 5 that went over to knock out coastal batteries that were trained onto the beach . our plane was hit by some of that german 20 millimeter flak . ` we had to bail out as soon as we got into french territory . ' once on the ground , he said , ' a group of us got together , nine to be exact ' . as they headed toward their target , ` we were hampered , i 'll say , by some german machine-gun nests ' . this 1940s era photo provided by beth j. harpaz shows her father david jackendoff , in army uniform , posing with his parents , harry and bella , in new york . jackendoff parachuted into normandy with the 101st airborne on d-day . monumental : on d-day , june 6 , 1944 , a landing craft just vacated by invasion troops points towards a fortified beach on the normandy coast . american soldiers wade to shore fighting heavy machine gun fire from the germans . with four men on one side of him and four on the other , ' i told them to crawl up as close as we could ' . ` and when i whistled , everybody was to throw a grenade , ' he recalled in 1984 on wnbc-tv . ` when we got there , all we saw was a lot of wrecks and dead germans . ' he won a bronze star for leading the charge that silenced the nest , without regard to his personal safety . but his account 40 years later hinted at the fear and regret . ` you did n't know what was around you , ' he said . ` you did n't know where you were . you did n't know if the fellow next to you was friend or enemy , all in blackface . ' he got back to his command post four days later , but not everyone made it . ' a mortar shell landed amongst four of the fellows including our top sergeant and killed them all , ' he said . ` as you go along , you pass bodies , and you just have to keep going . ' dad fought with the 101st for 37 straight days in france . in september 1944 , he went to holland , to operation market garden , a battle depicted in the movie ' a bridge too far ' . in december , they dug in for the siege of bastogne , belgium , part of the battle of the bulge . he earned a second bronze star , two presidential citations and a purple heart . though he died in 1993 , wartime radio interviews and a tv interview conducted by david jackendoff on d-day preserved his stories . his 1945 interview with wor was done at halloran general hospital , an army hospital on staten island , new york , as he recuperated from a bullet wound that crippled his right arm . looking back , he seems to me like a character straight out of a black-and-white world war ii movie . he smoked like a chimney , drank like a fish and lived every day like it was his last -- which is one way to prepare yourself to jump from a plane into a war zone . for the rest of his life , his war buddies were his best friends ; nobody else could understand what they 'd been through . and he loved calvados , the french apple brandy he first tasted in normandy . listening to the recordings now , i 'm struck by his nonchalance . as he described encountering machine-gun fire , he said , ` that held us up for a while ' . commando troops coming ashore from landing craft during the normandy landings in france in june 1944 . when the interviewer asked , ` one vital question : did you get them ? ' he answered simply , ` yes , sir ' . and there was this memorable aside : ' i love hand grenades . ' i have a 16-year-old son now , about the age i was when i did n't want to hear my father 's stories . my dad died before this boy was born , and as we listened together to his grandpa 's voice , i could see the look of amazement on his face . ` your dad was cool , ' he finally said . yeah , he was .", "summary": " world war ii soldier david jackendoff jumped into normandy on d-day with the 101st airborne division .   his daughter , beth j. harpaz , said her father would ` relive ' his battle days each night at the dinner table but she did not pay attention .   jackendoff died in 1993 .   harpaz recently digitized as a swathe of wartime interviews her father conducted .   she said that listening to them was like hearing the stories for the first time .   this year marks the 70th anniversary of d-day , which remains one of the world 's most gut-wrenching and consequential battles .
