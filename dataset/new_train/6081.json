{"text": "follow @@ foychris . george north goes into the most important club game of his career this afternoon hoping that he can find his cape and be ready to fly on another grand occasion . the wales wing arrived at northampton last summer with a reluctant superhero 's aura , acquired on the strength of his stirring deeds for the lions in australia . in his first season for the saints , the 22-year-old has moved heaven and earth to live up to his reputation and while his club are delighted with his endeavours , he has found it hard to fulfil his billing on a weekly basis . d-day : northampton 's george north prepares to take on saracens in the aviva premiership final on saturday . superman : george north will be relied upon when northampton face saracens in the aviva premiership final . great expectations : george north earned his reputation for his heroics on lions tour of south africa . ` coming here , it 's like superman -- my kryptonite is the fact that i ca n't get myself going every time , ' he said ahead of saturday 's aviva premiership final against saracens at twickenham . ` the season is so long and it 's been tough just trying to stay in one piece . ` off the back of the lions , i have come with a bit of expectation on my head . i sometimes feel like i have n't done as much as i was hoping and i 've been marked out of some games . ` i 'm my own worst critic but at the same time it 's not been too bad considering it 's been after a lions tour , it 's such a long season and i 've moved to a new place . i 've got to give myself a bit of leeway . ' north may self-analyse with a harsh eye but he is a fundamentally positive character so critical reflection soon gives way to satisfaction about his move from llanelli to the east midlands . last week , northampton won the amlin challenge cup and now they are one win away from the league title , so their high-profile signing has enjoyed being part of a team success even sooner than he had dared to imagine . the environment he has found himself in is similar to the one he left behind in wales . ` rugby is king here , ' he said . ` rugby is god . it 's quite like wales because everyone gets involved but it 's a bigger goldfish bowl . it 's more of a pond ! everyone has been super-kind . walking round the supermarket , i 'll be choosing my bananas and people will come up and say  good luck on saturday , we 'll be there  . ' food and drink references occur frequently as north considers his existence in english rugby . asked if he has now come to terms with public attention at such a young age , he added : ` it 's chips and rice -- half and half . i 'm more aware of it now since coming back from the lions tour . silverware : george north -lrb- holding trophy -rrb- celebrates wining the amblin challenge cup with northampton . ` it 's part of the job but i sometimes find it difficult dealing with that -- the other half of rugby . i still find it strange when people want to hear my opinion because i just think i talk rubbish most of the time -- i have n't got too much wisdom ! ' he came into the premiership with a notion of what the game would be like . as a welshman with an outsider 's perspective of english rugby , north expected an endless routine of arm-wrestle contests and limited openings out wide . since then he has changed his mind -- to an extent . ` i would say it is 75 per cent the same as i thought it would be , ' he said . ` it is very physical . they love to maul it . they love a forwards game . but i 'm quite lucky that at northampton we do play quite an open game . that helps me . other clubs like bath , sarries , quins also play some beautiful rugby . ` it is not just stick-it-up-the-jumper rugby all the time so my perception was wrong in a way . you 've got what i call the boring bits -- scrums , lineouts and mauling . you need that sometimes , especially if you have a dominant pack . but you also need the va-va-voom ! ' entert the dragon : northampton takes rugby as seriously as in his homeland wales , says george north . that 's where north comes in . he has provided vivid flashes of that game-breaking quality , such as when he carved gloucester open at kingsholm early in the campaign , to set up the try of the season for jamie elliott . he has savoured a handful of games when he has gone through his full repertoire but also the major team landmarks such as beating leicester in the semi-final at a fervent franklin 's gardens . ` that whole experience will stay with me forever , ' he said . ` it was awesome . it was epic . ' along the way , there have been times when the cape has slipped off his weary shoulders -- when the kryptonite of weekly demand has dragged him down . ` now and again i 've thought ,  i could do with a week off  , ' he said . ` this season has been really hard but i 've really enjoyed it , too . ` i am looking forward to some time off . i love my job but it is good to get away from it occasionally . i worked out the other day that by the time this season is over i 'll have been going for two years and a couple of months without a substantial break , so this summer will be great . ` people keep asking me if i 'm going away but i 'm not . the only thing i 've booked is to go to glasgow to see becky -lrb- girlfriend cyclist becky james -rrb- racing in the commonwealth games . apart from that it will just be nice to go home , sit down and have a cup of tea with my mum , go for a ride on my bike and play a bit of golf . i need the break , mentally more than anything . ' long season : george north admits there are times when he has wanted to take a week off . before that welcome respite north has three more monumental occasions ahead of him . he expects a titanic tussle with saracens and does n't dare hope that their heineken cup final defeat against toulon last week will have broken their spirit . ` saracens will be wounded but they will dust themselves off and go again , ' he said . ` they have been the dominant team in the premiership this season and they 've got a great chance to win silverware this weekend , but so do we . ' when the domestic duties are over he will join wales for two tests in south africa . it looms as a gruelling assignment for a side missing the likes of captain sam warburton and leigh halfpenny , but north believes the tourists have enough quality in their ranks to mount a compelling challenge . ` there was talk they were going to rest some boys but you ca n't go to south africa with semi-skimmed milk , ' he said , in metaphor mode again . ` we have to throw everything at them . people wo n't expect much of us but no-one expected much of us going to the last world cup and we came out strong . we 've still got a hell of a squad . we 're taking as much firepower as possible .
