{"text": "norman headworth , 92 , who died the day after falling down steps on a family day out after having to wait 90 minutes for an ambulance . an elderly raf veteran who suffered a serious head injury in a bad fall died after having to wait 90 minutes on a concrete step for an ambulance . norman headworth , 92 , died at colchester general hospital four days after he tumbled down steps while on a day out to the seaside with his family . mr headworth , a former wellington bomber air gunner from long melford near sudbury in suffolk , suffered a fractured wrist and a major bleed on the brain as a result of the fall . he had enjoyed a cup of tea at a seafront pub in walton-on-the-naze , essex , and fell as he walked a few yards to meet his daughter moira cruickshank , who was waiting for him in her car . but then he had to wait for an hour-and-a-half before the emergency services arrived . now his family say he ` deserved much better ' - with his son-in-law , retired cardiologist john cruickshank , saying he believed the ambulance took so long because of mr headworth 's age . ` waiting for the ambulance seemed to go on forever , ' mr cruickshank said as he recounted the incident , which happened in may . ` we made at least three calls and i had to answer the same questions every time . norman had broken his wrist and banged his head - it was a severe injury . ' i am a medic but you do n't have to be a doctor to know that the quicker you get to a head injury the better the chances of survival . ` had the ambulance got there in the usual 20 minutes , the chances of his survival would have been better . ' an inquest into mr headworth 's death was held in bury st edmunds , suffolk last month , but full details of the ambulance delay have only now emerged . mrs cruickshank said she agreed with the hearing 's accidental death verdict - but she stressed her father may have survived if he 'd been treated as a priority case . ` at 92 he had been through the last war , ' she added . ` he lived with us in a self contained flat , was no burden on the state whatsoever and was in good health . ` it 's so sad because he just missed out on all the d-day 70th anniversary commemorations , which he was really looking forward to . mr headworth , pictured in his raf uniform , left , was a second world war veteran and his daughter moira , right , says that he deserved better . ` he wanted to make 100 and probably would have done so . he deserved much better . ' east of england ambulance service -lrb- eeast -rrb- carried out a full investigation into the incident . chief executive anthony marsh gave his ` sincere apologies ' for the long wait in a personal letter to the cruickshanks after the probe . mr marsh told the couple : ' i am able to state that between the time of 14.49 and 15.44 hours , all other emergency ambulances were either not available to respond for various reasons , or assigned to other emergency incidents which were coded higher and immediately life threatening or out of service for a variety of reasons . ' he insisted that the patient 's age does not affect the coding of a 999 call or level of response provided . mr headworth died the day after the fall at colchester general hospital after suffering a broken wrist and a bleed on the brain . last night , gary baines , eeast senior locality manager for north essex , said : ` we have been in contact with mr headworth 's family about what happened and the operational demand we faced on the day of his accident . ` we prioritise all 999 calls according to those patients in most serious need , but clearly want to reach and treat every patient as quickly as is possible . ` as we work hard to put more ambulances on the road with more new staff recruited in essex , this will improve our response times . ' mrs cruickshank said that her father volunteered to join the raf in november 1940 when he was just 18 - even though his worried mother wanted him to wait to be called up . he was accepted for aircrew training and sent to squire 's gate blackpool , the leading training site in the uk for air gunners . the 92-year-old volunteered to join the raf in november 1940 and went on to fly in wellington bombers , pictured , based in north africa . mr headworth went on to fly in wellington bombers based in north africa and took part in the campaign to capture italy from the germans in 1943 to 1944 . during his time in africa , the veteran recalled being ` strafed ' by german fighter planes , just making it to a slit trench in time , head first onto other occupants . he also recalled flying into a hail of flak and tracer bullets in a famous raid on benito mussolini 's italian navy over the bay of taranto . he then went on to be stationed at raf knockholt in kent which housed the ivy farm communications centre where german radio messages had been intercepted , transcribed and forwarded to bletchley park for decoding . there he met his wife beryl weston , who he married on june 11 , 1945 , just 35 days after the german surrender , and went on to set up his own successful driving school in the late 1950s .", "summary": " norman headworth suffered a bad fall while on family day out to seaside .   tumbled down steps suffering a fractured wrist and a bleed on the brain .   an ambulance was called but took 90 minutes to reach the raf veteran .   he died four days later after being taken to colchester general hospital .   his son-in-law , a retired cardiologist , says he was neglected due to his age .   east of england ambulance service has now apologised to his family .
