{"text": "san pancrazio , italy helen and armando rendón recently visited tuscany , italy , for the first time . residents of northern california , the couple took part in the june 29 candlelight procession honoring massacre victims at san pancrazio . rendón , an author , teacher and civil rights lawyer , describes how the experience allowed him a rare glimpse inside the  real tuscany ,  not the storybook one depicted in the movies . a former schoolteacher , helen was reminded of the injustices she witnessed in her native baghdad during world war ii . here is an edited transcript of their interview . and read the full story of san pancrazio . what was your experience participating in the san pancrazio procession ? armando rendón : i realized that we were the only two people who were n't from italy or europe . it was like we were representing the whole rest of the world . i remember just before night fell there was a beautiful sunset . the whole sky was just ablaze . it made me wonder what it was like in 1944 on that date and whether the sky was as beautiful as that . i thought of what the people must have gone through because they thought they were out of the way . but all of a sudden they had these tanks and soldiers coming in and gathering all the men up and killing them . and it was such a contradiction between what we 're looking at and what must have happened on that date . that really stayed with me . helen rendón : i felt very sad to hear what was going on . i was really very , very sad . they were just a delightful group of people really . and i thought :  oh my gosh , that 's terrible . why -lsb- did -rsb- this happen to them in 1944 ?  i know about the history of the nazis , but i did n't know about that town and what they did . do you remember something from the evening that affected you ? ar : i did n't feel , or sense , any bitterness or hate . that struck me very strongly . they were just there to remember and not to hate . when everything was over , we went to this little club that sits in the back of the village . some of the older guys were out in the front , chatting and smoking and having a beer or wine . and we went in and got something to drink . they knew that we could n't really speak italian . we could just say hello . but there were a feeling of acceptance of  thank you for being here .  what was your family 's experience during wwii ? ar : i had grown up in san antonio , texas . my grandmother and my aunt were the ones who were raising me during the war years . my mother had gone off to oakland , california to work . in fact , she worked in a parachute assembly plant . i lived mostly with my grandmother and she had five boys . four of them went into the service during the war years . you know how they put stars on the windows when you had somebody in service ? she had four stars in her front window . i did n't realize all this until i was much older and then i started to ask questions . so i knew the kind of sacrifices my grandmother had gone through . i do n't think i really had experienced first-hand the kind of feeling that i felt at san pancrazio and saw the place where the men had been killed and there were still some bullet holes in the wall . just incredibly inhumane . that gave me a whole different sense of what the war must have been like to people who were otherwise innocent , and just waiting and hoping that it would be over and pass them and we told them :  no , no we do n't have them .  we were lying so that they would leave . that 's what my father was doing . i did n't know what was going on but i was listening and they said :  be quiet . get in the house .  so they were going into the houses -- they were all empty -- and they started shooting . they stole all their clothes , all their furniture . they were very proud to be with hitler . my dad was very worried about the beautiful neighbors , the jewish neighbors we had . how did the experience change your opinion of tuscany ? ar : i had a romanticized idea about tuscany : a lot of vineyards and people drinking wine out on their patios . i think it 's still a romantic place . it 's a very human place . what i learned from san pancrazio was that people suffered . and there was a very difficult history . to recollect the way they do it is really beautiful . it left me feeling very happy to have experienced those moments with them . we saw another side of the italian people that not many people see . that was really a humbling experience . hr : for me , tuscany is great . when i finished seeing that beautiful little town , it 's great . it did n't affect me negatively . i was sad for them , but it was so delightful . i was impressed by the children and the grandmothers because they were sitting and talking while the children were laughing , running and playing . they were very happy . what thought would you like to leave us with ? ar : we honor the soldiers -- the warriors -- the men and women that fought for us and died for us to keep our freedom alive . but we often forget the people , the mothers and fathers , the families that were behind them , waiting for them to come back . so we have to remember the people who sacrificed on the battlefield , but also those who sacrificed at home . and certainly , san pancrazio gives us an example of the tremendous sacrifice of people who were otherwise innocent . it just reinforces my conviction that we can not use war as an option in working out our problems .", "summary": " couple who attended san pancrazio memorial share their feelings .   armando rendón : to recollect the way they do it is really beautiful .   helen rendón : the children were laughing , running and playing . they were very happy .
