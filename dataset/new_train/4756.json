{"text": "fashion week has begun in new york , but for space enthusiasts , the most exciting glamor shots are coming from mars . the much-celebrated rover curiosity has so far strutted 109 meters -lrb- 358 feet -rrb- on the surface of the red planet , according to its odometer , and she 's looking great , nasa scientists say . the 2000-pound suv-sized rover has been on the surface of mars for about one month , and operating as expected .  there have been no significant anomalies or wild cards thrown in where the performance on mars differed significantly from the earth ,  said michael watkins , curiosity mission manager at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory at a news briefing thursday .  that 's a real testament to the engineers that developed the system .  a new photo from the rover 's camera on the mast shows off the rover 's arm against the spectacular martian landscape . on the arm is the mahli camera , with resolution so great that it can resolve down to the grain of talcum powder , said aileen yingst at thursday 's nasa news briefing . yingst is the deputy principal investigator for curiosity 's mars hand lens imager at the planetary science institute , tucson . all that separated this camera 's lens from the martian environment was a dust cover , which appears to be intact . that means even higher-resolution images from the red planet may come through soon .  we 're just completely and totally enthralled and excited by this image ,  yingst said . what we 've done on mars , and what 's next . another new photo shows the rover 's tracks from its first drives on mars , as seen from the hirise camera on nasa 's mars reconnaissance orbiter . scientists can get insights about how changes on the martian surface , as dust is deposited , by examining these tracks over time . hirise also took an image of the parachute and back shell that helped curiosity arrive safely . curiosity made a dramatic landing on august 6 in a complicated maneuver involving a large parachute and a sky crane . scientists and fans watched the live nasa feed from the jet propulsion laboratory as mission specialists confirmed the touchdown . the landing site has been dubbed bradbury landing after science fiction author ray bradbury . premiering a song -- from mars . in the interim , researchers have been checking out the many different instruments on board curiosity . the rover also did a test drive in august and has moved away from the landing site . now , everything except for the arm and sampling system is already operational , scientists said . the rover is currently 82 meters -lrb- 269 feet , measured as the crow flies -rrb- from bradbury landing . it will remain there for about another week while scientists continue testing . in about a month , scientists plan to have curiosity scoop up some martian material . because the rover is taking images as it goes , planners can determine whether it 's making progress and how much slippage there is . it appears that there is very little slippage going on , watkins said . how driving a rover works : meet scott maxwell . curiosity 's next destination is glenelg , a site with three types of terrain , including layered bedrock , that may be a prime target for drilling . ultimately , the rover will end up at mount sharp , about 3 miles high and composed of hundreds of layers of rock that built up over time . as the rover climbs , it will sample different layers to investigate signs that life could have once existed on mars . follow complete coverage of the mars rover .", "summary": " scientists are n't seeing major ` wild cards ' in rover performance .   dust cover on high-resolution camera appears to be intact .   sampling of martian material may begin in about a month .   curiosity has been on mars since august 6 .
