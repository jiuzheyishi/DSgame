{"text": "what is ariel sharon 's legacy ? the eulogies have focused on his decision to pull israeli settlers out of gaza in 2005 under the so-called  disengagement plan .  u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon praised sharon 's  political courage and determination .  u.s. secretary of state john kerry said sharon  surprised many in his pursuit of peace .  the reality is that sharon 's withdrawal from gaza portended no courage to change his pro-settlement , virulently anti-palestinian policies . since the 1970s , when he planned and helped establish 64 west bank settlements , sharon had earned his moniker as  the father of the settlements .  his evacuation of 21 settlements in gaza and four in the west bank seemed surprising , indeed . but the removal of settlers must be seen in the context that overall during sharon 's term as israel 's prime minister from 2001 to 2006 , the number of israeli settlers in the west bank , including east jerusalem and the golan heights , increased from roughly 388,000 to 461,000 . sharon 's legacy is deeply disturbing . he went to his grave without facing justice for terrible things he did . his death is a grim reminder that impunity for human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law has plagued israel and the palestinians for far too long . it mattered little to sharon that israel 's transfer of its civilians into palestinian territories wasâ $  and isâ $  a grave breach of the geneva conventions and a potential war crime . it mattered even less that the settlement regime and israel 's military rule in these areas subjects palestinians to severe discrimination and a mountain of restrictions that makes life miserable . part and parcel of this settlement expansion plan was sharon 's construction of the israeli separation barrier , which today stands as a monument to human rights violations . sharon 's government approved its construction in 2002 , ostensibly to prevent palestinian attacks that killed 640 israeli civilians during his term . but the real motivation for the barrier , as countless studies have documented , was to build a wall around the israeli settlements , deep into the west bank , cutting off thousands of palestinians from the rest of the west bank . worse , he avoided prosecution for the killings of civilians in which he was implicated : a fact that deserves not eulogy , but infamy . ban and kerry could n't very well mention it , but history will remember sharon for his role in the massacres of civilians by lebanese militias in the sabra and shatila palestinian refugee camps in lebanon in 1982 . from september 16 to 18 , the militias killed at least 700 people , and perhaps more than 2,000 , including infants , children , pregnant women and the elderly , some of whose bodies were found to have been mutilated . sharon , as israel 's defense minister in 1982 , had overall responsibility for the israel defense forces , which controlled the area of the camps . according to a document prepared by his office , sharon 's instructions on september 15 , the day before the massacres began , included :  for the operation in the camps the phalangists should be sent in .  in february 1983 , the kahan commission , israel 's official commission of inquiry investigating the events , found that sharon bore  personal responsibility  for the massacre . there was a  serious consideration ... that the phalangists were liable to commit atrocities ,  the commission reported , but  from -lrb- sharon -rrb- himself , we know that this consideration did not concern him in the least .  his  disregard of the danger of a massacre  was  impossible to justify ,  the commission found , and recommended his dismissal as defense minister . although he did resign as defense minister , in a glaring example of gross impunity for crimes against palestinians , sharon remained in the israeli cabinet as a minister without portfolio and later became prime minister , serving until his stroke in january 2006 . similarly , elie hobeika , the phalangist leader the kahan commission named as responsible for directing the militias , also escaped prosecution and served as a lebanese cabinet minister until being killed by a car bomb in 2002 . the massacres constituted war crimes and crimes against humanity . yet israeli justice authorities did not conduct a criminal investigation to determine whether sharon and other israeli military officials bore criminal responsibility . israel also made sure that no one else could bring sharon to justice , either . in 2001 , survivors from sabra and shatila brought a case in belgium requesting sharon be prosecuted under belgium 's  universal jurisdiction  law . political pressure from the united states and israel -- it  was like nothing i have ever seen ,  said a colleague who closely followed the issue at the time -- led belgium 's parliament to amend the law in april 2003 , and to repeal it in august . belgium 's highest court dropped the case against sharon that september . many in israel are now highlighting sharon 's record as a warrior and bold political leader . but it is worth pausing to consider his record as a man who brought devastation and destruction to the lives of thousands of palestinians , without ever facing justice for his crimes , and whose policies undermined efforts to achieve peace between israel and the palestinians . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of sarah leah whitson .", "summary": " sarah whitson : while eulogies praise ariel sharon , his legacy is actually disturbing .   whitson : sharon 's pro-settlement , virulently anti-palestinian policies were harmful .   she says he avoided prosecution for the killings of civilians in which he was implicated .   whitson : his death is a grim reminder that impunity for human rights abuses still occurs .
