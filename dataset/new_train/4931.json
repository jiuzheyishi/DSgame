{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- even though rafael nadal had beaten his first-round opponent at the australian open , mikhail youzhny , five straight times , the spaniard was n't sure what to expect when they played monday . after all nadal last competed at a major at wimbledon and had lost both singles matches that he contested this year as he returned from appendix surgery . nadal -- who also suffered from back and wrist injuries in 2014 -- cast doubt on his australian open participation just last week . youzhny , too , owned four victories over the 14-time grand slam champion . but in a score that is sure to have his rivals taking note , the spaniard crushed the former top-10 regular 6-3 6-2 6-2 .  very positive result for me ,  nadal told reporters .  i think very good start .  always before the first match you have the doubts , especially in this situation i 'm arriving here . never easy , but it was an important match for me . was a comfortable victory that give me some confidence .  nadal habitually lingers on court even when he wins in straight sets but he needed just one hour , 50 minutes to dispose of the veteran russian . he only faced one break point , dropped four points behind his first serve and struck 22 more winners than unforced errors .  i think i returned well ,  said the 2014 finalist .  my return worked really well . the serve , too . i served , i think , the right way , with only one break point during the whole match . and in general i played with not many mistakes .  nadal could face roger federer in the semifinals , and the swiss began his charge with a 6-4 6-2 7-5 win over yen-hsun lu . lu has upset the likes of andy murray , andy roddick and david nalbandian in the past but he only really challenged the 17-time grand slam winner in the third set . an attacking federer -- appearing in a record extending 61st straight major -- approached the net more than 40 times , winning 70 % of those points . nadal and federer were joined in the second round by two-time grand slam winner murray , although an outside contender for the women 's draw , ana ivanovic , fell . there was a time when many thought the former no. 1 would never return to the top 10 and top five but 2013 and 2014 saw the serb re-climb the rankings . and last week , she extended maria sharapova to three sets in a final in brisbane . her goal in 2015 , she said , was to perform her best at the grand slams , yet monday 's 1-6 6-3 6-2 loss to czech qualifier lucie hradecka means she still has n't figured things out . ivanovic heavily contributed to her downfall , hitting 10 double faults . it 's now only one grand slam quarterfinal for ivanovic in her past nine attempts .  it 's really disappointing ,  ivanovic told reporters .  it 's probably the worst thing that could happen .  i really have to now sit and work on few things and just maybe try to have a different approach to this kind of event and try to see what was lacking .  ivanovic admitted to nerves prior to the encounter , as did third-seed simona halep ahead of her match against karin knapp . but the fast-rising halep overcame the nerves and eased past the italian 6-3 6-2 . sharapova , bidding for a first major outside the french open in seven years , defeated petra martic 6-4 6-1 . halep 's reward is a second-round clash with aussie jarmila gajdosova , who snapped a long drought at her home major . having lost all nine of her previous matches in melbourne , the big-serving gajdosova ousted halep 's fellow romanian alexandra dulgheru 6-3 6-4 .  i was talking to my coach and i told him i actually did feel like i won the australian open ,  gajdosova said .  it was just the first round but it 's been such a long time coming . not to be able to do it in your home grand slam was very devastating for me .  later , there was more joy for australia as two of its brightest prospects won five setters . first thanasi kokkinakis upset 11th seed ernests gulbis 5-7 6-0 1-6 7-6 -lrb- 2 -rrb- 8-6 . kokkinakis -- who saved four match points in the fourth -- celebrated by doing a victory lap . not long after and past midnight in melbourne , nick kyrgios -- nadal 's conqueror at wimbledon -- edged federico delbonis 7-6 -lrb- 2 -rrb- 3-6 6-3 6-7 -lrb- 5 -rrb- 6-3 .", "summary": " rafael nadal crushes mikhail youzhny at the australian open .   it was nadal 's first grand slam match since last year at wimbledon .   but women 's contender ana ivanovic loses her opener in melbourne .   roger federer , simona halep , andy murray progress to the second round .
