{"text": "a missing moggy that vanished from his home has been found ten years after he first disappeared - two miles away and three times as big . when the cat , named little puss , vanished in 2003 from melanie ashlin 's home in outwood , surrey , he was a seven-month-old kitten . melanie 's daughter hollie was still at primary school . hollie is now 19 and a dairy farmer - and little puss has been piling on the pounds . melanie ashlin was over the moon to be reunited with missing cat little puss a decade after it vanished . but the food loving feline now weighs three times what he did when he left . melanie said : ` his name 's a bit out of date now though - he 's massive and perhaps we should start calling him big puss ! ' when little puss left he was a slimline 4lbs . now he has tripled to a curvier 12lbs . ` he 's very fat and he does n't stop eating , ' melanie said . ' i do n't know whether someone has had him and has been looking after him . ` when he left he was only seven months old . i thought i would never see him again , so it is just amazing . ` it is lovely having him home . he is so sweet , he does n't really want to go out , he 's quite happy here . ' reunited at last : melanie ca n't stop wondering what happened to little puss since he walked out of her home . now her pet is having to get used all the other animals she has . after almost a decade , he was found wandering forlornly and taken to a vet as a stray . there he was scanned and they found a microchip . that revealed his owners lived just a couple of miles from the spot he was picked up . melanie was stunned when she received a call to say they had found her wandering feline . ' i was so shocked - even after ten years , ' the mum-of-two said . ' i had never stopped thinking about him and wondering what had happened to him . ` when i went to pick him up i thought he would be a bit feral but although he was obviously a bit scared , he was as good as gold . little puss was discovered on farmland just a couple of miles away in south nutfield with a group of other cats . the cats protection league was alerted . they took him to a vet in nearby merstham who scanned him . two weeks after he was found he has settled back in with his family . but he has had to adjust to having company . melanie also has two dogs , two cats and five chickens . ` hollie was just 10 when little puss went missing and now she is 19 , said melanie , who also has a 31-year-old son . ` since he disappeared i have had two grandchildren . ' i look at him and say ,  where have you been all these years ?  i wish he could tell me . ` with all the snow we have had in the past few years , i always wondered whether he had somewhere to live . ' i wondered whether he was dead , if he 'd got run over . ` he was always in the back of my mind .
