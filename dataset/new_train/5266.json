{"text": "jailed : charles casey has been sentenced to nearly five years in a young offenders ' institution for defrauding an elderly man of his life savings . a frail couple in their 90s were ` robbed of their old age ' by a young conman who duped them out of # 365,000 for bogus roof repairs . the bill -- for work that was never carried out -- amounted to more than the # 350,000 value of their four-bedroom detached house . fresh-faced irish traveller charles casey , 21 , was yesterday jailed for four years and eight months for swindling ronald and lucy dew , 90 and 92 . casey was among a gang of eight sentenced for building repair and driveway resurfacing frauds that netted them almost half a million pounds from pensioners in berkshire and devon . he began his fleecing of the dews with a knock on the door , claiming they had a damp problem in their roof . demands for cash escalated until the couple 's savings were gone . retired quantity surveyor mr dew , married to former secretary lucy for almost 70 years , said last night : ` i feel very foolish to have been taken in by him . it has been two years of hell and he had robbed us of our old age . ' mr dew said he and his wife had hoped to spend their savings on trips to the ballet , theatre and opera -- and had planned to leave a healthy inheritance for their daughter . reading crown court heard that ` heartless ' casey -- who also admitted conning elderly edith dobrijevic and her son peter , 50 , out of # 100,000 in exeter -- had begun making money from the vulnerable when he was 15 . between november 2007 and march 2008 , he had been ` the main money man ' in a # 1million scam on a bristol man with learning difficulties , for which he got away with a community service , which was later revised to a curfew . in 2010 , shortly after the dews had paid # 17,000 for roofing work on their home in wokingham , berkshire , he knocked on their door . calling himself ` jeffrey andrews ' , casey told the couple the repairs had left their home suffering from damp and urgently needed dehumidifying . he asked mr dew to pay a deposit for machinery at a cost of # 18,000 , then demanded a further # 18,300 for a more powerful machine . casey cashed the cheques almost immediately . reading crown court , pictured , where casey was sentenced to four years and eight months for the ` cynical , sophisticated , heartless asset-stripping ' when mr dew tried to get the deposits back , he was told he could ` jump the queue ' by paying more . daniel fugallo , prosecuting , said casey told mr dew that ` if he divested himself of all he and his wife 's assets and put them over to him then all this , together with the deposits , would be returned to him . he was told to tell the banks none of this was to do with building work , but personal matters . ' confused mr dew handed over more cheques . he also received calls from casey 's partners in crime , one of whom claimed to be a ` scambuster ' , who told him not to call the police . in january 2011 , mr dew agreed to hand over another # 13,000 in cash -- but was by then suspicious of casey . as they discussed the situation , casey demanded the money , which the pensioner refused to hand over , so casey snatched the envelope from mr dew , which tore before casey made off with the cash . police were initially unable to trace the cocaine addict and father-of-one . then in november 2011 casey knocked on the door of the dobrijevics , this time calling himself anthony fleet , shortly after they had paid # 59,000 for paving on their driveway . he claimed they had been scammed but he could fix it , and got them to hand over # 19,000 in cash and around tens of thousands more in cheques before they called police . officers were at their home in april 2012 to arrest casey when he drove round to collect a further # 19,000 . his fingerprints matched those on the remains of mr dew 's torn envelope . casey admitted three money-laundering offences , two counts of conspiracy to defraud , and robbery . judge nicholas wood said of the defrauding of the dews : ` it was a cynical , sophisticated , selfish , heartless asset-stripping of a gullible 88-year-old man causing great shock , divesting him of his life savings of # 365,000 . ' casey 's seven fellow gang members were jailed in november , receiving terms of between ten months and two years and three months for having cash from the scams paid into their accounts .", "summary": " charles casey , 21 , told ronald dew his roof needed to be dehumidified .   sentenced to four years and eight months in a young offenders ' institution .   victim says fraudster has ` robbed him of his old age ' with cruel scam .
