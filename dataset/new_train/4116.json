{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- yaya toure has all the trappings of a english premier league footballer . there is the reported $ 334,000-a-week salary , the luxury homes and cars , not to mention the silverware from last season when manchester city won the premier league and the english league cup . yet despite that success , including a fourth straight african player of the year title , the city and ivory coast talisman describes 2014 as  a horrible year .  no wonder -- it 's barely six months since his younger brother ibrahim died while toure and his brother kolo were on world cup duty in brazil . as for what lies in store during 2015 , he 's no idea . asked if he wants to stay put at city , toure says , in a wide-ranging interview with cnn 's amanda davies :  that 's a big question and that 's an easy question as well , and you have an easy answer ... we 'll see .  pressed on whether he plans to still be at the etihad stadium for the 2015-16 premier league season , he says :  i do n't know . i 'm at city . city is a great club where i 've achieved lots of things .  those less than equivocal answers bring us to toure 's marie antoinette  let them eat cake  moment . after city 's title triumph last season , his agent dimitri seluk said toure was upset that the ivorian 's birthday had n't been properly  acknowledged  by the club .  he got a cake but when it was roberto carlos 's birthday , the president of -lrb- russian side -rrb- anzhi -lrb- makhachkala -rrb- gave him a bugatti ,  seluk reportedly said .  sometimes it makes you disappointed when the story is going wrong ,  says toure looking back on the episode .  i do n't want to open my heart up again and open my mind to the newspaper -lsb- reports -rsb- again because there have been such disappointing things running in the newspaper that have hurt me a lot . but i 'm a guy who is very strong mentally .  toure says he felt let down by certain individuals over how the story unfolded , though he 's not divulging any names . however , he is quick to credit the city supporters as well as chairman khaldoon al mubarak and manager manuel pellegrini for ensuring he felt loved again . though it 's playing that provides the greatest solace .  it 's only football that keeps me peaceful ,  adds toure .  it 's only the feeling of going after the ball that makes me happy . it 's only once i see the city fans singing my name and the manager told me i want to cover , to take more space , it makes me feel happy and it 's all i want .  toure is very much a player who wears his heart on his sleeve , and that becomes very apparent as he reflects on the highs and lows of 2014 . the biggest low came while in brazil when news of ibrahim 's death was broken to him over the phone by another of his brothers . for toure , the tragedy still remains raw :  2014 was , i think i can say , a horrible year for me .  it was disappointing in the world cup . of course , we won the premier league and the cup this year but i think with the death of my brother it was a hard one , the hardest one because i was not preparing to support such a situation .  in the family you have one who you love , one who you care about above all the rest and i think ibrahim was this guy . when he passed away ... that time was quite difficult because we have the beginning of this season in the premier league and to manage that was difficult .  amid the tragedy , toure and sibling kolo , who plays for liverpool , opted to stay in brazil and represent their country . it 's a decision that he still regrets to this day . playing the ensuing game against greece , he admits ,  in my mind , i was thinking that after the game i was calling him -lsb- ibrahim -rsb- . i was still asking ` how do you feel about the game i played against greece ? ' but he passed away before the game .  perhaps the memory is in some ways just as raw now , with the brothers back in international action for their country for the upcoming africa cup of nations -lrb- afcon -rrb- in equatorial guinea . at this time the loyalties of all african players are tested , given so many play for top european club , which are often fighting for titles and cups .  it 's difficult because your country and club is always our hardest divide especially the city fans , the chairman , the boss as well , they 're good with me and i want to give 100 % when i 'm there ,  said the 31-year-old . the elephants are undeniably one of the strongest teams in the continent of africa given they can call on the likes of the toures , recent city signing wilfried bony , salomon kalou and cheick tiote . but the nation have not always shone at international level -- especially at africa 's most prestigious tournament -- winning just one afcon title back in 1992 , and finishing runners-up in 2006 and again two years ago .  i think it 's the lack of concentration or maybe it 's because we fear our own team . we think we are the best but ... you have to have desire , you have to have determination ,  says toure , reflecting on his country 's relative under-performance at the tournament .  we have to be mentally ready for the hard battle because in africa it 's not only the opponent we have to fight . we have to fight the temperature as well , we have to fight the field .  the tournament had been due to take place in morocco but , amid fears of the ebola crisis , the north african nation withdrew as hosts and equatorial guinea stepped in as hosts . ebola remains a talking point among players and toure has no qualms that it 's something that concerns him ahead of an opening game against guinea , where the disease has taken hold .  it 's difficult when you feel like your family can maybe contract this infection , you 're a little bit afraid ,  he says .  yes , we fear but we ca n't say we do n't want to go because it 's a situation we need to educate people because people do n't understand how to protect themselves against this infection .  there was talk of perhaps scrapping the tournament for a year due to the threat posed by ebola , but toure believes organizers are right to go ahead .  january is the time when the african people can enjoy ,  he says .  the african player coming from europe is like a moment in a dream for the african because , when they see us coming , they are always happy .  it 's going to be like a big fiesta where people can enjoy , they can dance , they can love and they can do what they want .  after toure 's tumultuous 2014 , he 's hopeful it will prove the perfect start to 2015 .", "summary": " toure says ` we 'll see ' when asked if he expects to still be at manchester city next season .   midfielder relives the horror of hearing of the death of his brother ibrahim at the world cup .   toure 's sights are now set on winning the african cup of nations with ivory coast .
