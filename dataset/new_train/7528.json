' when the victim appeared to slump over the sergeant 's desk during the incident last october 13 , rea said : ` get off my desk , you horrible little individual . ' rea claimed he only tried to lift the teenager up but district judge jeremy coleman rejected his defence after a trial at westminster magistrates court . the judge said : ` in the custody suite he -lsb- the victim -rsb- was being difficult and irritating . however , he was not being violent . ` sgt rea decided to use shock tactics and he agrees that cctv shows him accurately and he did this in order to gain his cooperation . ` he had lost his temper and left the neutral area behind his desk . what he did next was completely out of character . ' the assault rea then perpetrated on the boy went well beyond ` necessary force , albeit after provocation ' , the judge said . william emlyn-jones , defending , told the court : ` this finding will undoubtedly bring this career to an end . ' relatives of rea openly wept in the gallery as the verdict was read . cctv footage played in court showed how rea attacked the boy as he was lying on a bench at the police station . rea was behind his desk when he told the teenager : ` right your -lsb- custody -rsb- clock starts now , young man ' . the boy then raised his middle finger . rea moved around his desk and shouted : ` now you have f ****** upset me , get up , stop being a p **** ' , before picking the victim up by the throat and roughly shoving to the floor and then across the room . the boy had been arrested earlier in the night after the theft of a bottle of vodka from iceland . questioning rea about the assault on october 13 last year , prosecutor carl kelvin asked : ` how is that compliant with your officer safety training on how to deal with people who are an unknown risk or potentially show aggression ? ' . ' i took a calculated risk in what i did ' , rea replied . the 39-year-old custody sergeant was caught on cctv attacking the teenager in the custody area of bexleyheath police station in southeast london . mr emlyn-jones claimed his foul language merely added 'em phasis ' and did not reflect any ` anger ' . rea claimed he only tried to lift the boy , adding : ' i expected him to lift himself with my assistance . ' his barrister hailed him as an ` exemplary character ' and a ` public servant ' . ` the use of force was not just necessary but clearly unavoidable by his -lsb- the victim 's -rsb- conduct . something had to happen - something had to be done about him . ` he could n't could n't be allowed to just loll about in the custody area . the only question is whether he -lsb- rea -rsb- used reasonable force . ` all he did in fact was try and pick him up . he did n't slap him , or punch him , or kick him . ` he used - ironically - too little force rather than too much . ' the judge accepted that the victim had been ` deliberately uncooperative ' but said there was no doubt the sergeant 's actions amounted to assault by beating . stan fitzpatrick , an inspector at bexleyheath police station , had told the court earlier that rea was ' a credit to my team . ' ' i certainly would have him back anytime ' , he said . rea was handed a six month conditional discharge and costs of # 500 . he denied the charge but was convicted of assault by beating . detective chief superintendent alaric bonthron , mps directorate of professional standards said : ` the custody sergeant has responsibility for the welfare of those within the custody suite especially the young and vulnerable . ` the public has a right to expect that anyone brought into a custody suite will be treated in an appropriate manner . ` steven rea let everyone down when he assaulted this boy and it is right that he has been convicted at court .
