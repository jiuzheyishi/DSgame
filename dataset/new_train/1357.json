{"text": "this brings new weight to the term ` chasing rainbows ' , because chasing this colour spectrum would literally mean running in circles . during a recent trip over cottesloe beach in western australia , 46-year-old aerial photographer colin leonhardt happened upon a rare natural phenomenon . ` the pilot and i were on our way back from shooting a grand final afl match in rural perth . it was raining softy , and the sun was peering through the clouds . ` as we went through the trailing edge of the rain , the sun was low and setting and the sunlight just created this amazing rainbow . it just evolved in front of us . ' stunning : 46-year-old aerial photographer colin leonhardt happened upon the rare natural phenomenon on his way back from shooting an afl match in rural perth . think quick : leonhardt took over 50 images for the five minutes it remained a complete full circle rainbow . according to nasa , the full circle rainbow is ` an observer dependent phenomenon primarily caused by the internal reflection of sunlight by raindrops ' ' i had never heard of it before , not to mention seeing one in person . we looked at each other and said ` what the hell is that ? ' leonhardt says he trusted his instincts on how to capture the moment . ` my experience with this sort of thing is to shoot first , then ask questions . i starting snapping like there was no tomorrow . ' he took over 50 images for the five minutes it remained a complete full circle rainbow . ` once we reached the beach , a big burst of light came through and the whole thing really lit up . then it faded as quickly as it came . ' ` as soon as i got home , i started researching . basically it 's a very rare phenomenon that relies on specific conditions . ` it needs to be low sun-so early mornings or evenings-and it has to be straight after a storm , with light coming through the rain . ' when leonhadt uploaded the images online , they spread like wildfire . leonhardt received a spate of emails from scientists and astronomers who said they had ` never seen anything like it ' leonhardt -lrb- right -rrb- says he probably would n't attempt to find the circle ranbow a second time due to the exorbitant costs of aerial photography . apart from getting media attention from all over the world , leonhardt was also contacted by a wealth of scientists and astronomers-including none other than nasa . ' i received a bunch of emails from people in those fields . they were so excited , they said they had never seen anything like it . ` next thing i knew , i got an email from nasa . they wanted to use my image for their astonomy pic of the day . i thought ` why not ?  according to nasa , the full circle rainbow is ` an observer dependent phenomenon primarily caused by the internal reflection of sunlight by raindrops . ' when asked if thought he would try to chase the rainbow down a second time , leonhadt said ` in the end of the day , aerial photography is n't cheap . ` it costs $ 1000 every time you want to get up there . with how rare these things are and how difficult it would be to replicate the moment , i 'm not sure if i could justify a second time .
