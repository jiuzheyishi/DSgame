' mr gove said : ` evidence uncovered in . birmingham clearly indicates that schools have used the notice they have . been given of inspections to evade proper scrutiny . ` our children need . to be kept safe from the dangers of extremism and guaranteed a broad and . balanced curriculum . ' allegations : park view school , which has allegedly been infiltrated by extremists , has been iven glowing reports and rated ` outstanding ' by ofsted in recent years . a leaked report speaks of alarm at language and teaching in oldknow junior school , birmingham . the trojan horse allegations came to light earlier this year after a letter emerged claiming existence of a plan for hard-line muslims to seize control of schools by installing friendly governors , then forcing out uncooperative headteachers . the letter is now regarded as a hoax , but prompted investigations by ofsted and the department for education , under orders from michael gove as well as west midlands police . the controversy has left david cameron 's government in crisis after mr gove was forced to make a grovelling apology to the prime minister for undermining home secretary theresa may , whose spin doctor had to quit for attacking the education secretary . the punishments were meted out after a furious mr cameron was compelled to intervene to stop a vicious power struggle between home secretary mrs may and education secretary mr gove . mr gove agreed to say sorry after private remarks he made criticising her and home office counter-terrorism boss charles farr at a lunch with times newspaper executives over the home office 's handling of extremism in schools appeared in the media . mrs may 's spin doctor , fiona cunningham , was forced to quit for leaking a damaging private letter to mr gove written by mrs may . many in the muslim community have expressed anger over the investigations , with staff at one of the schools inspected branding the inquiries nothing short of ' a witch-hunt ' . mr cameron also said he was calling a special meeting of the government 's extremism taskforce to discuss the implications arising from the findings of the ofsted review and the wider situation in birmingham . mr gove is expected to say today that the five or more schools to be placed in special measures by ofsted could have their governors and leadership teams removed . powers granted in february will allow him to impose an indefinite ban on anyone whose conduct has undermined ` fundamental british values ' , including ` individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance or those with different faiths and beliefs ' . the rev oliver coss , a governor at regent 's park primary school , one of the 21 inspected , told bbc breakfast that allegations were made that were ` completely untrue ' after the departure of its head and deputy head teacher last year . ` our school was named in a document which has become known as the trojan horse document , as being one where the head teacher and the deputy head teacher had been removed by an insurgency . those allegations we utterly rejected , ' he said . ' i do think it is right that once criticisms or complaints are made about schools that we see them through and make sure we know that we have answers . ' commenting on the wider inquiry , he said : ` there is a wide variety of allegations that have been made by a number of different groups and people and it is absolutely right that we get to the bottom of what is going on , so that people have confidence in saying that there is no extremism in birmingham schools and that children are adequately protected from those risks . ` but i think there is a genuine risk of making it seem as though islam is the same as extremism , or islam is the same as terrorism , those things are categorically not true . ` it is very wise and very right that we should respect islamic communities in east birmingham , it is very right that we should allow that to be reflected in the culture of our schools because those things are good and noble and we want things that are good and noble celebrated in our schools .
