{"text": "the big auto show in detroit does n't kick off until next week , but major car companies are already showing off some of their more exciting car-tech prototypes here at the international consumer electronics show . bmw and audi unveiled their latest driverless car technology and conducted demonstration drives . nevada is one of a few states where it 's legal to test drive autonomous cars , though it requires a person to sit in the driver 's seat at all times . bmw added its highly active assist technology to a modified 2 series coupe . the car can slide into a controlled drift to demonstrate how precise the control systems are and how it can handle a critical situation . the company has posted a video showing it in action .  it 's like the best test driver you have ,  said dr. werner huber , bmw project manager driver . the car uses steering , breaking and throttle to control acceleration , deceleration and direction in very small , exact amounts . the demonstration is just one aspect of the technical building blocks required to make a self-driving car . there are also sensors , environmental modeling and decision and driving strategy technologies that bmw is working on . those were not included on this particular test vehicle . early automated-vehicle prototypes from car makers , universities and google looked like frankenstein experiments , covered in custom-hacked hardware . now the technology is getting smaller and the necessary sensors and cameras are shrinking to barely noticeable sizes . audi is particularly proud of decreasing the size of its computer systems , which previously filled the entire trunk of the car , into a box that 's mounted inside the glove compartment . the german car manufacturer demonstrated its sport quattro laserlight concept car at ces . audi 's real advancement this year is the compact zfas car computer . in the future , the nvidia powered system could be used for key automated-driving tasks like traffic sign recognition , lane departure warnings and pedestrian spotting . size is n't the only technical challenge . dependability is also incredibly important for a computer system driving a car . you ca n't reboot a vehicle while it 's hurtling down a highway at 60 mph .  we ca n't have these systems crash ,  said david anderson , nvidia 's senior automotive solutions architect .  this is a safety critical application .  making it legal . car makers agree that while there are many technical issues ahead , they may not be the most daunting obstacles self-driving cars face . autonomous driving features are at least seven to 10 years away from becoming commercially available . the technology inside the cars is developing fast , but the auto industry will need at least that much time to sort out a tangle of non-hardware and software issues to clear the way for the cars .  the main problems are regulations and laws ,  said audi 's heribert braeutigam . various laws will have to be updated around the world to make it legal for automated cars to drive on the road . car manufactures and suppliers are already forming working groups to address the topics and work with governments .  we can only influence the technology . the framework work must be done by governments ,  said huber . insurance and liability are particular tricky . if a car driving itself gets into an accident that results in damages or injuries , who is responsible ? the driver who was watching netflix on a state-of-the-art car entertainment system , or the manufacturer that designed the car ? researchers and makers of driverless cars say the technology will be far safer than people-driven vehicles because they eliminate unpredictable human errors like distracted or drunk driving , or poor reactions to emergency situations . however , the cars wo n't be accident proof . the first major accident involving the technology will be a huge public relations hurdle for the entire industry . driverless cars ' people problem . inside the vehicle , the humans are the difficulty .  the psychological aspects of automation are really a challenge ,  huber said . at first , cars will share driving responsibilities with their human owners . companies are working on automated parking features or traffic assistance technology that will take over in specific scenarios under certain speed limit . there will be many times where the driver will have to actually drive , which means they will not be completely off the hook even during downtime .  he 's not allowed to sleep , read a newspaper , or a use a laptop ,  said braeutigam , outlining some of the rules for a driver in a partially automated vehicle . the rules are to minimize the amount of time needed to turn a passive passenger into an alert driver who is in control of the car . that 's where the connected , in-car entertainment and information systems come in . they may seem like an unnecessary distraction or luxury , but they 're actually a key safety feature in the automated driving system . car makers will want to limit drivers to only using in-car systems while not steering so the vehicle can get their attention when there 's an emergency or when they need to take over driving . an in-car system can pause movies , turn off e-mail and hide reading materials when it 's time to drive . if the driver does n't respond , it might sound alarms and blink lights , eventually turning on the hazards and slowing to a complete stop .  we need five to 10 seconds to pull him back into driving ,  huber said . during that time , the car must be able to operate autonomously . will the public want them ? there 's also the small matter of selling the public on automated driving . for people who love the act of driving , taking a powerful car like a bmw 2 series coupe and turning the action over to an automated system might seem like a waste .  we have to interpret the driving fun in a new way ,  huber said . that means bringing content and activities to the car so that the driver can make better use of his or her 30 minutes in traffic . they 'll still be able to take over during the fun parts , zipping down a curvy country road . privacy will be another big concern . the various sensors and in-car systems can collect data about driving patterns and locations and save that data in the cloud . the idea is to use this information to assist the driver , say updating a car 's route based on real-time mapping information . a recent report to congress said in-car services that currently collect location data on drivers do n't always follow recommenced privacy practices . many companies , like car makers or gps services , share collected data with third-parties , though the report did n't find any selling the information to data brokers . the report recommended the government do more to protect drivers ' privacy . information collection will become more prevalent in the future . eventually , car makers hope to open up the lines of communications between individual cars on the road to better avoid traffic jams and prevent accidents . that technology is even farther off than automated driving , since car manufacturers need to come together to agree on protocols and frequencies . as cars pile on more advanced automated technology , it becomes clear they fit into the consumer electronics show as much as the typical car show . they are moving beyond just being cars .  the car is becoming a driving robot , a moving robot ,  huber said .", "summary": " bmw and audi demonstrated autonomous driving vehicles at ces in las vegas .   self-driving cars face a number of technical , legal and human challenges .   the technology could appear on the roads in seven to 10 years .
