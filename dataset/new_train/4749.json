{"text": "accra , ghana ghana is n't the easiest place for people with disabilities . they are often viewed with suspicion , deemed unlucky , untrustworthy , or without value .  unfortunately , we associate disability with all manner of negative influences : with witchcraft , with the devil , with bad karma ,  explains max vardon , who formerly headed ghana 's national council on persons with disabilities .  they get relegated to the sidelines . the schooling they should get , the support from their families they should get , they do n't , so life is very difficult for them ,  he adds . lately , however , a number of paralympic athletes are hoping to use sport to change public perceptions . one of the leading spokesmen for ghana 's physically challenged is charles narh teye , one of a handful of ghanaian para-athletes who competed in the london 2012 paralympics . narh teye had both his legs amputated when he was one-month old . today , he is a professional body builder who also owns his own gym .  with the gym , i love it when people see me with my disability training able-bodied people ,  says narh teye , who is now training himself for the paralympic games in rio de janeiro . he uses his earnings to reinvest in ghana 's para-sports , an area he admits is under-financed .  we do not have a qualified para-powerlifting bench here in ghana , so we make do with the ones that able-bodied people use . of course , that reduces our input and output .  a new game ? another group looking to bring attention to the cause is the rolling rockets , ghana 's skate soccer team made up of polio survivors .  the sport is appreciated . i would say , in this country , it is admired by so many people ,  says albert frimpong , the team 's coach . skate soccer does n't yet have paralympic status , though it has garnered some attention in the last couple of years . in 2012 , the story of the rolling rockets inspired a kickstarter campaign for the documentary rollaball . earlier this year , the team was featured in a documentary and advertising campaign by chevrolet . frimpong initially formed the team to help get the men off the street .  the idea was to get them to stop begging , to improve their lives . i was hoping to use soccer as a way to set up business - and income-generating projects for them ,  he recalls . since then , his vision has expanded somewhat .  one of the dreams is to organize an african cup of nations , the first ever in the world here in ghana ,  he admits .  we can get a big fifa car to bring people here to come and watch , and the world will finally see them exhibiting their talent .  the next generation . the accra rehabilitation centre is currently one of the few institutions working to provide economic opportunities to the country 's physically challenged . the center is particularly keen to get their members involved in sports , not only for confidence-building , but for the sponsorship opportunities as well .  we have so many people with disabilities who have competed on a world stage , and because of that , they are being introduced to heads of state ,  says vardon .  they have acquired a livelihood for themselves and for their families that they did not have before .  another novel academy , called right to dream , is also hoping to nurture ghana 's future para-sportsmen . headed by raphael botsyo nkegbe and his protÃ © gÃ © , maclean atsu dzidienyo -- both internationally recognized wheelchair racers -- the academy aims to educate ghana 's disabled community , and nurture their talent for sport .  we work with some very disadvantaged kids in ghana , and they come from environments where they do n't actually know what opportunities are out there in the world . so when you bring them here , and tell them if you apply yourself you can achieve amazing things in life , they do n't understand ,  says nkegbe .  those who are competing are the new generation . they are the people taking over the baton .
