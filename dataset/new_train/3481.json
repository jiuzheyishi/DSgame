{"text": "activists have accused google of being racist and sexist in their choice of figures to create the firm 's much loved google doodles for . spark , which describes itself as a ` girl-fueled activist movement ' , said its analysis found the majority of google 's doodles were of white males . it said the accolade was the modern equivalent of being put on a stamp , and said ` it 's uncommon for google to celebrate historical women of color . ' researchers from spark found 62 % of doodles where of white males - with just 4 % black women . in 1998 , before the company was even incorporated , the concept of the doodle was born when google founders larry and sergey played with the corporate logo to indicate their attendance at the burning man festival in the nevada desert . they placed a stick figure drawing behind the 2nd ` o ' in the word , google , and the revised logo was intended as a comical message to google users that the founders were ` out of office . ' while the first doodle was relatively simple , the idea of decorating the company logo to celebrate notable events was born . it says its investigation was sparked in january when google featured author zora neale hurston on its u.s. homepage . the doodle was a huge success . ` here 's a theory : maybe it was special because it 's one of the few times that the internet saw google honor a black woman on its front page , ' spark 's celeste monta√±o said in a blog post . ` maybe it was special because it 's uncommon for google to celebrate historical women of color . ' although they began as a way for google 's founders to tell visitors they were visiting the burning man festival , they have become an online tradition . google doodles range from drawings and animations to full games that replace the google logo on holidays or birthdays of historical figures . sometimes the doodles are seen worldwide , but mostly they 're reserved for the country in which the holiday or individual is best known , as was the case with hurston -- her doodle was only visible on google 's u.s. homepage . the very first doodle to celebrate an individual appeared in 2001 in honor of monet , but the doodles did n't start making frequent appearances on google 's homepage until around 2010 , . ` for a while now , we at spark have noticed that white men get featured on the google homepage all the time , whereas women of color are rarely honored . zora neale hurston , one of the pre-eminent writers of twentieth-century african-american literature was recently honoured with a google doodle . ` but it was n't until september 2013 that we set out to find the exact numbers . ' the team analysed hundreds of google doodles for months . ` it turns out that from 2010-2013 , google celebrated 445 individuals on its various homepages throughout the world . 1 . ' 9 were women of color , 54 were white women , 82 were men of color , and an overwhelming 275 were white men . ` about half of those 19 women of color appeared in 2013 alone , so at least we can say there 's been some progress . ' spark also said there has n't been a single asian , latina , or indigenous woman featured in a global doodle as of february 2014 . the organisation today called for google to take action . carlos juan finlay , the cuban physician and scientist recognized as a pioneer in the research of yellow fever was also recently the recipient of a google doodle . kristian olaf birkeland , the norwegian scientist who explained the aurora borealis was recently honoured . ` we 're demanding that google make a concerted effort to change such a blatant imbalance . ` we want them to acknowledge the problem , but we also want more : we want google to publicly commit to improving these numbers . ' ` google doodles may seem lighthearted , especially when accompanied by quirky games and animation , but in reality they have emerged as a new manifestation of who we value as a society , a sign of who  matters .  ` just like statues , stamps , and national holidays , you know that if someone is featured on google 's homepage , they 've done something important . ' it called for the doodles to include all races and genders . ` women , people of color , people with disabilities , queer people , trans people . ` we 're asking google to draw our histories , our achievements , our strength , our heroes , our fighters and foremothers . you ca n't keep ignoring us . we 're here , and we 've always been here . ' google said it already is working to improve the doodle gender balance . ryan germick , doodle team lead , told mailonline : ` women have historically been underrepresented in almost all fields : science , school curricula , business , politics -- and , sadly , doodles . ` we 've been working to fix the imbalance in our doodles -- this year we 're hoping to have women and men equally represented . ` so far this year we 've done doodles for as many women as men , a big shift from figures below 20 % in past years . ' the organisation launched a campaign today to try and persuade google to be more diverse with its doodles .", "summary": " organisation claims it is ` uncommon for google to celebrate women of color '   says doodles have become as important as stamps for recognition of key people and events .   google pledges to represent men and women equally in 2014 .
