{"text": "tokyo japan began dumping thousands of tons of radioactive water into the pacific ocean on monday , an emergency move officials said was needed to curtail a worse leak from the crippled fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant . in all , about 11,500 tons of radioactive water that has collected at the nuclear facility will be dumped into the sea , officials said monday , as workers also try to deal with a crack that has been a conduit for contamination . the radiation levels were highest in the water that was being drained from reactor no. 6 , the officials said . these are the latest but hardly the only challenges facing workers at the embattled power plant and its six reactors , which have been in constant crisis since last month 's ruinous earthquake and tsunami . officials with tokyo electric power company , which runs the plant , proposed the release of excess water that has pooled in and around the nos. 5 and 6 reactors into the sea . but most of the dumped water -- 10,000 tons -- will come from the plant 's central waste treatment facility , which will then be used to store highly radioactive water from the no. 2 unit , an official with the power company said . the water in reactors nos. 5 and 6 is coming from a subdrain and was n't inside the building itself , officials said . tests suggest that groundwater is the source of the contamination in these two units , but they are not certain . japanese chief cabinet secretary yukio edano called the dumping  unavoidable .  the liquid was most likely contaminated in the process of trying to cool nuclear fuel rods . the scope of the dump was staggering .  for an idea about how much is 11,500 tons , one metric ton is 1,000 kilograms or about 2,200 pounds , which is close to an english ton . water is about 8.5 pounds per gallon , so one ton is about 260 gallons ,  said gary was , a professor of nuclear engineering at the university of michigan .  so 11,500 tons is about 3 million gallons . a spent fuel pool holds around 300,000 gallons . so this amount of water is equivalent to the volume of roughly 10 -lrb- spent fuel pools -rrb- .  it could take 50 hours to dump all the water , tokyo electric said . the dumping of so much radioactive water into the ocean conjures up fears of mutated sea life and contamination of the human food chain , but experts said the radiation will be quickly diluted , minimizing risk .  to put this in perspective , the pacific ocean holds about 300 trillion swimming pools full of water and they 're going to release about five swimming pools full of water . so hopefully the churning of the ocean and the currents will quickly disperse this so that it gets to very dilute concentrations relatively quickly ,  said timothy jorgensen , chair of the radiation safety committee at georgetown university medical center .  it 's a considerable amount of water , but the immensity of the pacific ocean will quickly dilute this amount of water to harmless levels ,  he added . john till , president of risk assessment corp. , similarly cited the vastness of the ocean in helping to minimize harm , and said he does not expect to see any permanent effects on marine life , even close in to the plant . however , he said officials should continue to monitor the radiation levels closely .  what we have to watch is how these materials accumulate in food products and then could be consumed by people ,  till said . the build-up of water could cause problems around the nuclear facility , which is 240 kilometers -lrb- 150 miles -rrb- north of tokyo , edano said monday . authorities have made a priority of dealing with water from the no. 2 unit , some of which has been gushing into the sea through a crack in a concrete shaft .  the radioactivity level is very high near the no. 2 reactor , and we know this . we have to stop the leak as early as possible to prevent this from going into the sea ,  edano said .  the radioactivity level is much less in the water from the nos. 3 and 4 units .  nuclear and industrial safety agency officials said monday night that the hope is that pumping out the no. 2 reactor turbine plant will lower the water level enough that contaminated liquid wo n't be able to reach the sea .  i am not able to say for certain whether or not this will be the last discharge , but we certainly would like to avoid releasing any such water into the sea as much as possible ,  agency spokesman hidehiko nishiyama said . officials were still awaiting test results to confirm the water pouring into the ocean is leaking from the highly radioactive no. 2 reactor .  we do n't know clearly , but we feel it is somehow leaking from unit 2 ,  nishiyama said . even if the water is confirmed to have come from the reactor , neither tokyo electric nor government officials know how it is making its way from the reactor to the leaking pit , he said . once the water is pumped out of the waste treatment reservoir , the agency believes it can safely transfer the water from the basement of the no. 2 turbine plant to the reservoir without further leaks , he said . though japanese officials say the water being discharged is less radioactive than the water now leaking into the sea , its top concentration of radioactive iodine-131 is 20 becquerels per cubic centimeter , or 200,000 becquerels per kilogram . that 's 10 times the level of radioactivity permitted in food . but since it 's being dumped into the pacific , it will be quickly diluted , according to dr. james cox , a radiation oncologist at houston 's md anderson cancer center and a cnn consultant . reactors no. 1 and no. 3 , which have lower levels of water , need to be drained as well . tokyo electric 's plan is to pump that water to other storage tanks , including some that still need to be set up . attempts to fill the 20-centimeter -lrb- 8-inch -rrb- crack outside the no. 2 reactor 's turbine building -- on saturday by pouring in concrete , then sunday by using a chemical compound mixed with sawdust and newspaper -- were not successful . as officials mull other ways to cut off the leak at its source , workers will install a silt fence along a damaged sea wall surrounding the plant , nishiyama said . the aim of this screening , usually used to halt erosion at construction sites , is to prohibit the spread of radioactive particles into the sea . workers also have injected a dye tracer into the water to allow them to track the dispersal of such particles , the spokesman added . addressing the issue quickly is critical because officials believe it is a source of alarmingly high radiation levels in seawater near the plant , as well as in nearby groundwater . complicating the situation is the fact that , in some cases , authorities do n't even know how much radiation is getting out . after some high-profile errors , little new information on water , ground and air radiation has been released since thursday . one reason is that the dosimeters being used do n't go above 1,000 millisieverts per hour , said junichi matsumoto , an executive with tokyo electric . authorities know the water in the cracked concrete shaft is emitting at least that much radiation -- which equates , at a minimum , to more than 330 times the dose an average resident of an industrialized country naturally receives in a year . plugging the external leak is job one , in order to prevent the outflow of radiation into the pacific . but it may not be the most difficult , or important , task ahead . authorities still have to figure out how the tainted water got into the concrete shaft in the first place . the water had to come from somewhere , potentially traveling across melted-down nuclear fuel in the reactor 's core before somehow reaching the outside .  we were assuming and hoping -lrb- that water -rrb- would stay in the containment vessel as vapor after being cooled ,  nishiyama , the nuclear safety official , said sunday .  however , it may have flowed into the building , and then the trench .  determining why and how that happened -- and what to do about it -- may be  exceptionally challenging ,  said physicist james acton , with the washington-based carnegie endowment think tank . officials may have to inspect a complex array of pipes inside the dangerous radioactive environment inside the containment buildings . the state of the nos. 5 and 6 units is another new problem . water in their turbine buildings ' basements threatens the power supply for the system used to cool nuclear material in these units ' spent fuel pools , edano said . this makes it imperative to pump out that water , which will end up into the sea like that from around the nos. 3 and 4 units .  though those reactors are stable at the moment , the growing water level in the turbine houses may disturb their stability ,  he said . the effort to keep the nos. 1 , 2 and 3 reactor cores and spent fuel pools cool took a step forward sunday , when the electricity source powering those three units ' cooling systems was switched from a temporary diesel generator to a more permanent , external power supply , according to the international atomic energy agency 's website . authorities hope this step , as well as preventing damage to the nos. 5 and 6 units ' power supply , will help to minimize the prospect of any more radiation that might contaminate tap water or food . farmers have pushed for lower standards on radiation in food , calling them unnecessarily stringent . on monday , edano said these limits would not change , even as he outlined a process in which sales restrictions on certain crops , in certain areas , would be lifted if they test safe three times in a row . cnn 's matt smith ,
