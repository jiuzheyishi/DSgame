{"text": "patrick mouratoglou believes andy murray is on track to do well at wimbledon despite the deflating way in which his french open ended . murray had impressed on his way to the semi-finals for only the second time at roland garros only to suffer his worst ever grand slam defeat at the hands of rafael nadal . the spaniard , who will bid for a ninth title against novak djokovic on sunday , took just an hour and 40 minutes to win 6-3 6-2 6-1 , murray winning only 10 points on nadal 's serve in the match . deflated : andy murray was flattened in straight sets by rafael nadal in friday 's french open semi-final . no hiding place : the scotsman was completely overwhelmed by the spaniard , losing 6-3 6-2 6-1 . king of clay : nadal is on track for an unprecedented ninth crown at roland garros . murray will now seek solace in the grass of home , beginning the defence of his aegon championships title at queen 's club on wednesday before preparing to step out on centre court as the reigning wimbledon champion . the 27-year-old had certainly expected better of himself , particularly having come close to beating nadal on clay in rome three weeks ago . he hinted it might take him a while to get over the drubbing , but mouratoglou believes murray can feel very positive about his form . the frenchman , who coaches serena williams , told press association sport : ' i think everyone was surprised . ` they had this match in rome that was so good and that murray played so well . i think that 's the match that put him back on track , even though he lost it . we expected at least a battle , and there was no battle at all . ` if you do n't put doubts in rafa 's mind , if you do n't press on his weaknesses , then of course he 's so dangerous . i think murray let him play , he gave him too much time and he did n't hurt him . ` it was a bad day for him but i think he was too tired . when you 're tired against rafa on clay , you have zero chance , that 's it . ' i think it was a very positive roland garros for murray because his game is back to a very good level , and he knows it . this match he forgot already for sure . ` he gained a lot of confidence through this tournament . he knows what he needs to improve because it was obvious in this roland garros . much too many ups and downs , going from offence to defence too many times for no reason . ' guru : french coach patrick mouratoglou watches on at last year 's wimbledon championships . guru : the 44-year-old is the current coach of us tennis superstar serena williams . attention will now turn back to when murray will appoint a new head coach , having been without one since splitting from ivan lendl in march . he rated his chances of having someone in place before wimbledon , the most stressful two weeks of his year , as 50/50 . mouratoglou said : ` we have this saying in france that it 's better to be alone than with bad company . ` if he does n't find the right person yet then he has to wait but for sure it 's important to be back with someone with new goals , to have new things to work on in your game , to have a different voice , to have something new to bring excitement back . ` but i think he can do well also without the coach because he has so much experience . he 's won two grand slams and he 'll have all the crowd behind him at wimbledon , and he 's playing well again . ` he should n't panic . if he has someone it 's better , but if he does n't he can still do well . ' murray admitted he would rather have a few days off to lick his wounds and recover from the physical strain of two tough weeks on the clay rather than heading straight onto the grass . it is at least a much less physical surface while , if murray needs his spirits lifting , returning to the scene of his greatest triumph should be just the thing . watchful eye : murray is on the hunt for a new coach following his split with ivan lendl . mentor : the czech legend helped turn murray into a two-time grand slam champion . ' i expect to play well there , ' said the scot of wimbledon , which begins on june 23 . ` i 'm really looking forward to going back . i think it will give me a lot of positive energy . ` i 'm glad i 'm back playing to a level that was able to get me through to the last stage of slams . i just need that extra few per cent so that i can give myself a chance to try and win them again . ` but the grass will obviously help me . it 's a surface i have always enjoyed playing on . i think it 's been my most successful surface over my career . ` i 'm really looking forward to wimbledon especially . it 's only two and a half weeks away , so i do n't have too long to wait .
