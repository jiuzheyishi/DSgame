{"text": "patients are having to wait five and a half hours in ambulances parked outside a&e because there are not enough beds . some relatives are arriving at hospital to visit their loved ones only to find they are still ` queued up ' outside the main entrance . last week some 4,500 patients waited in ambulances for at least half an hour before they were admitted . waiting time : last week some 4,500 patients waited in ambulances for at least half an hour before they were admitted , according to figures obtained by labour . since the beginning of november there have been more than 68,000 such cases , a rise of a third compared to the same period last year . figures obtained by labour show that one patient brought in by great western ambulance trust in the last two months was made to wait 5 hours and 42 minutes . another taken to hospital by west midlands ambulance trust waited five hours and five minutes . warning : shadow health secretary andy burnham said : ` these chaotic scenes in a&e take us straight back to the bad old days of the mid-1990s ' but there is concern that keeping ambulances outside hospitals for so long puts other patients waiting for help at risk . one unnamed paramedic , who works in hertfordshire said : ` someone will die this winter as a result of no ambulance being available at the time of the emergency . it is not a matter of if , but when . ' shadow health secretary andy burnham said : ` these chaotic scenes in a&e take us straight back to the bad old days of the mid-1990s . ` up and down the country , ambulances are unable to dispatch patients , hospitals are full to bursting and people are waiting on trolleys in corridors . ` the government must take urgent action to ensure all a&e s have enough staff to provide safe standards of patient care and meet national standards . ' another unnamed paramedic , who works in north east england said : ` families of sick people arrive at hospitals and expect to find them in a bed , but they are still outside in an ambulance . the frustration of ambulance staff is beyond belief ' many emergency departments have become increasingly overstretched over the last few years and at times they are just too busy to admit new patients . but there is also concern that staff are deliberately making patients wait outside so they can meet targets and avoid fines . the rules state that hospitals ensure that at least 95 per cent of patients spend no more than four hours in a&e before they are discharged or taken to other wards . yet the clock only starts once patients are admitted , so managers will be inclined to leave them outside when they are very busy . delay : one patient brought in by great western ambulance trust in the last two months was made to wait 5 hours and 42 minutes . katherine murphy , chief executive of the patients association , said : ` the public will be deeply concerned by these figures , and deserve to expect the quickest access to a&e possible . ` long periods of waiting in an ambulance clearly adds to the stress and discomfort patients are already experiencing . ` the government needs to act to address the severe service pressures that lead to these unacceptable bottlenecks . ' nhs figures show that the number of emergency admissions has risen by 8 per cent in a year to 17.6 million . this rise has partly been blamed on the failure of gp out-of-hours services as well as the increasing elderly population . meanwhile officials are considering renaming a&e units either ` 999 ' or ` 111 ' departments . a report from nhs commissioning board recommends that all emergency departments are classified into treating either emergency cases or just urgent . those responsible for emergency care would be known as 999 units , while those looking after urgent cases would be 111 centres . a department of health spokesman said : ` the nhs is seeing an extra one million more patients in a&e compared to two years ago and despite the additional pressure overall it is coping well .
