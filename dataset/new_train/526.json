{"text": "updated : . 04:09 est , 16 november 2011 . secret talks are being held about watering down voters ' newly-granted power to trigger debates in parliament , following a series of embarrassments for the government . ministers and senior mps have discussed raising the threshold for the number of signatures needed on e-petitions before they can be considered for discussion in the house of commons . another idea is for debates to be relegated from the commons chamber to the backwater of westminster hall , normally only attended by a handful of mps at a time . conservative mp philip davies , who sits on the backbench business committee that decides which petitions should be debated , said : ` our committee has helped re-establish the faith of a lot of voters in the democratic process . the government should be pleased about that rather than interfering like this . ' the extraordinary manoeuvres came to light on the day that mps passed a motion triggered by an e-petition demanding that the treasury considers scrapping a 3p rise in fuel duty due in january . senior mps appear increasingly concerned that they have created a monster with the e-petition scheme , which forces them to consider debating an issue in the commons once an online petition attracts more than 100,000 signatories . its critics had warned that the government 's plans would allow the commons to be hijacked by campaigners , and would mean mps spending precious parliamentary time debating proposals that have little or no chance of becoming law . but ministers insisted it would revitalise public engagement with parliament in the wake of the expenses scandal -- even if it forced mps to confront difficult issues . popular : since the site was launched in the summer , several petitions have attracted the required home of signatures - and have then been debated in the commons . since the scheme was launched in the summer , several petitions have attracted the requisite number of signatures remarkably quickly . they include a call for a referendum on britain 's future in europe , the release of secret documents on the hillsborough tragedy , stripping rioters of their benefits and curbing immigration to prevent britain 's population reaching 70 million . the backbench business committee assesses the petitions that reach 100,000 and decides whether the issues should be given time from the 35 days allocated during each parliamentary session for non-governmental business . successful petitions then have to be sponsored by an mp who leads the debate . pr disasters : the introduction of the scheme has left david cameron embarrassed after rebellions against him by his own backbenchers . the scheme has led david cameron into a series of public relations disasters . the worst came in a debate last month over a referendum on britain 's future in the eu , which saw the prime minister suffer the worst rebellion on the issue ever staged by tory mps . senior colleagues said mr cameron blundered badly when he decided to turn a backbench vote , which was designed as a non-binding expression of the view of parliament , into a trial of strength . despite the prime minister imposing a three-line whip -- the toughest possible party instruction on how to vote -- and threatening members of the government that stepped out of line with the sack , 81 conservative mps defied him and voted in favour of a referendum . and last night mps called on the treasury to scrap fuel duty rises planned for next year and nodded through a motion calling for a new price stabilisation mechanism . more than 100 mps -- including 83 tories and five liberal democrats -- had backed the motion . attempts to change the e-petition system just months after it has been introduced will trigger accusations that the government is fighting shy of rebellions from mps over issues popular with voters . a government source confirmed last night that while the prime minister remains committed to the ` principle ' of e-petitions , discussions were taking place over whether to tighten up the system . one petition , on the treatment of british citizen babar ahmad , wanted in the u.s. on charges of terrorism , has already been tacked on to another debate on extradition treaties in westminster hall . others could follow the same route . contrasting views : philip davies said e-petitions had restored voters faith in the democratic process , but natasha engel said the government had not thought the scheme through properly . both are members of the backbench business committee . ` there are discussions , ' said one source . ` we did say from the start that we would see how this worked . if parliament is getting 100 petitions a year which attract 100,000 signatures , then people will ask if it 's sensible to change the threshold . ' natascha engel , the backbench business committee 's chairman , said the government had ` not thought through e-petitions at all ' and suggested the system was spiralling out of control . she said there were now false expectations that a petition attracting 100,000 signatures automatically means a debate and vote in parliament , followed by a change in the law if mps backed the motion . in reality , commons leader sir george young writes to the committee , asking them to consider a debate and a vote , which has no binding impact at all on government policy . the chairman said ministers had suggested doubling the threshold for signatures , but admitted doing so would prompt public ` outrage ' . mr cameron speaks at the despatch box ahead of the debate about an eu referendum , where he suffered the worse rebellion of his career . ` they ca n't raise the threshold : i think that would just send the signal to the public that politicians and parliament ca n't be trusted , when e-petitions were brought in to address that problem in the first place , ' she said . senior mps are understood to be proposing a system similar to scotland 's , in which a special unit corresponds with people proposing e-petitions and discusses whether the issue would be best addressed with a debate , a select committee inquiry or an amendment to a bill . labour 's petition website , which was not accompanied by the right to trigger issues for consideration by the commons , was suspended ahead of the general election and then shelved by the coalition . it too hosted a series of highly embarrassing campaigns , including demands for former prime minister gordon brown to resign . a downing street spokesman said there were ` no current plans ' to change the system , adding : ` 100,000 remains the qualifying threshold for a referral to the backbench business committee . '", "summary": " consider raising signature threshold from 100,000 .   mps claim debates waste valuable parliamentary time .   cameron says he remain ` committed ' to the scheme . "}
