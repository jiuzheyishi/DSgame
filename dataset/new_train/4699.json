{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- looking for a spa break ? in the past , the world 's chill-seekers might have ventured to thailand or india to get their massage fix . in the future , they 're more apt to be africa-bound . a new report in the global spa and wellness monitor puts sub-saharan africa as the world 's fastest growing region for wellness tourism . the number of spas has tripled since 2007 , and spa revenue has leaped 184 % . the number of those lured to the continent for a little r&r has also soared . 2013 saw 4.2 million wellness tourists -- a 90 % increase from 2012 . as a testament to this growth , this year 's annual global spa and wellness summit took place in morocco -- the first time the event was held on african soil .  africa is seen as the final frontier . it 's virgin territory ,  says magatte wade , the senegal-born founder and ceo of beauty brand tiossan , and a keynote speaker at the summit . she attributes the continent 's spike in spas not only to the increase of international travelers , but to the growth of the consumer class within africa .  the middle class is growing , there are more african billionaires right now , and then you have people like me , who 've had the opportunity to live all over the world and have money to spend , and want to go back home and have the same top-of-the-line service you have in new york or tokyo ,  she says . the wellness trend has also started to leak into africa 's safari industry , according to henry hallward , founder of both the good safari guide and the safari awards , and former chairman of the african tourism and travel association . hallward estimates there are 9,000 safari lodge operators today , up from approximately 400 in 1995 . pampering , he admits , has also become a stronger focus .  almost every safari lodge that i 'm aware of has added into its suite of services either massage , or else an entire spa branded by product suppliers ,  he says . a geographical shift . even countries that were once eschewed due to political concerns are set to emerge as wellness hotspots . hallward says he 's seen growth in markets such as ethiopia and even the sudan ,  now that the politics has calmed down .  he is also noticing a shift in the type of safaris on offer . the old formula of trekking the  big five  in the masai mara from the comfort of a jeep is outdated . instead , safaris are becoming more active , and different countries are starting to specialize in niche versions .  botswana has become the center for safaris on horseback , while malawi and zambia are emerging for the underwater wildlife experience ,  he says . wade too is also noticing growth in regions that were once considered off-limits .  angola is getting up there , and rwanda is starting to pay attention . it 's still in its infancy there , but it will grow fast ,  she says . a taste of the continent . wade says there is an incredible opportunity for new properties to embrace the numerous healing traditions and natural ingredients indigenous in the continent . her product line , which boasts senegalese black seed oil , is one of the few to do so , but wade is hoping it 's a trend that will spread .  there are 54 countries in africa , and each of these has dozens upon dozens of different healing rituals . there is a richness and diversity that we need to tap into ,  she says . so far only a handful of brands have taken a similar track -- such as the south african spa brand healing earth , which incorporates local ingredients like kalahari melon or mongongo nut . wade worries about the implications if more do n't follow suit : .  if we 're not careful , the wellness industry will come and put a blanket over what we already have . they 'll bring the asian - and european-inspired traditions they already know , and what we 've had for thousands of years will be lost ,  she warns .", "summary": " africa has a multitude of healing traditions and ingredients .   the spa industry in africa is soaring . it 's the fastest growing market for wellness tourism .   there is opportunity for beauty brands and resorts to showcase these traditions to the world .
