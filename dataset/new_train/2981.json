{"text": "nobody would have predicted this . a team coming off the back of a mediocre season with a newly-appointed , unheralded coach , sitting at the top of the italian serie a table after a run of nine successive victories . no team in european football has made a better start to the 2013-14 season than roma ; no team in italian football history has ever made a better start to a serie a season . a handful of vibrant new recruits and a wily old-timer have all combined to lift the club to the top of the table , with roma 's form attracting admiring glances from around the world .  what i really like about this roma team is that they play with a strong mentality ,  italian football expert tor-kristian karlsen told cnn .  they play with such intensity and have a winning mentality ,  added the former monaco chief executive . with many scratching their heads as to how this incredible run has been put together , cnn gives you five reasons why rudi garcia 's team are the toast of the continent . rudi garcia . garcia 's arrival at roma in june went largely unnoticed , the frenchman replacing aurelio andrezzoli after an unspectacular sixth-place finish in the 2012-13 campaign . the frenchman won the ligue 1 title with lille in 2011 , a team which featured players like gervinho -lrb- more on him later -rrb- and chelsea star eden hazard , but arguably garcia had flown under the radar of all but the most-discerning european football fans .  he has a very strong personality , he is very articulate and commands huge respect ,  french football expert philippe auclair told cnn .  i recently talked to hazard and he was speaking about chelsea manger jose mourinho 's insistence on taking care of defensive duties . he said that approach is similar to garcia and that speaks volumes about the thoroughness of his preparations .  garcia is one of a small band of french coaches to have worked in italy 's top division and the 49-year-old has faced his fair share of doubters during his first six months in rome .  his success has been a huge surprise ,  added auclair .  france has exported a lot of players to italy , but when he went to roma there was a negative reaction that this guy was a ` no-hoper ' .  garcia 's success is made all the more remarkable given the pressures which weigh on the shoulders of any roma coach . despite having left monaco earlier this year , karlsen remains in touch with former roma player and coach claudio ranieri , who is currently in charge at the ligue 1 club . the norwegian said :  ranieri told me that roma is probably the toughest job in the world given the pressure and focus from outside the club .  garcia has also done well to utilize the considerable talents of club captain francesco totti , a player who is idolized by the romanisti and whose exclusion from the side can result in uproar .  totti is a talisman for roma , but that also creates problems for any incoming coach ,  explained karlsen .  he is a god to the club 's fans and you would n't want to be the coach that ends his career . you 'd imagine that the other players look up to him and he is strong influence in the dressing room .  he is a leader , who is deeply attached to roma and wants the best for his team and city .  market trading . roma 's smart preseason trading has been another factor in their record-breaking start . argentine winger erik lamela and argentine-born italy striker pablo daniel osvaldo were both sold to english clubs , tottenham hotspur and southampton respectively , in big-money deals , giving roma scope to recruit some exciting talents . gervinho arrived from arsenal , while sturdy dutch midfielder kevin strootman --  made for italian football  according to karlsen -- was signed from psv eindhoven despite reported interest from manchester united . morgan de sanctis and medhi benatia are two new recruits who have helped make up a formidable defence , along with veteran brazilian right-back maicon . lamela has been replaced by adem llajic , a serb who joined roma from fiorentina and who has already scored three times in six appearances .  you have to praise the technical director walter sabatini -- and he deserves a lot of credit ,  added karlsen .  the first part of the transfer window they were just a selling club , but sabatini kept a cool head , bought the right players at the right price at the right moment having made a profit of 40 million euros .  a water tight defence . nine games played , nine games won and one goal conceded . parma are the only team to have breached europe 's meanest defence , taking the lead in a match roma went on to win 3-1 . goalkeeper de sanctis arrived from napoli for a modest $ 690,000 in july and he has enjoyed a near faultless start to his career in the italian capital , stationed behind the center back pairing of italian international federico balzaretti and morocco 's benatia . roma 's latest win , a 1-0 success at udinese , was proof of their defensive steel . down to 10 men , without the services of attacking talisman totti and in-form winger gervinho , roma ground out a 1-0 win to become the first visiting team to take three points from udine since september 2012 .  congratulations to my team-mates ,  said totti on his website after the match .  each one showed courage , strength and , as we say around here , two massive balls !  francesco totti . like the coliseum and the circus maximus , totti is an immovable monument on the landscape of the eternal city . the flamboyant attacker is roma 's captain and the definition of a one-club man . since making his debut in 1992 , totti has made 542 appearances for the giallorossi , scoring 230 goals . as roma 's official website says ,  the number 10 is without question the best player in the club 's history .  totti 's form this season has been imperious , with the veteran scoring three goals and contributing six assists . his standout performance of roma 's winning run came away at inter milan , where he found the net twice in a convincing 3-0 triumph . his performances have led to calls for him to return to the italy team for the first time since 2006 . his last match for the azzuri was the penalty shootout triumph over france in the 2006 world cup final , with current national coach cesare prandelli suggesting a fit and in-form totti would be a shoo-in for a place at brazil 2014 . gervinho . another attacking star of roma 's renaissance has been gervinho , the ivorian forward who has thus far proved to be a shrewd acquisition from english premier league team arsenal . gervinho 's two-year stay in england was largely unremarkable as he developed a reputation for missing chances . his preseason move to roma saw him reunited with rudi garcia , who was his coach during a successful stay in france with lille , and it has paid dividends . three goals and one assist from a player who managed just six premier league goals in his final season with arsenal is an impressive return , hinting that gervinho could be ready to fulfill the promise he showed during he and garcia 's first spell together .", "summary": " roma top serie a after winning opening nine
