{"text": "wood used as a biofuel could make air pollution worse and cause almost 1,400 deaths a year in europe , scientists have warned . trees grown as a biofuel have been seen as a greener , cleaner alternative to fossil fuels but could be having a detrimental effect on air quality . according to a new report they release a chemical into the air that , when mixed with other pollutants , can damage human health and reduce crop yields . the red hotspots show where deaths are expected to rise the most as a result of trees planted as biofuel crops . ` growing biofuels is thought to be a good thing because it reduces the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , ' said nick hewitt , who worked on the study with colleagues from at lancaster university . ` what we 're saying is  yes , that 's great , but biofuels could also have a detrimental effect on air quality . ` large-scale production of biofuels in europe would have small but significant effects on human mortality and crop yields . ` as far as we know , no one has looked at the air quality of growing biofuel crops before . ' the report , published in the journal nature climate change , looked into the impact of a european union scheme to slow climate change by producing more biofuels . a similar impact would be expected wherever biofuels were produced in large quantities in areas suffering air pollution , including the united states and china . poplar , willow or eucalyptus trees , all used as fast-growing sources of renewable wood fuel , emit high levels of the chemical isoprene as they grow , the study said . isoprene forms toxic ozone when mixed with other air pollutants in sunlight . the report estimated that ozone from wood-based energy to meet the european union 's 2020 goal would cause nearly 1,400 premature deaths a year , costing society # 4.4 billion -lrb- $ 7.1 bn -rrb- . the european plan would also reduce the annual value of wheat and maize production by # 900 million -lrb- $ 1.5 bn -rrb- since ozone impairs crop growth , the study added . changes in monthly mean ozone levels in july caused by trees grown for biofuel . red shows the highest rises . air pollution from extra isoprene is likely to reduce wheat and maize crops . red indicates the worst hit areas . other scientists said the findings showed that the impact of biofuels on human health needs to be taken into consideration when planning crops . but they said it is one of many factors and that the advantages of replacing fossil fuels with biofuels should not be ignored . dr angela karp , scientific director of the cropping carbon institute programme , rothamsted research , did not see the study 's findings being a reason to reverse the uk 's biofuels policies . ` it is well known that many trees emit isoprene and efforts have been placed on reducing this , ' she said . ` we have flagged this up as a target for research , pointing out that reducing isoprene emissions from willow would not only reduce greenhouse gases but reduce loss of carbon from the plant . ` having said that , at least one previous publication i know of does not suggest that the levels harm air quality . ` for all these reasons we do not see that the uk needs to reconsider its interest in biofuels . ' wheat is one of the crops likely to suffer a fall in yield . prof ottoline leyser , of the university of cambridge , added : ` there are many different biofuel crops , cultivation methods , production and processing systems post-harvest , and different final biofuels . ` each one has advantages and disadvantages , which must be compared to the advantages and disadvantages of alternative options . ` the key is to ensure that the policies driving biofuel development and adoption are properly formulated to take account of these complexities . ' siting new biofuel plantations far away from polluted population centres would help limit ozone formation , the study suggested . genetic engineering might be used to reduce isoprene emissions , it said . ozone can cause lung problems and is blamed for killing about 22,000 people a year in europe . overall air pollution , mainly from fossil fuels , causes about 500,000 premature deaths in europe a year , according to the european environment agency . he noted that the main reason to shift to biofuels was to cut emissions of carbon dioxide , mainly from fossil fuels , that u.n. studies project will become ever more damaging this century . the united nations ' world health organization estimates global warming has caused more than 140,000 deaths annually worldwide since the 1970s . the biggest impact was recorded in developing nations where floods , droughts and other disasters blamed on climate change left millions of people suffering from diarrhoea , malnutrition , malaria and dengue fever . burning biofuels is viewed as neutral for climate change because plants soak up carbon when they grow and release it when they burn or rot . fossil fuels , by contrast , add carbon to the atmosphere from underground stores millions of years old .", "summary": " isoprene released by trees can produce oxone in the atmosphere .   fast-growing trees ideal as biofuels produce high levels of isoprene .   emissions expected to reduce wheat and maize production by # 900,000 .
