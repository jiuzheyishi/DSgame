{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- climbers conquer everest . runners complete the marathon . and globe-trotters master the ultralonghaul flight . amazing advances in technology now let nonstop flights fly farther and cheaper for airlines than ever before . many follow routes that take them near the north pole as they whip over the top of the globe to the other side of the world . but these giant intercontinental leaps present their own challenges : how do passengers and pilots deal with annoying and potentially dangerous fatigue that comes with marathon air travel ? how do twin-engine planes figure into the future of longhauls ? let 's start with the king of nonstop flights : singapore airlines flights 21 and 22 between singapore and newark , new jersey . the route is the longest both in distance -- about 9,500 miles -- and in time -- about 19 hours . business traveler charles yap is a big fan of this route because it avoids a connection in germany , which he says saves six hours . all 100 seats aboard the flight are business class . add hundreds of in-flight movie choices , and longhaul travel is n't so bad for this discovery channel executive .  if you 're stuck on a flight , you might as well enjoy it ,  says yap , 39 . his long-distance travel tips for surviving 19 hours aloft :  walk around . explore the cabin . do n't force yourself to sleep .  ah yesssssssss , ssssssssslumber . conversations with ultralonghaulers inevitably will turn to the subject of sleep . specifically , avoiding jet lag .  you should try on the day before to get on the same clock as your destination ,  advises chris uriarte , 36 , an american express exec who 's flown the route about a dozen times .  for long west-to-east flights -- a day or two before you leave , start moving your bedtime earlier in the evening . for long east-to-west flights , try to delay sleep until late at night . planning ahead makes you a lot more productive when you hit the ground .  uriarte should know . he logs more than 200,000 flight miles a year . your seating position on the plane is  absolutely key ,  to a good longhaul , uriarte says . singapore uses airbus a340s with a spacious 1-2-1 seating configuration . the back two rows are even better with 1-1-1 seating . in general , uriarte recommends aisle seats in the center section . sleeping is easier when  there 's no one climbing over you ,  he says . seats behind the plane 's four wing-mounted engines will be louder , but some travelers enjoy being lulled to sleep by the jet noise . ` dr. sleepgood ' sleep is curt graeber 's business . during his 19 years as boeing 's chief engineer for human factors , pilots nicknamed graeber  dr. sleepgood  because he helped them manage fatigue on longhaul flights .  buy a seat that has a bed , and you 're fine ,  graeber says with a chuckle . -lrb- the price tag -- often thousands of dollars -- is the real challenge . -rrb- sleeping in a coach seat is no easy feat , graeber acknowledges . try to sleep at the time when your body is asleep , he says , although  that 's not always possible .  and avoid eating a heavy meal . for the traveler , avoiding exhaustion is nice if you can swing it . for pilots , it 's critical . longhaul passenger tips . -- do n't be a clock watcher . -- wear loose clothing . -- stretch your legs . -- take off your shoes . -- brush teeth every few hours to freshen your mouth . -- use noise-canceling headphones , pillows , neck rests , moisturizer , eyedrops . source : singapore airlines passengers . graeber ran a 1989 nasa/federal aviation administration study that recommended allowing u.s. pilots to catnap in the cockpit -- but only under supervision of another pilot . cockpit napping is allowed for pilots in europe , canada , australia , new zealand and elsewhere . it 's been accepted by the international civil aviation organization . the faa wo n't allow it .  longhaul flights require relief crews ,  the faa said in a written statement to cnn .  rest is provided outside the cockpit . the faa does not permit napping in the cockpit on u.s. air carriers .  the faa 's rejection of cockpit napping  does n't makes any sense ,  graeber says .  everyone i talk to who uses it says it 's an important stopgap measure to improve safety and reduce sleep loss .  related : uk probes whether pilots fell asleep . national transportation safety board investigators said they were concerned that pilot fatigue was a factor in july 's deadly crash landing of asiana airlines flight 214 , a boeing 777 which caught fire on a san francisco runway after a 10-hour flight from south korea . the ntsb has not yet issued a final report on the reasons behind the crash . international longhaul pilot justin schlechter says he 's seen the effects of flight fatigue firsthand .  it 's tough ,  schlechter admits .  it affects your reasoning surrounding your flying and the speed that your brain processes information .  schlechter predicts that the faa eventually will reverse itself and allow cockpit catnaps .  the international standard allows it ,  he says .  i think it 's safer to take a controlled catnap . i 'm in favor of it .  here 's what u.s. longhaul pilots are allowed to do to manage fatigue : . typically , during a 14-hour flight , the captain and first officer will fly the first three hours . then , they hand off the plane to a second crew and get some rest in a special compartment -- or in reserved seats in the passenger cabin . during the cruise portion of the longhaul , pilots use various methods to keep sharp , such as checking fuel consumption and navigation , adjusting the ventilation , turning up cockpit lighting and engaging in energetic discussions with the other pilot . every three hours , the two crews will switch off command of the cockpit until about 90 minutes before landing , when the captain and first officer will land the aircraft . twin-engine longhaulers . so , those are some of the ultralonghaul challenges for humans . as for the machines -- they have their own hurdles . obviously over vast oceans it 's critically important for airliner engines to be reliable and powerful . but hey , it 's a business , so the engines also have to be efficient enough to keep airline fuel costs low . the twin-engine boeing 777 holds the long-distance commercial airliner record . in 2005 it flew 13,423 miles from hong kong to london . total time : 22 hours , 22 minutes . decades ago , that meant ultralonghaulers were likely four-engine planes , like the 747 . in the unlikely event that an engine failed , the other three engines could power the plane the rest of the trip , no problem . the downside : four engines guzzle a lot of fuel .  now , engines are way more reliable ,  says travel expert and former airline manager brett snyder of crankyflier.com . they 're also more powerful and fuel-saving . that 's why boeing 's twin-engine 777 worldliner flies so many of the world 's longest nonstop routes . in the coming years look for newer wide-bodies to fly more longhaul routes , like boeing 's twin-engine 787 dreamliner and the twin-engine airbus a350 xwb . both aircraft are made with superlightweight materials which also cut down on fuel costs . already , united airlines has announced its dreamliners will begin 14-hour nonstop service from san francisco to chengdu , china . british airways plans to use the plane for a 10-hour nonstop from austin , texas , to london . the faa requires twin-engine planes to fly within close reach of a safe landing spot , in case of engine trouble . some travelers seem intrigued by the idea that an airliner can fly in a straight line with only one engine .  would n't the thrust from the engine be unbalanced and make the plane fly in circles ?  they ask . if a 777 lost one of its two engines , the plane has a computer that automatically adjusts the aircraft 's controls to compensate for unbalanced thrust . pilots flying other airliners may have to manually adjust the plane to compensate . how reliable are those engines ?  we 've never seen an issue where a twin-engine plane has lost one engine during a transoceanic flight and ca n't make it somewhere with the other engine ,  says snyder .  and engines almost never fail . with high reliability , airlines are free to look at economics and say , ` why would we have aircraft with four engines when we can have one that performs the same mission with two and save us money ? '  what killed the longest flight in the world ? in fact , money is exactly what 's being blamed for killing the longest flight in the world . that 's right -- after nine years of service , singapore airlines flights 21 and 22 are scheduled for cancellation . snyder and most other experts suspect the airline got tired of dealing with poor profit margins on the fuel-guzzling four-engine airbus a340 .  they do use a ton of fuel , and that 's always painful ,  says snyder .  but the schedule advantage is n't that great either when you fly so far .  also , the world 's second-longest nonstop -- a singapore airlines 18-hour flight between singapore and lax -- is scheduled to be canceled this month . that will leave qantas flight 7 , a boeing 747 from sydney to dallas , atop the list of world 's longest nonstops by distance , at 8,600 miles . the longest nonstop by time will be delta 's flight 201 -- a 777 from atlanta to johannesburg which clocks in at about 17 hours . fans of the singapore-newark flight say they 'll miss its spacious seats and well-trained flight attendants . on a singapore passenger website , commenter buster ct1k -- tongue firmly in cheek -- called the airline 's decision to cancel the flight a  very sad day in the history of aerospace and aviation . first , man stops going to the moon . then the space shuttle stops flying . then concorde stops flying . and now this . i will miss the newark-singapore nonstop very much .  the way amex exec uriarte sees it , for now , the airline industry appears to have pushed the longhaul envelope to the maximum .  that 's about as long as we 're going to get ,  he says .  the days of the 19-hour flight are over .  cnn 's mike ahlers contributed to this report .", "summary": " world 's longest nonstop flight -lrb- 19 hours -rrb- linking singapore and newark canceled .   veteran passengers , pilots and a sleep expert offer tips for ultralonghaul airline flights .   many countries allow cockpit catnaps to stave off fatigue during long flights .   more twin-engine planes are flying long routes because of powerful , reliable engines .
