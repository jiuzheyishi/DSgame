' i have always loved dogs and always wanted a dog but as an actress it can be tricky to juggle time and commitments , ' she added . ` but i decided i just could n't wait a minute longer and looked into re - homing an older animal because they are always the hardest to home . ' she had read about dust on the safe rescue website and says she knew instantly he was the one for her . ` when i read what dust had been through , i just felt strongly he was the one so i phoned safe rescue and asked if i could come and meet him .
