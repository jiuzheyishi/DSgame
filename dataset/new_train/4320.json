{"text": "the near daily stream of violence in iraq is a bitter reminder that the country is still far away from stabilizing and that the sunni-shiite divide , which has led to over 6000 deaths in 2013 , appears wider than ever . despite this climate of uncertainty and destruction , iraq 's top energy official told cnn that the country 's oil production will continue to climb -- reaching at least 3.5 million barrels a day by the end of the year . hussain al-shahristani , the deputy prime minister for energy , said two new fields in southern iraq , near nasiriyah and basra , have revved up production .  these two fields will add between them 300 thousand barrels . there 's extra production from the other fields so when you add them up you will get to 3.5 , 3.6 million barrels a day by the end of the year ,  shahristani told me during a one-on-one interview at the gulf intelligence conference in dubai . iraq has had difficulty managing expectations over the past few years . the original plan was to hit 6 million barrels a day by the end of this year , double that level by 2020 at the latest . those forecasts have been ratcheted down significantly with the government 's so-called revised integrated strategy . shahristani said baghdad needed to decide whether to front load production or set a more realistic target that will allow fields to produce more crude over the next two decades .  we decided to go for the second option to maximize recovery rather than hit the highest possible production in a short time ,  he said . iraq was criticized within energy circles for signing service contracts that gives international energy giants a production fee of just $ 1.15 - $ 2.50 a barrel , instead of production sharing agreements that give the majors a percentage of overall production . shahristani admits that strategy has forced a rethink and in some cases a revising of existing contracts .  i would confess that our contracts have been very tight , perhaps the toughest the oil companies had to deal with ,  he said .  we want the oil companies to make a good profit in iraq and that is why we are willing to reconsider those contracts ,  he added . the climate with its international partners is improving and iraq is confident it can now deliver a sizable level of production capacity by the end of the decade . it has committed to just over 9 million barrels a day , which would put the country in the league of saudi arabia and russia -- currently the two largest producers in the world . the international energy agency in paris has expressed reservations , suggesting iraq will be producing 6 million barrels in that time frame .  all i will say , at this point , is that iraq has signed contracts with the largest international oil companies who have the best know-how in this field ,  shahristani said .  and they have very strong financial muscle , if they say they can do it , they can do it .  further , he added , they are bound by contract to do so . according to bp 's 2013 statistical review of world energy , iraq sits on 143 billion barrels of crude , 9 % of global proven reserves . oil executives say there is plenty more to be found , with some 300 potential sites in the southwest of the country still not explored . there is speculation that thawing relations between tehran and washington could see a partial lifting of economic sanctions on iran , which has cut production by 1.5 million barrels a day . the deputy pm said he is hopeful negotiations will proceed in good faith , but does not expect downward pressure on prices as a result . however , he said , it was yet to be seen if that would reflect on oil production in the short term .  i personally doubt 2014 will give sufficient time even if sanctions are relaxed ,  he noted .", "summary": " the violence in iraq is a reminder the country is far from stable , but oil production is set to rise this year .   its forecasts have previously been ratcheted down and more realistic targets set .   deputy pm hussain al-shahristani said new fields would add to production .   thawing relations between tehran and washington could assist in this .
