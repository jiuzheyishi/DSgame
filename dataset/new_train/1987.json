{"text": "the u.s. should adapt to a european model in the workplace in order to halt global warming , a study says . by working less hours per week and take longer vacations the american people could reduce carbon emissions , think tank center for economic policy and research claim . if the ` western european ' working model was to be adopted in the u.s. , it could reduce up to 50 per cent of the addressable global temperature rise expected by 2100 . time off for the climate : american can help fight climate change by taking on the ` european model ' of working less hours per week . there is a documented link between a shorter work week and lower levels of carbon emissions , which is at the centre of the research by the washington think tank . as productivity grows in western civilisations , as well as developing countries , the study analyses the gains from the resulting increase in consumption versus the possible loss as a result of fewer working hours . it concludes that a developing country expanding at a high rate should chose the ` european ' model in order to keep greenhouse emissions at bay . it adds that an american switch to the ` european ' system could have a significant impact on global warming . the research paper estimates that a change could ` eliminate about one-quarter to one-half ' of global warming which is not already in the atmosphere , and would have particular effect if adapted by workplaces that consume high levels of energy , such as factories . green time : by taking more vacations , american families can help the environment -lrb- file photo -rrb- . travelling time : the reduction in emissions would mainly derive from lowering the productivity in workplaces which use a lot of energy , such as in factories , but also by less commuting . ` the relationship between -lsb- shorter work and lower emissions -rsb- is complex and not clearly understood , but it is understandable that lowering levels of consumption , holding everything else constant , would reduce greenhouse gas emissions , ' the study 's author , economist david rosnick , writes . he concludes that some climate change is inevitable , but adds that the amount of which is ` very much under our control ' . ` in addition to reducing emissions by other means , a significant reduction in climate change is possible by choosing a more european response to productivity gains rather than following a model more like that of the united states . ' in the ` best case scenario ' americans would begin working about 0.5 per cent less each year , starting with a 10-hour reduction in 2013 , which could prevent an increase of up to 1.3 degrees . ` we can get a similar amount of work done as productivity and technology improves , ' rosnick says . ` it 's something we have to decide as a country -- there are economic models in which individuals get to decide their hours and are still similarly productive as they are now . ' however the study does not take into consideration what people would do with the increased leisure time , and although it says fewer working hours will help , it could be cancelled out if it would mean an increase in holidays with extensive travelling .", "summary": " shorter hours and more vacations could help the environment .   by working 0.5 per cent less each year , americans can prevent a temperature rise of up to 1.3 degrees .
