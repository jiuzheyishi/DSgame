{"text": "foreign chefs , bricklayers and tilers will no longer require a sponsor to work in australia come july in a bid by the federal government to fill labour and skills shortages . the three professions have been added to the skilled occupation list which means workers do not have to be sponsored by employers for a permanent visa . but the move has been slammed by unions who say the government should be looking out for domestic workers instead of encouraging more overseas workers to come to australia . foreign chefs will no longer have to be sponsored to come work in australia from july 1 . the changes were made following advice from the australian workforce and productivity agency based on labour market , education and training , migration and general economic and demographic data , and stakeholder submissions . assistant minister for immigration and border protection michaelia cash said australian residents would always come first . ` the abbott government believes that where there is an australian who is ready , willing and able to do the job , they should always be considered first , ' she said . ` however , it would be simplistic to say that there is always an australian willing and available to fill a particular position in various geographical locations within australia , and it is the role of the skilled migration program to fill the gap where such shortages exist . ` it is important to remember that a business that is forced to close due to an inability to source vital skilled labour is a business that employs no-one . ' a department of immigration spokesman said figures indicated chefs have been in shortage for the past 10 years , which threatens the sustainability of the hospitality and tourism industry . he also said the vacancy rate for the sector was more than four times the national average , according to industry experts . the union who represents chefs is united voice and its acting national secretary david o'byrne said he was ` very concerned ' about the move . ` we do n't think labour issues within the industry need for this to occur , ' he said . ` the hospitality industry is very good at and easily able to attract staff through the industry . ' mr o'byrne said instead of going overseas for jobs the government should be investing in training and furthering career paths . ` in the era of masterchef are you telling me there are n't people who do n't want to become chefs ? it just does n't make sense , ' he said . tilers and bricklayers have also been added to the skilled occupation list that currently has 188 jobs on it . bricklayers and tilers have also been included on the list because of a predicted increase in demand coupled with a fall in apprenticeship completions . based on 2012 projections by the department of employment , there will be a 13.4 per cent increase in the number of people employed as bricklayers over five years to november 2017 and a 17.3 per cent increase in the number of people employed as tilers occupation over the same period of time . michaelia cash , the assistant minister for immigration , hopes it will help address the skills shortage in these industries . but construction , forestry , mining and energy union 's david noonan said the abbott government 's reasoning for adding the three occupations to the list were unfounded . ` in particular the building trades that the government intend to put back on the list are trades where there are no shortages and even the master builders association have acknowledged that , ' he said . ` it seems that the coalition again is putting the australian workers ' interest last . ` rather than ramping up migration in these areas they should be addressing the collapse in apprentice numbers in these trades . ` it 's extraordinary the government would do this would do this based on the evidence and to the people who pay their wages . ' the number of skilled workers to be taken in under the program has been capped at 43,990 . to ensure these industries are not dominated by overseas workers , a ceiling cap of six per cent of the workforce is enforced for all industries , but the chef workforce will be dropped to three per cent for six months from july 1 and will then be reviewed . the department 's spokesman said it would increase if no ` adverse behaviour ' was identified . currently there are 188 jobs on the skilled occupation list - including accountants , social workers , psychotherapists , fitter and turners , stonemasons and teachers . david noonan of the cfmeu says the government was not looking after australian workers by introducing the move .", "summary": " the three professions have been added to the skilled occupation list .   it means they can come to australia without an employer 's sponsorship .   the federal government says it will address labour and skills shortages .   but construction union says no evidence that there is a employee shortfall .
