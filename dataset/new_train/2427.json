{"text": "what is life like for the men who build dubai 's skyscrapers ? human rights groups have repeatedly drawn attention to the low wages and living conditions of the emirate 's corps of foreign workers -lrb- mostly from south and southeast asia -rrb- , but there have been few attempts to scratch the surface of their everyday life beyond the construction sites . a new documentary that opened in dubai cinemas this week is hoping to change all that .  champ of the camp  chronicles an annual singing competition that takes place in dubai 's labor camps . like many of the city 's migrant workers , the subjects put up with long working days , relative isolation and inhospitable weather so they can send money back home ; sometimes to children awaiting school fees or daughters awaiting dowries .  camp ka champ  -lrb- the hindi name applied to the contest -rrb- offers them a rare bit of respite and the chance to earn cash prizes .  the money i send back home to my family is how they make ends meet . it has n't been easy ; sometimes i feel i have no life ,  admits one contestant featured in the film . western union is the official sponsor of the competition . according to rupa vinod , the managing director at right track , the advertising agency that set up the contest , the uae represents one of the largest markets for the money transfer firm . many laborers use their services bi-monthly to send remittances .  while there 's not a commercial angle to the contest , it does help build loyalty with the brand ,  vinod admits .  people -lrb- in the camps -rrb- might trust the brand a little bit more now that it 's closer to them .  likened to  american idol  with a bollywood twist , champ of the camp has become increasingly popular over the years . when it launched in 2006 , only 100 contenders auditioned . last year , 3,000 applied . first-place winners take home aed10 ,000 -lrb- $ 2,722 -rrb- , other contestants can win items like tvs and home appliances . though the subject of labor camps can be somewhat touchy in dubai , with many expats living comparatively gilded lives at the expense of the city 's migrant workers , there seems to be a lot of curiosity about how these men -- squirreled away into tower blocks on the fringes of the city -- live their daily lives . more than 1,200 viewers turned up at the film 's premiere at the dubai international film festival .  the dubai public has a curiosity about the men who built the city for them ,  explains mahmoud kaabour , the film 's director .  many people live here for years and enjoy the champagne lifestyle without ever knowing how the other half have come to be here or what kind of lives they have ,  he adds . one of the more touching story lines in the film follows adnan , a pakistani worker who helped construct the burj khalifa .  he could always see it in the remote distance , but he never walked along the fountains , or enjoyed its restaurants or went up to see its viewing deck ,  says kaabour , who took him back to the site during filming .  he stared at the tower and gave a really poignant reflection on what life in the burj might be like compared to life in the camps . it was one of the critical scenes in the movie , and it really excited viewers .  at the end of the premiere , movie 's characters took to the stage and performed a live concert , eliciting a standing ovation from the crowd . in a rare moment of engagement , many viewers hugged the participants and posed in photos with them . despite the movie 's popularity and critical acclaim , the journey from film festival to cinemas has been a financial struggle , and unless kaabour gets more funding for his project , the likelihood it will last past this week is remote .  the uae is a tremendously expensive place to film ,  says eva sayre , the film 's producer .  we were able to get a couple of grants , but otherwise , the entire thing came out of our own pockets .  in hopes of raising enough money for marketing and distribution , sayre and kaabour have launched a crowd-funding campaign through aflamnah , a middle east version of kickstarter .  we want the general public to hear the laborers tell their stories and to know who they are , but we also want to invite further pondering about the labor camp institutions ,  says kaabour .  we hope we cracked a dialogue that 's going to go a bit further now that the film has hit cinemas .
