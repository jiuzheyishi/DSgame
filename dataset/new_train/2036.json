{"text": "i 'm in a room built for laughter and i 'm fighting the urge to faint . or vomit . or at least dab at the beads of sweat forming on my upper lip . if you 're not great with small spaces , then an anechoic chamber probably is n't an ideal place to conduct an interview . barely large enough to fit two chairs , with every surface covered in foam wedges and a tv bolted to the wall , the sound-proof bunker has the unnerving appearance of an apocalyptic big brother diary room . it 's the type of place where nobody could hear you scream -- and that 's exactly the point . this echo-free room is where university college london scientist sophie scott has been recording laughter , in an effort to find out what makes us giggle and why .  i do n't like coming in here , it makes my head feel thick , like i 've got a load of blankets dropped on me ,  said the 46-year-old professor of cognitive neuroscience , as we sit down to talk about her work .  this is where we record a lot of our emotional stimuli . we try to make people laugh in here , which is something of a challenge . we 've also made people cry in here , so that was a day in the park -- crying in an anechoic chamber , the perfect storm ,  says scott before adding her own cheerful chuckle , her large cartoon moon earrings jangling in agreement . laugh out loud . how do you send someone into stitches , in such an uncomfortable environment ? youtube clips help -- that 's where the tv comes in . but the best trick is being with friends . in fact , we 're 30 times more likely to laugh when we 're with other people , according to scott . as part of their experiments , scott and her team recorded two types of laughter in the anechoic chamber -- real , uncontrollable whooping , and posed , deliberate , chuckling . they then played the recordings to over 1,000 people while scanning their brains with fmri .  when people heard the posed laughter , there was more activation in brain areas associated with ` mentalizing ' tasks -- ie . trying to work out what someone else is thinking ,  said scott .  real laughter was much less ambiguous than posed laughter -- if someone is really laughing hard , it 's easy to understand what they are doing .  they also found men and women processed laughter in much the same way .  we have a myth that women and men use communication very differently -- that men are n't emotional and women are somewhat too emotional ,  said scott .  it 's not the case .  standup scientist . scott is a woman of infectious merriment . her conversation is sprinkled with warm chortles , and even the message alert on her phone is a cackle . as a child growing up in lancashire in the north west of england , she was surrounded by parents who were  big laughers ,  and recalls them singing silly songs to the point of hysterics . unsurprising then , that the mother-of-one calls herself a  standup scientist ,  performing with the university 's bright club -- a group of researchers using comedy to deliver their message on stage .  it was one of the most terrifying things i 've ever done , but i 've completely got the bug for it now , because it 's such an interesting way to approach your work ,  said scott . ada lovelace . this week scott will again be taking to the stage to help mark ada lovelace day , in honor of the 19th century female mathematician , often credited as the world 's first computer programmer . scott will be one of many prominent female scientists , engineers , and technologists talking about their work at imperial college london .  it 's still a case that on the whole , the stereotype of the scientist is the gray beard , white coat man in a laboratory -- and of course , that 's not true ,  said scott .  one of the important things to remember about women in science is actually , there 's loads of them . it 's just that we lose them , we do n't value them as much , we do n't think they count in the same way .  indeed , yale researchers have found potential employers still view young male scientists more favorably than their female counterparts . universal language . for scott , laughter is more than displaying amusement -- it 's a primal way of showing people that we like them and want them to like us .  laughter is the only positive emotion we found to be cross-culturally recognized . it does n't matter where you are in the world , it 's a sound that people recognize ,  she said .  interestingly enough , it 's not constrained to humans . chimpanzees laugh , orangutangs laugh , even rats laugh .  scott pointed to studies done by u.s. scientist jaak panksepp , who found that rats made the same high-pitched  laughing  sound when they were playing , as when they were being tickled . such is the bonding power of laughter that it can even help make or break a relationship , as scott explains :  some of the things scientists are finding is couples who manage stressful situations with positive affect -- laughter -- are the people who stay together longer .   comedian victor borge said ` laughter is the shortest distance between two people . ' i think what borge was getting at was the intimacy of laughter . it 's an expression of closeness .
