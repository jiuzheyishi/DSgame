{"text": "tough stance : mark harper , conservative mp for forest of dean , has said limiting access to free healthcare is key to preventing the nhs becoming an ` international health service ' migrants from romania and bulgaria who travel to britain without a job are to be told they must have private medical insurance to prevent the nhs becoming an ` international health service ' . immigration minister mark harper told the daily mail that limiting access to free healthcare is seen as key to preventing a fresh influx of migrants when controls are lifted at the end of this year . he suggested the requirement for medical insurance would apply to all student incomers and those who claim they are ` self-sufficient ' , meaning they are not coming looking immediately for work . ministers are also examining incomers ' rights to benefits and other public services . other measures under discussion include requiring migrants to leave britain if they fail to secure a job after three months -- or can not prove they have sufficient funds to support themselves for at least six months . transitional arrangements in place since 2005 , which restrict the rights of 29million bulgarian and romanian citizens to live and work in other eu states , will expire on january 1 . no official figure has been put on the anticipated number of arrivals , but tory mps warn there must be no repeat of the situation when poland joined the eu and labour catastrophically underestimated the numbers that would come . a significant influx of immigrants from the two former communist regimes could derail the conservatives ' testing target of reducing net immigration to under 100,000 by 2015 . campaign group migrationwatch has claimed as many as 250,000 people could arrive in the uk from romania and bulgaria over the next five years , though ministers do not believe there will necessarily be an influx of that size since other eu countries are lifting restrictions at the same time . mr harper , who is chairing a new cross-government committee examining measures to deter incomers who would be a burden , said : ` we are all clear we need an immigration system that works in the national interest . that is why we are bringing together colleagues from other departments to address the pull factors that drive immigration to the uk . ` european nationals do not have unrestricted access to the uk -- they must be exercising their treaty rights . this means they must be working , studying or self-sufficient . we already have tough rules on access to benefits ; we need to see if there is more we can do to tighten them up . ` in addition , eu students and those that are self-sufficient should not be a burden on the host member state , which means they should have things like health insurance . we have a national health service , not an international health service . ' it is unclear how the proposals would work in practice but it is likely nhs staff would be asked to check healthcare entitlements when migrants first came into contact with the nhs . immigration : transitional arrangements in place since 2005 , which restrict the rights of 29million bulgarian and romanian citizens to live and work in other eu states , will expire on january 1 . but restrictions on access to free healthcare are likely to run into opposition from some doctors , who resent the idea they should act as another branch of the immigration service . ministers insist britain must have the right to address ` pull factors ' that are blamed for attracting jobless migrants from the eu . areas being looked at include healthcare , education , housing and benefits . the nhs has written off debts of at least # 35million incurred by foreign national patients since 2002 . as well as restrictions on students and non-working migrants from the eu , ministers are understood to be considering making non-eu migrants have health insurance before being granted a visa . downing street said the government was determined to prevent potential damage to the labour market from a fresh influx of migrants , but acknowledged britain will have to operate within eu rules on the right to free movement . the government is also examining the idea of an ad campaign telling potential migrants in romania and bulgaria that british streets are not necessarily ` paved with gold ' .", "summary": " migrants need health insurance to stop nhs becoming ` international ' service .   mp mark harper said requirement would be for self-sufficient and students .   ministers examining rights to other public services and benefits .
