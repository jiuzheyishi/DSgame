{"text": "the uk pays almost # 1billion a year to cover the healthcare costs of britons who fall ill on the continent -- but receives only a fraction of that for nhs treatment of european visitors . official figures show that last year taxpayers handed # 903.4 million to european governments and insurance providers to pay for the care of britons . but the nhs managed to collect only # 48.7 million from the same european countries to pay for the care of their citizens who fall ill here . health secretary jeremy hunt promised to ` shake up the system ' to ensure fairness . it means that for every # 18 the uk sends to europe to pay for healthcare , it gets only # 1 back . the figures underline how ineffective nhs hospitals are at clawing back money they are owed compared with those in europe , amid claims that ` health tourism ' costs british taxpayers billions a year . many nhs trusts do not even keep records of debt . health secretary jeremy hunt promised to make hospitals improve . ` our nhs processes to collect money from visitors are n't good enough , ' he said . ` that is why we are going to radically shake up the system to ensure we get fairness . ' earlier this month cancer specialist professor j meirion thomas warned of a ` massive and escalating problem ' of foreigners travelling to britain for cancer , hiv , kidney and infertility treatment , then leaving without paying . he said the nhs was also becoming the ` world 's maternity wing ' as expectant mothers arrive just to give birth without paying . experts have warned of europeans travelling to the uk to get free treatment for cancer , hiv , kidney and infertility treatment . some of the disparity in the figures , obtained with a freedom of information request , is because more british pensioners retire to the continent than those from the eu here . igures were not available to show the overall number of european visitors to the uk compared with britons going abroad . but there are 1.4 million migrant workers from the eu here , against 330,000 britons employed in other european countries . in 2011/12 , the uk paid ireland # 368million for treating britons who fell ill there , but only # 23million came back the other way . some # 247million was paid to spain , but just # 3.2 million came back . france received # 197million and returned # 6.3 million . italy got # 11million and sent back # 850,000 , and greece collected # 8million and returned # 500,000 . julia manning , of the think-tank . 2020health , said : ` the fact that the nhs fails to keep proper records of . overseas visitors who come here from the eu is indicative of two . problems : the reluctance of staff to think of the nhs as a business that . should be run as efficiently as possible , and a system which depends on . governments chasing reimbursement , rather than visitors paying up . front . ' robert oxley , of the taxpayers ' alliance , said : ` this is an incredible amount of taxpayers ' money leaving the nhs at a time when budgets are tight . it 's vital that checks are in place . ' the department of health highlighted the issue of pensioners . those who retire on the continent are classed as ` non-permanent residents ' , meaning eu countries can claim payment for their healthcare . the department said : ` the nhs is not there to serve the health needs of the world and we will not tolerate abuse of the system . ` last year we began a review to address concerns about access , cut down abuse and consider how best to ensure those who should pay do so . we are looking at a range of proposals .
