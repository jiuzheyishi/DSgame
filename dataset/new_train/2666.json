{"text": "hong kong for the majority of people in the west banking is as easy as walking to a local branch or atm , or logging into their account from a computer . but for millions in developing countries , even having a bank account is out of reach . in india , at least , that could be about to change . vodafone india and icici bank , india 's largest private bank , have launched m-pesa , a mobile-based money transfer and payment service that was first established in kenya in 2007 . the partnership , announced in a news release april 17 , claims it will give mobile-banking access to some 700 million indian people who are currently  unbanked  -- people with no access to conventional banking services like bank branches and atms . vodafone says service will first rollout in india 's eastern regions , including kolkata and west bengal , with 8,300 agents . that part of india is home to about 220 million people . service will eventually be extended across the rest of the country . the m-pesa system -- where  m  stands for mobile and  pesa  is the swahili word for money -- begins with real cash and an m-pesa agent . a customer signs up , registers a personal mobile phone number and deposits money into the linked account at an agent store , which could be a mobile phone shop , a gas station or a supermarket . to send money , the user inputs a recipient 's mobile phone number , the amount of money to send and a security code for protection . to withdraw funds , the receiver visits an m-pesa agent and requests a withdrawal through his or her mobile phone . both the receiver and the m-pesa agent then receive a confirmation for withdrawal , which instructs the agent to give the customer cash . bills can be paid and mobile talk time can also be bought through the platform .  for millions of people in india , a mobile phone is a bank account , a front door to a micro-business or a lifeline to people in the remotest areas ,  said marten pieters , managing director and ceo of vodafone india .  research shows that m-pesa brings real benefits to users in their daily lives , saving three hours a week of their time and around $ 3 in money transfer costs -- a significant amount to people in some areas .  greater cell phone penetration also brings greater economic benefit to local economies , often far removed from urban centers in large developing countries . a 2006 university of michigan study found that every 10 % increase in cell phone penetration grows the local economy by 0.6 % . in 2011 , india alone added 142 million new mobile phone subscriptions -- twice as many as in the whole of africa , and more than in europe , the middle east and the former soviet republics combined , according to the international telecommunication union -lrb- itu -rrb- in a june 2012 report . between 2000 and 2011 , india recorded an enormous boom in cell phone subscriptions -- growing from just 3.5 million to more than 893 million . in that same time , china saw mobile phone subscriptions increase more than ten-fold to more than 986 million subscriptions . the united states saw growth of just 87 % over the same dozen years to 290 million , says the itu .", "summary": " vodafone india announced launch of m-pesa , a mobile phone based banking service .   m-pesa was first established in kenya in 2007 as a way to transfer money and pay bills .   vodafone says 700mn indians are  unbanked  , with no access to traditional bank services .   in 2011 , india had 986mn mobile phone subscriptions , second largest after china .
