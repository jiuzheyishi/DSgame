{"text": "two huge radio telescopes have given scientists a rare look beneath the surface of the moon . radar signals beamed from the arecibo observatory in puerto rico -- the world 's largest radio dish , with a diameter of 1,000 feet -- penetrated deep into the moon . they then bounced back and were detected by the green bank telescope in west virginia , the planet 's biggest , fully steerable radio telescope at 330 feet wide . a lunar impact crater known as aristillus . the dark 多 halo 多 surrounding the crater is due to pulverized debris beyond the rugged , radar-bright rim deposits . the crater is approximately 55 kilometers -lrb- 34 miles -rrb- in diameter and 3.5 kilometers -lrb- 2 miles -rrb- deep . to make these images , radar signals beamed from arecibo 's powerful transmitter penetrated far below the moon 's dusty surface . the signals then rebounded back and were picked up by the sensitive receivers on the gbt . this observing technique , known as bistatic radar , has been used to study many objects in our solar system , including asteroids and other planets . researchers use this technique , called bistatic radar , to study many solar system objects , from asteroids to other planets . in this case , it revealed subsurface details in two lunar locales , the sea of serenity and a crater called aristillus . scientists were able to peer 33 to 50 feet beneath the sea of serenity , which is near the site where nasa 's final manned lunar effort , the apollo 17 mission , touched down in december 1972 . light and dark areas visible in the images reveal details of rock and dust composition , researchers said . the radar images also provide a new perspective on aristillus crater , which is about 34 miles wide and 2.2 miles deep . ` the dark ` halo ' surrounding the crater is due to pulverized debris beyond the rugged , radar-bright rim deposits ,  representatives of the national radio astronomy observatory , which operates the green bank telescope and a number of other instruments , said in a statement . the image reveals previously hidden features around an area known as mare serenitatis , or the sea of serenity , which is near the apollo 17 landing site . the radar observations were able to 多 see 多 approximately 10-15 meters -lrb- 33-50 feet -rrb- below the lunar surface . the light and dark features are the result of compositional changes in the lunar dust and differences in the abundance of rocks buried within the soil . ` the image also shows traces of lava-like features produced when lunar rock melted from the heat of the impact , . ` these images help planetary scientists interpret the complex history of the moon , which is often obscured by dust layers built up over billions of years , better understand the geology of earlier landing sites , and plan for future lunar exploration .
