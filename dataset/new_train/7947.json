{"text": "the war in afghanistan will end up costing taxpayers # 20billion , it emerged last night . at a nato summit in chicago , david cameron and other world leaders will tomorrow draw up a firm timetable for pulling combat troops off the frontline against the taliban . but official figures show that the war had already cost # 17.3 billion by the end of march this year on top of regular defence spending since 2001 . about tiem : a firm timetable will be drawn up to withdraw troops from afghanistan - but it has already hit taxpayers hard . the true cost of the war was revealed by the house of commons library and will be formally published by the ministry of defence later this year . it puts britain on course for a bill approaching # 20billion by the time british troops hand over responsibility for combat operations in helmand province . a total of 414 british servicemen have lost their lives in the country , more than 20 of them at the hands of the afghan security forces they are supposed to be training to take over . the government has said british troops will have ended combat operations by the end of december 2014 . but mr cameron has also signalled that a large number of troops will pull back from the frontline and begin coming home next year . -lsb- caption . british troop numbers will fall from 9,500 to 9,000 this year and that number is expected to halve during 2013 . mr cameron will use the nato summit to demand that other countries help shoulder some of the costs of the conflict as western military involvement winds down . in an article published yesterday , mr cameron said countries that had not sent troops should shoulder their share of costs since the world 's leading economies had paid a disproportionate amount . ` today the g8 accounts for four-fifths of the donor funding now going to the region , ' he said . ` we must encourage other countries to step up and contribute to the future of afghanistan , irrespective of the role they have played so far . ' but the most pressing issue to be discussed at the chicago summit will be to ensure that western governments launch a co-ordinated withdrawal . the prime minister and president barack obama will ask the new french president , francois hollande , to ditch his election pledge to withdraw france 's 3,300 troops from afghanistan by the end of this year . mr hollande has already watered down his pledge . he now talks about withdrawing combat troops , rather than all troops , by the end of the year . but french officials have made it clear that he is likely to want all troops home during the early part of 2013 . british commanders are concerned that an early french withdrawal will put pressure on britain and the us to fill the gaps left behind . the national security council in london has also discussed warnings that failure to leave in an orderly and co-ordinated manner would leave british troops at greater risk of attack as they pull out . the uk has been in talks with neighbouring uzbekistan about pulling soldiers out across that land border . removing lots of heavy equipment will add to the costs of the war . shadow defence secretary jim murphy said the huge costs of the afghan operation made an orderly withdrawal all the more important . ` after the lives sacrificed and the money spent , it is vital that withdrawal does not lead to the return of the conditions which led us to war , ' he added . ` withdrawal must be internationally co-ordinated and we need a renewed focus on the safety of british personnel before and beyond 2014 .
