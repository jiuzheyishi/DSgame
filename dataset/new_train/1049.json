{"text": "animators have created remarkable pictures that resemble an alien landscape from the latest science fiction blockbuster , but are in fact ultra-realistic representations of the inside of a human body . produced by studio xvivo in hartford , connecticut in the u.s. , the movies magnify areas of our insides by up to 10 million times . the 3d . images were produced as part of a project aimed to help students and scientists understand the human body in new and creative ways . xvivo compiled the collection for institutions including harvard , . pfizer , and the united states department of defence and used . replications of electron micrographs , medical illustrations and photographs . to recreate snapshots of parts of the body at a molecular level . scroll down for videos . an underwater world ? : this is an image of kinesin -lrb- yellow , centre -rrb- , a motor protein that is capable of moving across a cell . kinesins are able to ` walk ' along microtubules , filament-like protein structures within cells that are involved in a variety of cellular processes , ranging from cell division to transportation of certain chemicals within cells . animators have included motion images of the inner ear , . bone marrow and the protective structure inside the gastrointestinal . tract amongst other areas . although the project used real data , the equipment used to . produce the microscopic imagery produces no colour , so illustrators . added their own shades , tints and tones . michael astrachan , a partner in xvivo said : ` aesthetically inspirational art moves people . we can take information that is typically taught in a bland , uninspiring two dimensional textbook and bring it to life through a meaningful and inspirational journey . ' he added : ` beauty and scientific-accuracy exemplifies xvivo 's work . our animations allow people to clearly understand complex science and biological processes . ' resembling an alien biodome : a magnified image of a virus ` blebbing ' inside human body . in cell biology , a ` bleb ' is an irregular bulge in the plasma membrane of a cell . this often occurs when a cell dies but blebbing also has important functions in other cellular processes , including cell movement and cell division . image of a marrow cavity where hematopoietic stem cells are found inside human body . these cells are called ` multipotent stem cells ' , and are responsible for the production of all blood cells . through a process known as ` hematopoiesis ' these cells mature into white blood cells -lrb- which protect us from infection -rrb- , red blood cells -lrb- which carry oxygen to the cells in our bodies -rrb- , and platelets -lrb- which help curb bleeding after injury -rrb- . a creature from mars ? : this image is of a microscopic bateriophage , a type of virus that infects and replicates within bacteria . extra-terrestrial canyons : a computer generated image of sterocilia , the sensing organelles of hair cells found in the inner ear . they respond to motion for various functions , including hearing and balance inside human body . the hair cells turn the fluid pressure and other stimuli into electrical signals that travel to the brain where they are interpreted as sound . this image shows the microscopic process of how how atp - a form of energy - is produced within mitochondria inside cells . here intestinal microvilli from the small intenstine are pictured . microvilli are responsible for absorbing nutrients into the bloodstream , for transport to the liver and other cells . in order to increase the amount of nutrients taken into the bloodstream , each villus itself has dozens of microvilli , to increase greatly the surface area . image of transforming growth factor beta -lrb- tgf-beta -rrb- , a polypeptide found in the human body and milk . golgi apparatus are minute organelles found inside most complex cells . they help package proteins inside the cell before they are sent to a part of the body to perform a whatever their job is . pericytes -lrb- green -rrb- are pictured on a capillary -lrb- a small blood vessel -rrb- . pericytes regulate capillary blood flow as well as the clear vessel of cellular debris . in the brain they help sustain the blood-brain barrier .", "summary": " animators at the xvivo studio have produced stunning short movies of the internal workings of the human body .   the connecticut-based artists have magnified some areas of the human body by up to 10 million times .   produced as part of a project to help students and scientists understand the human anatomy in a new way .   amongst the areas captured are bone marrow , the components of a single cell and individual virus particles .
