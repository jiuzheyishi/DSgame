' mr holland , who is married with three children and a keen motorcyclist , also asked the pakistan-born worker while in the kitchen : ` do you fancy a ride ? ' not realising this was a smutty double entendre , mrs raza replied : ` oh yes , whereabouts ? ' mr holland then said : ` how would you like something red hot and throbbing through your legs . ' mr holland also told mrs raza she should have a relationship with an indian-born security guard at the centre saying : ` he wants to stay his visa has expired . ' once he reduced her to tears when he told her to ` f *** off ' as she attempted to wipe clean spilled tea on a lunch table in front of him . and on another occasion he told a tradesman : ` oh here she is . this is who gives free hugs to . people . ' the tribunal ruled that mrs raza had been ` upset and humiliated ' by mr holland 's behaviour . mrs raza told the tribunal mr holland was ` aggressive and insulting ' towards her as if he was ` speaking to an errant ten-year-old child .

' whirlow grange and mr holland , who lived in chesterfield , claimed mrs raza ` conducted a number of acts of . gross misconduct ' involving sexually harassing the head chef and bar . supervisor and was sacked after a ` reasonable ' internal investigation . the tribunal ruled several other claims made by mrs raza were ` outlandish ' and that she could be ` irritating ' towards mr holland on occasions . but mr rostant said she had suffered ` appallingly unfair treatment ' during the disciplinary procedure and the panel accepted she was ` upset and humiliated ' by mr holland 's behaviour . after winning compensation the single mother who is divorced and has a 17-year-old son said : ` mr holland told other staff he was a born christian but his behaviour towards me was hardly christian-like .
