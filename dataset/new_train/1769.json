{"text": "a supercomputer that was supposed to help britain 's security service track terror suspects will not be ready in time for the olympics . mi5 has sacked a firm of it consultants after the company failed to meet deadlines to implement the new intelligence-checking system . the computer system is designed to help mi5 officers carry out secret searches on suspects , including those who may pose a threat at the olympics . posing a threat : the computer system is designed to help officers at mi5 -lrb- pictured -rrb- carry out secret searches on suspects . but spy chiefs have admitted that the software will not be ready in time to be safely trialled before the start of the games later this month . the new ` electronic records management ' system will bring together all mi5 intelligence material , so officers can carry out complete searches of old and current records . for example , it would alert officers more quickly to archived intelligence on a terror suspect who had been dormant or lying low for a number of years . the it failure comes days after the government announced that private security firm g4s had failed to hire enough guards for the olympics . ministers have been forced to call upon the army to make up the shortfall . one security source said of the mi5 it project : ` of course it would be better if this was up and running in time for the olympics as it allows officers to search all their systems in one quick check . in a fast-moving investigation , with finite resources , delay can mean the difference between success and failure . ' the new search facility is understood to work in a similar way to the high-tech computers used in the bbc tv series spooks , where spies match pictures , names and mobile phone numbers to identify suspects from their records . last night , security sources declined to name the company at the centre of the it controversy . nor would they say exactly why the firm had its contract terminated . but it is understood that the project , which is estimated to have already cost up to # 1 million , has been plagued by technical and commercial difficulties . computer crisis : spy chiefs have admitted that the software will not be ready in time to be safely trialled before the start of the games . the decision to postpone implementation until after the olympics leaves the taxpayer out of pocket while mi5 must find a replacement contractor . it has emerged that jonathan evans , director-general of the security service , has voiced concerns about a number of costly it security contracts , including the one that has been terminated . in a report published on thursday by mps from the intelligence and security committee , mr evans is quoted as saying : ` i think it would be a fair criticism to say that we have had some cases where -lsb- our use of consultants and contractors -rsb- has n't been as controlled as it should , -lsb- but now -rsb- we have got a proper focus . . . ` post-olympics , we intend to reduce -lsb- the -rsb- number of organisations and individuals we deal with and to manage those relationships more aggressively than we have done . ' a whitehall security source said that the decision to postpone introducing the system until after the olympics was ` taken some time ago ' on the grounds that it would be too risky to introduce new software just before the olympics . he said that while the delay would affect the service 's capability ` nobody was saying we desperately need the new system immediately now ' . it has also emerged that almost 500 officers from across mi5 , mi6 and gchq have left the secret services in the past year at a cost of # 47 million to the taxpayer . many of the senior staff have been paid six-figure sums to take early retirement while others have been given big redundancy payoffs . the figures , in the report by the intelligence and security committee , are : . the 24 mi6 staff were paid a total of # 4 million to leave the service as part of a drive to remove some of the most expensive spies from the payroll . at the government 's secret listening post , gchq , 255 staff left under the approved early retirement terms in 2010/11 . the cost to the taxpayer of these exit packages was # 23 million . but the director of gchq , iain lobban , told mps he had been forced to offer early retirement to reduce staff numbers and stay within budget . he said : ` we lost a number of more senior members of staff . . . as i shook hands with each of them , i felt a degree of regret , but we needed to get our figures down in order to hit our own spending review commitments . ' in the security service , 216 staff left under the service 's living within our means -lrb- lwom -rrb- scheme in 2010/11 . of these , 103 staff left voluntarily and the remaining 113 were redundancies . the cost to the taxpayer was # 20 million . jonathan evans told the committee that part of the reason for the redundancy programme was to ` -lsb- change -rsb- the staff mix ' , and that ` in this sort of world where technologies come and go in a fortnight , some of the staff that we had . . . were n't really the right people ' . the mps also said that all three agencies were struggling to retain staff as the private sector continued to offer government-trained spies and cyber experts much bigger pay packets . before the gs4 security fiasco , about 12,000 officers were due to be on duty at olympic venues on peak days . criminal trials are being delayed until after the olympics because of the crisis over security . police officers due to testify at hearings across the country are instead being called on to assist at the games . it was not clear last night how many cases will be affected , but the figure may run into the hundreds . on average , about 40,000 criminal cases are heard in england and wales every week . there is also concern that defendants will be kept in custody for longer than usual , at a cost to taxpayers of more than # 100 a night . district judge graham wilkinson , who was last week trying to arrange a trial date for an assault case in wolverhampton , said in court : ` we can have no police officer cases during the olympics . ' before the gs4 security fiasco , about 12,000 officers were due to be on duty at olympic venues on peak days . but hundreds more are now required to do the work of private guards in a further blow to the already over-stretched criminal justice system . adding to the sense of justice being put on hold , courts in and around london will close during the two-week games because of the transport chaos . the old bailey will lose half of its 18 courts , and some judges are understood to have been urged to go on holiday .", "summary": " # 1m device for tracking suspects will not be ready in time for the games .   mi5 : 216 staff each costing an average of # 93,000 .   gchq : 255 staff at an average cost of # 90,000 .   mi6 : 24 staff at an average cost of # 166,000 .
