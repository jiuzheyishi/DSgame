{"text": "as far as hurricanes go , sandy is not particularly intense . with peak winds at 90 mph monday at 5 p.m. , it is still classified as a category one , with only a small chance of briefly achieving the low end of category two before making landfall somewhere in new jersey on monday evening . and yet , state and local governments have gone into full alert mode , with schools closed , cities shut down , and evacuations ordered across the eastern seaboard . justifying the alarm are enormous waves arriving onshore , raising the mean water level by a few feet even here in miami , where the winds are blowing directly offshore . sandy could bring ` catastrophe , ' affect 60 million . sandy represents the confluence of a modestly strong hurricane coming up from the caribbean and a fairly strong but not unusual continental weather system -- what meteorologists call a  trough  or  dip  in the jet stream -- that has been traversing the country over the last few days . in the vast majority of cases , these weather systems weaken hurricanes while at the same time pushing them quickly out to sea . such weather systems also generate their own cyclones , not as intense as hurricanes , but larger and slower moving . opinion : as sandy descends , tips from katrina survivors . when these extra-tropical cyclones form over the ocean and move along the coast , we call them nor'easter s -lrb- for the strong northeasterly winds they generate -rrb- . sometimes , tropical and extra-tropical systems merge , and the hurricane turns into a large ocean cyclone . but again , almost all of these storms move quickly out to sea . there are two elements that make sandy very unusual , possibly even  super .  first is its pathway . rather than racing out to sea like most coastal storms , sandy has already turned hard to the left and it will make landfall at nearly a right angle to the u.s. coastline . this extremely unusual track -lrb- from right to left -rrb- means that almost every piece of coastline from new jersey to cape cod will receive onshore winds at some point during the event . second , the core of sandy -- the part that will look and feel like a hurricane -- has remained intact , even as cooler and drier air from the united states wraps around it . thus , sandy has each of the worst features of both kinds of storm : a small core of hurricane-force winds around its center , and a broad expanse of gale-force winds extending hundreds of miles outward that will batter the shorelines for several days . why did this happen ? it was simply a matter of positioning . sandy arrived east of florida at exactly the right time and place to get the maximum benefits from its interaction with the dip in the jet stream . as a result , sandy became large enough to influence that system as well , and the two will wrap around each other into a single , deep cyclone , 800 miles across , extending from the ground to 40,000 feet in the sky . this will add to the duration of the event as the circulation takes several days to wind down over pennsylvania and new york . opinion : climate change raises stakes for coast . as for whether sandy is a  superstorm ,  perhaps we should refrain from such a designation until after the event . there was already a  superstorm  in march 1993 -- a nor'easter that dumped snow from new orleans to canada . there was the halloween storm of 1991 -- later known as the perfect storm -- which , like sandy , also grew from the confluence of a large extra-tropical cyclone and a hurricane -lrb- which , unlike sandy , was destroyed in the process -rrb- . and there was the blizzard of ' 78 , the eastcoaster of 1996 , and others . sandy will take its place in history , but we will not know what that place is until many days have passed .", "summary": " david nolan : as far as hurricanes go , the storm we call  sandy  is not very intense .   nolan : there are two elements that make sandy unusual , possibly even  super    he says sandy 's right-to-left pathway is atypical , as is its intact hurricane core .   nolan : sandy will take its place in history , but we 'll have to wait until it 's over to know where .
