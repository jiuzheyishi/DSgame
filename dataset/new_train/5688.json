{"text": "athletes of all levels have always needed to monitor the possible danger of concussion on the sports field . now , a new gadget aims to simplify the assessment of a blow to the head , before producing an immediate signal about the severity of the incident . checklight , a skull cap produced by reebok and electronics company mc10 , fits underneath a helmet and uses sensor technology to monitor impact . safety first : the new skull cap will instantly analyze and indicate impact on the head during contact sports . the control module at the back of the cap will flash yellow for moderate impact and red for severe blows to the head . as reported by engadget , the device then flashes a color-coded led on the strength of the blow for all to see . mc10 claim on their website that this ` smart , sensing skullcap serves as an extra set of eyes on the playing field , giving players , parents , coaches and trainers a visual measurement of force of impact to put athletes on a pathway to assessment . ' a strip of flexible plastic inside the cap is packed full of sensors , measuring multi-directional and rotational acceleration , as well as the location and duration of impact . according to engadget , all this technology is connected to a microcontroller module at the back of the cap with three indicator leds . the sophisticated sensors inside the cap measure multi-directional and rotational acceleration , as well as the location and duration of head impact . the technological cap fits round the head , so measures impact extremely accurately and it can also be used with multiple helmets . one light shows the status of the rechargeable battery on board , then a yellow led flashes after moderate blows to the head and the third light flashes red after severe impact . this ensures that immediately after a potentially dangerous collision , everyone on the field is immediately notified . mc10 hope that this will remove one of the biggest problems with concussion injuries - the fact that sports players often do n't even report such incidents . as the new product provides immediate and simple information , the makers hope that sports teams will be able to look out for and police each other . the checklight fits round the users ' head , rather being a part of the helmet , ensuring that it accurately measures potential damage to the body rather than just impact to the protective equipment . as such , the skull cap can also be used with a number of different helmets . both reebok and mc10 hope the equipment will be used at all sporting levels , including youth athletics . when engadget asked isaiah kacyvenski - mc10 's director of licensing and business development and ex-nfl player - about the potential cost of the device , he said it would be ` affordable and comparable to the cost of other sporting equipment . ' checklight will be available in the first half of 2013 . the dangers of concussion have long been a concern for athletes playing contact sports , especially in nfl . legendary nfl linebacker junior seau was found to have a degenerative brain disease caused by repeated blows to the head when he committed suicide in may 2012 . on thursday , analysis of the brain of nfl legend junior seau revealed that when he committed suicide last year he was suffering from a degenerative brain disease often linked with repeated blows to the head . researchers from the national institutes of health said that the former football star 's abnormalities were consistent with chronic traumatic encephalopathy , or cte . the hard-hitting linebacker played for 20 nfl seasons with san diego , miami and new england before retiring in 2009 . he died at age 43 of a self-inflicted gunshot to his chest in may 2012 , and his family requested the analysis of his brain . ` we saw changes in his behavior and things that did n't add up with him , ' his ex-wife , gina , told the associated press . ` but -lrb- cte -rrb- was not something we considered or even were aware of . but pretty immediately -lrb- after the suicide -rrb- doctors were trying to get their hands on junior 's brain to examine it . ' the family of junior seau spotted ` changes in his behavior and things that did n't add up with him . ' this was a result of degenerative brain disease caused by repeated concussions .", "summary": " checklight , the new technological skull cap , analyses impact to the head during contact sports , then signals the severity of the incident .   makers reebok and mc10 hope it will be used at all sporting levels , including in youth athletics .
