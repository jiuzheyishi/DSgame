{"text": "tokyo -lrb- cnn -rrb- how we view robots -- and the inevitable robotics revolution that we 've been promised for so long -- depends largely on our background . for me , as an american , robots will be inherently linked with star wars as a kid , but later with the unstoppable android that was the terminator . so , while i can dream of a cute , trashcan-sized companion , the fantasy is also coupled with an inherent fear that it may one day rise up and attempt to exterminate me . for many japanese people , robots were a staple of pop culture growing up . from osamu tezuka 's astro boy -lrb- known here by his original name , which translates as mighty atom -rrb- in the 1950s and 60s , to the towering , martial robots of the  gundam  and  evangelion  universes , to name but a few , robots have long held a special place in the collective imagination . robot pioneers . so it really is no surprise that the country is on the leading edge of robot technology , and a visit to the national museum of emerging science and innovation , known as miraikan -lrb- future hall -rrb- in tokyo really drives home the point . here , visitors can interact with asimo , the honda-developed android that can run , perform tasks , and interact with people . honda first unveiled asimo a decade ago , and even today it remains a futuristic vision of what robotics may one day hope to achieve on a consumer scale . miraikan also houses other , interactive automatons that show glimpses of what life might be like in 15 , 20 , or 30 years . there 's otonaroid , who looks like a young japanese woman with silicone skin , flowing hair , and blinking eyes . and then there 's kodomoroid , an android newscaster that reads headlines to museum visitors , and telenoid , a creepy-looking communication device that allows you to  speak  to friends or loved ones who are far away -- and feel as if you are sitting with them . you can hold and hug the telenoid , and it hugs you back with its little stubs for arms . while giant fighting space robots may be a while off -- although engineers are reportedly planning a moving , 60 ft tall gundam -- japan is betting big that robots will have a greater place in our lives in the years to come . help at home . from housework helpers which can ease the burden of a range of daily chores -- like twenty-one , the multipurpose home care droid currently under development at tokyo 's waseda university . with a humanoid upper body and wheeled base , it boasts a dexterity and mobility that would be helpful in any number of tasks , including assisting the elderly . shigeki sugano and his team have the vision of putting robots in everyone 's homes . he tells me it will be decades before robots are mass-produced the way cars are today , but what is being developed today could well become commonplace in the future . twenty-one is a great example of how japanese researchers are thinking of helping the country 's aging population . androids -- humanoid robots -- may also one day soon act as companions and helpers to the elderly as japan looks at its current demographic crisis and uses technology in inventive ways to combat a shrinking , aging population . nursing homes could also benefit from  wearable ,  exoskeleton robots , like cyberdyne 's hal-5 , that can assist with mobility . thanks to technological advances , including those in  emotion recognition functions ,  robots are becoming a lot more sympathetic and  human  for want of a better term , and thus accepted . last month , japanese telecom company softbank showcased pepper ,  the first robot to read human emotions ,  according to the company 's ceo , masayoshi son . elsewhere , national emergencies like the meltdown at the fukushima daiichi reactor have driven home the point that there remain myriad situations for which we soft , fragile humans are ill-equipped . economic boon . japan 's robot revolution is not only underway , but has the backing of the country 's government , which sees it as a potential antidote to decades of sluggish gdp growth . last month , japan 's prime minister shinzo abe said that he is bullish about the future of robotics , after photo ops at a saitama nursing home and a tokyo robotics factory . he 's expressed a desire to  set up a council on making a robotic revolution a reality in order to aid japan 's growth ,  and set a benchmark of tripling the robot market to Â¥ 2.4 trillion -lrb- $ 24 billion -rrb- . abe also declared his hope that there will be a high profile  robot olympics  in 2020 , a companion piece to the human version , which will be held in tokyo that year . the robolympics -lrb- as they should clearly be called -rrb- will act as a showcase for advancement in the fields of robotics and engineering .  in 2020 , i would like to gather all of the world 's robots and aim to hold an olympics where they compete in technical skills ,  mr abe told jiji press agency .  we want to make robots a major pillar of our economic growth strategy .  already ingrained in the country 's cultural conciousness , the robots of today will hopefully encourage and inspire the next generation of designers , programmers and engineers , in the way that i was inspired by star wars , and countless japanese youths , by their rich robot anime and manga culture . this robot valet will park your car . meet pepper , the emotional robot . euan mckirdy in hong kong contributed to this report .", "summary": " japan has long portrayed robots in popular culture , paving the way for the
