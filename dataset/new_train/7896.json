' i never thought i 'd get another chance when i was in east reach hospital on the day i was meant to be carrying the torch in 1948 . ' ` it is not uncommon for a flame to go out and this can happen for a number of reasons , for example , in extreme winds . ' a replacement torch was brought out from the convoy of vehicles and was lit from the mother flame . ` we keep the mother flame in specially designed miners ' lanterns so if the flame does go out for some reason on the relay we relight it from the source of the flame , ' the spokeswoman added . mr follett was left paralysed at 19 when he was struck by a car . but after returning to college to complete his a levels he looked at what sports were available to wheelchair athletes and helped to set up a badminton club . with his playing partner , follett has been unbeaten for three years in the four nations competitions and he is now the para-badminton world no 1 in his class . the torch relay entered its third day today and will see dozens of unsung and hard-working individuals get their moment in the spotlight as they carry the torch from exeter to taunton . however , some of the olympic torchbearers have caused a stir after cashing in on their once-in-a-lifetime privilege by selling their torches on ebay . before the first day of the relay was completed , the gold torches appeared on the online auction site.a torch used during the relay on saturday is currently attracting bids of more than # 30,000 . the seller lists the item as : ` an amazing sporting souvenir , be one of the first to have one ! ' other torchbearers have pledged to donate the proceeds from the sale to charity . sarah milner simonds , from burnham-on-sea , who is selling her torch to raise money for the project she represents , said she had received a bid of more than # 150,000 . ms milner said she still needed to check if the bid was genuine . ` it only occurred to me to do it on saturday night , ' she told bbc breakfast . ` the sale closed last night at 10pm and the final bid was # 153,000 . ' the torchbearer , who was nominated for her work as a community gardener for the people 's plot , said she was dismayed that people who objected to her decision had started sending her abusive emails . torch fever : the crowds were back today to watch georgina geikie carrying the olympic torch on the leg between okehampton and merton in devon . we want the torch ! school children enjoy a break from their lessons to watch the torch pass them in okehampton , devon . patience : a british bulldog decked out in red , white and blue waits patiently for the touch in bideford , left , while right , crowds gather on a bridge between torquay and teignmouth . ` obviously it has really upset people but i think that it 's not something that is really me to keep my shiny trophy on a mantelpiece when it is obvious how much good one can do with the money that someone might be willing to pay for it . ' organisers will be hoping for a repeat of the scenes on the first two days of the relay when excited people packed the streets of cornwall and devon to catch a glimpse of the torch . yesterday began at the plymouth life centre with the torch in the hands of 18-year-old jordan anderton . the relay travelled from plymouth , through totnes , paignton and torquay on the south devon coast , before finishing in exeter for an evening celebration . more than 8,500 people filled exeter cathedral gardens to watch a live show of music and dance . away from the official olympic torch relay , residents in hatherleigh , devon got on with some burning of their own . but perhaps holding a flaming fireball on a stick close to a row of pretty thatched cottages was not quite a gold medal idea . as crowds of local residents lined the streets of the small market town clapping the unofficial torch bearers down the street , thick black smoke filled the air . luckily the event passed without incident . and what 's more the unofficial torch , which must have cost a fraction of the # 495 price of a golden cheese grater , did not malfunction , despite the wind . bit close for comfort : a man bearing his own rather ambitious torch waves it close to a line of thatched cottages during an unofficial spin-off gathering in hatherleigh , devon . has one been working out ? crowds lined the streets of hatherleigh for the race run ahead of the official olympic relay .", "summary": " para-badminton star david follett had been carrying torch through great torrington , devon when it went out .   replacement torch was brought out and lit from ` mother flame '   ` not uncommon for flame to go out , ' says locog spokesman .   but highly unofficial torch continues to burn at event 13 miles away .
