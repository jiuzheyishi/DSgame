{"text": "london , england scores of iraqis who claim they were abused by british troops are demanding an independent inquiry into their treatment , via a lawsuit against the british government this week . at least 125 iraqis allege they were subjected to mistreatment including sleep deprivation , hooding , being forced to stand or kneel in stress positions , or being exposed to  loud pornography .  the mistreatment was not the work of rogue soldiers disobeying orders , but part of a  deliberate policy of abuse being used to assist interrogation ,  lawyer philip shiner argues . the  allegations indicate systematic abuse of detainees which reflect policies of the armed forces or at least tolerated and widespread practices ,  he says in court papers . he showed interrogation videos in court on friday and planned to introduce more evidence monday and tuesday , he told cnn . the allegations center on a unit known as the joint forward interrogation team , about which shiner says he has been able to obtain little information . in court papers he says it was responsible for detainee interrogation and control , calling it  effectively a black hole , a segregated and tightly controlled environment operating under a separate chain of command .  the ministry of defence did not immediately respond to cnn questions about the interrogation team . the european convention on human rights requires the government to establish an independent investigation in the abuse allegations , shiner says . defence minister liam fox , the defendant in the high court case , is  very concerned  by allegations of abuse and is determined to  get to the bottom  of all such allegations , his lawyers said monday . but he does not believe he is under  any present obligations to set up a public inquiry .  the ministry of defence says the royal military police are investigating allegations case by case . a two-year project under its jurisdiction , known as the iraq historic allegation team , was announced earlier this year . fox believes that process is  desirable and appropriate  in investigating abuse allegations , and has made  significant progress  since it was established , government lawyers said . the historic allegation team  is the most effective way of investigating these unproven allegations -- to establish their truth or otherwise , identify any action that needs to be taken , including dealing with any connected or systemic issues and , should it uncover criminal behavior , provide the proper means to deal with it ,  said brigadier john donnelly of the ministry 's judicial engagement policy department .  in our view a costly new public inquiry is not necessary or appropriate . it would be unable to investigate individual criminal behavior or impose punishments and will not serve the interest of fair and expeditious justice ,  he said in a statement . shiner says that investigation is only putting off an inquiry that is certain to come .  there is no justification for delaying the inevitable ,  he argues in court papers . he says the military 's investigation is not sufficiently independent . and sending cases through the iraq historic allegation team before setting up an independent probe  offends  the european convention on human rights requirement for prompt investigations in allegations of abuse , he says . the case opened friday and is due to continue through tuesday . it is not clear when the judge will rule . cnn 's bharati naik and andrew carey contributed to this report .", "summary": " 125 iraqis claim they suffered abuse such as hooding and sleep deprivation .   the abuse was part of a  deliberate policy ,  their lawyer argues .   the ministry of defence says it is investigating case via a special commission .   the lawyer says that 's just delaying the inevitable .
