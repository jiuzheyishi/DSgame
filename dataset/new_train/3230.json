{"text": "they may not be regarded as the world 's greatest lovers , but it seems you can rely on british men where it really counts . that 's right -- our chaps are far more likely to be found scrubbing sinks or dusting the dining room than any other men in europe , a study has found . there 's still some way to go before they catch up with women , who typically do a bigger share of household chores . rule britannia : a study of more than 58,000 people living with partners in the uk , france , germany , italy and spain looked at how long they spent doing a range of chores . but in britain , men do a third of the work , while those in spain and italy only manage a fifth . the study of more than 58,000 people living with partners in the uk , france , germany , italy and spain looked at how long they spent doing a range of chores . the spanish team logged time spent cooking , ironing , cleaning the house , washing dishes , doing the laundry and odd jobs , gardening and shopping for groceries . ` if all housework is considered , the united kingdom would rate as the most egalitarian country , followed by france , germany , and as more inegalitarian cases , italy and spain , ' said lead author marta dominguez folgueras , of pompeu fabra university in barcelona . ` the difference is significant : men in the united kingdom do on average one third of the housework whereas in italy , they hardly manage 20 per cent . ' participants were asked to keep a diary of what they did during each 15-minute period of the day . still trying to impress ? the study also found that cohabiting men were more likely to do housework than their married counterparts . the lion 's share of chores fell to women -- except in shopping , where the work was evenly split , and some ` occasional male tasks ' . italian couples spent the most time on household chores -- seven hours per day between them . the british came in fourth , at five hours and 52 minutes , while the french spent the least time . the study , published in the journal of family issues , also looked at the difference between married couples and those who were cohabiting , but not married . it found cohabiting men were more likely to do housework than their married counterparts . the average married male did 23 per cent of the chores , but those who had yet to walk down the aisle did 30 per cent , a trend researchers suggest is partly down to a desire to impress a partner . ` cohabiting unions hold more egalitarian divisions of household labour , both in terms of quantity -- percentage of household load -- and quality -- types of task performed , ' the researchers wrote . they said living together may be ` part of a partner selection process ' in which willingness to do chores is seen as ` a desirable trait ' . living as an unmarried couple was most common in france , where 20 per cent chose to cohabit , followed by the uk with 14 per cent . young people were the most likely to live together when not married . a separate study this week found women in the uk do more unpaid housework and childcare than those in most other countries . the research by the organisation for economic cooperation and development found that in a week , married british women spend an average of 11 more hours on household matters than their husbands do , while putting in three hours less in paid work .", "summary": " cohabiting men more likely to contribute than husbands , study finds .   but italian couples spend most time on housework overall .
