' and writing on a facebook page set up by students to show support for the popular professor , he added : ` i 'm now able to say that none of the allegations against me were upheld . ` throughout this past year , i have been deeply moved and touched by the level of support that i have received . ` the only way i can think of beginning to repay that is through my teaching and writing - and i look forward to returning properly to that in the hope that it will be adequate to what you deserve . he was banned from the university of warwick campus after allegations he had also undermined authority . ` there are many colleagues - students as well as staff - whose position has been more difficult than mine . ` they now deserve the benefit of our combined reasoning , arguing , and sustained democratic debate . ` thanks again to you all - and , with luck , i 'll see some of you in class , in conference , or just around and about .

' dennis leech , president of the university & college union branch at warwick , added : ` the fact that a member of the academic staff can be suspended for almost nine months and subject to such a protracted disciplinary process suggests that there is a need to review the governance of the university . ' i hope the university will look again at how it can strengthen its procedures to protect and defend academic freedom , which this case exemplifies to be threatened from obtrusive managerialism . ' a spokesperson for the university of warwick said the process had taken the time it did ` in order to accommodate the specific requests and needs of all the participants in the process ' . in 2011 professor docherty published ` for the university : democracy and the future of the institution ' , which has been described as book that ` helps to make more people aware of the contradictory and short-sighted way that universities are now discussed and managed in britain .
