{"text": "the u.s. supreme court on thursday declined to hear an emergency application for a stay filed by a florida deep-sea salvage company that wanted to maintain possession of a half billion dollars worth of gold and silver coins until a final decision is made about who owns them .  spain has now been victorious at every level in the united states courts , from tampa to atlanta to washington ,  said jim goold , who defended spain 's claim to the treasure .  i am pleased and proud for all of us .  odyssey marine exploration had made an emergency appeal to the high court in an attempt to block a lower court 's order last week that it turn over the treasure to spain . justice clarence thomas , who has jurisdiction over applications from florida , denied without comment the motion in odyssey marine exploration inc. v. kingdom of spain . the company has filed at least one another stay request with the justices . melinda macconnel , odyssey 's vice president and general counsel , expressed disappointment , but said she recognized that the court  rarely grants  such motions .  how we proceed from here will depend on whether a mandate issues and what a subsequent order might look like , especially given the fact that the courts have determined they do not have jurisdiction in the case ,  she said in a statement . goold said it was unlikely that the supreme court would review the case .  the supreme court accepts 1 % or less of such requests and today 's decision makes a strong statement about their chances ,  he said . the dispute goes back to 2007 , when odyssey announced it had found a 19th-century sunken ship off of spain . the company claimed ownership of the coins and said it had flown them to a guarded location in the united states . spain filed suit in a federal court in tampa , florida , also claiming the treasure . spain says its navy warship nuestra senora de las mercedes was carrying the coins . the 34-gun frigate left peru in 1804 and crossed the atlantic to within a day 's sail from spain when british ships attacked the spanish fleet . in the ensuing battle of cape st. mary , south of portugal , the mercedes was hit in its powder magazine and exploded , according to the spanish government 's filing to the florida court . in 2009 , the federal court in tampa ruled in favor of spain and the federal appeals court in atlanta upheld the ruling last september . last week , the appeals court denied an odyssey motion , which odyssey appealed to the supreme court . the appeals court is expected to send the case back to the court in tampa , which would establish and supervise the procedures for sending the coins to spain , goold said last week . spain believes that most of the nearly 600,000 coins are currently in florida , goold said . spain 's culture minister , jose ignacio wert , told cnn in madrid on wednesday that the case was never really about the money .  we 're not going to use this money for purposes other than artistic exhibition , but this is something that enriches our material , artistic capital and it has to be appreciated as such ,  wert said in an interview . he said the coins would be exhibited at spanish museums , and perhaps elsewhere . peru , too , has followed the fate of the coins , which came from latin america when peru was a spanish colony .  formally , they have n't claimed anything , but we are completely open to consider the possibility of distributing some part of the treasure also among the latin american museums ,  wert said . the treasure includes fabled  pieces of eight ,  some minted in 1803 in lima , peru , spanish officials have said .", "summary": " odyssey 's bid to hold on to gold and silver coins was set back .   justice clarence thomas declined the motion without comment .   spain has won u.s. court rulings to date .
