{"text": "astronomers at nasa have discovered a pink alien planet orbiting a star like our sun 57 light-years away that they said is the smallest by mass photographed so far . scientists believe the planet , gj 504b , is thought to be a magenta colour , based on infrared data from the subaru telescope in hawaii . while gj 504b is the the lowest-mass planet ever detected around a star using direct imaging techniques , but it is still several times the mass of jupiter and similar in size . the planet , gj 504b -lrb- pictured -rrb- is the smallest exoplanet by mass orbiting a star like our sun , some 57 light-years away . it is thought to be a magenta colour , based on infrared data from the subaru telescope in hawaii . michael mcelwain , a member of the discovery team at nasa 's goddard space flight centre in greenbelt , maryland , said : ` if we could travel to this giant planet , . we would see a world still glowing from the heat of its formation with a . color reminiscent of a dark cherry blossom , a dull magenta . ' ` our near-infrared camera reveals that . its color is much more blue than other imaged planets , which may . indicate that its atmosphere has fewer clouds . ' gj 504b orbits its star at nearly nine times the distance jupiter orbits the sun , which poses a challenge to theoretical ideas of how giant planets form . according to the most widely accepted theory , called the core-accretion model , jupiter-like planets begin their life in the gas-rich debris disk that surrounds a young star , francis reddy of nasa explained . this composite combines subaru images of gj 504 using two near-infrared wavelengths -lrb- orange , 1.6 micrometers , taken in may 2011 and blue , 1.2 micrometers , april 2012 -rrb- . once processed to remove scattered starlight , the images reveal the orbiting planet , gj 504b . a core produced by collisions among asteroids and comets provides a ` seed ' and when this core reaches sufficient mass , its gravitational pull rapidly attracts gas from the disk to form the planet . while this theory holds true for planets in our solar system out to where neptune orbits , it is more problematic for worlds located farther from their stars . pink planet gj 504b lies at a projected distance of 43.5 astronomical units from its star - which is around one-and-a-half times the distance neptune is from our sun . markus janson , a hubble postdoctoral fellow at princeton university in new jersey said : ` this is among the hardest planets to explain in a traditional planet-formation framework . ' ` its discovery implies that we need to seriously consider alternative formation theories , or perhaps to reassess some of the basic assumptions in the core-accretion theory . ' the astronomers said gj 504b is about four times the mass of jupiter and has a temperature of around 237 celsius . its star , gj 504 also known as 59 virginis -lrb- circled -rrb- is slightly hotter than the sun and can be seen in the constellation virgo in this chart and can be seen without using a telescope , according to nasa . the research is part of the strategic explorations of exoplanets and disks with subaru -lrb- seeds -rrb- , a project to directly image extrasolar planets and protoplanetary disks around several hundred nearby stars using the subaru telescope on mauna kea , hawaii . the five-year project began in 2009 and is led by the national astronomical observatory of japan -lrb- naoj -rrb- . while direct imaging is arguably the most important technique for observing planets around other stars , it is also the most challenging . masayuki kuzuhara at the tokyo institute of technology , who led the discovery team , said : ` imaging provides information about the planet 's luminosity , temperature , atmosphere and orbit , but because planets are so faint and so close to their host stars , it 's like trying to take a picture of a firefly near a searchlight . ' the astronomers said gj 504b is about four times the mass of jupiter and has a temperature of around 237 celsius . its star is slightly hotter than the sun , which can be seen in the constellation virgo . the study on gj 504b will be published in the astrophysical journal .", "summary": " nasa believes the planet , gj 504b is a magenta colour , based on infrared data from the subaru telescope in hawaii .   the pink planet orbits its star at nearly nine .   times the distance jupiter orbits the sun to challenge .   theoretical ideas of how giant planets form .   gj 504b is about four times the mass of jupiter and its star can be seen without a telescope in the constellation virgo .
