{"text": "flooding the airwaves this election year in battleground states across the country are democratic ads featuring two men not on any ballot , and not even politicians . they 're the koch brothers , billionaire businessmen and gop mega donors . senate majority leader harry reid takes the unusual step of regularly ripping charles and david koch from the senate floor . he says they have  no conscience ,  calling them  un-american .  and now , is proposing a constitutional amendment to ban the kind of anonymous political giving the kochs engage in and , some experts say , perfected . other high-profile democrats are hitting the kochs , too -- from vice president joe biden to former vice president al gore , who this week argued republicans are reluctant to publicly accept the existence of man-made global warming for fear of crossing the koch brothers .  i do n't think it 's particularly complicated . they will face primary opponents financed by the koch brothers and others who are part of their group ,  gore said . democratic sources tell cnn it 's a carefully crafted strategy to make the koch brothers the 2014 election villains -- the personification of the rich manipulating the political system -- bankrolling a gop agenda to get richer .  the koch brothers seem to believe in an america where the system is rigged to benefit the very wealthy ,  reid says as part of his regular anti-koch rant . democrats are also trying to goad republicans into publicly defending them as a way to attack gop candidate as being in the kochs ' pockets . senate showdown likely coming over campaign spending . it begs the question : how wealthy are they ? forbes magazine puts charles and david koch as the fourth-richest men in the united states , with a fortune of more than $ 41 billion . an oil , gas and textile conglomerate . their oil , gas and textile conglomerate , koch industries , makes products people use every day : dixie cups , toilet paper , stainmaster products and even lycra . their business is privately held . the brothers own 84 % of koch industries shares . their libertarian politics come from their father , fred koch , a chemical engineer whose experience working in the soviet union instilled an aversion to big government . charles and david koch spend tens of millions of their personal wealth to push those anti-big government views . but exactly how much they donate is impossible to track because it is cloaked in secrecy . they fund groups that are not required to disclose donors -- groups that work to determine the outcome of federal , state and even municipal elections .  they are very secretive in the way they operate politically ,  explained dave levinthal of the center for public integrity , which tracks political spending .  they have a very vast and wide network of non-profit and limited liability companies ,  he said . it 's a huge web of roughly three dozen conservative groups funded , at least in part , by the kochs . one group , freedom partners , acts as a hub of sorts . it is funded by the kochs and 200 other like-minded businessmen . if that sounds confusing , that 's probably the point . their irs filing from 2012 shows freedom partners raised more than $ 250 million that election year . one of the most prominent koch-backed groups is americans for prosperity , which the brothers helped found . david koch is still on the board , and one of his few public speeches each year at afp 's annual meeting . afp puts its money where its mouth is . could spend $ 125 million this cycle . an afp official told cnn that it 's on course to spend more than $ 125 million this midterm election year , which would be unprecedented , and likely more than the party apparatus will spend . and like the political parties , that money will go toward television ads , ground operations and voter data collection . but unlike the political parties , afp 's money comes from anonymous donations .  we 're going to shield the privacy and the first amendment rights of the folks who support us ,  afp president tim phillips said . phillips says he is proud to have the kochs ' support , but also says they have 90,000 donors from all 50 states as well .  they 're interested in the policies we 're pursuing . they 're interested in , are we going to have cheap , affordable , reliable energy ,  phillips said . they 're interested in are we going to stop tax increases from going thru the roof and hurting americans , including businesses .  democrats say the idea that money is going to opposing government regulation and environmental protections because of economic principle is laughable . they say it 's really all about making the kochs and like-minded businessmen richer . to counter that , koch allies argue that ethanol subsidies help koch industries , but afp and other groups the koch 's fund , lobby against the government assistance . cnn sought an interview with charles or david koch , but the media-averse brothers declined . a spokesman , instead , offered nancy pfotenhauer , their longtime friend and former employee .  i would describe them as people who are driven by integrity , humility ,  pfotenhauer said . the image of the koch brothers as two fat cats with puppet strings controlling republicans is  just not reality ,  she said . infusing america with libertarian ideals . those who know charles and david koch say they have a long-term goal of infusing america with their libertarian ideals . but each has a personal passion . for charles koch , a soft-spoken intellectual who lives in the brothers ' hometown of wichita , kansas , it 's higher education . he has pumped millions into colleges and universities around the country , mostly to push free market economics with college students . he even founded the cato institute back in 1974 , a think tank dedicated to studying and advancing libertarian ideals . by contrast , david koch lives in new york like a traditional big city billionaire . his passion outside of political advocacy is donating tens of millions to medical research , hospitals , and even the arts -- a liberal bastion . he gave $ 35 million to bring a dinosaur exhibit to the smithsonian , and even restored the ballet at lincoln center -- which bears his name . their name might be on buildings and on democrats lips , but they remain largely silent . earlier this year , shortly after reid launched his anti-koch campaign , charles koch took the rare step of penning an op-ed in the wall street journal .  instead of encouraging free and open debate , collectivists strive to discredit and intimidate opponents . they engage in character assassination . -lrb- i should know , as the almost daily target of their attacks -rrb- ,  he wrote .  such tactics are the antithesis of what is required for a free society -- and a telltale sign that the collectivists do not have good answers ,  wrote koch . so , why do n't they speak out more ; do interviews to explain and defend themselves ?  i think that instinct is somewhat mediated by the , just the nastiness and the viciousness of these attacks that have real ramifications from the standpoint of security ,  pfotenhauer said . she and other koch sources wo n't be specific , but insist they 've had significant death threats against them personally , and threats against their businesses . but the reality is that charles and david koch do n't just cling to privacy because of security concerns . they 're trying to limit public scrutiny -- even as democrats make them the faces of fat cat influence .", "summary": " senate majority leader harry reid calls out koch brothers for anonymous campaign donations .   democrats are trying to make the koch brothers midterm villains .   kochs donate tens of millions of dollars to fund anti-big government campaigns .   critics say their wealth has outsized influence on elections .
