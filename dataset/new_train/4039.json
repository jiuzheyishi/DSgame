{"text": "nine air force commanders lost their jobs in the wake of a cheating scandal involving systemic cheating on tests by officers in the u.s. nuclear missile program , officials from that military branch said thursday . the fired officers were in  leadership positions  at malmstrom air force base in montana , air force secretary deborah lee james said . though not directly involved in cheating ,  they failed to provide adequate oversight of their crew force ,  according to james . in addition , col. robert stanley -- head of the 341st missile wing and a 25-year veteran --  relinquished command  and submitted his resignation thursday morning , said lt. gen. stephen wilson , the commander of the air force 's global strike command .  leadership 's focus on perfection led commanders to micromanage their people ,  said wilson , pointing to pressure to get 100 % scores on monthly proficiency exams when only 90 % was necessary to pass .  ... leaders lost sight of the fact that execution in the field is more important than what happens in the classroom .  james said thursday that 100 lower-level officers were at one point implicated in the ordeal -- having either been accused directly of cheating or having looked the other way . nine of those have been cleared and will be allowed to return to duty , while others could face punishments ranging from letters of counseling to courts-martial on various charges . these disciplinary measures are only part of the response , however . james and wilson both referred to a number of changes to address this incident as well as far-reaching issues with morale , micromanagement and more among those in the air force 's intercontinental ballistic missile program .  the issues that we have before us today are tough , and they did n't come overnight ,  said james .  ... while we have progress in certain areas in recent years , there is more work to be done .  military investigators stumbled into the cheating scandal while looking into alleged drug activity involving airmen . three of their targets in the drug probe happened to work as missile crew members at malmstrom , which is how investigators got access to their cell phones -- and  found test material on them ,  according to wilson . authorities previously said the cheating took place last august and september at the montana base , with officers using texts and pictures to cheat on their proficiency exams . but wilson said thursday that such behavior actually went well beyond that , having occurred as far back as november 2011 and as recently as november 2013 . the whole malmstrom scheme centered on four individuals , three of whom were being investigated in the drug probe , according to wilson .  if we would have removed those , then this incident probably would never have happened ,  he added . about 190 officers oversee the readiness of nuclear weapons systems at the montana base , meaning the episode tainted a large percentage of that force in some way . james said she found worrisome not just that airmen cheated directly , but that no one -- whether or not they were directly involved -- spoke up . the air force officials said investigators did n't find any indication of similar cheating on other bases tied to the missile program , though they pointed to common issues elsewhere when it comes to the program 's management . to that end , wilson said he has a list of  400 action items  to possible address those issues . some are simple , like grading the monthly proficiency on a simple pass/fail metric . others are more complicated , though all have a common aim of ensuring the nuclear weapons program is run smartly and effectively by satisfied , capable military personnel with high integrity .  our nation demands and deserves the higher standards of accountability from the force entrusted with the most powerful weapon on the planet ,  wilson said .  we are committed to living up to those standards .  navy responds to allegations . air force cheating scandal .", "summary": " the head of the 341st missile wing  relinquished command ,  asked to retire .    leadership 's focus on perfection led commanders to micromanage ,  official says .   the cheating on an exam for missile launch officers was between 2011 and 2013 .   air force leader : though they did n't cheat , commanders did n't provide adequate oversight .
