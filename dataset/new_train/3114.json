' she said : ` it was as if gavin was put on this earth to do such wonderful things , to help anybody that needed him . ` he . touched everyone he knew and he had thousands of friends . i am so proud . to have been gavin 's mother . the world is a poorer place without him . ' mr bedford had been tasked with dismantling machinery at the plant in llantrisant business park before gerber moved operations to their headquarters in bridgwater , somerset . but as he removed a large metal overhead pipe it fell and landed on his head , causing extensive skull fractures and brain injuries . his injuries were not discovered until a supervisor returned 40 minutes after the accident , having said he was going to find an adjustable spanner . mr bedford was taken away in an ambulance but died three days later in the royal glamorgan hospital . perfect son : his mum anna told of her heartbreak as she paid tribute to her perfect son . his dad nigel , who had become seriously ill in the aftermath of his son 's death , said : ` this type of work was obviously dangerous and gerber should have looked after gavin properly . ' the company was ordered to pay an # 80,000 fine at newport crown court yesterday after admitting health and safety breaches that contributed to his death . they also agreed to pay # 75,000 in costs outside court following their guilty plea , which came after an earlier court appearance . judge patrick curran qc said no risk assessment or detailed plans for removing the pipework had been produced after it was overlooked during initial work . on top of this the supervisor tasked with overseeing the final stages of the operation was unqualified for demolition projects and had never been given any health and safety training relevant to the task in hand . factory : mr bedford had an accident at this factory where the innocent smoothie brand was made in llantrisant . the large pipe should have been removed using scaffolding but despite an agreement that it would be put in place there was no formal instruction given . instead , plans to pull down the pipe were made by removing bolts before pulling it away from its fixtures from below with ropes . judge curran said there had been a breakdown in communication and the lack of detailed plans for the work meant gavin , as a keen , hard-working employee , took it upon himself to take down the last heavy metal pipe by himself . he added : ` that is why you plan . ' but he recognised the firm had an otherwise untarnished health and safety record . outside court the health and safety executive 's inspector liam osborne said there was a basic failure to plan , manage and monitor . he said : ` any demolition or dismantling work must be set down in writing and strictly monitored , as the law requires . it is also basic common sense . ` if gerber had given enough time at the beginning to think through what needed to be done , and how it should be done , then gavin would still be here today .
