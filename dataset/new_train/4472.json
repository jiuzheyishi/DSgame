{"text": "rubin  hurricane  carter , the middleweight boxing contender who spent 19 years in prison after being wrongly convicted of a triple murder , has died in toronto , according to win wahrer , the director of client services for the association in defence of the wrongly convicted . carter , 76 , died of complications from prostate cancer , wahrer said .  i always remember spending hours and hours with rubin talking about the wrongful convictions ,  she told cnn .  he was a great mentor and teacher . i felt very fortunate to have those times with him . ... he lived a very full life .  carter spent 19 years in prison for a triple killing in new jersey before a federal judge ruled in 1985 that he and john artis , who was with carter on the night of the shootings , did not receive fair trials and released them . artis was with carter when he died early sunday morning , wahrer said , adding that carter had lived in toronto since his release from prison . carter told cnn three years ago that prison allowed him to do two things : shed the illusions and anger that spurred his youthful delinquency , and come to the realization that his destiny might lie in fighting for justice . he was a title-seeking prizefighter no more . but first , he had to scrap his way out of prison .  hatred and bitterness and anger only consume the vessel that contains them . it does n't hurt another soul ,  carter told cnn .  if i were to allow myself to continue to feel that anger and the bitterness of being a victim , i would have never survived prison itself . prison can deal with anger ; prison can deal with hatred because prison is about all those things . so i had to overcome those things .  carter became an activist for the wrongly convicted after his release and was the first executive director of the association in defence of the wrongly convicted from 1993 to 2004 .  rubin will be remembered by those at aidwyc who were fortunate enough to have worked with him as a truly courageous man who fought tirelessly to free others who had suffered the same fate as he ,  the group said in a statement .  we will continue to fight against wrongful convictions , a battle that rubin valiantly fought until the day he died . rest in peace rubin , your battle is over but you will never be forgotten .  there was a time when boxing enthusiasts were giddy about carter 's future . he was fast and powerful , hence his sobriquet , and despite being short for his weight class -lrb- 5-foot-8 -rrb- , he became a madison square garden and television fixture . ring magazine declared him one of the top middleweight contenders in 1963 after he knocked out 11 of his first 15 professional opponents .  his shaven head , prominent mustache , unwavering stare and solid frame made him an intimidating presence in the ring decades before such a look became commonplace ,  according to the new jersey boxing hall of fame . following a loss in his only title bout in 1964 , carter precipitously fell from grace , losing seven of his 15 final matches before being fingered in a 1966 triple homicide at the lafayette bar and grill . he was convicted and sentenced to three life terms the following year . the ruling was later overturned , but carter was convicted again in 1976 , a year after bob dylan co-wrote a song declaring his innocence . that conviction , too , was tossed out , and carter walked out of prison in 1985 . in 1988 , a passaic county prosecutor filed a motion to dismiss the charges . by that time , carter was a cause celebre . in addition to the dylan tune , his case had drawn the attention of a heavyweight counterpart , muhammad ali , and actor burt reynolds , among others . his plight has also inspired at least a half dozen books , including his own autobiography , written from prison . a major motion picture that opened years after carter 's release would earn actor denzel washington his fourth oscar nomination .  god bless rubin carter and his tireless fight to ensure justice for all ,  washington said sunday . the 1999 film played a key role in introducing carter to an audience that had not followed his two-decade legal saga , but the ex-boxer said washington , in a way , also introduced him to himself . in his 2011 book ,  eye of the hurricane : my path from darkness to freedom ,  carter explained that he was not perfect and conceded guilt to a host of regrettable crimes including assaults and robberies -- but not murder . those crimes , he said , were perpetrated when he was blind , operating unconsciously -- a recurring theme in his book -- and they were the product of the anger to which he succumbed growing up under jim crow , he said . people we 've lost in 2014 .", "summary": " denzel washington : god bless rubin carter and his tireless fight .   carter wrote in a 2011 book that he was guilty of other crimes but not murder .   a federal judge said carter and another man failed to receive fair trials .   carter lived in toronto after he was freed from prison .
