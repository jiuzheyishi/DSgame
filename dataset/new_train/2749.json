{"text": "tampa , florida in the halls of the tampa bay buccaneers practice facility , players can be seen carrying ipads everywhere they go . they 're not goofing off or taking a break , it 's part of their weekly football practice . the bucs are one of two nfl teams , along with the baltimore ravens , that have purchased ipads for their players and coaches to use instead of the standard playbook . baseball and hockey leagues have also taken notice of the advantages of mobile technology . bucs players no longer need to haul paper-filled binders and stacks of dvds from practice to home in order to continually prepare for game day . while there are still nfl restrictions on how computer tablets can be used , these devices are slowly starting to change the way professional teams operate , offering high-quality video and internet connectivity almost anywhere . just before this season , the bucs moved the team 's playbook , a huge three-ring binder , into a custom app on the tablet . it plays nfl films used to study upcoming opponents , says general manager mark dominik .  it was a smashing success for our players . they loved it ,  he said . the team printed paper playbooks as a backup this year , but dominik says next year ,  we 're going green  -- no paper playbooks . the bucs first developed a customized application on the ipad as a draft tool to allow coaches to watch college games while evaluating players involved in the draft , said head coach raheem morris .  i was able to watch college players on the ipad while in the car or in the hotel ,  morris said . after the success of the draft tool app , the bucs ' owners approved the purchase of 150 ipads and 90 were handed out to players and coaches . they were loaded with the bucs ' newly updated custom application .  everyone loves this , man . it 's very helpful ,  said bucs defensive tackle gerald mccoy . but do n't expect to see the tablets on the sidelines of games , in locker rooms or in the coaches ' booth . nfl rules prohibit the use of any electronic computers , tablets or recording devices within 90 minutes of kickoff .  polaroid-type cameras  are the only device allowed to be used during a game , according to nfl rules . the cameras capture high angle still images of the field , which are printed on paper near the players ' benches on the field , giving the teams a different view of what their opponents are doing on the field . nfl spokesman brian mccarthy says the league is  strategically holding back  on technology advancements .  we try to keep as much of the human element in the game ,  he said . in addition , he said , the nfl 's strategy is to keep competition fair among all the teams . even if the nfl allowed computer tablets on the sidelines , it 's unlikely that apple 's ipads would be used , because the league 's major sponsor motorola has a tablet , the xoom . motorola tablets not selling . with 11 million ipads recently sold , according to apple 's financial report , app developers are scrambling to get the attention of young professional athletes who are accustomed to apple products . one of those developers , bloomberg sports , decided to give ipads to professional baseball players so they could review its newly developed app ,  pitch review ,  created exclusively for professional baseball players .  we did n't have to ,  said bill squadron with bloomberg sports .  because every player had an ipad .  the front office management of 19 out of 30 baseball clubs have adopted apps like pitch review , which features statistics , averages and video clips that can be customized . the national hockey league is also utilizing mobile technology , allowing its live games to be broadcast through paid subscriptions to nhl gamecenter live on mobile devices including tablets . but not everyone in professional sports has immediately embraced the technology .  our dinosaurs have been our coaches ,  said dominik .  -lrb- they -rrb- are older and used to the more traditional way of doing things .  the bucs ' linebacker coach , joe baker , admitted he was  a little skeptical  when the team started using ipads . his concerns were rooted in a past experience , when another team he worked for started using laptops . at the time , he said , it was a poor integration of technology and the team 's needs . today , he admits things have changed .  to have all that information at your fingertips accessible and convenient ,  said baker .  it 's a godsend .  baker and the other coaches said they believe the ipads have helped improved their players ' study habits . morris points out that the players ' motivation was already there , the technology has just helped them capitalize on it .  at the end of the day these guys want to be great , so they want to study their opponents ,  said morris .  so they have the ability to be -lrb- great -rrb- and that 's the desire that makes them watch it .  bucs linebacker geno hayes says the easy access to watching plays has created a kind of addiction .  i use it on a daily basis , sometimes my girlfriend gets mad at me because i 'm so into it ,  hayes said .  i 'm watching films all day .
