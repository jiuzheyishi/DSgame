{"text": "attorneys for the family of a former florida a&m football player fatally shot by police in charlotte , north carolina , have filed a civil lawsuit against several parties connected to his death . according to the complaint filed monday by jonathan ferrell 's mother , the family is targeting the city of charlotte , mecklenburg county , charlotte-mecklenburg police chief rodney monroe and the shooter , officer randall kerrick . the mother , georgia ferrell , said tuesday that she hopes the lawsuit will lead to changes in the way charlotte-mecklenburg police are trained .  i do n't know if it will bring peace , but i hope and pray that -lrb- in -rrb- doing this ... that they get the proper training ,  ferrell said at a news conference , flanked by her two attorneys . kerrick shot an unarmed ferrell , 24 , in september after a woman -- home alone with her 1-year-old child -- called 911 and reported that someone was trying to break down her front door . it was 2:35 a.m. , and according to the lawsuit , the woman  does not understand that jonathan may be injured and is in need of assistance and becomes frightened by his presence on her doorstep at such a late hour . she quickly closes the door , calls 911 for assistance and activates her home security system ,  the lawsuit states . the woman told police ferrell was  yelling for her to turn her alarm off ,  but never reported that ferrell harmed her , made threatening statements , brandished a weapon or stole or vandalized her property , the lawsuit further alleges . police were dispatched , and ferrell walked down the street to seek assistance elsewhere , according to the lawsuit . kerrick and two other officers arrived on the scene about 11 minutes after the 911 call , but kerrick did n't speak with the woman , the lawsuit says . he instead tracked down ferrell , who  never engages in any conduct which can be objectively reasonably interpreted as aggravated active aggression ,  according to the lawsuit .  defendant kerrick , in direct violation of written cmpd regulations , fires 12 high-velocity bullets at jonathan , striking him 10 times in the chest and arms ,  the lawsuit continues . kerrick is accused in the lawsuit of failing to recognize ferrell was injured and unarmed , failing to identify himself and failing to adequately assess the situation before firing his weapon . the lawsuit further alleges that kerrick used  stealth and surprise  in approaching ferrell and  negligently failed to realize that , because of the dim lighting in the area , jonathan would be startled , frightened and unable to see his approach and commands .   afterwards , as he lay dying on the ground in a pool of his own blood , on information and belief , jonathan struggled to breathe and , in effect , drowned in his own blood . in short , upon information and belief , jonathan experienced excruciating and horrible physical pain and mental suffering as he died from gunshot wounds inflicted upon him by defendant kerrick ,  the lawsuit states . the 25-page lawsuit , which devotes about two pages to citing allegations of misconduct and excessive force by charlotte police since 1997 , seeks monetary relief of more than $ 10,000 , though the exact amount is n't specified . back in october , family attorney chris chestnut accused kerrick of  cold-blooded murder ,  saying the incident was caught on a dashboard camera of a police cruiser at the scene . ferrell was involved in a serious wreck a block away and was only seeking help , according to chestnut . kerrick has been charged with felony voluntary manslaughter , meaning he is accused of either using excessive force in self-defense or shooting ferrell without the intent to kill him . he is free on $ 50,000 bond .  we are confident that at the resolution of this case , it will be found that officer kerrick 's actions were justified on the night in question ,  his attorney , michael greene , said in september . the charlotte-mecklenburg police department has called the shooting unlawful .  the evidence revealed that mr. ferrell did advance on officer kerrick and the investigation showed that the subsequent shooting of mr. ferrell was excessive ,  police said in a statement on september 14 , the day of the shooting .  our investigation has shown that officer kerrick did not have a lawful right to discharge his weapon during this encounter .  the statement further said ,  it has devastated a family as well as caused a great deal of sadness and anxiety in our organization .  police used the words  charged ,   ran  and  advanced  in describing ferrell 's interaction with police . but chestnut said the young man merely walked  briskly  toward them and surmised that ferrell was relieved police had arrived to help him after he wrecked his car . an officer tried to subdue ferrell with a stun gun but was  unsuccessful ,  police have said . kerrick opened fire after that . at the time of his death , the former gymnast , famu chemistry major and safety for the football team was working at both dillard 's department store and best buy , to save money to complete his education as an automotive engineer , the lawsuit says . his fiancee , cache heidel , told cnn in october that ferrell had been out with friends the night he was shot . he had just given a coworker a ride home , about 17 miles east of central charlotte , and on his way back to his own home , ferrell drove off the road , down an embankment and into a group of trees , the lawsuit says . ferrell could n't find his phone , and his car doors were jammed shut , so ferrell kicked out the back window of the car and walked a half mile to a home where he knocked on the door for help , according to the lawsuit . family members have said ferrell was a happy , outgoing guy . heidel described him as someone who was always joking and finding ways to make people smile . his demeanor was so gentle and caring , she said , that she nicknamed him  sweets .   he 's always a joy to be around . he cared so much for other people , more so than himself ,  she said in her october interview . she said she hopes kerrick is convicted and that her fiance 's death will spur dialogue across the nation .  that is a hope i have , that his death will resound for a country that prides itself on being diverse and inclusive and accepting everyone for who they are ,  she said .", "summary": " new : ferrell 's mother :  i hope and pray  lawsuit will prompt training changes for police .   24-year-old suffered  excruciating
