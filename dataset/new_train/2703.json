{"text": "cleveland first came the pain -- a decade of torture , torment and terror for three captive women and one of their young daughters . now comes the prosecution and -- if there 's a conviction -- punishment for the man accused of being responsible for their hell . ariel castro appeared silently in court thursday , his head down , as he was arraigned on four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape , accused of holding the women captive in his cleveland home . cleveland municipal court judge lauren moore ordered castro held on $ 8 million bond -- $ 2 million for each of the three women and the child born to amanda berry before they were freed monday evening . hours later , the top prosecutor in cuyahoga county , ohio , announced he 'd press for more charges --  for each and every act of sexual violence ... each day of kidnapping , every felonious assault -lrb- and -rrb- all his attempted murders .  furthermore , prosecutor timothy mcginty said he 'd try to persuade a grand jury to indict the 52-year-old castro for  aggravated murder  for the termination of his captives ' pregnancies . he cited a state law that a person can be charged with murder -- a conviction that could lead to the death penalty in ohio -- for killing unborn children . cnn exclusive : ` we do n't have monster in our blood ' according to an initial incident report obtained by cnn , michelle knight said she became pregnant at least five times while in castro 's 1,400-square-foot home . when that happened , she told investigators , castro  starved her for at least two weeks , then he repeatedly punched her in the stomach until she miscarried .  it is not known how many times , if any , the other two women got pregnant only to miscarry . one of them , berry , gave birth to a daughter while in captivity . that 's just one of the brutal tales reported so far about the women 's captivity , which mcginty described as  beyond comprehension .   the child kidnapper operated a torture chamber and private prison in the heart of the city ,  he told reporters .  the horrific brutality and torture that the victims endured for a decade is beyond comprehension .  castro 's own mother is among those trying to make sense of the horror .  i have a sick son who has done something serious ,  she told univision and telemundo .  i 'm suffering very much . i ask for forgiveness from those mothers ; may those girls forgive me .  source : writings detail actions , reasons behind them . so what was going through the suspect 's mind , when he allegedly lured three women into a car between 2002 and 2004 , took them to his home three miles away and held them there -- where they were chained , threatened and repeatedly sexually assaulted ? neither castro , his attorneys nor police have spelled out a motive publicly . the suspect has talked with investigators , confessing to some of the actions of which he 's accused , said a law enforcement source closely involved with the investigation . the source did not describe precisely what castro confessed to when he was interrogated . plus , investigators have asked the state crime lab to expedite tests to create a dna profile of castro -- something that typically takes 20 days , but should be back friday -- said ohio attorney general 's office spokesman dan tierney . they 're also poring over evidence , including more than 200 items seized from castro 's seymour avenue home . among them are writings authorities believe were written by the suspect , said two law enforcement sources closely involved in the case . those contain  specific detailing of actions and reasons behind actions  tied to the women 's abduction and their kidnapper 's behavior toward them , one of the law enforcement sources said . the author cites his own history of abuse by family members as justification . the latest developments in the cleveland case . the source -- who described the  pretty lengthy  writings as  more of a diary  -- said they included talk of suicide , though that 's just one of many aspects . authorities are working  meticulously  to see whether others were involved in the kidnapping plot . two of castro 's brothers , pedro and onil , were initially arrested in the case only to be released thursday -- after appearing in court on unrelated cases -- when investigators found nothing , including from the victims ' interviews , linking them to the abductions . one of his daughters , angie gregg , told cnn that she  just wanted to die  upon hearing her father had been implicated . but looking back , she thinks there were signs of something awry -- such as how her father  kept his house locked down so tight  and would sometimes leave mysteriously for an hour or so , then return , with  no explanation .   everything 's making sense now ,  gregg said .  it 's all adding up , and i 'm just disgusted .  source : death threat if newborn died . according to the initial incident report , the women said castro first chained them in the basement but later let them live upstairs on the second floor . the women went outside only twice during their ordeal -- and just  briefly  at that , cleveland public safety director martin flask said . most of the time the three would be in different rooms , though they interacted occasionally and came to  rely on each other for survival ,  said a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the investigation . one thing they could count on was that their alleged captor would n't let them out . castro would often test his captives by pretending to leave , the law enforcement source said . then he 'd suddenly return ; if there were indications any of the women had moved , they 'd be disciplined . survival the key difference from ` house of horrors ' case . while knight told investigators castro forced her to miscarry her own unborn children , she said he ordered her to deliver berry 's child , according to a police source familiar with the investigation . the baby was delivered in a plastic tub or pool in order to contain the afterbirth and amniotic fluid , the source said . panic ensued soon after . the child stopped breathing , and everyone started screaming , the source said , citing accounts by the young women . knight said castro threatened to kill her if the baby did not survive , the initial police report states .  what 's most incredible here is that this girl who knows nothing about childbirth was able to deliver a baby that is now a healthy 6-year-old ,  the source said . ' i do n't think she would have lived very much longer ' knight remained hospitalized in good condition thursday , said metrohealth medical center spokeswoman tina shaerban-arundel . the others held -- berry , her 6-year-old daughter and georgina  gina  dejesus -- are back with relatives . fbi specialists who talked with them feel they  desperately need space and time ,  said mcginty . who are berry , dejesus and knight ?  these victims need to be decompressed ,  he said .  they need a chance to heal before we seek further in-depth evidence from them .  those close to them , as well as residents of cleveland and beyond , are trying to make sense of the alleged depravity . one of them is arlene castro , the suspect 's daughter and once a very good friend of dejesus . she was interviewed on an  america 's most wanted  segment in 2005 talking about how she 'd been with dejesus , hoping to spend the afternoon with her , shortly before her abduction . speaking thursday on abc 's  good morning america ,  she said she last spoke with her father late last month , adding the two had never been close . whatever their relationship , she insisted ,  i had no idea  what was happening .  i 'm really disappointed , embarrassed , mainly devastated ,  arlene castro said .  ... i would like to say that i 'm absolutely so , so sorry .  women crushed by news her father allegedly abducted her friend . fern gentry said on cnn 's  starting point  thursday that hearing berry , her granddaughter , was alive 10 years after her disappearance was the  most important thing that ever happened in my life .  gentry , who spoke to berry by phone from her tennessee home tuesday , said she 's grateful for all involved in the case -- from police to helpful neighbors -- and that her granddaughter can now live her life .  if she had n't got out , i do n't think she would have lived very much longer ,  gentry said . timeline : from missing to liberated . cnn 's pamela brown reported from cleveland , and cnn 's greg botelho reported and wrote from atlanta . cnn 's holly yan , matt smith , rose arce , chandler friedman , poppy harlow , brian todd , tory dunnan , martin savidge , justin lear and laura ly contributed to this report .", "summary": " new : ariel castro 's mother :  i have a sick son , who has done something serious    new : castro 's daughter :  it 's all adding up , and i 'm just disgusted    prosecutor says he 'll seek to charge castro with murder for ending captives ' pregnancies .   already charged with kidnapping and rape , castro is being held on $ 8 million bail .
