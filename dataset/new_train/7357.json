' lacking confidence : one in two british women are not happy with what they see in the mirror . ` there are a whole swathe of women who are not obsessed by ageing or looks but at the same time just want to look the best they can , ' added another , helen williams , 38 . the survey and focus group was conducted on behalf of organic skincare brand , pai , which is also participating in the government-led campaign to encourage women to feel better about the way they look and conducting an age confidence campaign of its own . ` as a 37 year old woman , i resent being told my days of looking and feeling my best are numbered , and that i should trolley-dash my way around my local beauty hall to  save  myself from lines and wrinkles , ' said pai skincare founder , sarah brown . ` age confidence is an antidote to anti-ageing quick fixes , and encourages women to take a healthier approach to both their skin and their self-image . ` rather than looking ten years younger , out research shows women 's real beauty ambition is to look and feel fantastic in the skin they 're in . ` it 's time brands started to celebrate beauty at every age , and help build rather than break down healthy self-images with positive beauty messages . ' ageing beautifully : dame helen mirren and dame judi dench have both embraced growing older . the government 's body confidence campaign was launched as part of the coalition 's ` create a fairer and more equal society ' policy , and aims to widen the definition of beauty represented inmainstream culture to include all ages , shapes , sizes and ethnicities . jo swinson , minister for women and equalities , and the mp in charge of the government plan , said : ` there is evidence to suggest that women over 40 experience high levels of dissatisfaction with their weight and bodies in comparison to their younger years . ` that 's a huge , and largely hidden , reservoir of distress that we need to understand more fully and take action on more effectively . ' i want to question the veneration of ` eternal youth ' that dominates the beauty industry , and highlight the negative influence it has on women 's self-image -- particularly with regards to ageing , ' added brown . ` together , both campaigns show that it 's time the beauty industry and regulatory bodies unite to make marketing more responsible and work towards building healthy self-images rather than destroying them . ' negative : pai skincare founder sarah brown thinks there is too much pressure on women to stay youthful .", "summary": " one in two british women are unhappy with their looks .   ironically , 88 % asked said confidence is secret of beauty .   government has launched campaign to boost confidence .
