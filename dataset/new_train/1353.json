{"text": "warm water is brewing in the pacific , resurrecting claims that a much-anticipated el niño may be on its way . el niño - a heating of sea-surface temperatures in the pacific - affects wind patterns and can trigger both floods and droughts in different parts of the globe . now , for the first time , scientists have mapped how flood risks change across the world when an extreme el niño hits the oceans . scroll down for video . for the first time , scientists have mapped how flood risks change when an extreme el niño hits the oceans . pictured is the percentage of land experiencing changes in flood volume with return periods of 100 years , during el niño years -lrb- top -rrb- and la niña years -lrb- bottom -rrb- . their study shows how some areas are exposed to dangerous floods that can damage buildings , put people 's lives at danger , while other areas get a reprieve from drought . ' a lot of scientific effort has been put into modelling physical hazards themselves , ' philip ward , who led the new study told discovery news . ` only much more recently have we started looking at the damage and being able to model that damage . ' according to a report by roz pidcock at carbon brief , the latest map was created using detailed hydrological models . pictured is the percentage of land experiencing changes in economic damages during el nino years -lrb- top -rrb- and la nina years -lrb- bottom -rrb- . in el niño years , 10 per cent of the globe sees higher than normal damages , while 19 per cent sees lower than normal . el niño and la niña are opposite phases of what is known as the el niño / southern oscillation -lrb- enso -rrb- cycle , says the noaa . the enso cycle is a scientific term that describes the fluctuations in temperature between the ocean and atmosphere in the east-central equatorial pacific -lrb- approximately between the international date line and 120 degrees west -rrb- . la niña is sometimes referred to as the cold phase of enso and el niño as the warm phase . these deviations from normal surface temperatures can have large-scale impacts not only on ocean processes , but also on global weather and climate . el niño and la niña episodes typically last nine to 12 months , but some prolonged events may last for years . they often begin to form between june and august , reach peak strength between december and april , and then decay between may and july of the following year . while their periodicity can be quite irregular , el niño and la niña events occur about every three to five years . typically , el niño occurs more frequently than la niña . researchers at amsterdam 's global change institute compared the amount of flooding in el niño and la niña years to the average from all years between 1958 to 2000 . the study also looked at its opposite phase , la niña , which occurs when winds in the equatorial pacific causes a shift to cooler than normal ocean temperatures . it found that 44 per cent of river basins around the world saw changes in 100-year flood risks during el niño or la niña years . in one map , around 34 per cent of the world 's land area experiences a change in the amount of flooding in el niño years , compared to 38 per cent in la niña years . the biggest increases in flood risk were found in southwest united states , parts of southern south america and the horn of africa . meanwhile , the sahel region of africa and most of australia saw the biggest decreases in flood risks . the researchers also looked at how the weather pattern cause economic damage caused by flooding . in el niño years , 10 per cent of the globe sees higher than normal damages , while 19 per cent sees lower than normal . the red colour in the map below shows regions where flooding decreases in el niño or la niña years . a darker the red , the lower the risk compared to normal . ` there have been studies -lsb- showing -rsb- that some areas get more rainfall during el niño years , but more rainfall does n't necessarily mean more floods , ' professor ward said . ` so we 're looking at the actual flooding and damages caused by flooding . ' these do n't always match an increase in rainfall . for instance , the southeast of the us is often cooler and wetter during an el niño , but the impact of flooding as a whole was n't severe . scientists recently suggested that ecuador is about to be hit by eastward-moving waves of warm water , suggesting that el niño may be on its way . the most recent waves increase the chances that parched california could be in for some relief - albeit small - if weather patterns take a turn later this year . but nasa has warned that ` fickle ' el niño will likely be weak if it does appear , providing only limited relief for a drought-ridden west coast . strong el niño events occur every 20 years or so . on the left , the village of puerto maldonado , peru , is seen flooded in january 2003 as a result of el niño rains , which drove 16,000 people from their homes . the worst el niño on record in 1997 to 1998 was blamed for massive flooding along china 's yangtze river , right , that killed over 1,500 people . kelvin waves of high sea level -lrb- red/yellow -rrb- are seen crossing the pacific ocean at the equator . the waves may be due to el niño events . green indicates normal sea level , and blue/purple areas are lower than normal .", "summary": " el niño - a heating of sea temperatures in the pacific - affects winds and can trigger both floods and droughts .   scientists have now mapped how flood risks change when an el niño and its opposite , la niña , hit the oceans .   they found 44 per cent of river basins around world saw changes in 100-year flood risks during these events .   biggest increases in flood risk were found in southwest us , parts of southern south america and horn of africa .   but it also found that the sahel region of africa and most of australia saw the biggest decreases in flood risks .
