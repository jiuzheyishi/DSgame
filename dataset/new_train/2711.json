{"text": "do you ever look at your smartphone and think it 's just too stiff and flat ? a growing number of tech giants have , and they 're aiming to fix that with what may become the next wave of smartphone innovation . lg announced on monday that it will start mass-producing a flexible , curved smartphone screen . its first devices to use the new 6-inch oled screens will be available next year . several companies have shown prototypes of flexible displays before , but so far there have n't been any mass-market bendy phones . samsung announced a similar screen technology last month and plans to release the 5.7-inch galaxy note 3 , its first device with a curved display , later in october . apple has long been rumored to be looking into similar technology for the iphone . a patent filed in march describes an  electronic device with wrap around display  that would go around most , or all , of the device . apple , like other companies , sometimes files patents for products that never come to market . what 's clear in the minds of many is that the coming wave of flexible and curved displays is just the first step in what could become a dramatic shift in what we expect of our phones .  what we 're seeing today is a big step toward a break from the rectangular norm of smartphone design , paving the way for more outlandish shapes and sizes for future devices ,  aaron souppouris , of tech blog the verge , wrote monday . since apple released the keyboard-killing iphone , the physical design of smartphones has pretty much stagnated . the touchscreen rectangles have appeared in different sizes , and recently companies like motorola and apple have tried to spice things up with different colors and patterns on the back . but the basic look is the same . most of the serious competition takes place inside the devices . manufacturers compete for the best camera , the fastest processor , the widest selection of apps and , of course , low price tags . when all those specs are close and the devices start to blend together , companies turn to splashier -- some might say gimmicky -- features to try to make their 5-inch android smartphones stand out from the other guy 's 5-inch android smartphones . the samsung galaxy s4 has a motion-controlled scrolling feature to make it easier to read text without tiring your fingers . apple recently added a fingerprint sensor that makes it faster to unlock your phone . some companies are trying to change how you interact with your phone , such as apple and google , which are pushing voice-activated interfaces like siri and google voice . and now there are curved displays . lg says its technology works because the panels are built not on glass , but on plastic substrates . also called wafers , substrates are thin slices of material that act as semiconductors . the new lg display will curve in from top to bottom . so , other than the  gee whiz  factor , what are the advantages of a curved or flexible screen for smartphone owners ? to start , a flexible display is thinner and lighter than a glass display . in a field where companies -lrb- apple chief among them -rrb- brag about being a fraction of an inch or a few millimeters thinner than the competition , that 's apparently an issue . lg and others also market the screens as unbreakable . it 's not entirely clear what the practical benefits are of a curved , concave 6-inch screen , beyond the novelty of having a curved screen . samsung has said that a curved screen would have more viewing space in the same footprint . there are already curved tvs on the market that use similar technology . they take advantage of the flexible oled displays and offer a screen that curves in towards the viewer on the left and right sides , supposedly for a more immersive visual experience . the effect wo n't work the same way on a small 6-inch screen , though . the tv panels are stuck in their curved position permanently and can not actually be re-bent , so the flexibility is gone . the other big mobile trend that has been bubbling up over the past year is wearable peripheral devices that connect to your smartphone , like smart glasses and watches . if lg or samsung gets the flexible display technology right , it could prove extremely useful in the new wave of small screens that the tech industry is betting we 'll wear on our bodies in the coming years . the bulky and poorly received samsung galaxy gear smartwatch , for example , could greatly benefit from a screen that molds to your wrist instead of the giant solid square it sports now . cnn 's doug gross contributed to this report .", "summary": " lg is working on a flexible , curved screen for 6-inch smartphones .   samsung recently announced a similar technology .   the durable , bent screens could be the next smartphone fad and even appear on smartwatches .
