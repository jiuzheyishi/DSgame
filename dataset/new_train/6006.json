{"text": "roma have slapped a # 50million price tag on in-demand defender medhi benatia . the morocco international has attracted interest from the likes of barcelona and chelsea - while manchester city had a # 16.5 million offer rejected on friday . the premier league champions are also interested in porto 's french defender eliaquim mangala , although he is believed to prefer a move to chelsea . benatia has been fined by roma for publicly criticising their latest contract offer , accusing the club of treating him ` like a child ' after being offered what he considered an ` unacceptable ' pay rise . priced out of the market ? roma have put a # 50m price tag on manchester city target medhi benatia . however , club director walter sabatini insists the 27-year-old will not be allowed to leave for less than 61million euros -lrb- # 50million -rrb- . speaking on roma 's official website , sabatini said : ` mehdi is a great player with a contract that expires in four years ' time . we have no problem with him . case for the defence : city have shown interest in medhi benatia -lrb- l -rrb- and eliaquim mangala -lrb- r -rrb- . ` perhaps he slipped up with a few comments or words but he did n't intend to distance himself from roma or the fans . he mentioned broken promises . that 's not exactly how it went . it 's true that when he signed for roma he turned down other offers that were higher than ours . ' i said to him : ` you try and play like benatia and we 'll give you an improved contract . ' we offered him an increase -- although there was no obligation for us to do so -- and we did n't agree on the amount , but he did n't mean to describe it as ` ridiculous . ' he 's speaking a language that 's not his own -- you ca n't slaughter him for it . ' blues in the red : city won the premier league but will have their spending restricted by ffp regulations . sabatini stressed that benatia would stay at roma and accused the player 's agent , moussa sissoko , of creating problems . ` i 'd like to remind this man that 30 million is the price i believe benatia 's weak foot to be worth , his left . his right foot is worth at least a million more . so you do the maths . ' ` as i 've said , the player is not for sale , but if his agent wants to speculate on a price for him , then any clubs who are interested should consider him to be worth 61 million . ` if someone were to offer that amount , then i do n't think i could guarantee that he would stay 100 percent .
