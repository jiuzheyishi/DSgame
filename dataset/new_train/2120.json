{"text": "the late house speaker tip o'neill once said ,  all politics is local .  certainly there is some truth to this in the roman catholic church . most practicing catholics experience the church through the parish they attend , and its sacramental life through the priests who minister there . those priests are ordained for a particular diocese that exists , along with others , within a particular geographic area administered by its local bishop . that bishop is named by the pope , but it is the vatican congregation for bishops in rome that has major influence in determining who is selected as a bishop and where he is assigned to administrate . and this is where pope francis is making his agenda felt this week . by removing the american cardinals raymond burke and justin rigali from the congregation for bishops and appointing cardinal donald wuerl , he is signaling the most radical kind of change -- one that will affect the church 's hierarchical structure from top to bottom . it is bishops who determine the tenor and emphases of local church communities . the congregation for bishops is being peopled by a different kind of person , who will implement francis ' vision of a church governed as much by compassion as by orthodoxy . this is a big deal . while burke champions traditional marriage , condemns abortion and cherishes fine vestments , rigali appeared less sensitive to the gravity of the priest-pedophilia tragedy , positions associated with roman catholic conservatives . by removing these men , francis is shifting emphasis and establishing different priorities . but wuerl is hardly a liberal . while the new bishop of pittsburgh deviated from his predecessor 's practice of washing only men 's feet and included women at the holy thursday service , a gesture associated with jesus ' serving his disciples , he also accepted rome 's request to serve as coadjutor of the diocese of seattle when its bishop expressed views regarding homosexuality , divorce and the priesthood that rome considered too liberal . he also was executive secretary of a papally mandated study of u.s. seminaries . so he is not so easily pigeonholed as either liberal or conservative . he takes pastoral initiative , seeming to believe that  authentic power is service ,  as francis has said , but he is also a loyal son . described in a 2013 national catholic reporter article as  dead center of the bishops ' conference ,  he is reported as saying ,  in the pulpit we 're supposed to present the teaching with all of its unvarnished clarity , but when you step out of the pulpit , you have to meet people where they are and try to walk with them .  francis has reconstituted the congregation for bishops beyond the replacement of two american prelates . all of his new appointments to the congregation , we may be sure , accord with his perspective : compassion and solidarity are at the forefront . he prioritizes the hopes and the anguish of the people he seeks to serve rather than abstract right teaching . consistent with francis ' own witness to date and his efforts so far to renew the curia -lrb- the vatican bureaucracy -rrb- , this appointment of carefully selected men to the congregation for bishops , men who share his priorities , may well be the most powerful tool available to him to effect far-reaching and sustained change -- in every parish throughout the entire world . in his book  pope francis : why he leads the way he leads ,  chris lowney begins each chapter with a quotation from francis . these speak eloquently to why burke and rigali have been replaced , not for anything bad they have done but because of the new emphasis francis desires to bring to his papacy . introducing  the new leader  chapter :  today 's world stands in great need of witnesses , not so much of teachers but rather of witnesses . it 's not so much about speaking , but speaking with our whole lives .  perhaps this is why francis shared his birthday breakfast tuesday with four homeless men . for chapter 4 ,  washing feet : authentic power is service  :  this is a symbol , it is a sign . ... washing feet means , ' i am at your service . ' as a priest and as a bishop i must be at your service .  was it not at an italian prison that francis washed feet last holy thursday , including the feet of muslim girls ? a third and telling quotation is taken from francis ' address to brazilian bishops in july :  -lrb- u -rrb- nless we train ministers capable of warming people 's hearts , of walking with them in the night , of dialoguing with their hopes and disappointments , of mending their brokenness , what hope can we have for our present and future journey ?  no doubt francis wants to guarantee that those who are appointed bishops are in accord with this perspective . francis , as he has presented himself , is neither conservative nor liberal . he is not about ideology but about the gospel . matthew 25 comes readily to mind : feed the hungry , give drink to the thirsty , welcome the stranger , cloth the naked , care for the sick , visit those in prison -- as do the admonitions in matthew 7:1 :  judge not , that you may not be judged ,  and 1 colossians 3:13 :  as the lord has forgiven you , so you must also do .  the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of alice l. laffey .", "summary": " alice laffey : pope signals radical change by upending congregation of bishops .   she says congregation helps pick bishops , who will implement francis ' vision .   she says mandate not about politics but compassion and solidarity with those served .   laffey : this is powerful tool for him to effect far-reaching , sustained change around world .
