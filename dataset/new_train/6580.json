' the council admitted its policy following a complaint from local shopkeeper nick lawrence , who runs regal shoe repairs in sevenoaks . mr lawrence said he and at least five other shopkeepers had contacted the council to report a car with polish number plates which had illegally parked in the town centre . difficulty : parking chiefs claim it is ` impossible ' for them to enforce penalty charges against the owners of foreign-registered vehicles -lrb- file picture -rrb- . he claimed the dark blue volkswagen golf had been parked on double yellow lines for nearly a month - and was causing problems for delivery lorries attempting to get to the shops . he added that the car had not yet received a parking ticket , but a customer of his was given a # 60 fine ` within minutes ' after parking her uk-registered car behind the vehicle last week . ` last friday , one of my customers pulled up on double yellows behind the polish car and ran into my shop for a couple of minutes , ' he told the sevenoaks chronicle . ` when she went back she was being given a parking ticket . i was outraged - my customer was there for a few minutes and the polish car had been parked illegally for weeks and weeks . ` it 's discrimination against british drivers and i think it 's absolutely unbelievable . ' today , a dvla spokesman confirmed that there would be ` no point ' in british councils contacting the government-run agency about foreign-registered cars - as it does n't hold any details about . them . the spokesman said that , by law , foreign vehicles must be registered with the dvla after being in the . country for six months . if the owner of a car did not declare . the vehicle being in britain by then , it would be ' a matter for the police to enforce ' , she said . ` the dvla will only have a record of a foreign-registered car if the owner contacts us after six months , ' she said . ` they are entitled to be in the country for six months , but after they it must legally be registered with the dvla .

' today , the volkswagen golf ` suddenly vanished ' after mr lawrence confronted the owner of the illegally parked vehicle . mr lawrence said : ' i saw the guy and had a word . in his ear and he moved the car . ` he . wo n't be back again , but he 's probably parked on double yellows . somewhere else in town safe in the knowledge he wo n't be getting a . parking ticket . ' the sevenoaks district council spokesman said they know who . the owner is and have written to him . ` we have written to the owner informing him that he is not . permitted to park in this location and advised him that he has a legal . duty to register the vehicle with the dvla once it has been in this . country for six months , ' he said . it is estimated that there are between 30,000 and 40,000 foreign-registered cars on britain 's roads illegally .", "summary": " sevenoaks council in kent told wardens not to put tickets on foreign cars .   parking chiefs say it is ` impossible ' to enforce penalty fines against owners .   locals have branded the council 's policy a ` total joke ' and ` discrimination '   dvla has confirmed there is ` no point ' councils reporting foreign vehicles .   claims it does not hold details about cars that are in uk under six months .
