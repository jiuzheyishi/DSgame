' i know her , she 's not anorexic or unhealthy and eats a very good diet . she 's just a naturally thin person . ruling : the asa acted after receiving a complaint claiming the model -lrb- left -rrb- ` looked anorexic ' in the campaign . miss hendrick , pictured second from right at the 2010 scottish fashion awards , was recently voted scotland 's most stylish woman at the scotland style awards . ` do i think people should aspire to be like her ? yes , because she is a beautiful person and jets around the world earning # 600-plus a day . she 's got a successful career and no mental health problems . ` do i think removing a picture of amanda will stop people being mentally ill ? no , i do n't , but i accept the decision and so does amanda . ' the spat is the first black mark on an otherwise flawless career , which saw miss hendrick plucked from obscurity as a gawky 15-year-old by a talent spotter at glasgow 's central station . the former airdrie academy pupil was quickly snapped up by top modelling agency storm , which launched kate moss 's career , after she was runner-up in the nivea model search 2004 competition . since then , she has gone on to feature on the cover of vogue and elle fashion magazines , modelled for christian dior in the italian fashion capital milan , and completed a photo-shoot for glamour magazine , wearing cartier and valentino . she has also appeared at london and paris fashion weeks and will be the face of topshop 's christmas campaign . shooting star : the spat is the first black mark on an otherwise flawless career , which saw miss hendrick plucked from obscurity as a gawky 15-year-old by a talent spotter at glasgow 's central station . according to her online profile , she is 5ft 10ins with a 24-inch waist - 10in smaller than the average british woman and just an inch bigger than that of victoria beckham , who has sparked health fears because her 23-inch waist is the size of a typical seven-year-old child 's . the asa 's ruling said : ` the asa considered the model was very slim . we also noted that in the bikini and denim shorts images , hollows in her thighs were noticeable and she had prominent thigh bones . ` we considered that in combination with the stretched out pose and heavy eye make-up , the model looked underweight in the pictures . ` while we considered the bikini and denim short images might not cause widespread or serious offence , we concluded they were socially irresponsible . ' early in her career , the raven-haired beauty reflected on how her life had changed so dramatically from being teased by classmates about her height to becoming one of europe 's most sought-after models . she said : ' i was a goth at school and did n't really hang around with all the popular kids . ` they used to shout things at me and called me ugly but i did n't let it bother me . i still find it hard to believe that people think that i can now be a model . ' i think it shows you can just be yourself and have an individual look . everyone does n't have to be the same . i just hope i can continue to be successful because modelling has given me the chance to travel and experience new places and i want to continue to do that . ' miss hendrick is currently represented by london-based select model management and glasgow 's colours agency . both declined to comment .", "summary": " amanda hendrick , 21 , recently voted scotland 's most stylish woman .
