{"text": "people in china are undergoing risky surgery in order to make their voice more masculine or feminine . people in china are undergoing risky surgery in order to make their voices more masculine or feminine . voice operations are the latest in a booming cosmetic surgery market , with doctors offering the procedures reporting that demand for the surgery has risen steadily in recent years . several clinics now offer people the surgery - which was traditionally carried out on patients undergoing a sex change . this is despite the known risk that surgery can cause loss of voice altogether , as well as pneumonia . academics say the rising popularity of these procedures shows the pressure chinese people are under to conform to gender stereotypes . one person who has had the surgery is lu xiang , 23 , who endured years of being mocked for his ` girly ' high pitched voice . ` for many years , my classmates and colleagues made fun of me because of my voice , calling me a sissy , ' lu told global times journalists . ' i could n't get a girlfriend either . ` women did n't see me as a real man , and instead treated me like one of their female friends because of my girly voice . ' lu 's voice did not drop during puberty and in his job as a call centre operator , he was frequently mistaken for a woman . people also assumed he was gay because of the way he spoke . so despite the potential risks of the surgery , he decided to go ahead and have an operation which would make his voice lower . it involved cutting a segment of cartilage from his larynx and injecting botox into his vocal cords . mr alasdair mace , an ent surgeon at charing cross hospital in london , told mailonline that botox causes the vocal chords to become shorter and more loose , deepening the voice . mr mace carries out around two ` voice surgeries ' a month , usually on patients undergoing a sex change , or patients with a defect in their voice through birth or injury . he said lu 's case is unusual because normally females transitioning to becoming male who are hoping for a deeper voice would be given testosterone therapy which works well to deepen their voice 's pitch . mr alasdair mace , an ent surgeon at charing cross hospital in london , carries out two ` voice surgeries ' a month , usually on patients undergoing a sex change , or patients with a defect in their voice through birth or injury . here , he explains to mailonline how a procedure to lower the pitch of the voice would work ... mr mace said : ` the pitch of the voice is determined by length , the thickness , and the tension of the vocal chords . ` you can stretch the vocal chords - the thinner they become , the higher the voice will go . ` the thicker and the more lax the vocal chords , the deeper you 'll go . ` botox makes the chords shorter , flatter and more floppy , deepening the voice . ` the chords are also attached to a bit of horse-shoe shaped cartilage called thyroid cartilage . ` if you cut a little bit of cartilage out and drop it back , this shortens , stiffens the chords and the voice will become deeper . ' he added that the botox injection is usually temporary . ` it 's a vacuous aim if you inject it into the vocal chords because it 'll wear off . so they keep having to come back . ' he added that the procedure carries well-known risks . he said : ` if you have too much you weaken the chords so they can no longer come together and you 'll lose your voice . ` the reason we have vocal cords is originally to protect the lungs from things going down the wrong way . ` there 's a risk of causing pneumonia by paralysing them . ` people having the procedure would have to know about the risks : losing the voice , the chest infections . ' lu underwent a surgical procedure presumably because he was already male and so testosterone therapy would not be appropriate . . he explained how the procedure works : ` the vocal chords are attached to a bit of horse-shoe shaped cartilage called thyroid cartilage . ` if you cut a little bit of cartilage out and drop it back , this shortens , stiffens the chords and the voice will become deeper . ' ` injecting botox makes the chords shorter , flatter and more floppy , deepening the voice . however , he added that the botox injection is usually temporary . ` botox paralyses muscles . you use it for wrinkles ; it only works for three to six months . which is why people have to keep going back for more . ` it 's a vacuous aim if you inject it into the vocal cords because it 'll wear off . so they keep having to come back for more injections . ' patients risk losing their voice temporarily , and catching chest infections , he added . he said : ` if you have too much you weaken the chords so they can no longer come together and you 'll lose your voice . ` the reason we have vocal cords originally is to protect the lungs from things going down the wrong way . even animals who do n't speak have vocal chords for this purpose . ` there 's a risk of causing pneumonia by paralysing them . people having the procedure would have to know about the risks : losing the voice , the chest infections . ' one chinese doctor says he has performed more than 200 vocal surgeries over the last four years . huang yideng , a doctor from the chinese people 's liberation army 118 hospital , said most people who came to him for surgery were men like lu with a high-pitched voice but wanted to sound more ` manly ' . women with low-pitched voices who wanted to sound more ` girly ' also opted for the procedure . one manager at a centre that carries out the operations said demand for the surgery from china has risen in recent years . zhou meiling , a manager of the yeson voice center in south korea , said four years ago about 20 chinese clients came to the clinic each year . last year , around 100 chinese patients visited , she said . scroll down for video . one 23-year-old man had a procedure which involved cutting a segment of cartilage from his larynx and injecting botox into his vocal cords . he wanted to sound deeper after years of his ` girly ' voice being mocked . many were seeking to improve their competitiveness in the job market . different procedures exist , but one option is to place titanium plates between the throat muscles , causing the vocal chord to stretch , raising the pitch , the telegraph reports . an incision can be made in the vocal chord , or part of it can be burnt away with a laser . this causes scarring which stiffens the chord , making the pitch higher . many might dismiss such cosmetic surgery as a symptom of vanity , but some academics blame rigid chinese gender roles . ` gender is performed , in the sense that men are expected to behave in ways that conform to preconceived ideas of masculinity , and women are expected to behave in ways that conform to preconceived ideas of femininity , ' chen yaya , of shanghai academy of social sciences , told the global times . people who already have normal voices , but still seek vocal surgery are doing so out of pressure to conform more fully to gender stereotypes , she said . she added : ` our society needs to be more inclusive of differences within genders , so that people with unconventional voices or other characteristics that do n't conform to their gender stereotype wo n't be pressured into the pain of surgery .
