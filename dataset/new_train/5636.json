{"text": "david cameron offered an olive branch to christians last night , issuing the most overtly religious christmas message by a prime minister in recent times . he quoted from the gospel of st john in an apparent attempt to parade his religious credentials while controversy rages about his government 's plans to introduce gay marriage . ministers have come under fire from churchmen and mps over the plans , on which the commons will vote in the new year . olive branch : david cameron has issued the most overtly religious christmas message by a pm in recent times in an apparent bid to defuse anger over plans for gay marriage . mr cameron has regularly ignored advice that politicians in the modern age should not ` do god ' . but the prime minister went further than ever last night when he quoted from the bible , referring to jesus as ` the light of all mankind ' and the ` prince of peace ' . he spoke about the ` extraordinary year ' featuring the ` spectacular ' olympics and the diamond jubilee , when ` we cheered our queen to the rafters and praised the efforts of the armed forces ' . but the most striking passage of his message came when he turned to the meaning of christmas . ` christmas gives us the opportunity to remember the christmas story -- the story about the birth of jesus christ and the hope that he brings to the countless millions who follow him , ' he said . ` the gospel of john tells us that in this man was life , and that his life was the light of all mankind , and that he came with grace , truth and love . indeed , god 's word reminds us that jesus was the prince of peace . ' he concluded : ` so however you celebrate this time of year , it is my hope and prayer that you have a happy and peaceful christmas . ' criticism : churchmen have accused the prime minister of being out of touch with the ` vast majority of practising religious people ' mr cameron 's message appeared designed to defuse anger at his decision to push forward plans for gay marriage despite heavy criticism . the bishop of leicester has accused him of being out of touch with the ` vast majority of practising religious people ' despite assurances that no churches will be forced to carry out such ceremonies . in a speech last year mr cameron said the values of the bible ` go to the heart ' of what it means to be british , although he admitted he was no more than a ` vaguely practising ' christian ` full of doubts ' about theological issues . he also used his christmas message , to be published today , ` to pay particular tribute to our brave servicemen and women who are overseas helping bring safety and security to all of us at home ; their families who can not be with them over the holidays ; and to all the dedicated men and women in the emergency services who are working hard to support those in need ' . he added : ` when we are celebrating with family and friends , they and many others are all working on our behalf and deserve our thoughts and appreciation .
