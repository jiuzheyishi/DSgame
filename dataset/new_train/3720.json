{"text": "jailed : bhadresh gohil was convicted of money laundering and given a 10-year prison sentence . a mother-of-three has won the right to demand a bigger divorce payout from her ex-husband - after he was jailed for handling cash for a # 50million fraudster . varsha gohil accepted # 270,000 and the family peugeot from solicitor bhadresh gohil in 2004 after divorcing him for alleged adultery and unreasonable behaviour . but in 2010 he was jailed for ten years for money laundering after a court heard he helped millionaire nigerian politician james ibori steal around # 50million from the oil-rich state he governed . now she has been granted permission to seek a bigger payout in britain 's highest court after claiming he had not disclosed his full wealth when she agreed to the original settlement . it is the latest stage in a lengthy legal battle by mrs gohil . in june 2012 a high court judge agreed she could fight the case , and a hearing was fixed for june this year . but in march three appeal court judges unanimously quashed that ruling and the hearing was cancelled . now , however , mrs gohil has now won permission to take her case to the supreme court - where she will stand alongside a second woman fighting her own ex-husband . mrs gohill , from london , will fight the case next june with 46-year-old alison sharland , who is battling her software millionaire ex-husband . mrs sharland accepted # 10.35 million from appsense founder charles sharland two years ago after their marriage of 17 years broke down . she agreed to the payout thinking it was worth half his fortune - yet his stake in the firm was estimated wildly higher at # 150million soon afterwards , london 's court of appeal heard . ros bever , a specialist divorce lawyer with mrs gohil 's solicitors irwin mitchell , said : ` dishonesty in any legal proceedings should not be tolerated ; the family court should not be an exception . ` this is yet another case in which an unfair settlement has been agreed because of one party being dishonest and not sharing all the details of their wealth to the courts . ` we are pleased that the supreme court has agreed to hear this case alongside alison sharland 's . battle : mrs gohil will fight alongside alison sharland , 46 -lrb- left -rrb- , who accepted # 10.35 m from her ex-husband charles -lrb- right -rrb- in the belief it was half his fortune . his firm appsense was later valued wildly higher . ` both cases raise serious issues about how the courts should handle cases where information shared with the court and used to agree a divorce settlement is later found to be false or incomplete . ` we believe the situation that both women find themselves in is unfair and that is why we applied for permission to take their cases to the supreme court . ` in this case the court of appeal judges admitted having sympathy with mrs gohil 's situation . in our view if family law judges , who are given broad discretion to ensure fairness in proceedings , are having to acknowledge this then something in the letter of the law has stopped that fairness from prevailing . ` there are numerous legal arguments to be heard by the supreme court but we hope that ultimately justice will be done and will be seen to be done . ' in the previous hearing , lord justice mcfarlane offered mrs gohil his ` sympathy ' but said it was ` simply not open to the court ' to decide in 2012 about an issue discussed in 2004 . the judge said that it was apparent that at some stage prior to 2007 ` the husband became involved in offences of fraud and money laundering on an astonishing scale . ' ` mr gohil was an out and out rogue involved in financial criminality on an eye-watering scale , ' lord justice mcfarlane said . landmark : mrs gohil 's case will be heard alongside that of alison sharland at the supreme court -lrb- pictured -rrb- . ` to the eyes of the wife , and it seems the judge , it was possible to discern at least the outlines of a  smoking gun  indicating that the husband must have had substantial assets in and prior to 2004 , which he deviously failed to disclose in the financial relief proceedings . ' but there was no evidence gohil had met ibori before the middle of 2005 - more than a year after the payout was settled , the judge added . according to the judge , the jailed ex-husband said his wealth related only to a period after mid-2005 - and besides , as they have been found to represent proceeds of crime , they can not be taken by his wife . the case will be decided after a supreme court hearing next june .", "summary": " varsha gohil accepted # 270k and peugeot car from bhadresh in 2004 .   but six years later he was jailed for ten years for part in # 50million con .   he was acting as solicitor for corrupt nigerian governor james ibori .   now mrs gohil , 50 , will be allowed to ask for more in supreme court .
