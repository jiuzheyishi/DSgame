' mr cridland , whose organisation represents 240,000 businesses , said ` face-to-face ' guidance was needed for pupils aged 12 and over and called for the national careers service to be given access to schools . a report from the commons education select committee earlier this year warned there had been a ` worrying deterioration ' in careers advice available to young people . at present only adults have personal contact with ncs advisers . young people contact the service over the phone or internet . he also recommended the government 's new traineeship programme and 16-19 study programmes should have impartial careers guidance and firms should volunteer employees to mentor pupils and offer career support . the national careers council released a report earlier this month which called for more to be done to ensure young people were informed about a wide variety of jobs . those in greatest need , it said , were youngsters from less deprived backgrounds who do n't have access to the social and family networks that more privileged people can use to find work . the commons education select committee has also raised concerns about the issue . a report earlier this year warned there had been a ` worrying deterioration ' in careers advice available to young people . brian lightman , general secretary of the association of school and college leaders , said the ` bewildering array ' of career routes meant many made the wrong choice . ` a national telephone helpline and a website are useful for information but they are no substitute for a conversation with a qualified , knowledgeable careers professional who can help them make informed choices , ' he added . john richards , head of education at public sector union unison , said providing careers advice had been ` dumped on schools with no extra funding ' . * the speech coincided with a poll of 500 workers that found 77 per cent admit having regrets about their career choice . four per cent of workers felt they should have chosen a less pressurised job , according to a poll . file picture . over a third yearned for a more exciting or worthwhile job , while 31 per cent wished they had chosen something more lucrative and seven per cent wanted a less demanding role . four per cent felt they should have chosen a less pressurised job , according to the poll for office space provider officebroker.com . a department for education spokeswoman said the new system replaced one that was ` patchy , costly and often of poor quality ' . the national careers service website had received seven million visits in its first year and a webchat facility had been used more than 67,000 times by young people , she added . ` it is clear that headteachers are best placed to judge the needs of their pupils and the type of careers advice they will most benefit from , ' the spokeswoman said . ` we have issued guidance to schools to help them fulfil their obligation , and ofsted has said it will prioritise the inspection of careers guidance from september . ' the current system replaced the connexions service , which was run by local authorities and provided universal careers guidance .", "summary": " john cridland says teens are woefully ill-equipped to deal with job market .   the business leader says government is ` laissez-faire ' about career advice .   his comments came as poll found 77 per cent of people regret their career .
