{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- for ashley bridges , life was good . she and her boyfriend , jonathan caughey , were in love and along with her young son braiden , they were excited to become a family . the only distraction was her aching knee , which began bothering her in spring 2012 . bridges described the  multiple trips  to the doctor 's office .  the first appointment was like , ' i think there 's something wrong with my knee . it 's achy sometimes but then it goes away . '  the doctor told her it was probably just arthritis or bursitis . then she went back a couple of months later and was told it 's  something you 're going to have to live with .  this went on for over a year until finally bridges , who lives in menifee , california , could not walk anymore and was referred to a specialist in october 2013 . but before she made it to the specialist , the pain became so intense she had to go to the hospital .  i had excruciating pain in my knee and my toes went numb . so i went to the hospital and they did an x-ray ,  she said . they had just wheeled bridges back to the waiting room to wait for the results when they rushed her back into a room and said the doctor needed to speak with her . the doctor came in and said ,  you have bone cancer .  a cancer known as osteosarcoma . she was just 24 years old and in shock from the news . bridges could n't believe what she was hearing , .  i was like , no . 'cause who thinks of when their knee hurts that they have bone cancer ?  bridges still gets emotional when she talks about how long it took to get her eventual diagnosis .  i 'm angry ,  bridges said , tears welling in her eyes ,  but there 's really nothing we can do about it now . the doctor that i went to repeatedly and repeatedly telling him something was n't right probably cost me my life . this is a very aggressive cancer . i could have had more time .  bridges underwent surgery to replace her knee and remove the majority of her femur . the doctors also said she should start chemotherapy immediately , but there was a very big risk . bridges was already 10 weeks pregnant with a baby girl .  they told me what would likely happen to paisley , that you know , she most likely would n't make it and i just knew . it was n't a choice to me . it was like this is what needs to be done . she 's first . i 'm not going to kill a healthy baby because i 'm sick . there 's nothing wrong with her . her life is just as important as mine if not more important . i mean as a mother my job is to protect my kids .  unwavering in her decision to delay treatment -- a choice that could ultimately cost her life -- she knew caughey and her mother would support her no matter what . bridges ' mother , renee thomas , said her daughter has always been strong-willed and this decision did n't surprise her .  i always tell her it 's not over 'til it 's over ,  she said .  you never know . we might get that miracle  but after giving birth to paisley in july , a full body scan revealed the cancer had spread throughout bridges ' body , even into her brain .  when they told me that , i think oh my gosh , i am really dying . i 'm not going to beat this . and then i am sad for about a week and then i get back to ok , well it 's not over yet . and then i 'll be good and then i 'll get some more bad news that it spread through my whole entire body . and then that will knock me down for about a week and then i 'll bounce back .  but bridges admits it 's hard to be in pain all the time . bridges ' doctors say she has months to live , but she still has goals .  i am really pushing for paisley 's first birthday . this is what i do . i do october , ok , i just got to make it to thanksgiving . thanksgiving comes around -- ok , let 's just go to christmas . then christmas comes and braiden 's birthday is in march , so i 'm going to make it to braiden 's birthday . i 'm just going to keep setting little goals for myself and we 'll see .  24-year-old cancer victim inspires after death . after the terminal diagnosis , bridges and caughey moved their wedding date up a couple of months to this past november . bridges brightens when she talks about her wedding day . braiden , 6 , got to walk her down the aisle .  it just went by so fast . if i could sum that day up it would just be magical . magical . loved it . loved seeing all my friends , my family all together .  lindsey natzic-villatoro , owner of love song events and photography , planned the wedding in just a few weeks and has become a source of support for bridges and her family . she also has photographed bridges ' recent milestones -- from her pregnancy and the newborn to her engagement and holiday pictures -- documenting many of life 's firsts . natzic-villatoro , a mother of three , sees bridges as the perfect example of what motherhood is all about .  i think that this has helped express to others who have never had children the depth of actually a mom 's love -- the selflessness . it 's just like the best example that she has shown the entire world . so for that , she is definitely one of the most bravest people that i 've ever met .  for bridges , the memories and photographs are invaluable .  it means everything . my kids are going to have these memories . my husband 's going to have these . and my kids are going to be able to look at these forever .  when asked about what her legacy might be , bridges softly breaks down and says ,  i want my kids to know how much i love them and how much i fought for them .  when the cancer you beat comes back . cnn 's joe sutton contributed to this report .", "summary": " ashley bridges delays chemotherapy because she was pregnant with a daughter .   after the birth , doctors discover cancer has spread from her knee to her brain .
