{"text": "` suffering ' : john mcareavey , pictured with michaela on their wedding day , cried in court as closing statements were made during her murder trial . the widower of a bride who was murdered on their honeymoon broke down into tears as a lawyer hit back at ` grotesque theories ' put forward by the defence of her alleged killers . john mcareavey and michaela harte had been married only 12 days when she was found strangled in the bathtub of their luxury hotel on the paradise island of mauritius . two hotel employees are accused of murdering 27-year-old mrs mcareavey when she returned to the couple 's room at the exclusive beachside complex and caught them stealing . lawyers defending former hotel workers avinash treebhoowoon and sandip moneea had drawn the jury 's attention to a sex guide in the couple 's room and made references to sado-masochism . however , it later turned out that this was a free insert in a popular women 's magazine . michaela 's 's widower mr mcareavey sat bent over , looking at the floor , as prosecutor medhi manrakhan told jurors these were ` insulting ' innuendos that had been raised and cynically dropped by the defence . as the murder trial in the supreme court drew towards its close after 30 days , the strain became too much for the young widower . at one point during the prosecution 's 90-minute closing speech , he appeared to discreetly wipe away tears , his head shielded from the view of the jurors by the bench in front . mr manrakhan told the court : ` the person who has suffered the most on all of this , as if he has n't suffered enough after the death of the love of his life , michaela , is john mcareavey , . ` i am duty-bound to speak about the manner in which fingers have been constantly pointed at john mcareavey in the most unbefitting manner . ' he said several ` grotesque theories ' had been aired , including questions about erotic asphyxiation and the possible use of a belt found among the mcareaveys ' possessions . john mcareavey pictured at the port louis court : he and michaela harte had been married only 12 days when she was found strangled . witness : mr mcareavey arrives at court to give evidence at the trial in the island 's capital , port louis . accused : avinash treebhoowoon -lrb- left -rrb- and sandip moneea -lrb- right -rrb- are standing trial for michaela 's murder . accused : flanked by police officers , avinash treebhoowon , 30 , -lrb- right -rrb- and sandip mooneea , 42 , arrive at court . they are accused of murdering mrs mcareavey when she returned to the room at the exclusive beachside complex and caught them stealing . mr manrakhan also referred to the ` infamous ' cctv footage that the defence had implied showed john and michaela arguing at the hotel reception shortly before the killing . however , police later came to court with proof the couple in the video were german holidaymakers . all the defence theories were fortunately ` short-lived ' and had been abandoned ` one after the other ' when it became clear they were unfounded , mr manrakhan told the supreme court in port louis . he contrasted their behaviour with the straightforward way mr mcareavey , a down gaa player , had given his testimony . ` he came all the way from ireland with his family to seek justice for the wrongful murder of his wife , ' he said . ` he came and told us about how they met ... about the fairytale wedding , about the house they had bought together and never got to share and john told us that his life ended when her life ended . ' the defence 's case could only have confused the jury and was ` very insulting to john and his family and to the memory of michaela ' , mr manrakhan added . mr mcareavey kept his head bowed for most of the speech . michaela 's brother mark harte looked down helplessly at the young widower as he was forced to relive the darkest moments of the trial . it was only when mr manrakhan finished his address ten minutes later that mr mcareavey finally sat back upright , taking a deep breath and appearing to compose himself . happier times : michaela and john with her father mickey harte , left , bishop john mcareavey and the groom 's father brendan mcareavey at their wedding at st malachy 's . the lawyer , who described the trial as the most taxing and challenging of his career , had told the nine jurors the evidence could leave them in no doubt that the two accused were responsible for the killing . the prosecution case is that when michaela went to get a biscuit to go with her tea , she interrupted the two men stealing from her room and was strangled . ` this was a robbery that turned into a brutal murder , ' he said . ` it would have been easier for the two accused to beg forgiveness from michaela and to walk away . the worst that could have happened would have been the loss of their jobs . but they decided to murder her . this shows that they both possess killing instincts and have no respect for human life . ' michaela , the daughter of tyrone gaelic football boss mickey harte , was found strangled in her room in january last year . moneea , 43 , a former floor supervisor from petit raffray , and treebhoowoon , 32 , a former room attendant from plaine des roches , deny murdering the 27-year-old . michaela 's brother and the mcareaveys -- john , his sister claire and father brendan -- had remained out of court on the day details from the post-mortem report were revealed . yesterday was the first day they heard the graphic details of the injuries she sustained at the hands of her killer . her brother dropped his head and hid from view as the court heard of michaela 's desperate attempts to fight for her life . earlier , mr manrakhan said the police deserved praise rather than criticism for ` solving the case in record time ' . referring to the defence 's contention that officers ` bungled ' the inquiry , he said that it was not for the jury to adjudicate on the police . treebhoowoon 's lawyers had argued that his confession to the murder had been extracted by torture . nightmare in paradise : the couple 's room at legends hotel in grand gaube , mauritius . luxury holiday : a view of the swimming pool at the five-star legends hotel in mauritius , where the newlywed couple were staying . on trial : a sobbing treebhoowoon pictured arriving at court earlier in the trial . he pleaded not guilty to the killing . however , mr manrakhan said that this had been disproved and that the accused had ` come before you and regurgitated a concocted and rehearsed story ' . evidence from three doctors who examined him in january last year ` confirmed that the allegations of police brutality were totally unfounded ' , the lawyer said . he also reminded the jurors that ravi rutnah , who was acting for mr treebhoowoon , had withdrawn from the trial early on and had never come back to support his claim that his client was abused . previously , the court heard treebhoowoon had given a statement saying he and moneea were both in the couple 's room stealing when michaela walked in and that moneea had killed her . moneea 's lawyers had claimed he was on the phone to his sister at the time of the killing but the prosecutor questioned why he had waited 18 months to give this explanation and said the call did not appear in any of the statements from the time . the defence 's theories about the mcareavey 's belt had been disproved by the chief police medical officer . dr sudesh gungadin had told the trial : ` i am 100 per cent sure . no belt could have been used . ' mr manrakhan said the fact there was no dna or fingerprints from the accused in the couple 's room did not mean the men had not been there . he said expert witness susan woodroffe had explained that dna samples can dissolve in water . he told jurors to trust the testimony of raj theekoy , a former colleague of treebhoowoon and moneea , who told police he saw the pair coming from the direction of michaela and john 's room at the time of the murder . he said theekoy was a ` trusted witness ' with ` no reason to lie ' . summing up , mr manrakhan said : ` members of the jury , there are no politics to truth . there is right and there is wrong . i have no doubt whatsoever that when you consider the evidence , objectively and dispassionately , that you will reach the right decision -- that the two accused are guilty as charged . ' the mcareaveys and mr harte sat in solemn silence as the court emptied . the group appeared drained as they later made their way out past waiting cameramen and reporters . after nearly 50 testimonies , the last witness was called on thursday . the defence will deliver closing statements on monday and a verdict is expected next week .", "summary": " michaela mcareavey , 27 , found dead in bathtub of mauritius hotel room .   michaela and husband john had only married twelve days before her death in january 2011 .   hotel workers avinash treebhoowoon and sandip moneea deny murder .
