{"text": "smiling again : jodie hart underwent surgery to fix her underbite . when jodie hart first noticed her lower jaw jutted out further than her upper jaw , during her early teens , she assumed the problem would correct itself . instead , the mismatch only became more pronounced . within a few years her underbite -- where the lower jaw is further forward than the top -- was so severe that chewing food was difficult . ` i already had orthodontic braces to correct my crooked teeth and i hoped they 'd fix my underbite , ' says jodie , 26 , who works in pr . ` but my lower jaw gradually got more prominent and unsightly , and by the time i was 17 it was really uncomfortable . ` eating was hard as my teeth did n't . fit together properly . i did n't eat apples because it was too much . effort trying to bite into them and i had to get food to the back of my . throat and chew it much more . i also felt really self-conscious as my . jaw looked odd . ' an . underbite is a type of deformity known medically as a reverse overjet . it is caused by an overgrowth of the lower jaw or the upper jaw not . developing properly , or a combination of the two . ` jaw . deformities are quite common and affect about ten per cent of the . population , ' explains darryl coombes , consultant oral and maxillofacial . surgeon at the queen victoria hospital in east grinstead , west sussex . ` an . underbite can sometimes cause jaw-joint problems , such as pain or . clicking , and patients find it hard to bite into foods . ` there 's often . also a psychological impact too as it can appear strange and alter . looks . ' an underbite can . occasionally be corrected with orthodontic braces alone but if the . deformity is severe -- as in jodie 's case -- surgery is needed to . reposition and realign the jaws . this . is performed by surgeons qualified in both medicine and dentistry , and . only on patients aged over 18 whose bones have stopped growing . ` jaw surgery is a major undertaking and the entire process takes about 18 months ' says mr coombes . ` people with an underbite often have rotated or angled teeth , caused by the mouth adapting , and these must be completely straightened and aligned before the operation by an orthodontist . otherwise it 's impossible to work out where the jaws should be and teeth wo n't fit together correctly . ' before the op : jodie pictured before the surgery , when her protruding jaw meant that she struggled to chew her food properly . patients wear braces for a year -- and they remain on during the procedure . once the teeth are straight , the surgeon takes x-rays of the jaw and makes a cast of the teeth , and uses a metal hinge known as an articulator to simulate how the teeth should meet . ` once the correct position is determined , plastic wafers are made to sit on the teeth during the operation and show where the jaw should be , ' says mr coombes . ` a great deal of planning happens before the surgery . ' the operation is performed under general anaesthetic and through the mouth , via incisions in the gums , to prevent scarring to the face . ` to move the upper jaw , we break and . detach it from the base of the skull , then reposition it , ' says mr . coombes . ` to move the lower jaw , we cut the sides of the jaw using a . surgical saw . ' the jaw can then be slid forwards or backwards until it is in the correct position -- marked by the wafers . it . is fixed together again with titanium plates and screws , then the gums . are sewn up with dissolving stitches . titanium is used because it is . bio-compatible , so it can stay in for life . jodie had four screws inserted and had a thin slice of bone removed from her jaw , to improve the fit . surgery usually takes two to three hours and requires a short stay in hospital . ` afterwards patients experience swelling , numbness and discomfort for several weeks , ' says mr coombes . ` painkillers are prescribed and patients see their final appearance two to three months later . braces stay on for up to six months . ' jodie 's recovery from the nhs surgery took about five weeks . ` after the operation the pain was extreme , despite the painkillers , and there was a lot of blood in my mouth , ' she says . ` my jaw was locked shut , due to the pain , and my cheeks were like footballs . ` the first few days i was kept on a drip , then i started drinking nutrient shakes through a straw . after a few weeks i moved on to soft foods then later back on to solids . ` although my bottom lip and part of my chin are now numb , which doctors warned could happen , i have n't had any pain since . ` the ordeal was definitely worth it -- i am now able to chew food comfortably , can eat what i like and i breathe more easily . ` once the swelling had completely gone , i had a normal-looking face and was thrilled . it was like looking at a different person in the mirror . ` now i feel much more confident about my appearance , whereas before there was a major imperfection . ` my face is all in proportion and the new jaw position even makes my cheekbones more pronounced . ` having the surgery was the best decision i 've ever made .
