{"text": "a three-year-old boy who suffered a massive stroke in the womb has stunned doctors by learning to walk , talk and see in time for his first day at nursery . liam maule was delivered six weeks early in august 2009 after midwives could not find his heartbeat.while twin sister laura was born healthy , liam had experienced massive bleeding in the left side of his brain and was severely brain damaged . the stroke could have killed an adult and mother rosie , 34 , and father jason , 37 , from swindon , were warned he would not develop normally . liam , now aged 3 -lrb- left -rrb- , suffered a brain bleed while still in the womb . he has surprised doctors with his progress and can now walk and talk . pictured , right , aged one , wearing electrodes during a brain scan . but now liam has joined his sister at preschool , where he is walking , talking , and can see to a distance of six metres . rosie , from swindon , said : ` as far as i knew , i had been carrying healthy twins , until i had a routine checkup when they could n't find his heartbeat . ' i knew my children had to be delivered as quickly as possible . i was rushed for an emergency c-section . ` laura came out first , crying at the top of her lungs . liam came out two minutes later , but he was n't crying . the quiet made me panic . ' i was able to hold liam for a few minutes and i noticed his thumbs were sticking into his hands . i thought it was just a result of how he had been positioned in the womb . ' but two days later , a cat scan revealed that liam had suffered bleeding in his brain while he was still in the womb , five days before he was delivered . doctors battled to stabilise liam by attaching him to a drip and boosting his immune system , but there was little they could do other than wait to see what happened . rosie , who split with liam 's father before the birth , was told her son was still bleeding and she should prepare for the worst . she said : ` tears were streaming down my face . i could n't believe what was happening . ' i was told to consider liam 's quality of life . if the bleeding did n't stop and the brain damage got worse , i would have to prepare to let liam go . ' i told the doctor i did n't want to have to make that choice . i could n't face turning off a life-support machine . ' liam -lrb- right -rrb- pictured with his twin sister laura who was unaffected in the womb . their mother said it was difficult seeing their different rates of progress . liam learnt to walk with the help of a walker aged two . even if liam survived , he would be left with 14 serious health conditions , including cerebral palsy , microcephaly disorder , epilepsy , swelling on the brain , and respiratory problems . rosie said : ` the news was like a slap in the face . doctors told me it was unlikely that liam would ever walk or see . ` the part of his brain which affects his speech was also heavily damaged , so talking was another milestone he would find difficult to reach . ' incredibly , liam survived and left hospital three months later to join laura , brother lewis , 13 , and sisters erin , seven , and emily , 15 , at home . by the end of the year , doctors were amazed at his progress . rosie said : ` he first started seeing shadows at nine months old . shortly after his first birthday he reached out for a teddy bear . ' i got the video camera out and videoed him doing it again . i could n't believe he could recognise it . ` his first words were ` dada ' and ` dandan ' - his godfather daniel . he can now say ` daniel ' as well , and uses that for ` serious conversation ' like asking him if he can use his ipad . ` when he took his first steps in june this year i thought it was a miracle . ` my biggest fear was that he would n't be able to walk . a defining moment was at his godfather 's wedding in july 2011 , when he walked down the aisle . ` we were so proud of him making his own way down with his zimmer frame covered in ribbons and bows . ` when liam walked into the consultant 's room for his most recent cat scan in march , our doctor could n't quite believe it . ` looking at the scan of his brain he turned to me and said ` rosie , he should n't be doing any of this . walking , talking - it 's incredible ' . ' liam with his proud mother rosie , from swindon . sadly liam is not expected to survive beyond the age of 30 . last month rosie proudly dropped liam and laura off at the coleview preschool in swindon , where his progress has continued . preschool keyworker sandra cullen said : ' i first met liam in january and it 's amazing how much he 's improved since then . ` he 's settled in extremely well . he loves playing with the other children and he 's very popular . ` he has developed beyond what anyone expected , both physically and in his level understanding . he is very communicative . ' although strokes are usually associated with adults , around 400 infants and children are affected by the condition each year . consultant pediatric neurosurgeon at frenchay hospital in bristol , dr mike carter , said liam 's continual improvement can be partially attributed to the fitting of a tube which drains excess fluid from liam 's brain to his stomach , where it can be absorbed . liam 's young brain has been better able to adapt to the trauma caused by the stroke . dr carter said : ` children up to seven years old have increased plasticity , allowing functions within the brain to swap from one side to the other . ` the stroke liam suffered is often fatal in adults . children have a great capacity for recovery . ` in liam 's case , functions of the brain on the left side , which had been damaged , have been taken over by the right side . ' rosie believes liam has also responded well to her use of music , light and sound therapy in his daily routine . she said : ` music therapy is his favourite . he loves adele , as he knows that means nap time . before liam arrived , i took developmental milestones for granted . ` i 've always taken photos when my children get their first pair of shoes . unfortunately , when i took laura to get her first pair , liam was n't walking and had some problems with his feet . ` watching laura pose for photos , it saddened me that her brother could n't be there too . ` twins are meant to do everything together , but she walked before him , talked before him - she did everything before him . liam -lrb- left -rrb- pictured with sister laura aged one month old . liam in an incubator two days after he was born . he needs constant care and medication . ' i was n't giving up though - i wanted that photo . i got it , a year later , when liam was ready for his first pair of shoes . it was an emotional day , but everything is more emotional with liam . ` it seems unfair that , of the two twins , liam had to draw the short straw . i have no idea why it happened to him and not laura , apart from that she was always the more dominant one in the womb . scans showed her to be heavier and taking up more room . ` it is a struggle to watch them grow up side by side , knowing that their lives will be so different . ' rosie has been advised that liam , who needs constant care and medication to control his various health conditions , is unlikely to live beyond 30 years old . despite the heartache and challenges , rosie says she draws strength from liam every day . she has started a facebook group , called eye love liam , to give hope families in similar circumstances . she said : ` i 'm so proud of everything that liam has achieved . it 's really inspiring . ' i want to raise awareness , not just of the fact that babies and children can suffer from strokes , but also of ways that parents can encourage progress . ' i started the ` eye love liam ' campaign to share my experiences with other mums in my position and let them know there is hope for the future . '", "summary": " mother told she had to prepare to let her son go , after he suffered a brain bleed five days before he was born .   doctors said he was unlikely to ever walk or see , but liam achieved both milestones by the age of three .   children up to seven years old have greater brain plasticity so can swap brain functions from one side to the other following a stroke .
