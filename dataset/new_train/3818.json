' the move follows a ukba summer-long drive to remove visa ` overstayers ' that has led to thousands being removed , with 2,000 of those being in london alone . the majority of those targeted entered the country on student visas which have now expired . mr green said they mainly came from india , pakistan , bangladesh , china , brazil and nigeria and were now working illegally . an operation in the capital yesterday resulted in three arrests . two pakistani nationals and an iranian man were arrested in walworth and brixton , south london , for allegedly working illegally . one 28-year-old iranian was arrested by the same immigration officer at a halal butchers three years ago . another pakistani man smirked as he was led away in handcuffs in what was his third arrest by ukba staff . working illegally : this pakistani man was arrested by border police from the a.m. halal butchers in brixton , south london where he was allegedly working illegally . the chief inspector of immigration , john vine , criticised the ukba for not having a strategy for reducing the pool of overstayers last month . the only guidance staff were given for dealing with cases in this 150,000-strong group was that the total size of the pool should not be allowed to increase . vine said his greatest concern during his inspection of the hampshire and isle of wight immigration team was over the ' 150,000-plus cases nationally that are sitting in a migration refusal pool ' . the chief inspector concluded that ukba staff reported it being impossible to know whether the 150,000 were still in britain or had left voluntarily . arrested before : this iranian man was arrested at the same brixton butchers . he has been detained at least once before , three years ago by the same border officer seen here . in total , the ukba faces an enormous backlog of 276,000 immigration cases . the growing total includes asylum seekers , foreign criminals and illegal migrants and is equivalent to the population of newcastle . mps sitting on the commons home affairs committee said the uk has become a ` bermuda triangle ' for migrants , a country where it is ` easy to get in , but impossible to keep track of everyone , let alone get them out .
