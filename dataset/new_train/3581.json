reports came as 100 parents protested over the sacking of the entire governing body at the al-hijrah school in birmingham . the school was not part of ofsted 's trojan horse inspections , but it was placed in special measures last year after inspectors found ` inadequate ' teaching , an unbalanced curriculum and governors ` too heavily involved in the day-to-day running ' . with whitehall 's approval , birmingham council recently disbanded the governors and appointed a new head and ` interim executive board ' to run the school .", "summary": " three month inquiry by school watchdog found
