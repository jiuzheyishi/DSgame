{"text": "what kind of holiday rental home costs $ 10,000 a day ? perhaps one set on a private caribbean beach , with a personal fleet of boats ? an alpine chalet , with postcard-perfect views of the matterhorn from every window ? or maybe a personal spa , with a lap pool , hiking trails , a state-of-the-art gym -- and an on-call personal trainer to make sure you use them ? the answer : yes , yes and yes . for today 's new generation of well-heeled travelers -- who are increasingly eschewing hotels for private rental villas -- the bar for luxe hideaways has reached dizzying heights . departures.com : see more over-the-top villas . for a certain breed of jet-setter , home theaters , ducasse-worthy kitchens and private bars stocked with top-shelf liquor are all de rigueur ; what they 're after are award-winning chefs ready to whip up personalized dinner-party menus or on-demand yachts with captains who know the best deep-sea fishing spots . somewhat ironically , this surge in over-the-topness could be considered a by-product of harder economic times .  before the global financial crisis there was a glut of high-end construction ,  explains brian sharples , founder of homeaway , a network of villa rental websites representing 650,000 properties with prices ranging from a few hundred dollars up to $ 392,000 a week .  many owners of luxury properties who were over-leveraged have now turned to rentals as a way to defray ownership costs .  the result is a super competitive market where added extras like sports cars and ski equipment are as common as evening turndown treats in hotels . while many of the world 's most opulent villas lure guests with an array of cool toys -lrb- and we do mean cool -- how does recording studio equipment once used by john lennon sound ?

of course , for those seeking true sanctuary , the right vacation villa is only part of the equation ; the right staff is also key . -lrb- after all , a viking stove is n't much use if you 're a terrible cook ; and 17,000 square feet seems like a lot , when you have to vacuum it yourself . -rrb- . that 's why many top-tier villas come with phalanxes of personnel and also offer private transport -- via luxury car , boat or helicopter -- to zip guests anyplace they desire . but , really , when your home away from home is as outrageously opulent as these villas , why go anywhere else ?
