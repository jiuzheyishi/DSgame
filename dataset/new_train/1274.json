{"text": "it was a heart-wrenching story that proved too good to be true . hundreds of users of social networking sites and blogs followed the trials and tribulations of a canadian family over the course of 11 years . during that time , they read of five-year-old ` warrior ' eli dirr 's battle with cancer and just last month , the death of his mother dana in a car crash en route to the saskatchewan hospital where she was a surgeon . hoax : pictures used to depict the dirr family had been lifted from other people 's profiles on sites such as facebook , including images of twins that were actually the children of a south african blogger . john ` js ' dirr , an officer in the canadian royal mounted police , movingly described how she miraculously hung on to life just long enough to give birth to their 11th child , daughter evelyn danika . all of it , however , was a complex hoax . through her blog warrior eli : a hoax ? taryn wright has revealed js is actually a 22-year-old medical student living with her father in ohio . one of the only elements of truth in the countless posts on sites such as facebook was that the woman - emily dirr - shared a surname with the family she had invented . miss wright wrote on the gawker website : ' i was very surprised to . find out that a med student was behind the whole thing because of the . amount of time that had to have been involved with creating so many . characters . ' duped : hundreds of people were tricked into falling for convincing social network profiles that used photos lifted from the internet . miss wright speculated that the author may have a condition known as munchausen disorder by internet , which was identified in 1998 by psychiatrist dr marc feldman . she said : ` it says that people who have this disorder invent stuff like this over and over and over again . ` the only real treatment is having their internet use carefully monitored . ' the most outrageous message was posted on facebook on may 13 - mother 's day in america - when ` warrior eli ' broke the grim news that dana dirr had died from injuries sustained in a car crash . fabrication : widower john ` js ' dirr poured out his grief over the supposed death of his wife dana in this facebook post , which went viral . it read : ` last night at 12:02 am i lost the love of my life . i lost my wife , the mother of my children and my best friend . ` she fought so hard to cling to life . all of the doctors could n't believe she survived as long as she did . ' a tribute page quickly sprang up in memory of mrs dirr and raised more than $ 1,000 for a cancer charity before it was taken down . meanwhile , hundreds of people left condolence messages on facebook . it was at this point , however , that the hoax began to unravel . it emerged that pictures used to depict the dirr family had been lifted from other people 's profiles on sites such as facebook and flickr , including images of twins that were actually the children of a south african blogger . vital clue : taryn wright managed to track down the person behind the fake posts using the ohio return address emily dirr provided when she sent warrior eli bracelets to online followers like the one pictured above . as more questions were asked , the warrior eli facebook page was deleted and the privacy settings increased for the js and dana dirr profiles . eli dirr 's page on the caringbridge networking site was also made private . to track down those behind the charade , taryn wright set up a blog and email address for people to send information . she tracked down emily dirr after she was told the woman - described online as the younger sister of js - sent warrior eli bracelets to anybody who requested them . emily dirr provided a return address in rootstown , ohio - and miss wright found she was the only person mentioned on the sites who was real . after being outed , miss dirr apologised in a written statement published on miss wright 's blog . it said : ' i am deeply sorry for all the pain i have caused everyone . ` it was never my intention to do so . ` this all started 11 years ago when i was a bored 11-year-old kid looking for an escape from the pain and heartache i saw in my own family . ` it started almost as a fiction writing , but the more time i spent escaping to it , the more  real  it became . ' i am so sorry it hurt so many real families , and so many people out there . ' miss wright said that although the hundreds of people who were duped are angry , miss dirr does not appear to have committed a crime because she did not materially gain from the hoax . money raised for the cancer charity went straight into their coffers , she said . however , she said that miss dirr 's medical school is carrying out an investigation .", "summary": " ohio medical student , 22 , invented several online characters using profiles on sites like facebook and lifting photos from the internet .   she is not thought to have committed a crime , however , as she did not appear to materially gain .   after being outed , emily dirr said she was ` deeply sorry for all the pain i have caused everyone ' "}
