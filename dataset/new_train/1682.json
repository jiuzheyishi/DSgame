' history : the nobel peace prize has been awarded to 124 times since 1901 . svallfors compares snowden 's act to the rulings in the nuremberg trials of 1945 because ' i was just following orders ' was not held as a viable excuse for the nazis who carried out human rights atrocities . svallfors also believes this will help the peace prize regain some of respect it lost after prematurely awarding barack obama the award in 2009 . ` it would show its willingness to . stand up in defense of civil liberties and human rights , even when such a . defense -lsb- could -rsb- be viewed with disfavor by the world 's dominant . military power . ' but it may be too late for snowden to receive the award this year . nominations for laureates must be postmarked no later than february 1 for consideration in the following december 's prizes . between the months of march and august the advisers review the short list of candidates . however , svallfors ' nomination should be taken seriously by the committee for next year 's prize . as . a sociology professor at umeå university , he counts as one of the . ` qualified ' people who can send their nominations to the committee . these qualified people include : members of national assemblies and governments of states ; members of international courts ; university rectors ; professors of social sciences , history , philosophy , law and theology ; directors of peace research institutes and foreign policy institutes ; recipients of the prize ; board members of organizations that have been awarded the prize ; active members of the norwegian nobel committee ; former advisers of the norwegian nobel committee . the nobel peace prize was started in 1901 and has been awarded to 100 individuals and 24 organizations . qualified : as a professor of sociology at umeå university in sweden , svallfors is one of the few that are allowed to make recommendations to the committee . the process : candidates are nominated before february 1 and then go through a nearly year-long review up until the december award ceremony . too soon : many criticized the premature awarding of the peace prize to president barack obama in 2009 . it was the last prize described in alfred nobel 's will , which left most of his fortune to the creation of the prizes . other nobel prizes are awarded in the areas of physics , chemistry , medicine and literature . the peace prize is awarded each year to ` the person who . shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between . nations , for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the . holding and promotion of peace congresses . ' though snowden is eligible for nomination for the december 2014 prize , it 's unlikely he 'd be able to travel to oslo for the award ceremony . snowden applied for asylum in norway on july 2 , but the country then planned to reject it according to their national law . ` according to norwegian law , one ca n't seek asylum abroad and the normal procedures stipulate that the asylum application from edward snowden will be rejected , ' paal loenseth , northwegian state secretary told news agency ntb . if snowden is awarded the prize in 2014 , he would be the youngest nobel peace laureate in the history of the prize . best committee members!i suggest that the 2013 peace prize awarded to the american citizen edward snowden.edward snowden has - in a heroic effort at great personal cost - revealed the existence and extent of the surveillance , the u.s. government devotes electronic communications worldwide . by putting light on this monitoring program - conducted in contravention of national laws and international agreements - edward snowden has helped to make the world a little bit better and safer.through his personal efforts , he has also shown that individuals can stand up for fundamental rights and freedoms . this example is important because since the nuremberg trials in 1945 has been clear that the slogan  i was just following orders  is never claimed as an excuse for acts contrary to human rights and freedoms . despite this , it is very rare that individual citizens having the insight of their personal responsibility and courage edward snowden shown in his revelation of the american surveillance program . for this reason , he is a highly affordable candidate.the decision to award the 2013 prize to edward snowden would - in addition to being well justified in itself - also help to save the nobel peace prize from the disrepute that incurred by the hasty and ill-conceived decision to award u.s. president barack obama 2009 award . it would show its willingness to stand up in defense of civil liberties and human rights , even when such a defense be viewed with disfavour by the world 's dominant military power.sincerely , stefan svallfors professor of sociology at umeå university .", "summary": " stefan svallfors , sociology professor at umeå university , nominated edward snowden for the nobel peace prize .   snowden will not be eligible for this year 's prize , which will be awarded in december 2013 - but could be considered for 2014 .   the nsa whistleblower would have a hard time accepting the award , as he has already unsuccessfully applied for asylum in norway .
