{"text": "glasgow , scotland the roman catholic church has not been vigilant enough or fast enough in responding to the problem of sexual abuse by priests , pope benedict xvi said thursday .  these revelations were for me a shock and a great sadness . it is difficult to understand how this perversion of the priestly ministry was possible ,  he told reporters aboard his plane to scotland .  how a man who has done this and said this can fall into this perversion is difficult to understand .  he added ,  it is also a great sadness that the authorities of the church were not sufficiently vigilant and insufficiently quick and decisive in taking the necessary measures .  british people feel overwhelmingly that the pope has not done enough to punish priests who abuse children , according to a comres poll for cnn released as benedict arrived in the country . three out of four british people -- and two out of three catholics in the country -- say he should do more to punish abusive clergy . critics of the church were quick to pounce on the pope 's remarks .  it 's disingenuous to say church officials have been slow and insufficiently vigilant in dealing with clergy sex crimes and cover ups . on the contrary , they 've been prompt and vigilant , but in concealing , not preventing , these horrors ,  said joelle casteix of snap , the survivors network of those abused by priests . another campaigner took aim at the pontiff personally .  the pope affects the stance of a shocked bystander , when in fact he has been for decades the church 's central handler of sex abuse cases ,  said terence mckiernan of bishopaccountability , a group that tracks reports of abuse by priests . the pope made the comments as he arrived for a historic four-day state visit to britain , where the issue of abuse , and the vatican 's perceived lack of response to it , has created anger . but there was a warm welcome for him on a cold afternoon in glasgow , scotland , for the first major mass of his visit . tens of thousands turned out to hear him preach , with members of the faithful describing it as a  happy day  and calling it a  great honor  that he had come . benedict elaborated in glasgow on what 's expected to be a major theme of his visit , the value of religion in a society that he sees as increasingly secular .  there are some who now seek to exclude religious belief from public discourse , to privatize it or even to paint it as a threat to equality and liberty ,  he said in his homily .  yet religion is in fact a guarantee of authentic liberty and respect .  he also urged bishops to look after their priests -- possibly an oblique reference to the sex abuse scandal -- and warned young people against the temptations of  drugs , money , sex , pornography , alcohol -- which the world tells you will bring you happiness , yet these things are destructive and divisive .  benedict started his visit in edinburgh , where he held a meeting with the queen and greeted thousands who turned out to see him on the streets of the scottish city . queen elizabeth ii shook hands with the pope at her scottish residence near edinburgh , the palace of holyroodhouse , before they sat down for a private meeting . a military marching band played the national anthem god save the queen , for which the pope removed his white cap . the pope used relatively strong language in a speech delivered after the meeting , reflecting on the  sobering lessons of the atheist extremism  of the 20th century . he reminded the media of its  greater responsibility than most  to promote peace and the spread of human rights , and he reminded the country of its  deep christian roots  that he said are still present in  every layer  of british life .  today , the united kingdom strives to be a modern and multicultural society ,  the pope said .  in this challenging enterprise , may it always maintain its respect for those traditional values and cultural expressions that more aggressive forms of secularism no longer value or even tolerate . let it not obscure the christian foundation that underpins its freedoms .  those comments , too , resulted in  disappointment  from the british humanist association , which said the notion that atheism  somehow fuels intolerance in britain today is a terrible libel against those who do not believe in god .  the national secular society said british secularism  is not something to criticize , but to celebrate .   we have rejected dogmatic religion devoid of compassion ,  the group said in a statement .  in its place we have embraced and included gay people and given them the right to full equality , given women the right to control their own fertility , given scientists a free hand to seek cures for horrific diseases by the use of stem-cell research .  though a pope has visited britain once before -- pope john paul ii in 1982 -- this is considered the first state visit by a pope to britain because it comes at the invitation of the queen , not the catholic church , as was the case 28 years ago . benedict 's september 16-19 trip is scheduled to include meetings with political leaders , royalty , and bridge-building events with anglican church officials . it will culminate in the beatification of british cardinal john henry newman , a catholic convert who died in 1890 and is credited with helping rebuild britain 's catholic community . assistant chief constable fiona taylor , of scotland 's strathclyde police , said earlier this week that she estimated only 65,000 pilgrims would attend the mass there , short of an initially anticipated 100,000 . there has already been widespread outcry over the estimated 12 million pounds -lrb- $ 18.7 million -rrb- british taxpayers are having to pay for the visit , though christopher patten , the prime minister 's representative for the papal visit , has pointed out that one day of last year 's g-20 summit in london cost 20 million pounds . criticism has also focused on the armed police squads needed to protect a religious figurehead previously targeted by attackers . along with anger about the vatican 's response to child and sexual abuse , there is criticism over the pope being granted a state visit , given the catholic church 's attitudes towards gender equality and homosexuality . catholic leaders and government officials have defended the trip , with prime minister david cameron saying britain and the vatican have  incredibly important work to do together  in promoting a  multi-faith dialogue .  cnn 's phil black and erin mclaughlin contributed to this report .", "summary": " new : critics call his comments disingenuous and say he knew about the abuse .   pope : the church has not been vigilant or fast enough to respond .   he describes  sadness  and says the abuse is difficult to understand .   the pope is visiting england and scotland for four days .
