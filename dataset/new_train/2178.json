{"text": "the obama administration has not always been great at selling its agenda , but the president 's adoption of the right-wing slur  obamacare  as a prideful new name for the affordable care act has been a notable exception . we often think the proper response to being called a dirty name is to object . that 's a good first step , but in the long term , the judo approach is constructive -- hurl the power being used against you back to your opponent . for example , in 1968 william f. buckley could offend gore vidal by calling him a  queer  on television . today , the line would feel antique and impotent , in large part because gay men adopted the term for themselves and denatured its sting . women today are doing the same with b -- h. black people long ago adopted the n-word as a raffish term of in-group affection , and if you ask me as a black person , we 'd do better to stop going to pieces when white people say it . if the word did n't do the job , people would be less likely to use it . kanye west understands the technique . his idea of emblazoning the confederate flag on t-shirts to take possession of it in the name of black america is inspired . the good ole boy hangs a confederate flag out his window and black people are walking by under it in t-shirts with the same flag on it -- that 's how you get a new world started . yet on obamacare , we face the awkward fact that the right wing has not been completely vanquished in its quest to vilify the program with a name . we hear of quite a few out people out there who confidently espouse the tenets that the affordable care act is based on and yet lustily declare themselves opposed to obamacare , which they think is something separate . -lrb- watch this jimmy kimmel video to see people do that very thing . -rrb- . but this does n't mean we 'd be better off if obama had n't adopted the term obamacare . for one , for those in favor of the program , the term stands as a useful reminder of one of the few large-scale triumphs of this administration on the domestic policy front . health care policy is n't as inherently dramatic as battles over education , the environment or the culture wars . in the grand scheme of things , obama 's legacy in the popular consciousness is better served by a term as memory friendly as obamacare , just as the johnson administration is better served by its association with medicare rather than  social security act title xviii .  but what about those obamacare opponents who think companies should be required to enroll people despite pre-existing conditions and that young people should be able to stay on their parents ' policies until age 26 , while unaware that this makes hating obamacare about as logical as seeking to breathe while disapproving of respiration ? well , we can assume that in a massive , poorly educated nation such as this one , a healthy segment will display this  keep your government hands off my medicare  level of political sophistication . we assume , however , that in a modern democracy , change comes from ongoing disputation , as  conversations  move in certain directions . it will be hard for such people not to notice , as time goes by , that the provisions they espouse came into being under  obamacare ,  whatever their take on tea party ideology . even sooner than this , the prevalence of the meme holding these affordable-care-act-loving obamacare opponents front and center as national jokes will have a certain effect . oh , we wo n't see many contrite admissions of ignorance . but that 's not how ideological battles are won . as often as not , people admit the truth to themselves , but they 'd have no way to do even that if obama had n't picked up the obamacare term and lobbed it back . kanye west 's idea with the confederate flag t-shirts is  now , whaddya gon na do about it ?  for those who want universal health care but hate obamacare , the ignorance so deep that there 's nowhere to go but up . what are they gon na do about it ? learn , apparently -- they could n't avoid it if they tried . that 's progress . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of john mcwhorter .", "summary": " john mcwhorter : adopting a slur cancels its sting : women did it with b-word , blacks with n-word .   mcwhorter : should obama use  obamacare ,  the gop slur for affordable care act ?   he says anti-obama people support aca , hate obamacare , think they are different .   mcwhorter : obama did the right thing to link his name with far-reaching health care reform .
