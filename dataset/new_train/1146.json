{"text": "they say power corrupts , and absolute power corrupts absolutely . but now it seems there could be a scientific reason why the trappings of success and elevated position can make people more likely to be dishonest , according to a new study . researchers found that expansive physical settings , such as having a big desk to stretch out while doing work , or a large driver 's seat in a car , can cause people to feel more powerful . this may , in turn , elicit more dishonest behaviour - such as stealing and cheating , or even traffic offences , they claim . researchers found that expansive physical settings , such as having a big desk to stretch out while doing work , can cause people to feel more powerful . the new research , published in the journal psychological science , discovered that the physical environment may affect the likelihood of dishonesty . study leader doctor andy yap , who spearheaded the research while at columbia business school in the united states . he said : ` in everyday working and living environments , our body postures are incidentally expanded and contracted by our surroundings - by the seats in our cars , the furniture in and around workspaces , even the hallways in our offices - and these environments directly influence the propensity of dishonest behaviour in our everyday lives . ' trappings of success , such as having a big car , may , in turn , elicit more dishonest behaviour - such as stealing and cheating , or even traffic offences , researchers claim . building on previous research . demonstrating that expansive postures can lead to a state of power , and . that power can lead to dishonest behaviour , the new study suggests that . expanded , non-verbal postures forced on people by their environments . could influence decisions and behaviours in ways that render people less . honest . people who are considered unattractive are more likely to be belittled and bullied in the workplace , according to new research . the study by michigan state university found that unattractive workers were treated more harshly than their attractive colleagues when it came to promotions and which tasks they were given to do . and that being ` ugly ' played more of a role in how someone is treated than their age , gender or how long they had worked there . previous research has found that attractive students tend to be more popular in school . however , this study , led by associate professor of management at the university brent scott , is the first to find a direct correlation between attractiveness and bullying in the workplace . the research included findings from four studies conducted in the field and the laboratory . in one study , the researchers manipulated the expansiveness of workspaces in the lab and tested whether ` incidentally ' expanded bodies - shaped organically by one 's environment - led to more dishonesty on a test . another experiment examined whether participants in a more expansive driver 's seat would be more likely to ` hit and run ' when incentivised to go fast in a video game driving simulation . to extend results to a real-world context , a field study tested the ecological validity of the effect by examining whether car drivers ' seat size predicted the violation of parking laws in new york city . the field study revealed that cars with more expansive driver 's seats were more likely to be illegally parked on new york city streets . dr yap , who is now a visiting professor at mit sloan school of management in the us , said the research indicates that while people may pay very little attention to ordinary and seemingly innocuous shifts in bodily posture , these subtle postural shifts can have tremendous impact on our thoughts , feelings and behaviour .", "summary": " study says it elicits dishonest behaviour , such as stealing and cheating .   claims physical environment may affect the likelihood of dishonesty .   american study published in journal psychological science .
