{"text": "mitt romney garnered the same percentage of the popular vote he remarked represented the woebegone portion of the american electorate who will never ` take personal responsibility and care for their -lrb- own -rrb- lives . ' in a bit of electoral irony , the associated press calculated the republican presidential nominee amassed 47.2 per cent of the full presidential vote , or 48 per cent when considering only him and obama . oops : romney said during the campaign 47 per cent of america people would never vote for him because they were entitlement-obsessed people who did n't care about lower taxes . he said what ? romney remarked of the 47 per cent who would never vote for him , ` my job is not to worry about those people ' oveheard : romney 's remark , which many think torpedoed his changes on election day , was caught by a hidden camera . romney had presaged that the democratic incumbent would - in fact - be the candidate to cull that particular percentage , when he told a cabal of fat cat donors that nearly half of america would never vote for him - or his policies . ` and they will vote for this president no matter what ... these are people who pay no income tax ' that 47 per cent of the american electorate , he said , represent those , ` who are dependent upon government , who believe that they are victims , who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them , who believe that they are entitled to health care , to food , to housing , to you-name-it . ` that that 's an entitlement . and the government should give it to them . and they will vote for this president no matter what ... these are people who pay no income tax . ' ` my job is not to worry about those people ,  romney said in the vexing video .  i 'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives . ' some believe romney 's biting rejoinder , captured on a hidden camera and later posted to the internet , torpedoed his bid for the presidency . romney 's remark regarding 47 per cent of americans was captured during a closed-door florida fundraiser for fat cat donors . romney later reportedly said he was speaking ` off the cuff ' and replying to a question when he issued the acerbic address . he apparently made the unfortunate remarks at a closed-door florida fundraiser while on the campaign trail during the summer , or well before november 's election day . romney later reportedly said he was speaking ` off the cuff ' and replying to a question when he issued the acerbic address . ` it 's a question and answer , as i recall , about the process of the campaign and how i 'm going to get the 51 or 52 per cent i need , and i point out it 's by focusing on those folks that are neither in -lsb- obama 's -rsb- camp nor in my camp , ' romney said . close shave : obama , for his part , notched 51.03 per cent of the popular vote in the 2012 u.s. presidential election . ' i recognize that among those that pay . no tax , approximately 47 percent of americans , i 'm not likely to be . highly successful with the message of lowering taxes . ` that 's not as attractive to those who do n't pay income taxes as it is to those who do , ' romney reportedly said in explanation . ` and likewise those who are reliant on government are not as attracted to my message of slimming down the size of government . and so i then focus on those individuals who i believe are most likely to be able to be pulled into my camp and help me win the 51 or 50.1 percent that i need to become the next president . ' obama , for his part , recorded 51.03 per cent of the popular vote .", "summary": " romney was overheard saying 47 per cent of americans would never vote for him because such government-reliant ` victims ' did n't care about lower taxes .
