{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- zarine and shafi khan saw their son growing distant for months . but they say they did n't realize what was happening -- until it was too late .  for the past few months , he was very quiet and he wanted isolation because he was watching or doing something on social media . and that 's why he was brainwashed ,  zarine khan said in an exclusive interview with cnn 's  ac360  thursday . now mohammed hamzah khan , 19 , is accused of trying to support isis . this week he pleaded not guilty to a federal charge of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization . outside the courtroom in chicago , his mother told reporters she had a message for the terror group 's leader :  leave our children alone .   they 're misusing the children 's innocence ,  zarine khan told cnn 's anderson cooper thursday .  the children are gullible . they 're vulnerable . their thinking skills have not completely developed and these people are preying on that .  isis , an extremist islamist group , has been fighting to take over a swath of territory in iraq and syria , where it wants to establish a caliphate or islamic state . the group regularly uses social media to promote its goals , posting videos of brutal violence and using hashtags for other stories in the news to disseminate its message . authorities arrested mohammed khan at o'hare international airport in october as he was about to embark on a flight to istanbul . in a letter he left behind for his parents , he wrote that he was leaving the united states and on his way to join isis , according to a criminal complaint . he invited them to join him in the  islamic state ,  but he warned them not to tell anyone about his travel plans . the letter shocked them , his mother said .  the things in those letters did not reflect the upbringing they got . those values , they do n't come from us . it was so out of sync . it was so out of place ,  she said . thomas durkin , the teen 's attorney , said the case was a sign of  nothing but immaturity .   there are thousands of kids doing this , and i think that 's part of the point , what 's causing them to do it ? i do n't believe , in my client 's case , it 's because he 's a violent person and wants to go kill people ,  durkin said .  i think he was a misguided young man who got manipulated by social media .  during questioning at the airport , mohammed khan told fbi agents that a person he met online had given him the phone number of a person to call once he arrived in istanbul , federal authorities said in october . that person , khan allegedly told the agents , was to take him to isis territory . according to the complaint , khan told authorities he was planning on being in some type of public service -- like a police force -- or providing humanitarian work or in a combat role . isis has successfully recruited large numbers of foreign fighters from across the globe , including from the united states and western europe . turkey , the complaint notes , is a common transit point for foreign fighters from western countries who travel to join isis . if it were n't for the internet , his mother now says ,  he would never be in the situation he is in today .  so what 's her message for other parents ?  maybe the mistake we made was maybe we protected our children . we were trying to protect our culture or values . maybe that was a mistake ,  zarine khan said .  i would tell them to expose their children more to what 's going on in the world , help them develop critical thinking skills to differentiate between the good and the bad guys .  cnn 's michael martinez and george howell contributed to this report .", "summary": " mohammed hamzah khan is accused of trying to support isis .   the illinois teen 's parents says social media brainwashed his son .
