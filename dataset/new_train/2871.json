{"text": "london samsung just launched their next , new , big time product . it 's the galaxy gear smartwatch . are you kidding ? what the heck is a smartwatch anyway ? who needs it ? are we simply going too far ? do we really need yet one more piece of technology to carry around ? well the answer is yes , and you may be surprised why . i have been an industry analyst following the wireless industry since its beginning . i have have followed and commented on many companies and technologies over nearly 30 years . i have learned quite a bit over this time . one of the key points i have learned is this : the wireless industry reinvents itself every few years . and the smartwatch revolution is getting ready to sweep across and transform the wireless industry once again . read more : apple does n't need to copy samsung . years ago the networks transformed from analog to digital , opening the door to all these amazing devices and services we use today . the smartphone was born . back then , blackberry and nokia led . then , six years ago , the apple iphone and google android entered the picture and transformed the industry once again . the super-smart-phone was born . the tablet was next . mixed in all that noise , the cloud was born . suddenly the marketplace leaders have changed . today they are apple with the iphone and ipad , google android and samsung with the galaxy smartphones and tablets . the last few years have been quiet . this year will be different . suddenly we are seeing new thinking and new technology that will be just as popular entering the marketplace and capturing the headlines . the samsung smartwatch is not a stand-alone device . rather it connects and communicates with the galaxy phones and tablets . read more : the most indestructible meme in tech . why do we need a watch ? well the smartphone is growing in importance to many of us . yesterday we would n't leave the house without taking our keys , wallet and smartphone . tomorrow all we 'll have to grab is the smartphone . it will open our doors and start our cars , it will have credit card information and drivers license and pictures and all sorts of other goodies . it will let us communicate with our doctors , our car , retail stores and so on . in that world we 'll be pulling out our smartphone all the time . it will get to be a real pain in the neck . that 's where the smartwatch comes into the picture . samsung introduced the first smartwatch . it will communicate with their smartphone and their tablet . you can see how many emails , text messages , postings on social sites and more you are getting . you can even read them on the watch if you choose . you 'll have access to your calendar and all sorts of apps based on what you want to see on the watch . it 's up to you . but it all works together over the cloud . photos : battle of the smartwatches . the smartwatch will be your remote control for your smart phone . and your smart phone will be your remote control for your life . what a beautiful world . so let me ask you a question . if you have all these devices , where do you store your data ? we used to synch everything with our laptops , but going forward we 'll synch to the cloud . that 's right , like it or not , the cloud is in your future . it 's the center of the universe . watch more : could an iwatch make apple cool again ? sure there are risks . you have to protect your data like you do on your laptop . and you have to hope the bad guys do n't invade the cloud services that will start popping up all over the place . but one way or another , the cloud is in your future . so samsung wants you to buy a samsung smartwatch to talk with your samsung galaxy smartphone that talks with your samsung galaxy tablet and you can store all your information on the samsung cloud or google cloud . the benefit to samsung and google is the more pieces of the puzzle you buy from them , the more they 've got you . and they want to get you . what about apple ? they reserved the name iwatch a while back and we expected them to introduce their new device first . this time however samsung beat apple to the punch . will apple introduce their iwatch ? i say yes . whether it 's next week or in the near future i do think apple will jump into the same smart watch space . it 's the next wireless frontier . then , we have to ask , what 's coming next ? quite a bit , actually . and it will all be linked together over the cloud . can the smartwatch really compete in an already crowded market of mobile devices or will customers reject it ? without hesitation , yes . is this a gamble on samsung 's part ? well , on one hand , every new innovative idea is a gamble . but i think this will be a big success and get bigger over time . just like with the tablets . the whole idea here is for companies like samsung , google and apple to build an environment that both captivates and captures their audience . the cloud will be the core technology that will tie all these innovative ideas together . i think customers will love this smartwatch , the same way they love the tablets , smartphones , computers and the cloud . this is just one more piece of the puzzle that attracts and retains more customers . and companies will love it as well because it creates a tighter relationship with each customer . so who needs this new smartwatch ? just wait and see how successful it becomes over the next few years . you will be very surprised .", "summary": " samsung has launched its smartwatch which it is calling the galaxy gear .   technology analyst jeff kagan says the wireless industry reinvents itself every few years .   the smartwatch will connect and communicate with galaxy phones and tablets .   so does anyone need it ?
