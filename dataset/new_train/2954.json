{"text": "abu dhabi at 23 , asma al muhairi has never considered herself a social activist . but a shopping trip to a dubai mall left her so irate that she started a campaign against revealing clothing and has sparked a major debate in the united arab emirates . al muhairi 's campaign to persuade expats and tourists to dress more modestly began after she and her friend hanan al rayes saw a young woman in shorts that they considered left little to the imagination . she said many people in dubai mall were looking at the woman , but no one did anything , so she approached security guards and threatened to call the police .  we never saw this 10 years ago or even five years ago ,  said al muhairi , who began her campaign through a hashtag on twitter -- #uaedresscode .  i 'm only 23 but when i was young it was different ,  she added .  i feel sad for the new generations . my nieces when they go to the mall they think it 's fine to look at people dressed like this .  it makes me sad . in our days people always knew it was wrong . it is in our culture and our religion .  while wearing skimpy clothing is not illegal in the united arab emirates , shopping malls have policies that state knees and shoulders should be covered . on returning from the mall , al muhairi discussed the issue with al rayes and wrote a message on twitter , saying  till when will we keep seeing people going against our rules and showing indecent dresses ?  initially , al muhairi and al rayes had no intention of starting a campaign , just sharing their views with friends . however , the discussion grew as the issue touched a nerve with many .  i never though that in 10 days i would become a social activist ,  said al muhairi . the campaign has started a debate on how closely foreigners should follow local customs while in the united arab emirates , and just what standards of dress are acceptable . also on inside the middle east : egypt elections : ` women need a champion ' local newspapers , personalities and those prominent on social media have weighed in on the debate , calling on the country 's authorities and shopping-mall managers to enforce a conservative dress code . some have suggested that tourists arriving at airports should be given a brochure explaining local customs and standards of dress . the british ambassador to the united arab emirates , dominic jermey , had already made his own plea to visitors before al muhairi and al rayes began their campaign . in an interview with the ministry of interior 's 999 magazine in march , jermey said :  the vast majority of expats living here dress entirely appropriately , and i think that most british people who live here or visit here get it absolutely right . some who get it slightly wrong tend to get very bad sunburn !  but seriously , i think it is really important for expats and tourists to understand the norms of the society they are in , so that is why we , through our embassies in dubai and abu dhabi work very closely with tour operators , local schools , and the airlines , in particular emirates and etihad , to run a campaign called know before you go .  the issue goes to the heart of what can at times be a clash of cultures . more than 80 % of the united arab emirates population is expatriate , according to visit abu dhabi , and much of the country 's wealth is built on its foreign workers . the country prides itself on its welcoming attitude to foreigners . most emirati women wear abayas -- long robes that cover the whole body -- but the expectation for foreigners is more relaxed . the government advises visitors to respect local culture by avoiding  excessively revealing  clothes in public places . although most of the attention has been focused on women , al mulhairi also has her sights on men who wear shorts , go bare-chested or wear clothes that are too tight fitting . she said :  we should start in the malls distributing booklets with instructions . we need to create awareness and let people know about this campaign and that people here are upset about this issue .  we should give a deadline -- from a certain date , everyone will know that if they wear certain kind of dress , the mall wo n't let them in , or maybe give them a fine . someone suggested giving them something to cover themselves .  also on inside the middle east : young upstarts plotting mid east art revolution . many foreigners , as well as emiratis , agree that more needs to be done to educate visitors on what is acceptable . trudy klein , a 30-year-old south african who has lived in dubai for six years , said :  we are living in a middle eastern country . there are things we need to respect about the country and the religion . we are guests .  i 've seen girls that really push the limits . it would n't be a bad idea to educate some women to show respect .  khadija sali , a journalist from the philippines , said :  we have to respect the culture and respect ourselves as well . do n't wear anything too short or too tight , it 's common sense .  however , she said she would draw the line at shopping mall security guards giving people extra clothes to cover themselves .  the campaign is good but they should n't go over the top ,  said sali .  there are more important issues out there that they could do campaigns about -- sick people , children dying , hungry people , not what people wear in the malls .  follow the inside the middle east team on twitter : presenter rima maktabi : @rimamaktabi , producer jon jensen : @jonjensen , producer schams elwazer @schamscnn and writer catriona davies @catrionadavies .", "summary": " asma al muhairi started campaign after seeing woman in skimpy shorts in a dubai shopping mall .   shopping malls in the united arab emirates expect visitors to cover their knees and shoulders .   brochures should be given out at airports explaining the need for modest dress , say campaigners .
