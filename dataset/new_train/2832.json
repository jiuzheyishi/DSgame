{"text": "if sebastian vettel 's efficient march towards his fourth formula one crown left fans of motor racing 's premier competition stifling yawns , things in the top class on two wheels are rather different . last month , the latest in spain 's prodigious production line of motorcycle racers , marc marquez , looked to have the motogp title sewn up . arriving in australia with a cavernous 43-point lead over compatriot jorge lorenzo , it seemed almost inevitable that the 20-year-old would become the division 's youngest champion , and the first rookie to win the title since kenny roberts in 1978 . instead , the twisting undulations of phillip island flipped the season 's story on its head . bridgestone , motogp 's tire supplier , had been unable to properly test on the newly resurfaced circuit , and the teams quickly discovered that the fresh tarmac was causing their rubber to disintegrate at a dangerous rate . for safety , the race was reduced to 19 laps , and a mandatory bike change introduced at the halfway point . to widespread astonishment , marquez 's repsol honda team misinterpreted the strict guidance on pit stops and he stayed out on track a lap too long , leading to his disqualification . the black flag for marquez may have been harsh -- a tweet from veteran rider colin edwards summed up the feelings of many fans -- but honda 's loss was yamaha 's gain . lorenzo went on to win , and suddenly the championship race was back on . lorenzo carved further into marquez 's lead the following week , beating his younger rival into second place at honda 's home circuit in motegi , japan . now , as the teams arrive in valencia for sunday 's season finale , the title is well and truly up for grabs -- with just 13 points separating the top two . the most likely scenario for lorenzo to defend his title , and claim a third overall , is for the mallorcan to win the race and hope marquez is no higher than fifth . the other permutations would require marquez to either not finish -- which has happened only once this season , in june -- or be lower than eighth . however , he has been on the podium for 15 of 17 races . hervÃ © poncharal , a former rider who is now principal of the monster yamaha tech 3 team he co-founded , is a big admirer of both men .  lorenzo is an incredible racing machine ,  poncharal told cnn .  he is so sharp , he is so methodical . i have incredible respect for the rider .  however , he adds that the motogp paddock already considers marquez to be a champion .  for everyone it does n't matter the outcome of valencia , he is the world champ in terms of speed . and this year is really incredible , because this is happening in a year when motogp is so competitive -lrb- at the top -rrb- .  poncharal also notes marquez 's startling maturity , which has given the youngster the consistency that many rookie riders struggle to deliver .  he is incredibly aggressive on the bike , but if you look at the record he 's not a big crasher . when you look at how aggressive he is , how hard he tries , and the risks he 's taking , you can see that already now he 's a very mature guy , although he 's the youngest .  former motogp rider and double world superbike champion james toseland agrees .  i 've been amazed at how he pushes the bike to the limit consistently ,  toseland , who is now forging a career in music , told cnn .  at mugello -lrb- the italian motogp , when marquez fell close to the end of the race while riding in a comfortable second place -rrb- you saw an over-enthusiastic 20-year-old , but that 's all i 've seen of that kind of personality . he 's been so consistent and so level-headed since then .  the briton also sees the two spaniards as neck and neck in the talent stakes :  i truly believe that lorenzo is more than a match for marquez on the same day , on the same bike , in the same conditions .  motogp is not immune to the problems f1 has faced with the dominance of vettel 's red bull . while an underachieving ducati team continues to struggle , the factory outfits of honda and yamaha are simply blowing away the opposition , so the fact that this year 's title is going to the wire will no doubt please the championship 's governing body . also , while the gap between honda , yamaha and the rest may be wide , there is no absence of personal rivalry at the top of the championship . marquez 's relationship with third-placed teammate dani pedrosa is not exactly cordial , and he has consistently riled his rivals with his combative and uncompromising style . marquez was docked a point for a clash with pedrosa at aragon in early october , and controversially escaped censure for a rough pass on lorenzo in jerez . so while lorenzo will be fighting tooth and nail for victory , pedrosa may also be less than willing to help smooth his fellow catalan 's ride to glory . poncharal doubts that any quarter will be given .  i 'm not so sure pedrosa is going to help marquez a lot , but dani winning the race , that 's good news for marc ,  he said . intriguingly valencia is a particularly happy hunting ground for pedrosa , with a total of six wins at the track , including three in the motogp class . while his own hopes of a long-awaited first championship were ended in japan , the diminutive 28-year-old will be looking to end the season on a high . lorenzo has also won a motogp race at the track , in 2010 -- the year he won his first world title -- while marquez rode to victory there last season on the way to winning the moto2 class . poncharal believes that britain 's cal crutchlow , who rides for tech 3 , could also play key role along with lorenzo 's seven-time world champion teammate valentino rossi .  cal is going to wish to finish the season as high as possible ; he was second last year -lrb- at valencia -rrb- when he crashed four laps from the end . valentino is going to be pushing ; i 'm not sure he will play jorge 's game .  the last time a motogp season went down to the final race was in 2006 , when america 's nicky hayden , then riding for honda , wrested the crown from the all-conquering rossi . rossi , in his first stint at yamaha , fell early in the race and was unable to regain enough places to prevent hayden clinching what would be his first and , to date , only title . this time around , marquez will be hoping to avoid any mishaps as he looks to clinch motorcycle racing 's ultimate prize .  it 's going to be incredibly tense -- 13 points is good to have , but it 's not a lot ,  poncharal said .  it looks easier than it will be ... i think it 's 50-50 .  with europe heading towards winter , conditions at the track may also play a role .  valencia is a special track ,  poncharal said .  we know the weather this time will be difficult , there will be a lot of pressure because -lrb- in japan -rrb- we saw marc , for the first time , not being the marc we know . he will be under more pressure at the last round .  in jorge 's mind it was game over -lrb- before australia -rrb- . now everything has changed , jorge is going to go out in valencia not thinking , just pushing -- without any pressure .  for motorsport fans looking for one last fix of excitement before the season ends , sunday 's race should provide it in spades .  the final is going to be like a dream scenario ,  poncharal said .  let the sport decide .
