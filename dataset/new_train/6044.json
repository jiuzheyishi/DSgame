{"text": "they may look good enough to eat , but these images of realistic-looking meals are actually made entirely of lambswool . from the great british fry-up to a traditional roast dinner , art director and model maker jessica dance has recreated beloved classic dishes to scale - in a format not safe for human consumption . each tiny baked bean is individually sewn and yarn colour is alternated to show grill marks on meats , making the brightly-coloured reproduction dinners hyper-realistic , and also cartoon-like ; what a perfect diner advertisement might resemble . the comfort food series is a knitted project by jessica dance with photographer david sykes - the burger came first . the project is a collaboration between ex-fashion student dance , 26 , from east london , and photographer david sykes , 38 , from london . aptly called comfort food , the series aims to encapsulate the mood of the classic british caf√© , fast food joint and burger van - but with a woolly twist . the burger meal - ` fast food reimagined ' - . was knitted first . it features individually knitted fries in a red chip box , a mounded burger bun encasing a beef burger , and meticulous . detailing such as tomatoes , gherkins and floppy processed cheese . once the burger had been shot , david and jessica decided on the other dishes . they wanted to pick iconic dishes and thought , ` what 's more iconic than a full english breakfast ? ' , and recreated a classic fry-up form wool . for this one , jessica had to make lots . of baked beans out of wool to scale - ` they took a while to make , ' she . says , ` but were well worth it as they worked really well ' . it features a cup of tea , toast , beans , tomato , egg , sausage , bacon with fat , mushroom and butter - all knitted to scale from representative multicoloured yarn . the british fry-up features a cup of tea , toast , beans , tomato , egg , sausage , bacon , mushroom and butter - all knitted to scale . the next . shot was the classic american hotdog . the pair muse that while it was the simplest dish to . produce , it created one of the most graphic and striking images of the series . the . hot dog features a white and beige knitted hot dog bun - just like a . real one - and a pinkish hot dog with a yellow wiggly strip of mustard running down its length . while shooting the first shots in this series , david mentioned that he wanted to send out a christmas card and it would be great to make a christmas dinner . so jessica went away and created a full roast dinner out of wool . the roast came with all the trimmings , complete with woolly pigs in blankets - a must have at any christmas roast - brussels sprouts , carrots , cranberries , roast potatoes , gravy , and an entire turkey . the hot dog features a white and beige knitted hot dog bun - just like a real one - a pinkish hot dog and yellow wiggly strip of mustard . both david and jessica have a meticulous attention to detail and their collaborative projects are very much a meeting of minds . jessica knits all of her woolly creations on her vintage domestic knitting machine and sculpts the foundations of the models by hand in her east london studio . david wanted the images to look like they were classic food photography , but on closer inspection turned out to be made of wool , so they styled the sets to be as real as possible . to help with the double take effect , david lit them in the same way he would light one of his shoots with real food . david and jessica are planning to have an exhibition in london later in the year showing all their woolly projects , complete with large scale photographic prints of the work and also the actual models jessica made for the shoots . the christmas roast dinner comes with brussels sprouts , carrots , pigs in blankets , cranberries , roast potatoes , turkey and gravy .", "summary": " comfort food is project by director and model maker jessica dance , 26 , and photographer david sykes , 38 .   pair plan an exhibition of their knitted projects in october or november in a london gallery .
