' she continued : ` my medical needs are no less important or more important than the person in the cell next to me . ' in 2002 , wolf ruled that kosilek was entitled to treatment for gender-identity disorder , but stopped short of ordering surgery . she was also granted electrolysis treatment and hormone therapy . kosilek sued again in 2005 , arguing that the surgery is a medical necessity . in his ruling tuesday , wolf found that surgery is the ` only adequate treatment ' for kosilek 's ` serious medical need . ' ` the court finds that there is no less intrusive means to correct the prolonged violation of kosilek 's eighth amendment right to adequate medical care , ' wolf wrote in his 126-page ruling . prison officials have repeatedly cited security concerns in the case , saying that allowing her to have the surgery would make her a target for sexual assaults by other inmates . massachusetts correction commissioner kathleen dennehy has said that if kosilek has the surgery , the consequences would be unprecedented . ` the safety and security concerns are enormous , ' dennehy testified , according to cbs . but wolf found that the doc 's security concerns are ` either pretextual or can be dealt with by the doc .

' according to research by brown , about 27,000 people nationwide have gender identity disorder . experts estimate 500 to 750 americans undergo the surgery each year , with hundreds more seeking the procedure abroad . federal courts have said prisons must provide adequate medical care , and that they must protect inmates from themselves . but correctional officials and lawmakers balk at using taxpayer money for sex-change operations that can cost up to $ 20,000 . brown estimates that at least 750 of the more than 2 million prisoners nationwide had gender identity disorder in 2007 , his latest count . watch a legal discussion of the kosilek case from before the verdict was announced : .", "summary": " robert kosilek was convicted of murdering his wife cheryl in 1990 .   in prison , he changed his name to michelle , sued for the state to pay for a sex change and attempting to castrate herself in custody .   today a massachusetts judge ruled that the $ 20,000 surgery is the ` only adequate treatment '   prison officials say sex change will make kosilek a target in prison .   historic decision is the first of its kind in the nation .
