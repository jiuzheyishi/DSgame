{"text": "editor 's note : jenny mccarthy and jim carrey are actors and parents actively involved in autism-related causes . mccarthy is the author of the book  louder than words : a mother 's journey in healing autism .  actress jenny mccarthy believes that vaccines could have contributed to her son 's autism . in light of the recent hannah poling decision , in which the federal court conceded that vaccines could have contributed to her autism , we think the tide is finally turning in the direction of parents like us who have been shouting concerns from our rooftops for years . autism is a debilitating disorder , which according to the centers for disease control and prevention , is suffered by 1 in 150 kids , making it more common than childhood cancer , diabetes and aids combined . recently , england and ireland reported that autism is affecting one in 58 individuals . is it any wonder that autism has become many new parents ' no. 1 fear ? we 've met some of the most amazing moms and dads who are forging their own path to prevention and recovery . when our son , evan , was diagnosed with autism we were lucky enough to benefit from their knowledge and experience . evan has been healed to a great extent by many breakthroughs that , while perhaps not scientifically proven , have definitely helped evan and many other children who are recovering from autism . parents vs. scientists : watch the latest test case  there are some who wonder what we mean when we say  recovering  from autism . they confuse the word recover with cure . while you may not be able to cure an injury caused in a terrible car accident , you can recover ; you can regain many skills that you once lost . in the case of autism , we think there are treatments that often bring about such healing , so that the observable symptoms of the condition no longer exist . even though we may no longer see any symptoms of autism , we ca n't say a child is  cured  because we do not know what they would have been like had they never been injured . we believe what helped evan recover was starting a gluten-free , casein-free diet , vitamin supplementation , detox of metals , and anti-fungals for yeast overgrowth that plagued his intestines . once evan 's neurological function was recovered through these medical treatments , speech therapy and applied behavior analysis helped him quickly learn the skills he could not learn while he was frozen in autism . after we implemented these therapies for one year , the state re-evaluated evan for further services . they spent five minutes with evan and said ,  what happened ? we 've never seen a recovery like this .  watch jenny mccarthy talk about her son 's autism  evan is now 5 years old and what might surprise a lot of you is that we 've never been contacted by a single member of the cdc , the american academy of pediatrics , or any other health authority to evaluate and understand how evan recovered from autism . when evan meets doctors and neurologists , to this day they tell us he was misdiagnosed -- that he never had autism to begin with . it 's as if they are wired to believe that children ca n't recover from autism . watch cdc chief on vaccines , autism  so where 's the cavalry ? where are all the doctors beating down our door to take a closer look at evan ? we think we know why they have n't arrived . most of the parents we 've met who have recovered their child from autism as we did -lrb- and we have met many -rrb- blame vaccines for their child 's autism . we think our health authorities do n't want to open this can of worms , so they do n't even look or listen . while there is strong debate on this topic , many parents of recovered children will tell you they did n't treat their child for autism ; they treated them for vaccine injury . read about latest fight over vaccines and autism . many people are n't aware that in the 1980s our children received only 10 vaccines by age 5 , whereas today they are given 36 immunizations , most of them by age 2 . with billions of pharmaceutical dollars , could it be possible that the vaccine program is becoming more of a profit engine then a means of prevention ? we believe autism is an environmental illness . vaccines are not the only environmental trigger , but we do think they play a major role . if we are going to solve this problem and finally start to reverse the rate of autism , we need to consider changing the vaccine schedule , reducing the number of shots given and removing certain ingredients that could be toxic to some children . we take into account that some children have reactions to medicines like penicillin , for example , yet when it comes to vaccines we are operating as if our kids have a universal tolerance for them . we are acting like one size fits all . that is , at the very least , a huge improbability . even if the cdc is not convinced of a link between vaccines and autism , changing the vaccine schedule should be seriously considered as a precautionary measure . -lrb- if you would like to see some ideas for alternative schedules , check out http://generationrescue.org . -rrb- . we wish to state , very clearly , that we are not against all vaccines , but we do believe there is strong evidence to suggest that some of the ingredients may be hazardous and that our children are being given too many , too soon ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": " mccarthy believes diet and vitamins helped her son recover from autism .   vaccines played a role in son 's autism , she says .   mccarthy and jim carrey think children being given too many vaccines , too soon .
