{"text": "washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- in his upcoming state of the union speech , president barack obama will call on congress to simplify a tax code he deems overly complicated and weighted toward wealthy americans , administration officials said saturday . the moves -- likely to meet resistance from republicans in congress -- are meant to pay for the long slate of new programs the president began laying out two weeks ago designed to bolster the middle class , including offering two free years of community college to qualified students . obama 's aides have been seeking ways to expand a robust economic recovery beyond top earners , who have been buoyed by record closes on wall street . despite reams of positive economic news , most americans still say economic conditions in the country are only fair . and , if they see improvement , they are n't crediting the white house .  the middle class has yet to experience the prosperity shown in the recovery , and what you 'll see tuesday night is the vision for finishing that job ,  a senior administration official said . obama is set to propose tuesday a $ 500 tax credit for married couples who each hold jobs ; the intention , officials say , is to help alleviate the costs of child care and commuting that lead some spouses -- usually women -- to determine it makes more financial sense to stop working . he 'll also spell out ways to simplify the way taxpayers apply for education and child care credits , including increasing the top child care credit to $ 3,000 . the total cost for the new provisions : $ 235 billion , according to administration officials , who spoke anonymously ahead of the plan 's official unveiling . for the first time since becoming president , all of obama 's changes would need to be approved both by a gop house and a senate with a new republican majority . looking to increase capital gains rate . to pay for the changes , the administration is proposing about $ 320 billion in new revenue over the next decade . obama wants to wring more taxes from investment income -- capital gains and dividends -- which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary earnings . since wealthy americans are more likely to derive income from investments , they 'd bear the overwhelming weight of a higher rate on that type of profit . the tax rate for capital gains now stands at 20 % for the highest-earning americans . officials said saturday that obama will call for that rate to increase to 28 % for those taxpayers . he will ask lawmakers to close a loophole allowing capital gains on inherited funds to go untaxed -- a so-called  trust fund  loophole the white house says allows billions of dollars in capital gains to go untapped by the government every year .  this proposal is doing what it is intended to do , which is to make sure that the large , accumulated , unearned wealth of the wealthiest americans is actually subject to tax ,  an obama administration official said .  we are quite confident that we can do this in a way that achieves that objective while in fact helping middle-class families by putting those resources to better use .  the arguments against raising tax rates on investment income are well established : opponents argue it poses a  double tax  scenario , since the corporate profits that drive stock prices are already subject to taxes . and they stress some portion of investment gains is driven by inflation . but republicans are n't necessarily opposed to altering how investment income is taxed : last year 's proposal from the top republican on the house tax writing committee , rep. dave camp , called for applying ordinary income tax rates on 60 % of capital gains and excluding the other 40 % altogether . that put the top rate at 21 % . in his speech tuesday , obama also plans to all for a new fee on large financial institutions which administration officials estimated would bring in $ 110 billion ; camp 's plan called for an excise tax on large banks .  i would say that a number of the ideas that the president is outlining in this new proposal do have -- already have -- clear congressional bipartisan support ,  a senior administration official said saturday . republicans were dismissive of the tax initiatives unveiled saturday evening .  this is not a serious proposal ,  brendan buck , spokesman for house ways and means chairman paul ryan , told cnn .  we lift families up and grow the economy with a simpler , flatter tax code , not big tax increases to pay for more washington spending .  obama has spent the last two weeks offering up an advance look at his state of the union address , including the community college proposal , a plan to expand high-speed internet and reducing rates of federally backed mortgages . the early look is meant to introduce americans to each scheme individually , said administration aides , who determined the yearly laundry-list of plans -- combined with updates on america 's foreign policy -- was n't digestible during a single prime-time event . that does n't mean , however , the speech will necessarily be any shorter than the 65-minute address obama delivered last year .  it will still be a healthy speech in terms of breadth and length ,  one official said . why obama 's going to india after his state of the union speech .", "summary": " republicans criticize tax initiatives .   obama to unveil new tax proposals during tuesday 's state of the union .   new plan would offer middle-class credits ; wring more from rich .   plan needs approval from republican-controlled congress .
