{"text": "researchers have claimed that shakespeare 's portrayal of king richard iii as a psychopath was unfounded - but admit he was a control freak . a team at the university of leicester , which recently discovered the remains of the king under a car park , are now attempting to analyse the king 's personality . they found that , while there was no . evidence for shakespeare 's depiction of richard iii as a psychopath , he . may have had ` intolerance to uncertainty syndrome ' -- which may have . manifested in control freak tendencies . the hunchback king : the skeleton or richard iii , unearthed in a . dig last september , showing evidence of the curvature of the spine . and battle injuries suffered by the last . plantagenet king . they say their analysis aims to . humanise richard and ` to flesh out the bones and get to the character . of the man who became one of the most controversial kings in english . history . ' professor mark lansdale , head of the university 's school of psychology , and forensic psychologist dr julian boon carried out the study based on the consensus among historians . firstly , they examined one of the most persistent and critical depictions of richard 's personality -- the suggestion that he was a murdering psychopath . kevin spacey appears as richard iii in old vic theatre in london . researchers now say shakespeare 's portrayal of him was unfair . ` this reputation , portrayed most famously in shakespeare 's play , does not seem to have any basis in the facts we have about his life , ' they said . they found he showed little signs of the traits psychologists would use to identify psychopaths today -- including narcissism , deviousness , callousness , recklessness and lack of empathy in close relationships . however , the academics speculate that richard may have exhibited a common psychological syndrome know as an intolerance to uncertainty . professor mark lansdale said : ` this syndrome is associated with a need to seek security following an insecure childhood , as richard had . in varying degrees , it is associated with a number of positive aspects of personality including a strong sense of right and wrong , piety , loyalty to trusted colleagues , and a belief in legal processes - all exhibited by richard . ` on the negative side it is also associated with fatalism , a tendency to disproportionate responses when loyalty is betrayed and a general sense of ` control freakery ' that can , in extreme cases , emerge as very authoritarian or possibly priggish . ` we believe this is an interesting perspective on richard 's character . ' in addition , the pair examined how his . disability , evident in the curvature of the spine of the king 's remains . may have had an impact on his character - and specifically on the way he . interacted with people who he did not know well . the . remains of richard iii came within a matter of inches of being lost . forever when a 19th century toilet was built above the skeleton , a lead . archaeologist revealed today . richard . buckley , who led the project to exhume the deposed king , said his final . resting place came close to being ` completely destroyed ' when the . outhouse was built on top of the site . luckily , . the grave was only slightly disturbed by the building 's primitive . foundations , which missed the deceased monarch 's body by a few inches . when they were installed . because . his remains were buried just 27in under the flag stones of greyfriars . monastery in leicester , they were disturbed on a number of occasions as . by builders developing the area . the . 527-year-old skeleton - buried with its hands crossed in a shallow . grave - was missing its feet , which experts believe were smashed off . when the foundations were built . the . site was later turned into a council car park for social workers until a . team searching for the king 's body excavated the area last september . a . three-week dig by experts from the university of leicester unearthed . the skeleton which was confirmed ` beyond reasonable doubt ' today to be . that of the last plantagenet king . but . mr buckley said that the king 's remains were . almost flushed down the pan when the outhouse was constructed in the . 1800s . he said : ` the remains were very vulnerable because they were only under relatively modern debris . a less experienced team could easily have damaged the skeleton whilst using a mechanical digger to open the trench . ' one woman 's hunch led to the discovery of the skeleton which has now been proven to be that of richard iii . screenwriter . philippa langley , pictured right , said she felt a chill on a hot . summer 's day as she walked through the area where it was thought he was . buried . the . remarkable discovery of the remains , which , consistent with historical . accounts of richard , have both a curved spine back and wounded skull , . was made last september . miss . langley was strolling across the car park used by leicester social . services while researching a play about the king when she felt a chill . in august 2009 . ` it . was a hot summer and i had goosebumps so badly and i was freezing cold . i walked past a particular spot and absolutely knew i was walking on . his grave , ' she told the sunday times . ' i am a rational human being but the feeling i got was the same feeling i have had before when a truth is given to me . ' miss . langley initially funded the excavation of what is now a leicester city . council car park because she was '99 per cent certain ' that the remains . were those of richard . miss . langley , who is a member of the richard iii society , is working on a . documentary charting the excavation for channel 4 titled richard iii : . the king in the car park , which has been made alongside the university . academics and will be screened tonight . she . said the her play has been turned into a script for television and . film , which is now ` getting serious interest from los angeles and in the . uk ' . in medieval times , deformation was often taken as a visible indication of a twisted soul . as a result , it is possible that this would have made him cautious in all his interactions with others . professor lansdale added : ` overall , we recognise the difficulty of drawing conclusions about people who lived 500 years ago and about whom relatively little is reliably recorded ; especially when psychology is a science that is so reliant upon observation . ` however , noting that this is the problem historians work with as a matter of routine , we argue that a psychological approach provides a distinct and novel perspective : one which offers a different way of thinking about the human being behind the bones .
