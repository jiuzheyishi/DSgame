{"text": "more than half of households make no contribution to the state as a result of labour 's decision to increase spending on benefits , a report reveals today . in a 53.4 per cent of homes , state handouts and services now outweigh their tax payments . in 2001 - prior to labour 's debt binge - the figure was less than 44 per cent . burden : more than half of households make no contribution to the state as a result of labour 's decision to increase spending on benefits , a report reveals today . it had increased by only 0.7 per cent since 1979 . it then exploded after labour used tax credits and other handouts to drag a huge number of new households into the pay of the state . the centre for policy studies , which compiled the report , said the situation was ` unsustainable ' . the think-tank says benefits will have to be slashed , and the pension age increased , to balance the books . ryan bourne , head of economics at the cps , said : ` these data show that even before the financial crisis , the labour government was ramping up spending on cash benefits and benefits in kind without corresponding increases in taxation . increase : the proportion of non-retired households receiving a cash benefit other than child benefit rose from 40.3 per cent in 2001 to 44.6 per cent in 2010/11 Â¿ an increase of over a million households . ` this was not redistribution from rich to poor , but redistribution from the future to the present . it felt good at the time , but given the government does n't have its own money , was unsustainable . ' the study , based on figures from the office for national statistics , shows the government is becoming ever more reliant on the taxes paid by higher earners . only the wealthiest 20 per cent of society are paying significantly more to the state - # 20,125-a-year - than they receive in benefits and public services . state services and benefits include unemployment and child benefits and health and education . taxes include vat , council tax and alcohol duty , as well as payments to hmrc . criticism : last week , labour leader ed miliband criticised the tories for cutting the top rate of tax from 50 to 45 per cent for the highest earners . between 2001 and last year , around three million more households became net recipients of the state . over this period , middle-income households have moved from being significant net contributors to the state to significant net recipients - taking out # 4,589 more than they put in . in 1990 , middle income households faced an effective tax rate of 8.2 per cent . but by 2010/11 this had reversed , the study says . the effective tax rate was minus 20 per cent . the households with the lowest incomes received # 10,153 more in benefits than paid in taxes . the report acknowledges that at least part of the change in effective tax rates is down to changing demographics , with an increasing proportion of retired households . but even in non-retired households 39.6 per cent received more in benefits than they paid in taxes - up from 31.7 per cent in 1979 and 29.0 per cent in 2001 . the proportion of non-retired households receiving a cash benefit other than child benefit rose from 40.3 per cent in 2001 to 44.6 per cent in 2010/11 -- an increase of over a million households . tim knox , director of the cps , said : ` these trends are unsustainable -- particularly given the ageing profile of the uk population . ` reversing the trend will require implementation of tough policies to get more people into work , to continue the reform of public services , to restrain increases in the cost of benefits payment , and to ensure that enterprise has the freedom to flourish - leading to more growth , more employment and higher wages and salaries .
