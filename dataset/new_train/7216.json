' as 10 and 11-year-olds looked on in distress from just three feet away , priest argued about the accuracy of the speed gun and gesticulated at a classroom assistant yelling : ` is this what you f *** ing teach kids ? what sort of school is this ? ' later , when told by a regular constable he would have to pay a # 60 fixed penalty notice for doing 37mph in a 30mph zone , priest boasted : ' i earn # 80,000 a year so i can afford the ticket . my f *** ing solicitor will get me off . i 'm going to f *** ing have you . you 're f *** ed , i 'm going to make a complaint against you . ' the children were so upset by his aggressive outburst they had to be ushered back into the classroom at gorsey bank primary school in wilmslow . a letter was later sent out to all parents detailing what happened . details of the priest 's rant emerged as the businessman , who lives in a flat in mobberley , cheshire , was fined # 1,000 and ordered to pay # 1,000 costs after he was convicted of speeding and using threatening behaviour . the incident occurred in july last year , when nine year 6 pupils were taking part in a ` school speed watch ' project with the police officers as part of road safety week . any motorists stopped for speeding were given the option of taking a fine or explaining to children in a ` kids ' court ' at the school why they broke the speed limit . the trouble began when priest was pulled over in his silver audi a3 magistrates in macclesfield heard . teaching assistant debra barker told the hearing : ` he was very , very angry from the minute he was pulled over . he was aggressive and was using lots of  f-words  . ' i told the children the man had obviously had a bad day but they were worried and i kept trying to to reassure them . he said ,  is this what you f *** ing teach kids ? what sort of school is this ?  ... i felt very vulnerable and i felt awkward . ` he screeched into the car park . he drove his car forward , his wheels were spinning and he drove aggressively into the car park . ` threatening ' : he shouted and swore at pcsos in front of children from gorsey bank primary school in cheshire . ` he got out and walked up to the pcso and squared up to him . i thought it was going to come to fisticuffs and he was going to punch him . ' pcso gareth harding said : ` he was instantly argumentative and would n't let me show him the speed - instead saying the machine was n't calibrated . ` he started gesturing towards the pupils . i warned him about his language and behaviour but he jumped out of the car came straight towards me and started swearing and shouting . ` the teacher clearly looked very concerned for the children , a lot of them were starting to get quite agitated , looking like they did n't want to be there at all . a few of them were quite distressed . ' pcso rebecca wooley said : ' i explained that a speed gun had detected the speed he was going but he said he was not speeding and his speedometer had not shown him as speeding . - teaching assistant debra barker . ` he was angry and very irritated - his voice was raised and his demeanour came across as agitated . ` he made reference to the teacher and pointed and said ,  you want to teach your kids properly  . the children were becoming more distressed , they were n't used to that sort of behaviour , so i advised the teaching assistant to take them back into the school . ` mr priest stopped his car , got out then came quite close to my personal space . he became irritated and said something of the effect of : ` this is b ***** ks , i was n't speeding . ' ' i asked mr priest to not swear , there were still children and staff members who could potentially hear what he was saying . but he said :  you 're police community officers , you 're not even proper pigs . go and stop some more innocent people .  ` he made reference about being late for an appointment . he returned with a mobile phone from his car and said he was going to record the conversation . he wanted to take the issue to court and i said that was his entitlement . ' i saw mr priest in the constable 's personal space and he appeared to be waving his arms , very close to his face . he would n't let him speak and was shouting over him . ` he told him he earned # 80,000 a year so he can afford the ticket and he was moving to qatar for two or three months , so it did n't matter if he got any points . ' priest who was cleared of stamping on a policeman 's hat during the incident denied wrongdoing and said : ` i 've never heard of a kids ' court - it sounds ridiculous . i 'm not being ostracised by children . ' but district judge pam baldwin told him : ` your shouting and aggressive behaviour caused the children distress . i 've no doubt these incidents are frustrating but you went beyond a legitimate expression of frustration .
