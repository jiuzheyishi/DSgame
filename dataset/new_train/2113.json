{"text": "what color underwear did you wear on new year 's eve ? your choice may say something about your culture and your hopes for 2012 -- as might whether you decide to ring in the new year by smashing dishes , respectfully bowing to your elders or feasting on everything from cabbage to sticky rice soup to black-eyed peas . as they do every december 31 , revelers around the world spent saturday-into-sunday ushering in the new year in distinctive ways . one of the most common was by watching fireworks light up the nighttime sky , though this was just one of many ways people found to celebrate and do all they could to ensure that the next 12 months proceed as they wish . and yes , underwear is one way to state your intentions -- at least in many south american countries , including brazil and argentina . if you wore yellow , that supposedly enhances your chances for abundance and reaping in more money . if it was red , then you 'll more likely find love in 2012 . and if you were sporting white underpants , preferably new and clean , then peace was your top priority for the coming year . one new year 's theme that resonates across borders , ages and ethnic groups is feasting on foods in an effort to boost your prospects for the future . but the menu varies from place to place . cabbage represents money and sauerkraut is for living a long life for some of northern european ancestry , for instance . people in spain and many latin american countries down 12 grapes , one each to  guarantee  a month of happiness . in parts of the american south , year-round favorites black-eyed peas , ham and collard greens carry special importance over the new year 's holiday . people in the nation of georgia do n't count on a chef for good luck . rather , they rely on the first person to come through their home 's door after midnight -- a person who , theoretically , will bring them fortune for the following year . snacking on candy on new year 's eve is another way , in the former soviet territory , to ensure that 2012 is likewise sweet , and not bitter . brazilians try to optimize their prospects for the coming year by jumping waves or , if they are not near the beach , eating lentil soup or handing out money . besides raucously banging together pots and pans , filipinos eat round fruits to bring good fortune . some new year 's traditions have nothing to do with luck . a front stoop littered with broken plates in denmark , for instance , suggests that the person inside has a lot of friends since , each new year 's eve , people throw their old dishes at the doors of their friends ' homes . the agenda for fun in canada depends on where you are , from partying at a  reveillon  in quebec to imbibing screech rum in newfoundland to savoring  beaver tail  -- a canadian fried dough treat -- in ontario . still , for all those who partake in grand new year 's events , there are many more who make their own traditions . it may be a small gathering of family and friends , watching the times square ball drop on tv , or loudly running through the neighborhood . some may simply go to sleep early , so they can be energized for an early new year 's day hike -- perhaps while wearing underwear that suits their mood , and wishes , for 2012 . cnn 's marilia brocchetto , george kazarian , kenneth ernhofer , john sanders , peter kaplan , shruti pant , guilermo arduino , rafael romo , jane lee , bonnie turner , talia kayali , sara yeglin and armie jarin-bennett contributed to this report .", "summary": " people worldwide celebrate new year 's in different ways .   latin americans express their hopes through the color of their underwear .   in denmark , people throw old dishes at their friends ' homes .
