{"text": "tucson , arizona u.s. rep. gabrielle giffords on thursday continued her dramatic recovery from a gunshot wound to the brain by going outside for physical therapy , one of her principal doctors in tucson , arizona , told cnn .  today actually , we were glad to say that we were able to take her outside and she was able to do her physical therapy ,  dr. peter rhee told john king .  we gave her some fresh air and also gave her some sunshine ,  said rhee , speaking from outside university medical center .  she was able to see the arizona mountains .  behind rhee , flowers left by well-wishers filled a portion of the hospital lawn . a day before she was to be flown to a texas hospital , the husband of giffords , shot in the head less than two weeks ago at a public event , described his wife 's progress as  remarkable .  mark kelly said thursday he is hopeful the arizona congresswoman will make a full recovery .  i 've told her that ,  kelly told reporters at university medical center .  she recognizes it ... she is a fighter like nobody else that i know .  giffords is able to stand with assistance , but is not yet able to take steps or walk , said rhee , adding therapists are helping giffords with ways to express her thoughts and , eventually , speak .  -lsb- we are -rsb- holding her up so she can train herself to hold her head up ,  rhee said .  she is learning to balance and learning all the little things we can take for granted .  giffords , 40 , was shot in an assassination attempt and mass shooting that killed six and wounded 13 at a safeway grocery store in tucson on january 8 . the congresswoman is the only person still hospitalized after the attack , the hospital has said . giffords will be taken by ambulance friday morning from university medical center in tucson to davis-monthan air force base . giffords will be flown to houston , where she will receive further treatment at memorial hermann-texas medical center , her office said in a statement . on wednesday , the public learned that giffords was able to rise from her hospital bed and stand with assistance . kelly said that while what physical therapists classify as  standing  or  steps  and the clinical definition of it are  a little bit different ,  he said his wife  can bear her own weight , which is a big step , i think . just speaking for the doctors here , i think she 's made a remarkable recovery at this point .  he said he believes she has tried to speak , although she is prevented from doing so by a breathing tube in her neck , and believes she is aware of her surroundings , saying he can look in her eyes and tell . she will smile at him and pat him on the face -- something she did before the shooting , he said .  every time i interact with her , there 's something quite inspiring ,  he said .  we 've seen her moving her lips ,  acknowledged dr. michael lemole , chief of neurosurgery at the hospital . but , he said , it 's hard to say whether giffords is actually trying to speak . he said giffords has been able to scroll through an ipad and interact with her husband , so she does appear to be aware of her surroundings . but , lemole cautioned , she has a long road ahead of her that will take months , at least . kelly has discussed the shooting incident with giffords , rhee said .  she can probably put some of that information together on her own .  kelly said he believes his wife would be proud of how the tucson community has reacted to the shootings .  she 's going to need to continue to be strong ,  he said .  she will really appreciate the support of this community .  he said giffords ' family looked at several different rehabilitation facilities and liked memorial hermann for several reasons . the medical team there specializes in penetrating head injuries like the one giffords has suffered , and its closeness to tucson is also helpful . giffords has undergone other  minor procedures  this week , lemole said , calling it  housekeeping . it 's really getting her to a position where she can graduate from this hospital .  investigators have charged jared lee loughner in the attack . a federal grand jury indicted loughner on wednesday on three charges of attempted murder . the indictment charges loughner , 22 , with attempting to kill giffords and two of her aides , ron barber and pamela simon . legal experts said that more federal charges against loughner are likely .  this is really a placeholder indictment ,  cnn senior legal analyst jeffrey toobin said wednesday .  the grand jury investigation will continue ; there 's a long way to go in this case and these charges will be there but i 'm certain there will be more as well .  loughner is next set to appear in court on monday in phoenix .  i do n't think we 're ever going to fully understand the whys and the how and , you know , the reason for what happened on the 8th of january ,  kelly told reporters .  it 's a loss of innocent life . the injury of a dozen people , the death of a 9-year-old girl , a federal judge and the serious traumatic injury to my wife gabrielle -- we 'll never fully understand that .  cnn 's paul vercammen , susan candiotti and roni selig contributed to this report .", "summary": " wounded congresswoman does physical therapy on hospital grounds .   mark kelly predicts his wife will make a full recovery .    every time i interact with her , there 's something quite inspiring    giffords will be moved to a texas rehabilitation facility on friday .
