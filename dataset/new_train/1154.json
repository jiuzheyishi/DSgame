{"text": "parents should be careful what they tell their children because lying to them can directly influence how honest they are , according to a study . in fact , the more the children are lied to , the greater the chance of them also cheating and lying . the results of the study suggest children are more inclined to lie if they discover adults have not been telling the truth - but the researchers are n't entirely sure why this is . parents should n't lie to their children -lrb- illustration shown -rrb- as this will encourage them to , in turn , lie more themselves , according to researchers . the study was carried out by the university of california in san diego although an exact reason for the result is n't known . the study at the university of california tested 186 children aged three to seven in a temptation-resistance game . many adults will admit to telling white lies to children to make their lives a little easier . but research has found children can spot this tactic , and can even tell when their parents or teachers are deliberately withholding information from them . once spotted , a study from the massachusetts institute of technology found children will then try to fill in the gaps in the information themselves . determining who to trust is an important skill to learn at an early age because so much of our knowledge about the world comes from other people , explained hyowon gweon , lead author of the paper which is published in the journal cognition . ` when someone provides us information , we not only learn about what is being taught , we also learn something about that person . if the information is accurate and complete , then you might also trust that person in the future , ' she said . approximately half of the children were lied to by a researcher , who said there was a huge bowl of sweets in the next room , but quickly confessed this was just a ruse to get the child to come and play a game . the others were simply invited to play , with no mention of sweets . the game asked children to identify character toys they could n't see , by their sounds . sounds and toys were relatively easy to pair , although one sound was deliberately tricky : beethoven 's fur elise . when the classical music was played , the researcher was called out of the room to supposedly take a phone call , leaving the children alone in the room for 90 seconds and tempting them to take a peek at the mysterious toy making that sound . the children were explicitly asked not to peek . on returning , the researcher also explicitly asked the children to tell the truth . the five - , six - and seven-year-olds who had been lied to were both more likely to cheat , and then more likely to lie about having done so . leslie carver , associate professor of . psychology and human development in the university of california 's san . diego division of social sciences said : ` as far as we know , this is the . first experiment confirming what we might have suspected - lying by an . adult affects a child 's honesty . ' about 60 per cent of the school-aged children who had not been lied to in the study peeked at the tricky temptation toy , and about 60 per cent of the peekers lied about it later . among those that had been lied to , those figures rose to nearly 80 per cent peeking and nearly 90 per cent of the peekers lying . in the study , children were asked to identify well-known character toys -lrb- stock image pictured -rrb- they could n't see , using their associated sounds . one of the toys was intentionally difficult to identify and the researchers found the children were more likely to cheat , and then say they had n't cheated , if they 'd been lied to earlier . however the study , published in the journal developmental science , does n't know why . ` it could be the five - to seven-year-old children were simply imitating the behaviour modeled by the adult , or it could be they were making judgments about the importance of honesty to this adult , ' said professor carver . ` or , it could be more nuanced . perhaps the children did not feel the need to uphold their commitment to tell the truth to someone who they perceived as a liar . ' but it did n't seem to make any difference to the pre-schoolers - they peeked and lied at about the same rates . this may be because three - and four-year-olds do n't have very sophisticated abilities yet , said the research team . professor carver added : ` even if it 's expedient for an adult to lie , to get cooperation through deception , for example , or to get children to control their emotions , it 's probably a bad idea in the long run . ` the actions of parents suggest that they do not believe that the lies they tell their children will impact the child 's own honesty . ` the current study casts doubt on that belief . even a little white lie might have consequences . '", "summary": " children who are lied to are more likely to lie themselves , research claims .   study was carried out at the university of california in san diego .   186 children aged from three to seven who identified toys from sounds .   when an adult lied to them and then left the room , the children were more likely to cheat in the game and lie about it after .   but the researchers are n't quite sure why lying breeds more lying .
