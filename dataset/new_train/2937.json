{"text": "as  duck dynasty  star phil robertson returns from his brief  hiatus ,  he 'll do so to the cheers of some surprising supporters â $  southern blacks . robertson was suspended from the a&e hit show for calling homosexuality a sin and equating it to bestiality in a gq profile . receiving less attention were his comments that black people were happier before the civil rights movement . media have focused on two camps in the controversy . on one side are robertson 's predictable supporters , who include white evangelicals , southern republican politicians and fox news . on the opposing team are lbgt activists and progressives . but while robertson 's comments have roiled members of msnbc 's black media elite such as al sharpton , melissa perry and joy reid , robertson has found pockets of support among church-going , middle-class african americans . though i grew up in shreveport , louisiana , a city a little over an hour 's drive from the robertson 's empire in west monroe , i 've spent my adult life in washington . so when a high school facebook friend posted a 10-paragraph open letter of support to a&e for robertson , which was signed  everyone who is n't a left wing extremist -lrb- aka your former customer base -rrb- ,  i was a bit surprised . in my view , robertson 's comments regarding both homosexuals and african americans suggest he lacks empathy and the ability to think critically . to be preoccupied with the  sin  of 3 percent to 6 percent of the population seems as off-base as the idea that a people could be happy with second-class citizenship . my facebook friend never confirmed penning the letter he posted , which received nearly 50  likes  from other college-educated black professionals and blue-collar types . the comments ranged from analogies ,  where would we be if rosa parks had went to the back of the bus . she had rights , he has rights ,  to concern ,  have you noticed that anything and everything can be said about christians now . our beliefs are now wrong and we are outdated .  when two commenters pointed out robertson 's misguided remarks about black people  singing  while working the fields , they were quickly rebuffed with ,  from what i heard him say what he saw . are you saying that there are n't blacks who were n't like he said .  because support for robertson seemed to be fueled by religious beliefs , i sought some insight from bishop larry l. brandon , pastor of praise temple full gospel baptist church in shreveport . the bishop explained that though he was  deeply concerned  with how robertson expressed his spiritual views on homosexuality , he added ,  i ca n't twist scripture to suit a lifestyle ... i speak the truth in love .  indeed , brandon 's position is held most strongly by the black church . a 2013 pew research center poll found that while the percentage of white evangelicals , mainliners and catholics who believe homosexual behavior is a sin has dropped 4 , 5 , and 14 percentage points , respectively , since a similar poll was conducted in 2003 , the percentage of black protestants who regard homosexual behavior as a sin has actually increased 5 points to 79 % . many disagree with robertson 's portrayal of jim crow-era african americans . brandon said :  while i believe robertson has freedom of speech , i respectfully disagree with his remarks regarding black people . in my humble opinion , while our community has a history of overcoming adversity , making lemons out of lemonade regardless of the difficulty of the situation , one should not mistake our ability to endure with our actually enjoying abuse .  lz granderson :  duck dynasty  star 's rights were n't violated . not all of robertson 's black support is due to religious convictions . black hunters share a pastime with the robertson clan . while home for christmas , an uncle who loves  duck dynasty  shared his perspective with me on camera . uncle michael smith is 53 and has been a hunter all of his adult life . he owns a home , attends church and votes in every election . he honed his hunting skills watching tv outdoorsmen like roland martin and jimmy houston . for him ,  duck dynasty  is an extension of the hunting show genre he loves . uncle michael explained robertson 's comments this way :  the way -lrb- robertson -rrb- talks , it 's old talk ... the new generation is a whole lot different . everything is out in the open ... the comment -lrb- robertson -rrb- made -lrb- about homosexuality -rrb- probably was taught to him at a young age , but i do believe he just made a mistake . he apologized , so i 'm gon na continue to watch the show if it keeps coming on .  s.e. cupp : do n't reject  duck dynasty  family . while my uncle was unfazed by robertson 's comments about black people , some family members were put off . as a child in the late '70s , i had occasion to scale perch , pick bushels of purple-hull peas and use an outhouse . i 've heard kin describe what it 's like to pick cotton -lrb- hot and painful -rrb- , and they never sounded happy about it , but another story told in my family might explain the  happy  put-on . annually , my grandmother recounts my uncle james ' christmas day birth , explaining that because the hospital was understaffed and did n't execute his birth certificate until the next day , his birth date is listed as december 26 . as in past years , someone asked my grandmother why she did n't point out the mistake . her eyes grew wide , and she shook her head violently .  no ! you do n't understand ,  she tells us .  i was at charity hospital ! those white doctors did n't talk to us , and we did n't question them .  while my grandmother was in labor , her mother and aunt would wait in a closet-size room reserved for negroes . once a black child was born , a nurse would enter the room with her back to its occupants and write on a chalkboard the mother 's name , the baby 's sex and weight , and whether the baby was dead or alive . with a frown , my grandmother added ,  the only thing they ever said to me was , ` guurl , what you gon ' name this baby ? '  that my grandmother would not point out such a mistake is unfathomable to her grandchildren and great-grandchildren . we only know of her strength . to us she is the lifelong domestic who birthed nine healthy babies , buried two grown sons and slept in the bed her husband had died in hours earlier . but in her eyes , when she tells this story , i can see her vulnerability , her fear that  they 'd send me home and not let me come back .  shannan hicks , a researcher and storyteller who focuses on the northern louisiana post-jim crow era , is not surprised that black workers shielded their true feelings from robertson .  this was the age of black lynchings . a black person would never have reveled their true self to a white person who looked and talked like robertson ,  hicks said before referencing the paul laurence dunbar poem that opens with this stanza : . we wear the mask that grins and lies , . it hides our cheeks and shades our eyes , â $  this debt we pay to human guile ; . with torn and bleeding hearts we smile , . and mouth with myriad subtleties . since my visit home , i 've thought a lot about brandon 's last comments regarding what he believed to be robertson 's greatest offense â $  saying that homosexuals  wo n't inherit the kingdom of god .  the bishop emphasized :  only the lord has the right to condemn one to hell or lift them to heaven . god is our judge .  clearly , the big guy has his work cut out for him . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of yolanda young .", "summary": "  duck dynasty  star phil robertson returns in new episodes after controversial comments .   yolanda young disagrees with him but says there are pockets of support for show among african americans .   she says some believe homosexuality is a sin ; hunters feel an affinity for show .   young : some of my relatives understand , but object to , robertson 's comments on race .
