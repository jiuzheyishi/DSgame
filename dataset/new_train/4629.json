{"text": "last week , president obama 's campaign launched a fictional storybook ad called ,  the life of julia .  the slide show narrative follows julia , a cartoon character , from age 3 to age 67 and explains how obama 's policies , from head start to obamacare to mandated contraception coverage to medicare reform , would provide julia with a better life than mitt romney or paul ryan could . julia is not your typical all-american girl , but an obviously independent , yuppie liberal woman . she goes to public school , graduates college , and becomes a web designer . she is able to pursue her career because , at age 27 ,  her health insurance is required to cover birth control and preventive care , letting julia focus on her work rather than worry about her health .  at age 31 she  decides to have a child ,  with no mention of a father or husband . her son zachary heads off to a race to the top funded public school , while julia goes on to start her own web business . she retires at age 67 with social security and medicare supporting her financially and spends her later years volunteering in a community garden . julia 's happily-ever-after tale is remarkably void of reality . nowhere in her fictional life is it mentioned that head start has done little , if anything , to improve elementary education , that she will likely graduate with $ 25,000 in student loan debt , that she has a 50 % chance of being unemployed or underemployed after college , that medicare and social security are headed toward insolvency , and that her share of the national debt is $ 50,000 and growing . for republicans , julia 's story might seem like a joke too good to be true , but they should take it very seriously . because buried within  the life of julia  is the ideological vision of modern liberalism -- to create a state that takes care of its people from cradle to grave . the story of julia is a microcosm of obama 's vision for america and emblematic of his view of the government 's role in an individual 's life .  the life of julia  has done what many conservatives have failed to do so far -- outline in exacting detail what modern democratic policy wants for individuals . here we have obama 's 21st century synthesis of the great society , new deal and new frontier . julia 's entire life is defined by her interactions with the state . government is everywhere and each step of her life is tied to a government program . notably absent in her story is any relationship with a husband , family , church or community , except a  community  garden where she works post-retirement . instead , the state has taken their place and is her primary relationship . as banal and hackneyed as julia 's life of government dependence may seem , many americans support it . after all , similar promises lured a number of european countries into overreaching and under-supported social safety nets . with the american family less intact than ever and with single motherhood at historic highs , women like julia are increasingly left on their own . the idea of government assistance can become more and more attractive to them and even necessary . democratic policymakers realize that in the absence of self-sustaining family units , government can step in and fill the void . and a government large enough to fill that void can eventually take the place of the family altogether . cultural commentator heather mac donald recently wrote ,  the single mother has become the cornerstone of democratic politics .  julia is the perfect example . in response , conservatives must defend their own cornerstones -- individual liberty , virtue and earned success . conservatives must make the case that earned success is preferable to government dependency , and that julia is more likely to achieve success and fulfillment in a good , stable family . as families grow stronger , schools , churches and communities improve , and julia 's chances for success improve , both for herself and her son . but as government grows larger and more intrusive , julia 's personal liberty and opportunities may shrink . whatever pleasure republicans may get from jokes or parodies of julia , the fact is that many women will choose her life , some out of necessity or believing it 's necessary .  the life of julia  should make it obvious that this election is about more than offering julia a better job and more benefits . conservatives must be able to provide julia an alternative vision for a better future . without it , julia might have nowhere else to turn but to the government , and that is nothing to laugh about . follow us on twitter @cnnopinion . join us on facebook/cnnopinion .", "summary": " president obama 's campaign launches a fictional storybook
