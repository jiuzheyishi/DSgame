{"text": "the prime minister led tributes to the ` fleet street legend ' lord rees-mogg who died over the weekend at the age of 84 . as editor of the times for 14 years , he was credited with forging its reputation for investigative journalism and cutting-edge commentary . among his most influential articles were a piece in 1963 headlined ` a captain 's innings ' calling for prime minister alec douglas-home to resign , which he did shortly afterwards , and the editorial ` who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel ? ' , soon after becoming editor in 1967 , criticising a jail term handed to mick jagger for drugs offences . ` fleet street legend ' : former editor for the times llord rees-mogg died over the weekend aged 84 . he left the paper in 1981 and later served as chairman of the arts council , vice-chairman of the bbc and most recently a columnist for the mail on sunday newspaper for nearly a decade . he was made a life peer in 1988 . educated at charterhouse public school and balliol college , oxford , he started out as a leader writer on the financial times in the early 1950s . after twice running unsuccessfully as an mp he worked as a speechwriter for anthony eden , before moving to the sunday times where he worked his way up to deputy editor before being offered the top job at the times . tribute : david cameron said lord rees-mogg edited the times ` through a tumultuous period with flair and integrity ' his tenure was sometimes controversial , particularly his support for us president richard nixon during the watergate scandal . he resigned from the paper after initially backing his staff who opposed rupert murdoch 's bid to buy the newspaper , then changing his mind . during the late 1970s and early 1980s , he was a cheerleader for the monetarist policies of margaret thatcher - his friend since university . but he was a vocal critic of john major , trying unsuccessfully to challenge his maastricht laws on legal grounds , and then described him in the times as ` over-promoted , unfit to govern and lacking self-confidence . ' david cameron yesterday paid tribute to him saying : ` william rees-mogg is rightly a fleet street legend - editing the times through a tumultuous period with flair and integrity . ` i always found him full of wisdom and good advice - particularly when i first became leader of the opposition . my thoughts are with his wife and five children at this sad time . ' his son jacob , tory mp for north-east somerset , said his father had discovered only in the past few couple of weeks that he was suffering from inoperable oesophageal cancer and that he died ` very peacefully ' . his wife gillian and their two sons and three daughters and grand-children had been at his bedside during his final days . he said his father 's ` reputation as a wordsmith who could produce long and elegant articles was unsurpassed ' , but added that he always made time for his family . ` i had the greatest father anyone could ever want , who always encouraged his children in the different things that they did ' , he said . lord rees-mogg -lrb- right -rrb- is pictured with rupert murdoch -lrb- centre -rrb- and sunday times editor harold evans following the announcement that . mr murdoch was to buy the times . lord rees-mogg 's son , jacob , said his father had ` this fascinating position in british public life for the last 60 years ' ` he had the most extraordinary knowledge of almost every subject you could ever ask him about , and had this fascinating position in british public life for the last 60 years . ` he interviewed the leader of the opposition only six weeks ago . we are all enormously proud of him and all that he did ; and yet he found time to be the most active and loving father .
