{"text": "the warning was made by amsterdam-based engineer , nell watson at a recent conference . future generations could be exterminated by terminator-style robots unless machines are taught the value of human life . this is the stark warning made by amsterdam-based engineer nell watson , who believes droids could kill humans out of both malice and kindness . teaching machines to be kind is not enough , she says , as robots could decide that the greatest compassion to humans as a race is to get rid of everyone to end suffering . ` the most important work of our lifetime is to ensure that machines are capable of understanding human value , ' she said at the recent ` conference by media evolution ' in sweden . ` it is those values that will ensure machines do n't end up killing us out of kindness . ' ms watson claims computer chips could soon have the same level of brain power as a bumblebee -- allowing them to analyse social situations and their environment . ` machines are going to be aware of the environments around them and , to a small extent , they 're going to be aware of themselves , ' said ms watson , who is also the chief executive of body scanning firm poikos . ` we 're starting to understand the secrets of the human brain , ' she points out , while at the same time we 're getting better at programming computers with deep learning . ` it 's going to create a huge change in our society all around the world ' . for instance , google is already working on . self-driving cars that can automatically sense traffic and adjust their . speed and direction . mr musk has previously claimed that a horrific ` terminator-like ' scenario could be created from research into artificial intelligence . he is so worried , he is investing in ai companies , not to make money , but to keep an eye on the technology in case it gets out of hand . a still of the terminator is pictured . google has set up an ethics board to oversee its work in artificial intelligence . the search giant has recently bought several robotics companies , along with deep mind , a british firm creating software that tries to help computers think like humans . one of its founders warned artificial intelligence is ` number 1 risk for this century , ' and believes it could play a part in human extinction . ` eventually , i think human extinction will probably occur , and technology will likely play a part in this , ' deepmind 's shane legg said in a recent interview . among all forms of technology that could wipe out the human species , he singled out artificial intelligence , or ai , as the ` number 1 risk for this century . ' the ethics board , revealed by web site the information , is to ensure the projects are not abused . neuroscientist demis hassabis , 37 , founded deepmind two years ago with the aim of trying to help computers think like humans . meanwhile , japan is leading the way in creating home-help robots for the elderly and injured . while ms watson warning seems grim , she believes a robot uprising is n't necessarily a negative event . ` machines can help us understand ourselves and gather self-knowledge , ' she said . ' i ca n't help but look at these trends and imagine how then we shall live ? when we start to see super-intelligent artificial intelligence are they going to be friendly or unfriendly ? ' the warning echoes similar comments earlier this month by tesla-founder , elon musk who said artificial intelligence could someday be more harmful than nuclear weapons . musk referred to the book ` superintelligence : paths , dangers , strategies ' , a work by nick bostrom that asks major questions about how humanity will cope with super-intelligent computers . mr bostrom has also argued that the world is fake and we are living in a computer simulation . in a later comment , musk wrote : ` hope we 're not just the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence . unfortunately , that is increasingly probable . ' the 42-year-old is so worried , he is now investing in ai companies , not to make money , but to keep an eye on the technology in case it gets out of hand . in march , musk made an investment san francisco-based ai group vicarious , along with mark zuckerberg and actor ashton kutcher . vicarious is currently attempting to build a program that mimics the brain 's neocortex . the neocortex is the top layer of the cerebral hemispheres in the brain of mammals . it is around 3mm thick and has six layers , each involved with various functions . these include sensory perception , spatial reasoning , conscious thought , and language in humans . according to the company 's website : ` vicarious is developing machine learning software based on the computational principles of the human brain . the warning echoes similar comments tweeted earlier this month by spacex founder , elon musk who said artificial intelligence could someday be more harmful than nuclear weapons . high flier : elon musk -lrb- pictured -rrb- is setting his sights on satellites and wants to use them to get remote parts of the world online . the billionaire entrepreneur is now exploring ways to create small and cheap satellites in a project that would pit him against google and facebook . ` our first technology is a visual perception system that interprets the contents of photographs and videos in a manner similar to humans . ` powering this technology is a new computational paradigm we call the recursive cortical network . ' in october 2013 , the company announced it had developed an algorithm that ` reliably ' solves modern captchas - the world 's most widely used test of a machine 's ability to act human . captchas are used when filling in forms , for example , to make sure it 's not being completed by a bot . this prevents people programming computers to buy a bulk load of gig tickets , for example . professor stephen hawking has also warned that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself and adapt to its environment . earlier this year , the renowned physicist discussed jonny depp 's film transcendence , which delves into a world where computers can surpass the abilities of humans . professor hawking said dismissing the film as science fiction could be the ` worst mistake in history ' . stephen hawking has warned that artificial intelligence has the potential to be the downfall of mankind . ` success in creating ai would be the biggest event in human history , ' he said writing in the independent . ` unfortunately , it might also be the last '", "summary": " the warning was made by amsterdam-based engineer , nell watson .   speaking at a conference in sweden , she said robots could decide that the greatest compassion to humans as a race is to get rid of everyone .   ms watson said computer chips could soon have the same level of brain power as a bumblebee -- allowing them to analyse social situations .   ` machines are going to be aware of the environments around them and , to a small extent , they 're going to be aware of themselves , ' she said .   her comments follow tweets by tesla-founder , elon musk , earlier this month who said ai could be more dangerous than nuclear weapons .
