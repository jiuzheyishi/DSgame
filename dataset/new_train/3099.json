{"text": "labour 's pensions spokesman was branded ` out of touch ' today after admitting she did not know how much the state pension was worth . rachel reeves blundered during a live radio interview , when she insisted that ` of course ' the payment was worth ` just under # 100-a-week ' . when the shadow work and pensions secretary was told the true sum is actually # 113.10 , she tried to insist it depended how long people had been working for . wrong-footed : shadow work and pensions secretary rachel reeves was put on the spot during an interview on lbc with presenter nick ferrari . it is an occupational hazard for politicians to be put on the spot about the cost of everyday items -- pints of milk , loaves of bread and the weekly shop have caught out david cameron and ed miliband in the past . but voters could expect miss reeves to know how much pensioners will receive each week from the state , as she draws up labour 's reforms to how people save for retirement . appearing on lbc radio , live from the labour conference in manchester , miss reeves was asked how much the state pension is currently worth . host nick ferrari said : ` how much is a pension at the moment for an elderly person ? what do they pull in a week now ? ' miss reeves ' blunder at the party conference in manchester today is a setback for one of labour 's strongest media performers . miss reeves replied : ` it 's just under # 100 a week , the basic state pension , of course . mr ferrari asked ` is it ? ' and she again insisted ` yes ' . but pressed again , miss reeves modified her answer to ` around # 100 a week , of course ' , before mr ferrari put her right and stated it is worth # 113 . ` so you do n't actually know what the pension is ? ' the broadcaster declared . forced on to the back foot , miss reeves added : ` it depends how many years you 're contributed . ' however , the gaffe was ridiculed by the government , accusing labour of not being on top of the detail of pensions policy . lib dem pensions minister steve webb told mailonline : ` sometimes when labour criticised us on pensions , you wonder if they fully grasp how things work . ` for a shadow pensions minister not to know the value of the state pension suggests it is actually the opposition who are out of touch with our pensioners . ' embarrassingly , miss reeves ' error came less than 24 hours after she accused the government of overseeing an ` utter shambles ' . in her speech to the labour conference , she claimed conservative work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith is a man ` with his own special midas touch - everything he touches turns to a complete and utter shambles ' . ms reeves said the flagship reform universal credit was ` stuck in first gear ' , while work capability assessments were ` in meltdown ' and the youth contract was an 'em barrassing flop ' . she said : ` it would be comical if it was n't so criminal . we should be angry that taxpayers ' money is being squandered . ` that vulnerable people are being ill-treated . that lives are being scarred . that talent is being wasted . ` we should be angry - and they should be ashamed . ` the tories will leave a truly toxic legacy . and for all their talk about cutting welfare , they 've overspent on social security by # 13 billion in this parliament with a rising in-work benefits bill left for the next government . ' rachel reeves used her conference speech to accuse the government of an ` utter shambles ' during an interview on lbc radio , breakfast show host nick ferrari asked what seemed like an easy question for rachel reeves , the shadow work and pensions secretary . but her answer suggested she is not on top of the detail of her brief , as this transcript shows : . ferrari : how much is a pension at the moment for an elderly person ? what do they pull in a week now ? reeves : it 's just under # 100 a week , the basic state pension , of course . ferrari : is it ? reeves : yes . ferrari : the basic state pension is just under # 100 ? reeves : it 's around # 100 a week . of course ... ferrari : i thought it was # 113 . reeves : it 's around # 100 . if you ... ferrari : so you do n't actually know what the pension is ? reeves : it depends how many years you 're contributed . ferrari : right . ferrari : i 'm told the pension figure is # 113.10 , do you recognise that figure ? reeves : it does depend , nick , on how many years ... ferrari : well you 've just said it 's under # 100 . it ca n't be under # 100 . reeves : well it depends on how many years you 've contributed .", "summary": " senior frontbencher put on the spot about her brief during lbc interview .   she claimed that the state pension is worth less than # 100-a-week .   but the true value is # 113.10 , raising doubts about her grip on the detail .   pensions minister steve webb says labour ` out of touch ' with pensioners .
