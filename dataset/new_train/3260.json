{"text": "george osborne yesterday attacked some charities for being anti-business as he urged firms to put their heads ` above the parapet ' and stick up for the free market . the chancellor said that for the first time since the fall of the berlin wall , the principles of enterprise and business as a force for widespread prosperity were ` up for grabs ' . speaking to business leaders at the institute of directors ' annual convention , he called on firms to counter an anti-free market movement led by trade unions and some charities . george osborne attacked some charities for being anti-business as he urged firms to put their heads ` above the parapet ' and stick up for the free market . ` you have to get out there and put the business argument , ' he said . ` because there are plenty of pressure groups , plenty of trade unions and plenty of charities and the like , that will put the counter view . ` it is , i know , a difficult decision sometimes to put your head above the parapet , but that is the only way we are going to win this argument for an enterprising , business , low-tax economy that delivers prosperity for the people and generations to come . ` there is a big argument in our country about our future , about whether we are a country that is for business , for enterprise , for the free market . ` for the first time since my adult life , that is up for grabs . that issue felt it had been resolved when the berlin wall fell . tuc general secretary frances o'grady said osborne was agreeing with margaret thatcher 's ` enemy within ' rhetoric . ` politicians like tony blair form the left felt like they had understood that free markets create the taxes to fund public services and the like . ` that argument has gone and you saw it with the very stark contrast between the two political conferences in the last two weeks , so i would urge the business community not to sit on the sidelines of the political debate that is going to happen over the next seven months . ` it does n't mean you have to endorse a party , a party like the conservatives , but it does mean you have to get out there and put the business argument ... that is the only way we are going to win this argument for an enterprise , business low-tax economy which deliver prosperity for generations to come . ' the general secretary of the tuc , frances o'grady , said : ` the chancellor accuses unions of being anti-business , yet many of britain 's most successful companies and sectors -- such as carmakers -- depend on the labour and skills of trade unionists just as much as their managers . ` he has let down his guard to show how much he agrees with margaret thatcher 's ` enemy within ' rhetoric . ` but the real issue today is that the chancellor is doing nothing to fairly share the benefits of recovery . ` he has rewarded soaraway executive pay with tax cuts for the super-rich , but been happy to see the longest and deepest cut in living standards for everyone else , only this week announcing cuts in the benefits that low-paid workers desperately need when the real value of their pay is falling .
