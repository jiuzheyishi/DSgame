' devon and cornwall police have not been able to unmask alves or establish exactly what was planned with the funds , # 500,000 of which are still missing . but detective constable martin skinner of the force 's financial investigation unit said the complex scam showed how innocent singletons like ralph can fall prey to cyber conmen . ralph smith signed up for the site after splitting with his wife and soon became besotted with lilian alves . he said : ` alves had basically expressed her undying love for him to gain his trust . ` she then concocted a story suggesting that she wanted to come over and visit mr smith but she had to pay some employees who were working in europe who would only trust a uk bank account . ` mr smith was subsequently charged with criminal offences due to not reporting the incident to police immediately . ` you leave the dock an innocent man , no doubt a wiser man ' judge christopher harvey clark qc . det con skinner said the gang set up their profile specifically to seduce mr smith . he added : ` they basically did the work of the dating agency . they set up a profile for the exact sort of woman who would match mr smith 's requirements . ` alves appeared affluent , well presented , she had photos taken abroad in the u.s. and canada . she even had supposed links to biscovey . ` it was very convincing but in reality all a load of rubbish . ` this can happen to anyone . it 's a message we need to get across to the public - do n't trust anyone when there are finances involved ; always double-check ; never give your bank details out . ' mr smith , who can no longer work because of his disability , has since got back together with his wife . he has never been in trouble with the police before and says he had no idea the woman he fell in love with was a fraudster . mr smith said : ' i had absolutely no idea , never even gave it a thought that it was a crime . i was unaware of crime going on like that . ` my warning is to other people to please go careful online , who they talk to and who they trust because it happened to me and it happened so easily . ' i would just like it not to happen to somebody else , to have to go through what i 've been through .
