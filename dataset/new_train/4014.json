{"text": "coronado , california -lrb- cnn -rrb- rick perry used his final public address as texas governor on friday to sharply criticize president barack obama 's stewardship of the country and called on fellow republicans to articulate a plan to voters explaining how the gop will turn the country around .  what is needed at this time in history is a clear vision for the world with america leading again , and freedom on the march again ,  perry said friday afternoon in a speech to the republican national committee .  what is on the ballot in 2016 is a choice whether we are going to ... rise to the challenge of defending western values or accept the decline of western civilization , because those who had the most to lose did the least to preserve freedom .  perry , who delivered his remarks from behind a podium , reading from prepared notes , was at times halting in his speech . but he delivered heaps of political red meat to the state party leaders and activists sitting in the audience . not once did perry , who is considering a possible white house run , mention any of his possible opponents for the republican nomination during his speech , and he refrained from doing so when he spoke afterward to reporters .  i 'm not going to go back and rehash the 2012 campaign ,  perry said when asked what was mitt romney 's biggest mistake as presidential nominee .  i am not sure that is particularly of great utility . we need to be talking about the future and laying out a good bright vision for this country and how to get people back working again , how to get washington to focus on the few things it needs to do and do rather well . get our foreign policy back to where our allies know we are going to be standing with them and our enemies fear us . that is what we need to focus on .  perry sidestepped a direct question about what type of candidate romney would be if he decided to seek the gop nomination again .  whenever someone becomes a certified official candidate i 'd be more comfortable making a statement about him ,  perry said .  i think whether it is jeb -lsb- bush -rsb- , or it is mitt or whoever it might be , adding quality people to the field raises the level .  in his speech , perry did not necessarily present policy solutions , but rather critiques of obama on everything from the president 's handling of the economy and energy policy to foreign affairs . the texas governor specifically chastised obama for failing to travel to france for a unity march that drew leaders from around the world , who came come together to condemn the slaying of 12 people by terrorists at charlie hebdo magazine .  when leaders of the world gather to stand against terrorism , the president of the united states needs to be there and he needs to be standing in the front of that march ,  perry said . perry did highlight the texas economy and held it up as an example of how jobs should be created and copied throughout the nation .  our formula for success is simple : keep taxes low , implement smart regulations ,  he said .  you have an educated workforce and stop lawsuit abuse at the courthouse . that is the formula . it is simple .  before heading into a private reception to meet people attending the rnc 's winter meeting , perry , who is leaving office in a few days , was asked what his next job would be .  i will call you when i get that all figured out ,  he said .", "summary": " outgoing texas gov. rick perry speaks to the republican national committee .   he delivers plenty of red meat to his audience , but gives no clues about his 2016 plans .
