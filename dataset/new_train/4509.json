{"text": "if republicans do n't wield their congressional majority next year to pass immigration reform legislation , a gop takeover of the white house in 2016 will be  difficult , if not impossible ,  sen. lindsey graham of south carolina said during a cnn interview released on sunday . graham , a republican who has long-favored comprehensive immigration reform , said he believes the gop has hurt itself with hispanic voters due to its resistance to reforming the current system . and without a major change , democrats will get another four years in the oval office , graham told cnn 's dana bash on  state of the union .   if we do n't at least make a down payment on solving the problem and rationally dealing with the 11 million -lsb- illegal immigrants believed to be in the u.s. -rsb- , if we become the party of self-deportation in 2015 and 2016 , then the chance of winning the white house i think is almost non-existent ,  he said . but graham , who is mulling a 2016 presidential run , slammed president barack obama 's executive action last month to safeguard as many as 5 million undocumented immigrants . he accused the president of  acting in a rogue fashion  for  political reasons .  republicans , though , need to  do more than just fight the executive order ,  he added . graham supports giving a pathway to citizenship to the so-called dreamers -- undocumented immigrants who crossed into the u.s. illegally as children and have lived in the u.s. since . and in 2014 , graham showed the political viability of his position by successfully beating back a tough primary challenge in his conservative state by reaffirming -- rather than running away from -- his stance on immigration .  if the republican party can not muster the political courage to deal with the dream act children in a fair and balanced way after we secure our border , that says a a lot about the republican party 's future regarding the hispanic community ,  graham said .  i do n't believe most americans would fault the republican party if we allowed children who have been here since they 're babies to assimilate into society with a pathway to citizenship after we secure our borders .  graham was one of the most ardent supporters of a bipartisan immigration bill he helped negotiate in 2013 that passed the senate but did not get a vote in the house . the bill would have bolstered border security and created a path to citizenship for millions -- many of whom are now getting temporary relief under obama 's executive action . and while graham 's name did n't make the cut in the latest cnn/orc poll , another candidate who supports immigration reform is leading a crowded field of potential republican presidential candidates . former florida gov. jeb bush snagged 23 % of republican support in the survey released sunday . while graham said bush would be  an excellent candidate  who could win the presidency in 2016 , he insisted the race for the republican nomination is still  wide open .  related : jeb bush says he has ` no problem ' defending expanding immigration .  it 's like preseason polling in football . you really do n't know , do the pads connect ? but i think it 's good news for jeb bush at least initially ,  graham said . graham has n't yet decided on a 2016 run , which he will consider more seriously next year , but he did tout his  unique  qualifications to be president in a period of tumultuous global affairs .  i think over the last several years i 've been more right than wrong when it comes to foreign policy , that the next president of the united states has got a world on fire ,  graham said .  i think i have a unique capability to do things like that .  graham suspects china involved in sony attack .", "summary": " sen. lindsey graham says republicans need to tackle immigration reform in order to win the white house in 2016 .   he has not yet decided if he will make a bid for the gop nomination .
