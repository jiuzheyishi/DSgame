{"text": "over the past two decades , bishop eddie long has built his public ministry at new birth missionary baptist church near atlanta , georgia , upon a testosterone-laden theology and a hypermasculine image . his books bear titles such as  taking over ,   called to conquer  and  gladiator .  typical names for his sermons are  conquer and subdue  and  reign or maintain .  the ministry motto ,  taking authority ,  is signified by a golden sword and shield that adorns the bishop 's ring finger . this is why i was saddened to watch eddie long duck and dodge allegations that he seduced multiple teenage boys into sexual relationships . one would think that someone who constantly preaches about male headship , rulership , and power would deny these allegations with the same bravado that he defends his right to drive a $ 300,000 automobile . yet on sunday we never heard the term  innocent ,  or a refutation of the charges . in fact , we witnessed a cowardly , rhetorical two-step that may mark the tragic end to this bishop 's reign . milquetoast quotes like  i am not the man being portrayed on television ,  and  i 'm going to fight this ,  are at best nondenials . anyone familiar with these sorts of civil cases knows that such word selection is common among those trying to deflect a potential perjury charge down the line . either long engaged in inappropriate sexual acts with these young men or he did n't . to hide behind legal counsel , biblical metaphors and spiritualized acknowledgments of one 's imperfection insults the intelligence of those who respect him and his ministry . the question on the hearts and minds of parishioners is not whether he is a  perfect man .  nor does this story have anything to do with david and goliath , as long so irresponsibly alluded . the faithful just want to know whether long used his authority -lrb- and their money -rrb- to maintain a teenage male harem under the pretense of mentoring . is this too much to ask ? as a professor of social ethics who trains aspiring clergy , you pray religious leaders adhere to two important points . first , although we all fall short of our professed moral ideals , one should never spiritualize indiscretions . and no religious leader is fit to be called a leader unless he or she is willing to acknowledge when he or she is wrong . second , we must draw a line between our position and the institution that we are called to serve . the latter should always be considered more precious and important than the former . eddie long had four days leading up to sunday morning to address these charges . but aside from a brief yet legally broad statement through lawyers saying that  the charges against me and new birth are false ,  he did not counter the boys ' allegations . he did choose , however , to invite the media and the world into the house of prayer on the christian sabbath . by doing so , he appears to be the kind of pastor who puts his own protection and self-preservation before the community of faith . and rather than courageously defending himself , he looked like a coward using new birth 's congregation as human shields . if the bishop wants to take authority , he needs to begin by taking some responsibility . maybe for the good of new birth , eddie long should take that sword out of his golden ring and fall on it . the opinions in this commentary are solely those of jonathan l. walton .", "summary": " jonathan walton : bishop long never directly refuted allegations of seducing teen boys .   walton says those trying to deflect a perjury charge use the cowardly rhetoric long used .   long hid behind biblical metaphors , he writes , used congregation as shield .   walton believes if the bishop wants authority , he needs to take responsibility .
