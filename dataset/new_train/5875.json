{"text": "we give banks our hard-earned cash to look after , and what do we get in return ? leaflets we ca n't understand , emollient twaddle about ` relationships ' with people we do n't know -lrb- or want as new fake friends -rrb- , charges we were n't expecting , and , if we 're really doing well , a free fake leather cover for our cheque book . as far as i am concerned , bank managers still -lrb- erroneously -rrb- think they are doing us a favour , when it ought to be the other way round . recently , i decided to change banks , after my manager 's assistant -lrb- who i had never met -rrb- told me they were allowing me to keep a joint account ` as a favour ' . bank managers still think they are doing us a favour , when it ought to be the other way round ... this account had only a few hundred quid in it , and was being used to pay household bills . my other accounts were always in credit . model customer , you might think , except this snooty bank -lrb- coutts -rrb- acted like i was a penniless nuisance . they charged me # 150 a quarter on the joint account , ludicrous when there were so few transactions . i decided to move to hsbc , but then my stress levels really started to soar . it 's taken five weeks , four different people writing me strings of emails , dozens of incomprehensible forms , and i 've ended up with two managers at two different branches ! according to janet , snooty banks treated her like a penniless pest and charged her extortionate fees . they decided my company credit card could have only a # 1,000 limit -lrb- even though i was bringing a large business savings account -rrb- as if i was an ignorant student , and not someone who has made a living as a broadcaster and writer for over 40 years . then , they had the cheek to announce the limit would be increased ` as a gesture of goodwill ' in the light of problems moving my accounts . this makes me even crosser . i do n't need a favour , just what i am entitled to -- respect ! stuff a relationship , what about service ? i went to two meetings of an hour and a half each , and now another manager wants to meet ` to cement our relationship ' . no chance . banks should be there to serve us , not provide staff with chances to have a coffee and see the inside of our house or office . banks need to start treating their clients a lot better to prevent the souring relationship between banker and customer . i am not very welcome as a customer because i do n't need a mortgage , a loan and advice on investments . i am one of those irritating crumblies who manages to remain afloat all by myself -- something banks are n't keen on when they can charge big fees if we exceed our overdraft . which ? magazine reports that only one in ten of us read the small print when switching banks , because the information they provide is so confusing . hsbc -- and i can vouch for this -- hits the jackpot with a 29,000-word document that takes around an hour and a half to read ! i am not interested in internet banking , all i want is statements and cash out of a machine . i have n't even got the details of the ` free ' travel insurance they promised four weeks ago . then they sent a form asking me to rate my ` experience ' . i put a great big cross right through it -- are they paying me to do their research ? it 's not surprising that only 40 per cent of ` extremely dissatisfied ' customers -lrb- less than 4 per cent of all of us -rrb- can face the trauma of switching banks . next year , things should improve following a report by the independent commission on banking . under the new rules , by september 2013 , changing banks should take fewer than seven days . if we suffer any inconvenience , we should be able to claim compensation . good luck ! you 'll still get a free credit-card wallet easier than a new business loan . meanwhile , douglas flint , the chairman of hsbc , says he 'd like bankers to sign up to an oath , like doctors , and be monitored by an independent body enforcing a code of conduct . one of the proposed rules would require bankers ` to act honestly and fairly at all times when dealing with clients ' . i 'd go further , how about remembering that old adage ` the customer is always right ' ? mr flint is said to be looking for new non-executive directors for his board -- i 'm available and waiting for his call . larry taught me how to steal the show . dallas baddie : larry as jr ewing . cheerio , larry hagman , you 'll be missed . larry was one of the most entertaining actors i ever encountered , far more eccentric than his on-screen persona as the ultimate baddie in dallas . when we met at a dinner party in london in the early eighties , he was smoking a large joint , and announced he spent every sunday at his home in malibu in silence , in order to preserve his sanity . larry was fabulously indiscreet about his dallas co-stars and revealed that when contract re-negotiations were in full swing , everyone tried to get in front of the cameras -lrb- even when they were not needed -rrb- as much as possible to build up their ratings . it got so bad that he and bobby ewing -lrb- played by patrick duffy -rrb- were patting each other on the back , shaking hands and sidling up to each other so frequently , they were told off ! he taught me loads of valuable tricks about how to upstage rivals on a show , many of which i still employ today . what a fabulous man . so far , i 'm dead disappointed . detective sarah lund takes aim . the new series of the killing is proving to be a struggle . detective sarah lund -lrb- right -rrb- remains as compelling as ever , but this drama seems to be using too many of the same stock shots of the city at night we already saw in danish political thriller borgen . who cares about dreary party leaders rushing up and down dim corridors in government offices , vying to form a coalition government ? the leading lady looks as if she has n't slept for weeks , and seems to have aged ten years since series 2 . the action takes place in the dark , and the budget cuts the police are coping with seem to mean every office is lit with a single bulb . so far , i 'll award the killing just six out of ten . what makes celebrities happy ? jamie lee curtis on the red carpet . to raise money for a new museum of british illustration in london , artists were tasked with turning the lists of what makes celebrities happy into pictures to be auctioned at sotheby 's next month . quentin blake drew david walliams swimming while his wife lara stone stands on the riverbank with a stopwatch , surrounded by spaghetti , pyjamas and their dog chewing on a shoe . jamie lee curtis -lrb- right -rrb- picked clogs , cereal with milk , and a black t-shirt -lrb- by trendy jil sander , not just any old garment -rrb- . jeremy paxman chose evelyn waugh 's decline and fall and bollito misto -lrb- an italian dish of boiled meats -rrb- , which sounds rather pretentious . other celebs included ruby wax , brian eno and florence welch . i was n't honoured , but i doubt whether an illustration of my list would have fetched much . black pudding for breakfast , a walk in the rain , cotton m&s knickers , and pink turnips from my veg plot . i 'm too cheap and cheerful .", "summary": " janet street-porter bemoans customer service in banks who are now charging ludicrous service charges and restricting our choices .
