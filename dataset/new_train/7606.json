{"text": "historian : labour education spokesman tristram hunt faced charges of hypocrisy after taking lessons himself while campaigning against unqualified teachers . a labour education spokesman who has condemned government plans to allow more unqualified teachers into the classroom has boasted of taking lessons himself . former tv historian tristram hunt revealed he ` teaches in schools ' including delivering a lesson on the spanish armada to primary-age pupils . but he faced charges of hypocrisy because the labour party policy is for only qualified teachers to be allowed into the classroom . mr hunt , a respected academic who has presented history programmes for the bbc , used a newspaper interview to reveal he regularly takes charge of classes . ` i teach in schools in stoke when they allow me , to make sure i know what 's going on , ' he told the guardian . ` i do a class at the fe college about cape town as a city of empire . and i do an industrial revolution class at the sixth form . ` and i taught a class on the spanish armada to a primary school . ' but the comments from the mp for stoke-on-trent central appear to be at odds with the official labour party line . just yesterday his boss , shadow education secretary stephen twigg , condemned michael gove 's plans to allow more unqualified teachers into schools as the ` wrong approach ' . under michael gove 's policy , increasing numbers of schools are able to employ unqualified teachers . when we know the key to standards is the quality of teaching , this is the wrong approach . mr twigg added : ` it will be one where we insist on high standards for our children , with qualified teachers in every classroom . ' a source close to mr gove said : ` hunt 's hypocritical attitude is --  do n't do as i do but do as i say  . ` yesterday , hunt was saying that great teachers should be fired from state schools if they do n't have a particular teaching license that unions like . ` today , it turns out that hunt himself teaches in state schools without that license . ` instead of media posing , hunt should encourage more great teachers from private schools into state schools without the bureaucracy that he wants to swerve himself . it 's typical hypocrisy on schools from rich labour mps . ' reforms : education secretary michael gove has said he wants more unqualified teachers in academies , giving them the same freedoms as free schools and the independent sector -lrb- file picture -rrb- . last year mr gove announced academies would be able to employ no formal teaching qualifications , in line with freedoms enjoyed by free schools and the independent sector . the department for education said the flexibility would more schools to hire ` great linguists , computer scientists , engineers and other specialists who have not worked in state schools before ' . today mr hunt , who has a doctorate from cambridge , insisted he was not acting as a teacher , but simply taking lessons . he told mailonline : ` when i 'm invited i go and give talks in schools and i am delighted to do so . ` i do n't teach a course or anything like that . i do n't mark , i just give them some history . ` it is actually part of the broader issue that schools and schoolchildren should be exposed to as many outside speakers and ideas as possible . ` our party 's policy is that fully operational teachers should be qualified , so if you are running a class or course or marking ... ` i definitely think you need qualifications and training about different ways to teach about different school kids . ' questions were also raised about david miliband - brother of labour leader ed - who taught politics to local students before quitting as an mp for a job in america . tory mp craig whittaker , a member of the education select committee , said : ` we believe heads and governors are best placed to decide who are the best teachers , not bureaucrats . ` it 's a mistake to confuse being properly qualified and state controlled licenses , and it would be wrong to stop brilliant teachers who want to be able to switch from private to state schools from doing so . ` i 'm sure tristram hunt and david miliband are great teachers - but so are many others who , just like them , teach without a state controlled licence .
