{"text": "think you use your phone to look at facebook a lot ? unless you 're doing it at least 14 times a day , you 're actually below average . that 's just one of the surprising revelations in a research report by idc released wednesday . the study tapped 7,446 iphone and android users in the u.s. between 18 and 44 -- representative of the 50 % of the population that uses smartphones -- and asked them questions about their phone usage across one week in march . depending on your perspective , many of the results are either depressing or confirm what you knew all along . for example , it seems that 79 % of smartphone users reach for their devices within 15 minutes of waking up . a clear majority -- 62 % -- do n't even wait 15 minutes , and grab their phones immediately . -lrb- among 18 - to 24-year-olds , the numbers rise to 89 % and 74 % . -rrb- . given that the survey was sponsored by facebook , most of the questions focus on the social network . which is , it seems , only the third most popular app on your smartphone , after email and the browser . still , 70 % of smartphone users are frequent facebook visitors , with more than half of them checking it every day . peak facebook time is during the evening , just before bed . but any time 's good : on average , we visit the facebook app or the site 13.8 times during the day , for two minutes and 22 seconds each time . our average total daily mobile time on the site -- and remember , this is just via our smartphones -- is half an hour . that 's roughly a fifth of all the time we spend communicating ; it 's only slightly less time than we spend texting . on weekends , we check facebook more than we text . any place seems to be good to check facebook , too . some 46 % of us check it when we 're shopping or running errands ; 48 % use it at the gym . even preparing a meal gives 47 % of us no respite from the social network . -lrb- well , what else are you going to do while you 're waiting for the microwave to ping ? -rrb- . perhaps the most unpardonable sin : 50 % of smartphone users admit to checking facebook while at a movie . we hope they mean only during the ads . so what are we spending all that time doing ? well , for about half of that daily half-hour on the social network , we 're simply browsing our news feed . the rest of the time is divided fairly evenly between facebook messaging and posting updates . half of facebook users play games via the service on their phone a few times a day . does the smartphone survey ring true to you ? share your thoughts in the comments .
