{"text": "leh , india it 's always tricky being a tourist alongside foreigners in your homeland . that may be especially true in india , a country so vastly different in every respect from the united states . but when the call came from my husband 's niece and nephew , larkin and nelson , to accompany them and their father , raymond broussard , on a trip to the himalayan region of ladakh , i could n't say no . part of it was purely selfish . i 'd never been to ladakh , a region off india 's northern jammu and kashmir state that borders tibet . it 's fairly accessible these days by plane -- at least in the summer -- but during my childhood in india , ladakh was not a destination . back then , most indians visited picturesque srinagar , the summer capital of jammu and kashmir . that was long before a violent insurgency , aimed at wresting part of kashmir from indian control , ravaged the area . i 'd heard from friends who 'd been to ladakh in recent years about how glorious a place it was , surrounded by towering , snow-capped peaks and buddhist monasteries . i 'd yearned to go for a very long time , so the invitation was instantly appealing . but there was a deeper reason . raymond is a pediatric dentist in albuquerque , new mexico . he told me that when he was young , his father , also a dentist , had taken him on a goodwill mission to haiti . it was a trip that became indelibly etched in his mind . what american kid would n't learn from helping others so much less fortunate ? raymond told me he wanted his own children to experience something similar . he 'd been thinking about it for a long time and then suddenly , just like that , larkin was entering her senior year in high school . this was raymond 's last window of opportunity . he signed on with a group called global dental relief , a colorado-based charitable organization that provides dental care for poor kids in india , nepal , vietnam , cambodia , kenya and guatemala . he was going as one of six volunteer dentists . but the group needed nondental volunteers as well . larkin and nelson were going -- it was their first trip to india -- and they inspired me to sign up as a nondental assistant . if they could do it , why not me ? i was n't so sure about how much help i 'd be . i could n't tell you what  scaler  or  explorer  tools looked like , but it would n't hurt , i thought , to learn new skills . i rescheduled my previously planned trip to india . i almost always visit home in the winter when the humidity and sizzling temperatures subside in delhi and in my hometown , kolkata . but there is no easy way to reach leh , the ladakhi capital , in the winter . the city is snowbound . so on a late august evening , i boarded a flight in atlanta bound for delhi . after a day getting over jet lag and visiting family , i joined the global dental relief group and was immediately relieved to know that few of the nondental volunteers had any experience with cavities or extractions . but we all had two things in common : we wanted to do something good , and we wanted to see one of the most breathtaking places in the world . less than an hour after the indigo jet left smoggy delhi behind , passengers strained to see out the windows . the view was nothing short of magnificent . the rising sun kissed the tall , stark peaks of the himalayas . some of them looked like they were on fire , the orange hues so startlingly bright . after we settled into the snow view guest house , we ventured out into town -- even though it had been strongly suggested that we take it easy in our rooms . leh is about 12,000 feet above sea level and many a visitor has fallen prey to altitude sickness . we filled up on tibetan momos -lrb- dumplings filled with lamb , chicken or vegetables -rrb- and got up early the next morning to begin setting up the dental clinic . david sonam , the owner of the guesthouse , helps set up the clinic every year . he 's a businessman and a former dean at a school who wants to do something for the kids in ladakh , many of whom hail from impoverished homes and lack the services they need .  dental care ,  sonam told me ,  is not so good here .  the kids do n't get check-ups . many do n't even have toothbrushes or paste at home . the only care , sonam said , is for emergencies -- bad infections and painful teeth extractions . downstairs from our makeshift clinic is a permanent center that sonam set up for kids with special needs . there 's a room painted with stars where children with autism can relax . there 's also a physiotherapy center for children who 've had corrective surgery so they can walk again . a wheelchair can be a curse in a place like leh . it 's hilly and hardly anywhere is handicapped accessible . sonam said the biggest problem here is lack of water and hygiene . most children grow up with a mouthful of rotting teeth , which can lead to other problems later in life . and that 's what we begin to see the next day when the long lines begin to form at our humble dental clinic . one day , we encountered about 250 students from siddhartha school who traveled for hours from mountain villages .  they are kids who only go to see a dentist when they are in a lot of pain ,  said their teacher tanzin dolma , 38 . that includes tesering chonzom , 14 . she 's already had to have two fillings ; now she 's in for a third . she cowered from raymond 's anesthesia needle . her friend stanzin anmol tried to calm her down . i wiped the tears flowing down her cheeks . but within an hour , she was out the door , her cavity filled . over six days , the global dental relief volunteers saw 715 patients -- fillings , extractions , cleanings , sealants . in all , the group estimated the value of the service at about $ 170,000 . but we felt like a million . the clinic , i think , was especially meaningful for the indians among the volunteers -- there were three indian dentists and one other indian dental assistant . i 'd covered international aid organizations in my homeland -- in conflict and the aftermath of natural disaster -- but i 'd never been a participant in anything like this . my crash course in dentistry probably wo n't take me very far though the next time i am sitting in a chair -lrb- take note , dr. elise ashpole -rrb- , i will know what you mean when you say :  18 occlusal .  i will also know when you pick up the dread extraction tool . eventually , the names of the children i met will fade in my mind . what i will remember are the expressions of awe and astonishment on the faces of larkin and nelson , who , as teenagers , discovered a slice of a strange new land . they , like their father , raymond , who never forgot his trip to haiti , will hopefully look back on india in 2013 as a necessary stepping stone in the path of life . what i will also remember are certain moments -- angmo rigzin 's hand clutching mine so tightly that i thought the bones in my fingers might break . she was 11 , suffered from anxiety and deathly afraid of raymond 's needle . when her ordeal was over and she finally was able to smile again , i handed her a toothbrush to take home . she ran out , down the stairs and out into the afternoon light . two minutes later , she returned with an older student who spoke a smattering of english .  thank you ,  the older girl told me .  she would not have been able to bear this without you .  i watched angmo return to her schoolmates playing on a swing set in the shadows of a 17th century tibetan-style palace . every visitor to leh makes the trek up to that palace . from up there , tourists gasp at the scenery before them , the majesty of the himalayas ahead and all of the city below . but most tourists will never see what i did in leh . i saw a part of my homeland through a new lens . for that , i am grateful . follow moni basu on twitter .", "summary": " family members asked cnn 's moni basu to accompany them on a trip to her native india .   she
