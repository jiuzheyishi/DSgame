{"text": "the militant islamist group boko haram has issued an ultimatum giving christians living in northern nigeria three days to leave the area amid a rising tide of violence there . a boko haram spokesman , abul qaqa , also said late sunday that boko haram fighters are ready to confront soldiers sent to the area under a state of emergency declared in parts of four states by nigerian president goodluck jonathan on saturday .  we will confront them squarely to protect our brothers ,  abul qaqa said during a telephone call with local media . he also called on muslims living in southern nigeria to  come back to the north because we have evidence they will be attacked .  recent weeks have seen an escalation in clashes between boko haram and security forces in the north-eastern states of borno and yobe , as well as attacks on churches and assassinations . nearly 30 people were killed on christmas day at a catholic church near the federal capital , abuja -- a sign that boko haram is prepared to strike beyond its heartland . human rights activist shehu sani told cnn that the latest boko haram threat is credible , but many christians born and raised in the north have nowhere else to go .  the killings will continue ,  he said , and boko haram may respond to the state of emergency by taking its campaign of violence to areas not yet affected . sani said the state of emergency and an enhanced presence of the security forces would not improve the situation , alleging that troops had already been involved in human rights abuses and had done little to reduce violence . nigeria has almost equal numbers of christian and muslims , with the south predominantly christian . boko haram and other islamic groups claim the north has been starved of resources and marginalized by the government of jonathan , who is a christian . boko haram -lrb- which according to the group means  western civilization is forbidden  -rrb- is demanding the imposition of islamic sharia law across nigeria . christian leaders have demanded a stronger response to the attacks from the government and the muslim community . ayo oritsejafor , head of the christian association of nigeria , complained last week that the response of islamic leaders had been  unacceptable and an abdication of their responsibilities .   the christian community is fast losing confidence in government 's ability to protect our rights ,  oritsejafor said . david cook of rice university , who has studied the rise of boko haram , said that  if radical muslim violence on a systematic level were to take hold in nigeria ... it could eventually drive the country into a civil war .  corruption , poverty and a lack of government services have helped boko haram gain support , especially among young muslims out of work . so has a perception that the muslim north has been marginalized by a political establishment drawn largely from the christian south . cook says the group has been responsible for at least 45 major attacks , which have included assassinations -- frequently using gunmen on motorbikes -- and , more recently , suicide bombings beyond its northern heartland . beyond the security forces and christian targets , it has assassinated muslim clerics who oppose the group , and even killed a prominent boko haram member who had attended talks to explore a truce . boko haram 's presence in the city of maiduguri has made it almost ungovernable , according to analysts . its ability to inflict mass casualties has grown fast . in august , a suicide bomber struck the u.n. building in abuja , killing 23 people . in november , some 150 people were killed in a series of bombings and shootings in damaturu , capital of yobe state . the commander of u.s. africa command , gen. carter ham , has suggested boko haram may have developed links with other islamic jihadist groups in the region , especially al qaeda in the islamic maghreb . sani agrees , and says boko haram 's leaders have established sanctuaries across the desert borders in niger and chad , out of reach of the nigerian security forces . the former u.s. ambassador in nigeria , john campbell , says that boko haram is able to finance itself  through bank robberies and is arming itself by thefts from government armories and purchases -- there is no shortage of weapons on the market .  less than two months ago , president jonathan described attacks by boko haram as a temporary setback , which would soon be a thing of the past . now he appears to see the group as a lethal threat that demands the full attention of the security services . but since yusuf 's death , boko haram has had no obvious leader or structure , and appears to act as loosely connected cells . and it is feeding on deep-seated grievances that the government seems unable to address . cook warns that  as more and more territories become ungovernable , such as maiduguri , then muslims more and more will want to join boko haram , if only because it represents the one group that can actually project power and hold out the illusion of security to the people .
