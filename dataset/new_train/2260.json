{"text": " to this day  had a very small beginning . the poem itself was written in 2009 after rereading a series of notebooks i had written in as a child . i 'm fortunate enough to have a grandmother who never throws anything away , and one day , she returned a series of journals i had kept . i did n't pay any attention to them at first . i wondered what possible value could come from revisiting what i had already managed to survive . one day , out of boredom , i picked up a journal and began reading it . i was amazed to discover that in midst of all the darkness surrounding my childhood , there was a still a young boy with a sense of humor . after quickly consuming all of the other texts , i realized that i had been completely neglecting a large chapter of my life simply because i wanted to be done with the pain that i had associated with it . watch shane koyczan 's ted talk . i wrote a series of pieces , all exploring my early life , and was not surprised to find that so many people were relating to the material . there was a tremendous sense of agony as i prepared to perform the poems for the first time . i remember wondering why i was willfully about to put myself through these experiences again . it has been such a rewarding journey to rediscover a part of myself that i thought i had long discarded . my band , shane koyczan and the short story long , ended up rerecording  to this day  for our 2011 album remembrance year . the poem quickly became a requested piece from our catalog at live performances , and each time there seemed to be a special silence from the audience . fans have often remarked that we were telling their story back to them with that piece . i get a lot of mail regarding poems that i 've written , but the letters i get in response to this piece are easily the most heartrending . there are people in the world whose endurance staggers me . there are stories that test our hearts . they stretch us out into empathy , and all we can do is feel for these strangers who in an instant feel like family . in 2012 , i lent my voice to a project developed by giant ant studio for the dalai lama center and their educate the heart campaign . the team at giant ant were great work partners , and they offered to lend me their services for a project down the road . it did n't take long to pick a project :  to this day  was a piece i was wanting to do something special with for a long time . giant ant put together an animated video call out to other animators and the response we got was overwhelming . the team did an incredible job of threading the animations together to create the finished video . language fails me in my gratitude for everyone who helped bring this project to life . from  to this day  : . ... if you ca n't see anything beautiful about yourself . get a better mirror . look a little closer . stare a little longer . because there 's something inside you . that made you keep trying . despite everyone who told you to quit . you built a cast around your broken heart . and signed it yourself . you signed it .  they were wrong  because maybe you did n't belong to a group or a click . maybe they decided to pick you last for basketball or everything . maybe you used to bring bruises and broken teeth . to show and tell but never told . because how can you hold your ground . if everyone around you wants to bury you beneath it . you have to believe that they were wrong . they have to be wrong . why else would we still be here ? we grew up learning to cheer on the underdog . because we see ourselves in them . we stem from a root planted in the belief . that we are not what we were called . we are not abandoned cars stalled out and sitting empty on a highway . and if in some way we are . do n't worry . we only got out to walk and get gas . we are graduating members from the class of . f -- off we made it . not the faded echoes of voices crying out . names will never hurt me . of course . they did . but our lives will only ever always . continue to be . a balancing act . that has less to do with pain . and more to do with beauty ... the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of shane koyczan .", "summary": " spoken word poet shane koyczan rediscovered his childhood journal .   in the darkness of his childhood , he retained a sense of humor .   his poem has been viewed more than 8 million times on youtube .   koyczan :  if you ca n't see anything beautiful about yourself , get a better mirror  "}
