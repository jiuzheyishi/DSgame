{"text": "los angeles -lrb- cnn -rrb- hours after california attorney general kamala harris began raising money for a bid to replace barbara boxer in the u.s. senate , billionaire environmentalist tom steyer outlined the case for his own run tuesday and said he would decide soon -- setting up the likelihood of an exorbitantly expensive contest that could have two democrats facing off in november of 2016 . california 's two senate seats have been locked down by boxer and u.s. sen. dianne feinstein since 1992 , closing off statewide opportunities for the next generation of politicians . under california 's new top-two primary system , the top two candidates in the first round will advance to the general election , regardless of their party . in a column on the huffington post website , steyer said he was intrigued by the opportunity of taking on interests in washington that  oppose recognizing global warming and fight against the rights and futures of average americans .   washington needs to be shaken up and we need climate champions who will fight for the next generation ,  steyer said .  california democrats are blessed to have a deep bench of talent , and i will decide soon based on what i think is the best way to continue the hard work we have already started together to prevent climate disaster and preserve american prosperity .  steyer and harris would be among the most formidable contenders for boxer 's seat , along with former los angeles mayor antonio villaraigosa , who has said he is  seriously considering  a run . several members of the california congressional delegation and of the state leadership have signaled interest , including rep. loretta sanchez , rep. john garamendi , and state treasurer john chiang . in a facebook post on tuesday , sanchez touted her focus on working families , immigration reform and affordable healthcare :  i have advocated for policies that give all families the same access to the american dream ,  she said .  californians deserve a strong voice in washington and i have never been afraid to speak up , which is why i am seriously considering running for the united states senate in 2016 .  but lesser-known candidates could face great difficulty raising the money needed to run . boxer raised some $ 35 million in conjunction with party committees for her 2010 race against former hewlett-packard chief executive carly fiorina . steyer , a former hedge fund manager from san francisco whose net worth has been estimated at $ 1.6 billion by forbes , has pledged to give away the bulk of his fortune to public interest and philanthropic causes during his lifetime . he has been a vocal opponent of the keystone xl pipeline and a free-spending advocate for california environmental causes . his nextgen climate action committee spent more than $ 74 million in the midterm elections -- much of it steyer 's money -- trying to defeat candidates who had expressed doubt about climate change , but they had little demonstrable success in a republican wave year . as a candidate , steyer 's investments throughout his business career are also likely to come under uncomfortable scrutiny . last year , for example , the new york times examined lucrative investments by steyer 's former fund , farallon capital management in companies across the globe that own coal-fired power plants . harris , the former district attorney of san francisco who was just re-elected to her second term as attorney general , was the first to formally declare her candidacy since boxer announced last week that she would not run for re-election in 2016 . while villaraigosa could build a strong southern california base , and draw on his support from california 's growing latino community , harris also has a solid fundraising base in california from her two statewide runs and her close alliance with president barack obama . she has won praise as attorney general for pursuing banks that did not follow proper procedures when they foreclosed on the properties of california homeowners and she has kept a steady focus on reducing recidivism and truancy .  from my first days as a prosecutor in alameda county , to my work as san francisco district attorney to my current service as california attorney general , i have worked to bring smart , innovative and effective approaches to fighting crime , fighting for consumers and fighting for equal rights for all ,  harris said in a statement on her new campaign web page tuesday .  i will be a fighter for the next generation on the critical issues facing our country . i will be a fighter for middle class families who are feeling the pinch of stagnant wages and diminishing opportunity ,  she continued .  i will be a fighter for our children who deserve a world-class education , and for students burdened by predatory lenders and skyrocketing tuition . and i will fight relentlessly to protect our coast , our immigrant communities and our seniors .  gavin newsom passes on bid for boxer 's seat . harris ' position was strengthened on monday when lt. gov. gavin newsom bowed out of contention . speculation had swirled around the possibility of a heated race between harris , 50 , and newsom , 47 , who could have potentially split the northern california vote , clearing the way for a southern california candidate like villaraigosa . newsom has told many confidantes that he is interested in running for governor when jerry brown faces term limits in 2018 , and he and harris share the same political consultants . in a statement on his facebook page , newsom said it was better  to be candid than be coy  and noted that it would be better for his three children , montana , hunter and brooklynn , if he stayed in california .  while i am humbled by the widespread encouragement of so many and hold in the highest esteem those who serve us in federal office , i know that my head and my heart , my young family 's future and our unfinished work all remain firmly in the state of california -- not washington , d.c. therefore i will not seek election to the u.s. senate in 2016 ,  newsom said . hinting at his potential alliance with harris , he added that in the months to come , he looked  forward to doing whatever i can to help elect california 's next great democratic senator -- one worthy of succeeding barbara boxer and serving this remarkable state of dreamers and doers in the united states senate .  shortly after boxer announced that she would retire from the senate in 2016 , los angeles mayor eric garcetti said he would not run for the seat .", "summary": " billionaire tom steyer exploring run for barbara boxer 's seat .   california attorney general kamala harris raising money for senate bid .   lieutenant governor
