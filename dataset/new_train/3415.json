{"text": "you 've done the surprise theatre trip , followed by a slap-up dinner . you 've skated round the festive christmas rink more times than you care to remember . now , it 's time for the big one . yes , we 're in that tricky what-to-get-the-person-who-has-everything territory , and it wo n't come cheap . but your star will blaze brighter than the one atop the tree in trafalgar square if you sign up for a 20-minute helicopter flight above london . this latest tourist attraction makes the viewing gallery at the shard look tame . seeing the sights at a new height : the tour showcases london landmarks such as st paul 's cathedral . the thames as you 've never seen it before : tower bridge can be seen in all its victorian glory . take-off is from battersea heliport , near wandsworth bridge . within seconds , you 're 1,500 ft above the thames heading east . there were seven of us on board -lrb- including the articulate pilot , who pointed out various landmarks -rrb- and we were all given headphones with microphones in case we wanted to ask questions or proffer an opinion . in fact , we were all rendered speechless - except for one man who could n't help blurting : ` look , that 's my house and there 's the school where i drop off my kids every morning . ' what a show ! dome from home : the former millennium dome -lrb- now the o2 concert venue -rrb- , as seen from high above . i was struck by how orderly it all looks - the neat and tidy squares , the pristine parks , the seemingly free-flowing traffic . buckingham palace ? massive , and i 'd never quite appreciated how huge is its garden . the palace of westminster ? sublime when reflected in the river on a cloudless day . wheels within wheels : a dramatic from-above snapshot of the london eye in its slot on the south bank . and if you want to get a sense of the development going on at the battersea power station , then there 's no better way than this . we went to canary wharf , then followed the river to the national maritime museum at greenwich before heading back . watch out for that huge landmark : the height of the shard is even clearer from a helicopter window . say hello to the queen : the size of buckingham palace - and its gardens - is clearly visible from a helicopter . not bad for a back garden in central london : the grounds behind buckingham palace , as seen from above . hyde and seek : an aerial glimpse of the royal albert hall , with hyde park spreading out in the background . there are three choices : buzz -lrb- # 150 -rrb- gives you 12 minutes in the air ; sights -lrb- # 200 -rrb- pays for 20 minutes and max -lrb- # 1,500 -rrb- gets you exclusive use of the chopper so you can invite along five friends . towers of power : a helicopter-pilot 's - eye view of canary wharf , in london 's docklands district . out of time : st paul 's cathedral stands out as an oasis of history amid the modern buildings of the city . a superb snapshot : the twists and turns of the river thames are clearly visible above battersea . ` how was it ? ' asked the man who had checked us in . i told him it was ` emotional ' , that it had made me proud . and in some strange way , for 20 minutes , it made me feel i owned the greatest city in the world . bookings : 020 7887 2626 , www.thelondonhelicopter.com .", "summary": " helicopter tours are a new , spectacular way to see the sights of london .   flights take off from battersea heliport , on the south bank of the thames .   sights such as buckingham palace and st paul 's are part of the journey .
