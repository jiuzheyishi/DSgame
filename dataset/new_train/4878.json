{"text": "for about a month , barbara gattuso felt at least 40 years younger . gattuso , 65 , had enrolled in a clinical trial for a drug aimed at women who have low sexual desire . there is no treatment available in the united states for boosting the female sex drive , but women like gattuso hoped that would change with this experimental medication , called flibanserin .  it was amazing , absolutely amazing , and it just makes you feel whole ,  gattuso said , recalling her feeling of taking this drug .  it makes you feel like a complete woman again .  outside such experimental settings , there are no medications available in the united states for female hypoactive sexual desire disorder . that 's the technical term for when women have a distressing lack or absence of sexual desire or fantasy . up to one-third of adult women may experience it , according to a 2002 study . flibanserin seemed like a potential answer for many . but the u.s. food and drug administration has rejected applications to green-light the drug . sprout pharmaceuticals , which is pursuing approval of the drug , has appealed the fda 's most recent decision , and was scheduled to have a meeting with fda officials on friday , said the company 's president and chief operating officer , cindy whitehead . given that the drug has been through numerous , rigorous clinical trials , and so much has been invested in it , the fda 's refusal to approve it is a turning point in the field of sexual medicine , says dr. irwin goldstein , director of sexual medicine at alvarado hospital in san diego , california , who collaborated on clinical trials for flibanserin . if there is no positive action on the drug , it could spell doom for pharmacological efforts to manage female sexual desire , he said .  it will go back to dark ages of saying , ` this is all a relationship problem , ' even though we know it 's not ,  he said . the fda declined to answer specific questions regarding the matter . fda spokeswoman andrea fischer said in a statement :  the fda is only able to provide information on approved drug product applications . any information on an application that has yet to receive an approval or was denied approval belongs to the manufacturer/sponsor developing the drug .  sprouting a drug . flibanserin was initially developed by pharmaceutical giant boehringer ingelheim , but the company ditched it in 2010 after the fda declined to approve their new drug application , asking for more research , goldstein said . a smaller operation , sprout pharmaceuticals , took over work on the drug in 2011 , and resubmitted an application with 14 new clinical studies , encompassing data on more than 3,000 new patients , according to the company . in total , more than 11,000 people have participated in clinical trials for flibanserin , whitehead said . still , the most recent attempt to get flibanserin off the ground failed ; the fda did not approve the company 's revised drug application in october . the fda characterized the drug as having a  modest  effect in its response letter , whitehead said . but clinical trial results show statistically significant improvement in the women who took the drug , compared to those who took a placebo , she said .  in terms of what we see , i would say ` modest ' is meaningful ,  whitehead said . sex is doctor 's life 's work . a 2013 study in the journal of sexual medicine showed that women taking the drug reported an average increase of 2.5 satisfying sexual events in four weeks , compared to an increase of 1.5 among women using a placebo . flibanserin is not a hormonal treatment and does not appear to affect fertility or interact with birth control medications , whitehead said . the drug works by increasing brain blood flow in particular ways , goldstein said . it increases levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine and noradrenaline , and lowers levels of serotonin . side effects of flibanserin include dizziness , nausea , fatigue and sleepiness . unlike some treatments for men , flibanserin needs to be taken once a day , every day . other options . there are other experimental treatments for low female sex drive in the works . drugs called lybrido and lybridos , developed by a company called emotional brain , have undergone several randomized studies with results that are  very promising and will be published soon ,  according to the company 's website . a drug called bremelanotide is being investigated by palatin technologies for both men and women . none of these drugs has completed phase 3 trials , which are necessary before approval . whitehead counts 24 fda-approved treatments available in the united states for male sexual dysfunction , including popular drugs such as viagra -lrb- sildenafil citrate -rrb- . for women , it 's zero .  a lot of times , the medical community has really put men 's needs first and has n't really addressed women 's sexual needs ,  said jennifer foust , a sex therapist in aventura , florida , who is not affiliated with flibanserin . because doctors have no solutions , women have tried less-proven treatments for their low sexual desire , such as diets and herbs . none of foust 's clients has had success with them . she said some women who are n't functioning well sexually would be  open to anything .   i 've had women complain , ` why is n't there a female viagra ? '  foust said . sex drive : it 's complicated . sex drive is more complicated for women than for men , foust said . there are a lot of factors that could explain a woman 's low desire -- and not all of them are medical , she said . lifestyle and relationship issues may come into play . having a first child can be a problematic factor for some women ; the adjustment and figuring out how to restructure their sex life can throw off desire . foust has spoken to some new mothers who feel they are constantly being asked for something from their body , as if they are  touched out ,  but find their lack of desire troubling . some couples maintain satisfying sex lives over many years -- but some , over time , go on autopilot and have less and less sex .  you have to continue to feed your sexual relationship , and feed your relationship in general ,  foust said .  a lot of it depends on how much importance and energy you put toward your sex life .  sometimes stress is the issue , too , she said . foust offers cognitive-behavioral , focused exercises to help women who are distressed about their low sexual desire . low sexual desire in women is n't necessarily a problem in menopause or later . foust works with many women complaining of low sex drive who are in their 30s and 40s . the average age of participants in the flibanserin trials was 36 , whitehead said . gattuso 's daughter is in her late 30s , and she and her friends are having similar problems , gattuso said . her physician friends want a solution for low female sexual desire , too , she said ; they want to be able to offer female patients something besides  i 'm sorry .  follow elizabeth landau on twitter at @lizlandau .", "summary": " there is no fda-approved treatment for low female sexual desire .   flibanserin is a drug that showed positive results in clinical trials .   the fda has declined to approve this drug .   the drug 's promoters have appealed that decision .
