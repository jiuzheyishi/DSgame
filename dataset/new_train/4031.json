{"text": "why is vladimir putin scared of 24-year-old nadya tolokonnikova ? what have his people done to her ? why wo n't they let her family contact her ? nadezhda -lrb- nadya -rrb- tolokonnikova , the russian artist and activist who leads the provocatively named punk rock band pussy riot , was thrown into a car by russian prison authorities three weeks ago , according to amnesty international . after an international campaign , including an amnesty international petition , the office of the russian ombudsman now says that authorities have confirmed suspicions that she is on her way to a prison camp in siberia , thousands of miles away from her husband and her small daughter , with an orwellian claim that the move aims to  promote her resocialization .  tolokonnikova and pussy riot became a thorn in putin 's side with their performance pieces , when they wore the colorful face-covering balaclavas that became their trademark , and launched into routines that were clearly meant to outrage . their work had a cutting political message . imprisoned pussy riot band member transferred to another prison . she and her band , you may remember , got into serious legal trouble early last year after they staged a flash-mob style performance of their  punk prayer  at moscow 's main russian orthodox cathedral , chanting  virgin mary , mother of god , put putin away .  it was a protest against the church 's support for putin 's increasingly controversial rule . the video quickly had millions of viewings . within days , the performers were arrested and charged with  hooliganism motivated by religious hatred .  tolokonnikova , along with her pussy riot colleague maria alyokhina , was sentenced to two years in prison . she is scheduled to be released in march , but experience has shown that in russia , the government can find ways to delay a prisoner 's release practically forever , if that is what it chooses . just ask mikhail khodorkovsky , the once-wealthy businessman who became a putin critic . while he was already imprisoned in siberia , the government brought new charges against him , piling more years to his incarceration . as with khodorkovsky , putin 's russia has turned tolokonnikova into a symbol of state repression and proof that the government can not tolerate dissent or criticism . every day she is out of sight , the russian government looks more frightened of its own people , more eager to suppress freedom of expression and more comfortable violating human rights . that is definitely not a good look for a country preparing to host the world in the winter olympics . clearly , the tactics of tolokonnikova 's pussy riot are not to everyone 's taste . some find them deeply offensive . but the state 's ferocious response to the actions of a group of young activists was hardly warranted by the scale of their transgressions . authorities started by holding them without bail and compiling an indictment that ran almost 3,000 pages . their lawyers were given two days to review the material , prompting the defendants to go on hunger strike to protest the unfairness of the proceedings . tolokonnikova is a political prisoner . and now , in the worst tradition of soviet russia , tolokonnikova , a musician , wife and mother , has been thrown into russia 's gulag system . the timing of tolokonnikova 's disappearance helps explain its motivation . the government is punishing her and her family and trying to intimidate her because , incredibly , even in prison she has not stopped pointing out the excesses of the regime . on september 23 , she went on a hunger strike to protest the brutal conditions experienced by her and her fellow prisoners at the infamous women 's prison camp in mordovia . before she started her hunger strike , she wrote a letter explaining the reasons for her protest .  when they send you off to mordovia ,  she wrote ,  it is as though you 're headed to the scaffold .  she described the sadistic punishments , the unceasing slave labor ; the horrors of daily life . she told the story of a woman who was beaten to death in the third unit ,  the third ,  she explained ,  is the pressure unit where they put prisoners that need to undergo daily beatings .  the women , she said , work 17 hours a day with four hours of sleep and a day off every month and a half . the administration views the prisoners as free labor for the mass manufacturing of police uniforms , she noted , asking pointedly ,  where does the money they get for them go ?  even from prison tolokonnikova was able to rattle the system . her critique of the prison system made waves , even as her health declined . after 10 days on hunger strike she was transferred to the prison hospital . when she stopped the strike , expecting to be moved to a more humane prison , she was returned to the same labor camp and she restarted her hunger strike . then she vanished . in russia 's dismal prison system , the family 's material and psychological support can make the difference between life and death . but while a prisoner is being transferred , the government has no responsibility to inform relatives of their whereabouts . prison authorities say tolokonnikova is in transit , on her way to a new facility . her husband , peter verzilov , says he had good reason to believe his wife is being sent to a prison colony deep inside siberia , probably the worst place on earth to spend the winter . b . there is reason to fear for her health , after her lengthy hunger strike , and to worry about how she is being treated by correctional authorities . the country 's human rights ombudsman , vladimir lukin , says he has been told by prison officials that she is in  satisfactory  health , in transit to a new prison . by its vindictive treatment of nadya tolokonnikova and its efforts to frighten her into submission , the russian government is turning someone who would have been a fairly obscure activist into a major international figure , and in the process it is shining a light on the very abuses to which she wants to draw attention . this may be ultimately good for the russian people , but it is exceedingly dangerous for tolokonnikova . russia is a place where government critics have faced mysterious and tragic endings . it is not a moment too soon for the putin government to show tolokonnikova , to show it is treating her humanely , and to make good on its word to release her as soon as her current sentence expires .", "summary": " frida ghitis : nadya tolokonnikova , jailed pussy riot activist , has vanished .   amnesty says she was taken from prison in car ; family does n't know where she is , she says .   ghitis : her band , and putin regime 's crackdown on it , shone light on russia 's repression .   ghitis : it 's feared she 's in siberia , her health at risk . russia making her an icon .
