' she continued : ` despite his deplorable and totally abhorrent behaviour , and his hateful character , emilia and piero loved each other and i believe one could not live without the other . piero often spoke of his home being wherever my aunt was . my aunt always viewed england as her home .

' mr justice sales ruled last year that english , not italian , law applied to the case because mr curati , despite his italian roots , ` regarded england as his home and considered himself to be british ' . ` i have reached the conclusion that the 1994 will did not wholly revoke the 1980 will , ' he concluded . ` the material part of the 1980 will , which leaves the english estate of the deceased to his niece and nephew , continues to be valid and must now be carried into effect . ' lords justice pill , munby and tomlinson have now reserved their judgment at the court of appeal on mrs curati 's case against that ruling and will give their decision at a later date .", "summary": " italian piero curati , of borehamwood , hertfordshire , died aged 81 in 2007 .   his sister carmen curati , 90 , has been at war with his niece and nephew .   the duo , sylvano and roberto perdoni , won a high court battle last year .   dispute centres over english will he signed in 1980 and italian will in 1994 .   if latter will replaced earlier will , mrs curati can inherit all his global assets .   but if 1980 will was valid , sylvano and roberto will inherit english wealth .
