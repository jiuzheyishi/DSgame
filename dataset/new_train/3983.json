{"text": "nigel farage has dismissed claims that ukip backs the repatriation of eu migrants who have lived and worked in britain for years . he insists the party would allow lawful migrants to stay -- even if the uk leaves the european union . his intervention follows a storm of protest after ukip candidate mark reckless , who is set to win the party 's second parliamentary seat in the rochester and strood by-election tomorrow night , was accused of advocating the repatriation of existing migrants . scroll down for video . ukip leader nigel farage -lrb- pictured -rrb- has dismissed claims that ukip backs the repatriation of eu migrants who have lived and worked in britain for years and insists the party would allow lawful migrants to stay . labour last night condemned his remarks as an echo of the policies of the british national party and claimed he had ` let the mask slip ' . mr reckless , who defected from the tories in september , told an audience of residents on tuesday that european migrants could remain in britain on work permits for a ` fixed period ' -- even if they own a home and have children at local schools . asked if they could be deported , he did not deny it -- but said cases would be looked at ` sympathetically ' if someone had lived in britain for years and was well integrated . however , he hastily backtracked today , insisting that he had meant a tougher immigration system advocated by ukip would only apply to new migrants , not those already in britain . and mr farage , whose wife is german , claimed mr reckless had made the comments in a ` minor confusion ' and confirmed that ukip 's policy was to allow all migrants who already live in britain lawfully to remain here . the ukip leader said : ` we have never suggested since 2004 that anybody who has come here legally and in good faith should be subject to retrospective legislation ... that would be unfair , un-british and wrong . ` let me make this clear , during our divorce negotiations , even if the european union was to behave badly , and was to say , people living in spain would be threatened with not being there , we would maintain the line that we believe in the rule of law , we believe in british justice , we believe anybody who has come to britain legally has the right to remain . ' ukip candidate mark reckless -lrb- pictured -rrb- was accused of advocating the repatriation of existing migrants - he backtracked today and said he meant a tougher immigration system would only apply to new migrants . he said mr reckless had been fighting a two-month election campaign . ` this is the first bit of confusion that has been caused , ' mr farage added . ` apart from confusion over that he has not put a foot wrong . ' yvette cooper , the shadow home secretary , condemned mr reckless 's comments as ` nasty ' and said ukip had ` let the mask slip ' . she said : ` to hear the language of repatriation coming from someone they hope will be their second mp is shameful . ` it 's a policy that comes straight out of the last bnp manifesto and does not reflect british values . ' shadow health secretary andy burnham added : ` this is an extreme agenda . nearly every british family has got a connection with europe and immigration ... my wife 's dutch . is she going back under mark reckless 's plan ? ' mr reckless denied he had been confused , saying he had meant that if britain leaves the eu ` anyone here lawfully under freedom of movement rules we would allow to stay ' . he said repatriation was ` not a word i 've used ' and said some of the conservative rhetoric about immigration during the campaign had been ` disgraceful ' . conservative ministers did not condemn his remarks . communities secretary eric pickles , who was campaigning in the area yesterday , said the idea of deporting migrants was ` wacky ' . however , he said mr reckless had previously supported free movement of migrants and this showed he was ` willing to say anything to get elected . ' mr pickles said he was ` certain ' the conservatives could win the by-election , although polls have suggested mr reckless has a 15 point lead . the tory candidate , 36 year-old businesswoman kelly tolhurst , used a hustings in the town to appeal to labour , liberal democrat and green voters to back the conservatives to keep ukip out . miss tolhurst said : ` it 's a two-horse race and the reality of it is if we do n't want to wake up to a ukip mp on friday 21st november then people who would normally be voting for labour , the lib dems or anyone else , then they need to be voting for me . ' two more conservative mps are said to have held secret discussions about defecting to ukip . mark reckless , who defected from the tories in september , said he had been contacted by two former colleagues during his campaign to win the rochester and strood seat today . winning the poll would make ` a number of tory mps consider their position ' , he claimed . one tory mp held a ` cloak and dagger ' meeting with mr reckless to discuss the process of defection in detail , while another has contacted him by phone , he revealed yesterday . mr reckless said : ` i have spoken with two conservative mps about the possibility of their moving over , and i think they will want to see what the result is tonight before making any decisions . it is a very individual decision . and i feed back to nigel on those conversations . ` a lot of conservative mps will be looking at the result closely . i think it 's about ukip being able to show we are taking votes from labour as well as the conservatives . ' one of those rumoured to be on the verge of quitting the tories is peter bone , the arch eurosceptic mp for wellingborough . he is speaking at the cambridge union tonight in favour of the motion that ` ukip has been good for british politics ' . yesterday mr bone said the date of the debate had been fixed months ago and said he wanted ukip members to ` come back and join the conservatives ' . it emerged yesterday that mr bone , as well as tories philip hollobone and martin vickers are polling their constituents on membership of the eu . mr reckless did the same before defecting in september , as did douglas carswell before he changed parties in august . tory communities minister eric pickles downplayed further defections , saying : ` i do n't think there will be any . ` we have brought the economy back from the brink .
