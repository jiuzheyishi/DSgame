{"text": "it is undoubtedly one of the highlights of the british sporting calendar and last year attracted record crowds . but it looks as though the stands at next sunday 's british grand prix may be a little more sparsely populated with attendance figures expected to fall dramatically . even hardened formula one fans are thought to be put off by ever-increasing ticket prices . the cheapest tickets for the silverstone race start at # 145 and sources have said that sales this year ` are n't all that strong ' , according to the independent . drama : fernando alonso -lrb- red car -rrb- is chased down by eventual winner mark webber in front of packed stands at last year 's british grand prix . attendances are expected to drop this year due to high ticket prices . big occasion : last year 's winner mark webber is pictured celebrating after he took the chequered flag at silverstone . yesterday , silverstone 's website showed that just a third of 33 ticket categories have sold out so far with only races in abu dhabi and brazil more expensively priced than their british counterpart . last year 's british grand prix , won by australian driver mark webber , saw a record 127,000 attendance pack the spectator areas . as many as 30,000 others who had tickets were reportedly told to stay away after torrential rain turned car parks into mudbaths worthy of glastonbury music festival and saw surrounding roads struggling to cope with the sheer weight of traffic attending the event . race organisers have spent money improving non-tarmacked car parks and invested in better public transport provisions to the venue such as park and ride . bad experience : many spectators were told to stay away from last year 's event after torrential rain left car parks and paths more like a glastonbury mudbath than a grand prix . no show : although race organisers have spent money improving the track 's non-tarmacked car parks , it looks as though less spectators will turn up this year anyway . but with ticket sales at an apparently disappointing level , it looks as though their efforts may have been in vain . a spokesman for silverstone told the independent : ` we had record crowds in 2011 and 2012 and during our initial sales period for this year 's event ticket sales were not as strong , however they have picked up significantly in the last six to eight weeks and we are pleased to announce that although the crowd will not be as big as last years it will still be one of our biggest of recent years . ` there are a number of influencing factors ranging from the current economic climate through to what is going on in the championship - british drivers on the podium always have a positive impact on ticket sales . billionaire : ticket prices are high because television revenue and sponsorship money goes to bernie ecclestone 's company f1 group . ` thirdly , there is no doubt that some people came last year , got soaking wet and did n't have a good experience . ' tickets to the wimbledon men 's final , the grand national and last month 's champions league football final at wembley stadium are all less than the cheapest ticket at the british grand prix . the high ticket prices have also been attributed to the sport 's unusual source of revenue . television rights , advertising and hoarding sales and corporate hospitality money all goes straight into the pocket of the sport 's rights holder f1 group , which is owned by bernie ecclestone . therefore , ticket sales is the only way that venues make any money from the sport - barely enough to break even when the annual hosting fee is taken into account . unlike races in other countries , the british grand prix is not afforded the luxury of any government subsidies . ticket prices have risen more than 40 per cent for the british grand prix since silverstone signed a new contract to host the annual spectacle for another 17 years in 2009 . but a contractual clause with mr ecclestone 's company , which sees the hosting price go up by five per cent each year , sees organisers left with no choice but to raise ticket prices .", "summary": " the cheapest seats at silverstone next sunday will cost fans # 145 .   ticket sales ` are n't all that strong ' for this year 's race , say sources .   last year silverstone attracted a record 127,000 strong crowd .
