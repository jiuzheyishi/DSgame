{"text": "inside one of the many busy open markets in kampala , rows of hanged trousers and dresses swing in midair , casting a shadow over the colorful stacks of unsorted clothes sitting on rickety wooden stalls . amidst the hustle and bustle , bargain-hunting shoppers rummage through the large piles of printed t-shirts , short-sleeved blouses and retro jackets in search of a great deal . this is the ugandan capital 's version of a thrift store , fully stocked with second-hand garments from the west . here , european-made clothing , american sports jerseys and designer labels are all offered at discount prices , turning second-hand markets like this into a prime destination for cheap garments .  things from u.s. and uk , london , they are nice ,  says karol , owner of a local second-hand market stall .  my customers keep on coming .  short-term gain , long-term pain ? the sale of western cast-offs starts with charities in european and north american countries that earn money by offloading donated clothes they can not find buyers for . the unwanted used clothes often end up in landfills . increasingly , however , they are also being purchased by wholesalers , who then sort , label and package them into containers for export to different markets . a large portion of these previously owned clothes ends up in market stalls across africa -- according to an oxfam report , used garments account for over 50 % of the clothing sector by volume in many sub-saharan african countries . for customers in kampala 's bustling markets , however , this is no dumping ground . instead , these clothes are as desirable as they are affordable .  yes , the price is right and the clothes are still looking good ,  says brenda , a local shopper . in the beginning , it appears to be a win-win situation for everyone involved ; western charities receive much-needed revenue , african buyers with weak purchasing power get low-priced , well-made clothing , and merchants find eager customers for their merchandise . but some experts say that the mass influx of cheap hand-me-downs from the west could have a much more negative impact .  the long-term effect is that countries such as malawi or mozambique or zambia ca n't really establish or protect their own clothing industries if they are importing second-hand goods ,  says andrew brooks , lecturer at king 's college london and co-author of a study called  unravelling the relationships between used-clothing imports and the decline of african clothing industries .   your t-shirt may be quite cheap for someone to buy , but it would be better if that person could buy a locally manufactured t-shirt , so the money stays within the economy and that helps generate jobs ,  he adds . watch video : cashing in on second-hand clothes . big business . analysts say textile industries are relatively easy to develop and , as success stories like south korea showcase , can provide the first step in the ladder towards economic growth . a booming clothing sector is labor intensive , generates national revenues through taxes and , ultimately , can help end dependency on aid . but in africa , the introduction of trade-liberalization policies and the opening of economies in the 1980s and 1990 allowed both second-hand and cheap new imports , especially from asian countries , to enter markets across the continent . this undermined growth opportunities for many local industries and led to the closure of several african clothing factories , say experts . according to a 2006 report , textile and clothing employment in ghana declined by 80 % from 1975 to 2000 ; in zambia it fell from 25,000 workers in the 1980s to below 10,000 in 2002 ; and in nigeria the number of workers fell from 200,000 to being insignificant . meanwhile , second-hand became a highly lucrative industry across african markets . whilst exact continent-wide figures are hard to come by , global used clothing exports from oecd countries stood at $ 1.9 billion in 2009 , according to 2011 u.n. comtrade data . yet brooks claims the figure is an underestimation , largely because of the widespread smuggling of used clothes that occurs in many countries , as well as trans-shipments that are not documented in official statistics .  the best estimate that probably gives the value of the global trade of second-hand clothing would be about $ 3 billion ,  he says .  obviously , that 's the import cost and once things are sold on retail , -lsb- it 's -rsb- probably twice that ,  he adds . read this : ` africa 's tallest building ' set for $ 10 billion tech city . hard to compete . for many people across africa 's fashion industries , this curtails local new-clothing production and prevents their sector from growing . designer sylvia owori , who 's been in business in kampala for more than a decade , says it 's very difficult to rival the second-hand market .  probably 90 % of the clothing people are buying in the whole country are second-hand clothes ,  says owori .  it 's a multimillion dollar industry -- so , as a small fish , how are you going to start to compete with that ?  to deal with the problem , a number of african countries have banned imports of second-hand clothes in recent years as part of efforts aimed at protecting their national textiles industries . amongst them are the continent 's two biggest economies -- south africa and nigeria -- while many more are also debating restrictions . but there 's also another threat to the local industries : chinese imports that are even cheaper than the western hand-me-downs and locally made clothes . read this : ` china can transform africa '  one of the problems is that these local clothing industries are often more expensive than clothing that 's produced in asia ,  says brooks .  so if you ban second-hand clothing sometimes this gets replaced with imports of clothing from china or elsewhere in the far east .  back in owuri 's shop , the designer says she is resigned to the reality of her competition . she adds , however , that she looks forward to the day that homegrown businesses like her own prevail .  as much as i do n't like second-hand clothes to be in the market , i do n't have an alternative ,  she says .  i can not make enough clothes to support a population of 33 million . so we need to actually first grow the manufacturing and production side of the business locally for us to say , ` ok , all the other stuff ca n't come in . '  brooks says that whilst used t-shirts , jeans and dresses can satisfy a basic need for affordable clothing , they ultimately help keep people in poverty .  second-hand clothing maintains the status quo ,  he says .  it does n't help the poor get richer , it just keeps things as they are at the moment .
