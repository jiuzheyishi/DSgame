{"text": "the u.s. justice department has filed papers accusing russian evgeniy mikhailovich bogachev , pictured , as being the leader of the gang behind the software . the dangerous cyber pandemic known as gameover zeus could have infected thousands of british computers and be lying dormant gathering data , experts say . the malware , which the fbi estimates has hit between 500,000 and one million computers worldwide , has resulted in users losing tens of millions of dollars . gameover zeus , which experts say is ` sophisticated ' and capable of evading anti-virus software , infects a user 's machine when they open a pdf or click on a link sent to them in an email . once it is set up on the computer , gameover zeus will intercept all financial transactions and rewrite them , so that payments made by the user will be redirected into other accounts . the malware also has the power to disguise unapproved payments that are made , meaning that thefts might have occurred even if accounts appear normal . the virus has hit computer users around the world , with the most incidents reported in the u.s. and italy -- 13 percent and 12 percent respectively . seven percent of incidents have occurred in the uk . ` it keeps track of balances ; it . automatically corrects the numbers on the balance . it 's so sophisticated . that it hides its tacks , ' said nick savvides , senior principal systems . engineer at symantec in australia . mr savvides stated that many computer users could have downloaded the virus already and it may be lying dormant on their machines ready to be activated at any moment . scroll down for video . the gameover zeus malware has targeted computers in the u.s. with up to one million affected worldwide . cryptolocker is malware run by the same gang behind gameover zeus and they are often installed on computers at the same time . the cryptolocker malware often comes into effect if the user is not a ` viable ' victim for gameover zeus and the network can not access their financial details . cryptolocker locks your computer , encrypts files and demands a ransom for them to be unlocked . ` there 's really no alternative to getting files back after the infection -lsb- except paying the ransom -rsb- , ' said marcel mascunan , marketing manager for kroll ontrack asia-pacific . ` it 's a really nasty piece of malware . ' the u.s. government admitted that at least one police force has been forced to pay this ransom to release sensitive files . the gameover zeus malware was shut down by an international police effort this week , spearheaded by the fbi , assisted by both the australian federal police and symantec . this is the third attempt to shut down the malware , which first emerged in 2011 , and the fbi is reporting that users have two weeks to clean up their hard drives and install anti-virus software before the network responsible for gameover zeus will be operational again . gameover zeus has been so difficult to shut down because it uses peer-to-peer software , meaning that even if the main server is shut down , infected computers can continue to communicate with one another and continue operating . another reason is that once installed on a computer , gameover zeus has the ability to evade anti-virus software . ` once it has infected -lsb- a computer -rsb- , it 's very hard to get it off , ' said mr savvides . computers are often concurrently infected with gameover zeus and a separate piece of malware , cryptolocker , and there is some evidence linking the two pieces of malware back to the same eastern european network . the cryptolocker malware often comes into effect if the user is not a ` viable ' victim for gameover zeus and the network can not access their financial details . cryptolocker then locks the information on the computer and holds it to ransom . at the moment the software demands one bitcoin , an untraceable form of online currency favoured by criminals , which is around # 300 . in the worst cases , victims could lose access to their bank accounts which could be systematically drained . according to symantec data , three percent of people affected by the cryptolocker malware pay the ransom rather than lose their files and paying the ransom seems to be the only way for users to gain access to their files once they have been attacked . ` there 's really no alternative to getting files back after the infection . there 's not much we can do about it ... without having the keys it 's virtually impossible to decrypt the files , ' said marcel mascunan , marketing manager for kroll ontrack asia-pacific . the u.s. government admitted that at least one police force has been forced to pay this ransom to release sensitive files . earlier this week , the u.s. justice department filed papers accusing a russian named evgeniy mikhailovich bogachev as being the leader of the gang behind the software . could russian evgeniy mikhailovich bogachev , pictured , be the behind the global cyber virus pandemic ? he is the man suspected of being behind a gang that has sparked a global cyber virus pandemic . but the fbi has already spent years looking for russian evgeniy mikhailovich bogachev who uses the online names ` lucky12345 ' and ` slavik ' . the 31-year-old is already wanted for his alleged involvement in a ` racketeering enterprise ' that installed malicious software known as ` zeus ' on victims ' computers . the software was used to capture bank account numbers , passwords , personal identification numbers , and other information needed to log into online banking accounts . the fbi believes bogachev knowingly acted in a role as an administrator while others involved in the scheme conspired to distribute spam and phishing emails , which contained links to compromised websites . victims who visited these web sites were infected with the malware , which bogachev and others allegedly used to steal money from the victims ' bank accounts . this online account takeover fraud has been investigated by the fbi since the summer of 2009 . starting in september 2011 , the fbi began investigating a modified version of the zeus trojan , known as gameover zeus -lrb- goz -rrb- . it is believed goz is responsible for more than one million computer infections , resulting in financial losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars . on august 22 , 2012 , bogachev was indicted under the nickname ` lucky12345 ' by a federal grand jury in the district of nebraska on a number of charges including bank fraud , conspiracy to violate the computer fraud and abuse act and aggravated identity theft . on may 19 , 2014 , bogachev was indicted in his true name by a federal grand jury in the western district of pennsylvania on charges of conspiracy , computer fraud , wire fraud , bank fraud and money laundering . then just days ago on may 30 , a criminal complaint was issued in the district of nebraska that ties the previously indicted nickname of ` lucky12345 ' to bogachev and charges him with conspiracy to commit bank fraud . he is described as white with brown hair -lrb- though his head is usually shaved -rrb- and brown eyes . he is 5ft 9ins tall and weighs around 180 pounds -lrb- 82kg -rrb- . bogachev was last known to live in anapa , russia . he is believed to enjoy boating and may travel to locations along the black sea in his boat . he also owns property in krasnodar , russia . the complaint claims the software has . been responsible for the loss of more than $ 100m from individuals and a . string of major companies , with estimates that members of the gang . behind the malware would have amassed tens of millions of dollars each . computer users who fear they could fall victim to the virus are advised to install anti-virus software and ensure their operating system has the latest security updates . users are also advised to change their passwords , as original passwords may have been compromised during infection , and to enable automatic updates on their anti-virus software . users are also advised being cautious when handling unsolicited or unexpected emails , particularly during the two-week window before hackers rebuild their network . the boss of a government-backed website aimed at helping victims of cyber-crime has apologised after it temporarily stopped functioning as the gameover zeus crisis unfolded . computer users had been urged to contact get safe online if they had concerns about the malware . but within minutes of that announcement on monday , the website suffered an outage amid ` unprecedented demand ' for the service with problems running into wednesday . chief executive tony neate has since apologised and claimed that the website had ` quadrupled ' its capacity . it appeared to be up and running on wednesday afternoon . he added that the site itself had not been the subject of a cyber attack and that demand itself had caused the problems . get safe online is a jointly-funded initiative between several government departments and private sector businesses and describes itself as the government 's preferred online security advice channel . experts have also warned users to back-up all valuable data . many of those whose computers have already been infected will be contacted by their internet service providers . symantec has also produced a clean-up tool for infected users who need to get rid of the malware . however potential victims only have only a short time to protect themselves before the hackers can rebuild their network .", "summary": " up to one million computers have been infected by ` gameover zeus '   the software can lie dormant on computers before draining accounts .   thousands of british computers may be infected with the malware , which is extremely sophisticated and can evade anti-virus software .   an international police effort has halted the spread of the botnet , giving computer users two weeks to install anti-virus before the virus hits again .   apology from boss of cyber-security advice website after service goes down .
