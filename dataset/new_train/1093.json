{"text": "the ` rice portrait ' : exciting new evidence suggests the innocent-looking teenager in the simple white dress may really be the famous author . a portrait of a pretty 13-year-old girl claimed to be jane austen has divided art experts for years . but exciting new evidence has now emerged that the innocent-looking teenager in the simple white dress may really be the famous author , on a visit to kent in 1789 . an analysis of the oil painting using digital photographic tools has revealed writing that seems to back up the case for it being a genuine likeness of the 19th century novelist . no other professional portrait of the writer has ever been verified - with only two artworks drawn by amateur hands confirmed as having been produced from life . but now , analysts have discovered the name jane austen in the top-right corner of a . reproduction of a photograph of the portrait of the teenager , taken before the painting . was restored , according to the guardian . beside it , in . two places , is the name ozias humphry . mr humphry was an established portrait painter of . the period , a member of the royal academy and a friend of several popular artists of the day , including gainsborough and romney . the words have been digitally enhanced using . methods that were independently . validated by stephen cole of acume forensics in . leeds , who has spent more than 20 years analysing photographic evidence . in criminal cases . of the two verified amateur artworks , one is a watercolour and pencil sketch by miss austen 's sister cassandra , said to make the young woman look a little cross . the other is an ` idealised ' portrait used as the frontispiece to the austen memoir written by her nephew in 1870 . art critic angus stewart , a former . curator of an exhibition dedicated to the author , said : ` to have all these words revealed on the canvas is . very , very strong . ' i think you 'd be flying in the face of reason to deny . this . ' there have been various other claims to have found likenesses of the author taken before her death in 1817 aged 41 , but all have been the subject of furious dispute . ` unrealistic ' : the two verified portraits of the author from her lifetime - left , an ` idealised ' painting from the cover of a memoir by her nephew , and right , a ` cross ' watercolour and pencil sketch by her sister cassandra . in december , austen biographer dr paula byrne claimed in bbc documentary jane austen : the unseen portrait ? that she had found a sketch at auction that was the much-loved author , but she has not yet proved her case to universal satisfaction . the painting of the young girl is owned by the rice family , direct descendants of one of jane 's brothers . arguments : biographer dr paula byrne claimed in a bbc documentary that this sketch was produced before the novelist 's death . it came to light in the late 19th century and the family say it was composed while the austens were visiting jane 's great uncle francis in kent in 1789 , when the girl was 13 . according to the recorded family history , having commissioned the portrait francis kept it in sevenoaks with the rest of his family collection . it was then given by his grandson , colonel thomas austen , to a close friend as a wedding present , the year after the author died in 1817 , because the bride was reported to be a keen admirer of austen 's books . but since the , art experts , led by the national portrait gallery , have raised objections - mainly that the style of the girl 's dress and the general composition date the painting to after 1800 , when jane would have been in her 20s . but the new evidence could contradict that view . artist mr humphry went blind in 1797 and stopped painting . the photo even seems to reveal the date 1789 . the writing could have been put on the canvas by mr humphry himself or a later owner . but as the painting was believed to be by a more prestigious artist , johann zoffany , experts believe the words must have been put there during or shortly after jane 's lifetime . professor claudia johnson of princeton university said : ` whether humphry 's name was signed by himself in the 18th century and/or by some other hand later , the attribution must be contemporaneous with austen 's lifetime or by people who knew austen when she was alive . ' if the portrait is confirmed as being austen , it may be an embarrassment to the national portrait gallery , which granted the picture a licence for sale abroad on the basis that it could not be the writer . the gallery chose not to comment .", "summary": " only two existing images of novelist from her lifetime and both are by amateurs .   digital analysis has revealed writing on the canvas that says ` jane austen ' , the artist 's name and ' 1789 ' "}
