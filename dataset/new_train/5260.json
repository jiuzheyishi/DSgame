{"text": "a girl left severely disabled at birth is being forced to fly to the other side of the world every month in a ` soul destroying ' journey to qualify for medical compensation . paige carpenter was born in new zealand 14 years ago but suffered horrific brain damage when she was starved of oxygen . the authorities ruled that mistakes made by a midwife were to blame and paige was handed a massive payout package to provide care for the rest of her life . paige carpenter , pictured right with her mother donna , has to fly to the other side of the world to qualify for her medical compensation . when her english mother donna decided to return home to live in the uk in june 2010 the compensation money was halted . but mrs carpenter found a loophole in the legislation which means so long as paige is present in new zealand for just 24 hours once a month she still qualifies for the # 1,000-per week compensation . payments started in jan 2011 as soon as they landed . paige has now endured 11 round-the-world trips of 23,000 miles from her home in great bentley , essex - the equivalent of flying further than the moon which is 238,855 miles away . amazingly , when the teenager , her mother and her mother 's partner land - they are automatically registered as having been in the country - meaning they often return after just one night 's stay at an airport hotel . sadly nearly all of the money , which should be for wheelchair bound paige 's medical care , is instead spent on air fares and travel costs . donna , 43 , and her husband , stephen barnett , 47 , have to accompany the teenager on the exhausting trips which often involve a journey time of up to 40 hours to get out there . paige carpenter , now 14 , with her mother donna carpenter -lrb- left -rrb- when she was born and -lrb- right -rrb- paige when she was three . paige carpenter pictured after having undergone surgery for an e.coli infection when she was five . but mrs carpenter is determined to continue with the journeys in a bid to highlight paige 's plight and force the authorities in new zealand to back down and just make the compensation payments without the gruelling condition attached . she said : ` paige did not ask for this life and all this is about is giving her the care she so desperately needs . ` it 's not so that we can be wealthy - we are not living a life of luxury from this money - it 's about providing round-the-clock care for her . ' paige 's conditions mean she is wheelchair-bound and she is only able to speak a handful of words . mrs carpenter - a former shop manager - is now paige 's full-time carer . she added : ' i do n't know how long we are . going to be able to carry on doing the trips - they are soul destroying . i am in tears every time we get onto the plane . paige has now endured 11 round-the-world trips of 23,000 miles from her home in great bentley , essex . ` we have to have paige lying across our laps because she is not able to sit upright . ' i was ready to quit after the first few journeys we made but paige 's brothers and sisters encouraged me to carry on , reminding me that we are doing this for her future , hopefully so she will still be provided for in years to come when we are no longer alive . ' financial support is restricted for people once they leave new zealand , meaning the only way that paige can get her full entitlement is by moving back out there . mrs carpenter , a mother of six , said : ` it is heart-wrenching for us . paige needs 24/7 care and it is very difficult . ` we really do want to get the best care we can for her and improve the quality of her life but they are making it extremely difficult . ` why should we have to be living in new zealand in order to get the money she is entitled to ? all of our support network is now here in england and moving back to new zealand is simply not an option . ' paige was born at home in new zealand but suffered perinatal hypoxia - meaning her brain was starved of oxygen at the critical time . the teenager , who can barely speak , also suffers from cerebral palsy and has a twisted spine . mrs carpenter hopes one day to be able to take her daughter to america for an operation to straighten it and relieve the pain she constantly suffers . the mother-of-six says she has been constantly having to battle the authorities in order to get the compensation paige is due . she added : ` she is a fighter , so i am going to keep fighting for her . we were told she would never speak , but she recently started to say a few words . ` when she said ` mummy , i love you ' it was one of the happiest moments in my whole life . ' mrs carpenter has five other children - lauren , 21 , tyler , 19 , madison , 16 , jake , 11 and aiden , seven . lauren takes responsibility for looking after her younger siblings when her mother and husband , a carpenter , head to new zealand . the compensation money - to provide ` attendant care ' stopped in july 2011 and mrs carpenter 's new zealand lawyer argued there was ` no logical reason ' why paige should not receive the same payment in the uk but the case was dismissed . a spokesman for new zealand 's accident compensation commission said he was unable to comment on individual cases . he said : ` we provide a range of support for people with accident-related injuries . however , the accident compensation act restricts the support to clients once they leave new zealand . ' there is discretion for the acc to fund people living overseas , but factors such as cost and whether the care can be monitored are taken into account .", "summary": " paige carpenter was starved of oxygen at birth in new zealand .   she was given massive payout package to provide care for rest of her life .   but when her family moved to england with her the payments stopped .   that was until her mother donna found a loophole in the system .
