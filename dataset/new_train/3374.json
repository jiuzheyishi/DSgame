{"text": "the bbc gives too much weight to pro-immigration voices and ` almost totally ignores ' the negative social impact of multiculturalism , a new study has claimed . the corporation suffers from left wing ` groupthink ' that prevents its journalists from challenging institutional bias and results in pro-immigration ` propaganda ' , according to the research published yesterday . it was also accused of ` downplaying ' violence by islamists while being happy to criticise christianity and report on the activities of other violent extremists . the bbc has been accused of ` downplaying ' violence by islamists after a report which analysed its coverage since 1997 . the report , by independent think-tank the new culture forum , looked at coverage by bbc news and current affairs programmes since 1997 . it comes as the bbc undertakes an ` impartiality review ' by former itv and sky executive stuart prebble to see whether it gives ` due weight ' to a full range of opinion on controversial topics , such as immigration . the study 's author , ed west , concluded : ` in its coverage of the topic of immigration , the bbc has given overwhelmingly greater weight to pro-migration voices , even though they represent a minority -- even elitist -- viewpoint . ` and in its coverage of the economic arguments for and against immigration , it has devoted somewhat more space to pro-migration voices . ` in terms of the social costs , the bbc has almost totally ignored certain areas . the more awkward a subject is for polite society to deal with , the less coverage the bbc gives it . ' he added : ` it would be no exaggeration to say that a foreigner who subscribed only to the bbc might visit this country and be blissfully unaware of many of the social problems associated with immigration . ' according to the study , it is ` common practice ' for the bbc to give a platform to multiple pro-immigration spokesmen with no dissenting voices . mr west said : ` between 1997 and 2013 , of the hundreds of immigration news reports that i have personally watched , listened to and read , in literally just a handful have anti-immigration voices not been outnumbered . ' the report was particularly scathing about a bbc online article on ` migrant myths ' published in 2002 . the article said the idea of the ` scrounging , bogus asylum seeker ' was a ` misconception ' , while opponents of mass immigration were guilty of ` racism , political opportunism , misinformation , media mischief-making and sheer cowardice ' as well as genuine concern . mr west said : ` however laudable its intentions may be , a feature like this -- which presents only one side of the argument -- is propaganda . ' he said bbc bias was often unintentional or provoked by ` basic decency ' and a desire to protect the underdog . in the wake of the woolwich killing last week , the study accused the bbc of failing to report accurately on violence by islamic fundamentalists . but he said by focussing on personalised , emotive cases of asylum seekers and immigration success stories , the bbc failed to cover the views of ` working class natives ' or to ask awkward questions about the difficulties of integration . damagingly , in the wake of the woolwich killing last week , the study accused the bbc of failing to report accurately on violence by islamic fundamentalists . it said : ` in contrast to violence perpetrated by white-skinned extremists , the bbc tends to downplay any violent activity on the part of extremists . ' it added : ` the bbc feels uncomfortable tackling islamic extremism or aggression by minorities ; it feels more at ease to see muslims as victims of racism or islamophobia . ' in 2010 , the bbc 's then director general mark thompson accepted the corporation had once been guilty of a ` massive ' left-wing bias and admitted its coverage of immigration and europe had been ` weak ' . he said : ` the bbc does n't always get it right . i think there are some areas , immigration , business and europe where the bbc has historically been rather weak and rather nervous about letting that entire debate happen . in 2007 , a bbc trust report into the bbc 's impartiality found the corporation had self-censored subjects it found unpalatable . the bbc said coverage of immigration is ` impartial and balanced ' , but trustees are carrying out a review to see if ` due weight ' is given to a range of opinions on hot topics .", "summary": " report looked at coverage by bbc news and current affairs programmes since 1997 .   the study 's author , ed west , said the bbc ignored certain areas .   he said bbc bias was often unintentional or provoked by ` basic decency ' and a desire to protect the underdog .
