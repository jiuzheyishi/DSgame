{"text": "on tuesday , january 12 2010 , the world watched in horror as haiti was struck by a catastrophic earthquake . at least 100,000 people lost their lives in the devastation . in the aftermath , many people around the world sent financial aid to help support survivors . but one young entrepreneur was so affected by the tragedy that he sat down at his desk to try to lend his professional skills to future relief efforts . having watched the disaster unfold on tv , francisco aguilar , a graduate from mit sloan and the harvard kennedy school , began working on a tool that could be used to help in emergency response situations around the world .  if you remember the 2010 earthquake in haiti , you saw hundreds of thousands of people buried under the rubble . after an earthquake most people die in the first 48 hours . people who are trapped tend to die in the first 48 hours . and the international rescue teams came with their very sophisticated equipment , and did a fantastic job when they got there , -lrb- but -rrb- they did n't get there for 48 hours . and their tools , their fiber optic scopes , and all the kinds of equipment that they have , cost $ 50,000 , and are very hard to use . so , despite their very valiant efforts , they pulled out a few hundred people , but most of the damage was already done ,  aguilar says . the device aguilar invented is called the bounce imaging explorer -- a small black probe about the size of a baseball , fixed with an array of sensors and cameras that can be thrown or dropped into dangerous environments .  the initial thought was , how could we create something that was easy to use , that could allow a first responder , or even a volunteer , to easily look inside a space to determine whether it was safe to enter it , to see if there was a victim inside ,  aguilar says .  and that moved from search and rescue , to police who often face hostage situations : aggressive shooters , or terrorism . to fire fighting applications , where people often want to search different rooms in a complex , before having to enter or decide whether there is a fire or not . so there 's a common problem across first responders of having to decide whether to enter a house or a space . and we are trying to make it cheap and easy to get images while they are out of there .  to develop the product aguilar partnered with david young , an entrepreneur who spent four and a half years as a us army infantry officer . the bounce imaging explorer 's cameras and sensors can quickly take panoramic images after being thrown into an inaccessible space . the impact resistant shell can also house heat sensors , geiger counters , vibration antennae or smoke detectors to provide different information in different kinds of emergencies , such as natural distasters or swat team hostage rescues . the ball then broadcasts its findings back to a mobile device to give users information on whether there are hazards -lrb- or indeed survivors -rrb- around a corner , or buried beneath fallen debris . the company , bounce imaging , won a gold award of $ 50,000 at masschallenge , and was named one of time magazine 's best inventions of the year . gianfranco zaccai , ceo of design consultancy continuum , said :  i think that the concept is really great in its simplicity ... there 's a lot of potential there , and there 's a lot of potential for doing good with it , because if you think about , the dangerous world that we live in , we need simple , robust , usable ideas that are embedded in great products .  aguilar hopes to begin producing the bounce imaging explorer next year , and says he aims to keep the cost between $ 500 and $ 1000 .", "summary": " u.s. graduate francisco aguilar invents throwable camera called the bounce imaging explorer .   the shock absorbent baseball-sized tool can be thrown into hostile situations to assess risk .   it is a low-cost piece of equipment that could help first responders in developing countries .
