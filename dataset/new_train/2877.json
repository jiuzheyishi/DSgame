{"text": "it 's nicknamed  the kingdom in the sky  -- where blue , chilly skies linger over barren mountains , lush green mountains , snow-covered mountains . this is truly a kingdom of mountains -- the southern african country of lesotho . but the breathtakingly beautiful landscapes are a tough place to live and some remote highland areas can only be reached on foot or horseback . during winter time , temperatures can drop down to -4 fahrenheit -lrb- -20 c -rrb- and bad weather can cut off much of the population for months . the rural mountainsides are where boys as young as five tend cattle and sheep . they are the herd boys of lesotho , often spending months or even years away from their families . it is estimated that around a third of lesotho 's school-aged boys are shepherds . becoming a shepherd is a cultural obligation in the country and often deprives young boys of any form of education . instead , they lead isolated lives .  i wake up at seven in the morning . i boil some water and take a bath . i clean my surroundings and prepare for the day ahead . then i take the cattle to the grazing field ,  says 17-year-old shepherd thuso leeto , who over time has formed a special bond with the cows that are his only companions and which he considers to be his friends .  i have -lrb- even -rrb- given them names and when i reprimand them they listen and respond to their names ,  he says . read this : africa 's magnificent mountains - seven amazing climbs . the work of the herd boys is both mentally and physically demanding , but their income is often the only means of support for their families . for one year 's work , some boys will receive just one cow or 12 sheep . prince seeiso , younger brother of lesotho 's king and the country 's high commissioner to the united kingdom , has co-founded a charity called sentebale , together with britain 's prince harry . the aim is to help support some of lesotho 's most vulnerable children , the herd boys included .  there is not much social security in this country as far as the welfare or wellbeing of the herd boys -lrb- goes -rrb- ,  says prince seeiso . prince seeiso explains that whilst the tradition of the herd boys goes far back in time , the herding used to be done by older men .  when the migrant labor began to get into lesotho when the mines were opening , the older men went into south africa and then there was a void . then the kids became the herders ,  he says . lesotho has one of the world 's highest hiv/aids rates , with around 23 % of adults aged 15-49 being hiv positive , according to unaids . providing support and information about hiv/aids is one of sentebale 's missions , and it is also providing an education for the herd boys through night schools .  we are looking at the long-term goals of eradicating the need for herding , but in the meantime we try and bring some kind of respite in terms of education , in terms of appropriate clothing , in terms of appropriate technology , introducing them to mobile phones , so that when they are out there , they can be alerted to weather reports ,  says the prince . improving the lives of young herd boys . it 's not only the possibility of floods , or the biting winds that easily find their way through the worn-out , thin clothes of the young shepherds , that threaten them . after rounding their livestock into holding pens and retreating to their own small huts , the herd boys nervously await the impending night . this is peak time for cattle thieves and jackals . julius majoro , one of the local night school teachers , became a herd boy when he was 12 years old . he knows the fears these young men face .  many thieves come during nighttime and attack the shepherds . they sometimes kill them with a gun ,  majoro says , recalling the feeling of isolation .  i used to be lonely because i was just staying with the animals , also not feeling free , during the day and also during nighttime because i was supposed to care for -lrb- them -rrb- .  the isolation , the hunger -lrb- majoro says he sometimes had to eat food left out for the dogs by the farmer who employed him -rrb- and the hard weather conditions motivated him to fight for the rights of the herd boys .  the word shepherd , it sounds like an insult ... because those people have been abandoned by society , by our nation by everybody . nobody cares for them ,  he says .  now what i always try to tell the shepherd , -lrb- being -rrb- a shepherd does n't mean something bad , it means you 're doing something special .  read this : maasai cricket warriors . going the extra mile for education and a hot meal . as of october this year , sentebale has three night schools for the herd boys , and majoro runs one of them , in semongkong , one of the remotest parts of the country . he has been teaching there for five years now , and this season he has about 30 students . it 's winter time , and the classroom is cold . but many shepherds walk for hours after they have finished their work for the day , to get basic education and a hot meal .  it 's very , very cold ,  majoro says .  even if it 's worse than now , they will still come . education is their need . they need love . they want to socialize . and only here at school is where they get what they need .  the lesson plans involve math as well as english and sesotho -- the language of lesotho . the young men are also being informed about hiv and aids . but it 's not only about the education . their eyelids may be heavy after a long day of working , but here they can socialize . here , they can break through isolation .  they do n't grow spiritually , they do n't grow emotionally ,  majoro says .  they do n't grow socially , which is part of their life , because if they are not getting those things , they are not well complete .  that 's why we bring them here , teach them how to behave , counsel them . this is just like a big family .  before returning to their respective cattle posts , the herd boys of lesotho sing and dance together , forming a community spirit in remote highlands , 1,000 meters above the sea . then they walk off alone , again .", "summary": " in lesotho , around a third of school-age boys work as herd boys .   boys as young as five can spend a year away from their families .   lesotho 's prince seeiso and britain 's prince harry started charity sentebale to help them .
