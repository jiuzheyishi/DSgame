' while palace aides are keen to retain kate 's ` dignity ' as a woman in labour , they acknowledge the fact that social media such as twitter will make it almost impossible to keep her admittance to hospital a secret unless she is smuggled in . but although both buckingham palace and clarence house have their own twitter accounts on which details of royal events are frequently now broken , it will most definitely not be the preferred medium to announce the new royal baby . instead a formal notice on a piece of creamy a4 size buckingham palace-headed paper , signed by the medical staff who have assisted the duchess , will be brought out of the lindo 's front entrance by a press officer . it will then be handed to a waiting driver and driven through the streets of london -- escorted by police outriders - to the privy purse door at the front of buckingham palace . there it will then be placed on an easel , last used to announce prince william 's birth , by the main gates in the palace forecourt . this will signify to an eager public that a new royal baby has been born . same again : on june 22 1982 a sign on an easel was placed at the gates of buckingham palace announcing the birth , the previous day , of prince william . the same will happen this year with his child . joy : william , pictured with the queen on monday at the annual garter ceremony at windsor castle , will be with his wife for the birth , even if he is flown in by helicopter from his welsh raf station . happy day : kate 's pregnancy came around 18 months after their wedding at westminster abbey on april 29 2011 .", "summary": " prince william will continue shifts at raf valley in anglesey before the birth of his first child with the duchess of cambridge .   he may have to be flown to st mary 's hospital in london via helicopter .   sources strongly hint carole and pippa will be present at hospital as well .
