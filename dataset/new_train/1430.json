{"text": "crowds of bewildered people gathered on pakistan 's southern coast to witness the emergence of a new island created following a major earthquake in the region . the 7.8 magnitude quake struck 145 miles southeast of dalbandin in pakistan 's quake-prone province of baluchistan , which borders iran , on tuesday . the earthquake was so powerful that it caused the seabed to rise and create a small , mountain-like island about 600 meters off pakistan 's gwadar coastline in the arabian sea . dead fish have been spotted floating on the surface of the waters surrounding the island and visitors have heard hissing noises from the escaping toxic gas . television channels showed images of a stretch of rocky terrain rising above the sea level , with crowds surrounding the shore to witness the rare phenomenon . zahid rafi , principal seismologist for the national seismic monitoring center , said such masses are sometimes created by the movement of gases locked in the earth under the sea , pushing mud and earth up to the surface in something akin to a mud volcano . ` when such a strong earthquake builds pressure , there is the likelihood of such islands emerging , ' he said . ` that big shock beneath the earth causes a lot of disturbance . ' this liquefaction of sand layers takes . place after any earthquake , but these sudden islands are usually only . spotted after strong earthquakes , at least 7 - or 8-magnitude events . an aerial view of the island taken soon after it formed . the life of this island is likely to be short , according to nasa . the underground pocket of gas will cool , compress , or escape over time , allowing the crust to collapse and settle back down . such masses are sometimes created by the movement of gases locked in the earth under the sea , pushing mud and earth up to the surface in something akin to a mud volcano . waves , storms , and tidal action from the arabian sea will wash away the loose sand , soft clay , and mud on the island . scientists believe the 7.8 magnitude earthquake , which struck 145 miles southeast of dalbandin in baluchistan , triggered what is known as ` mud volcano ' . they occur where there is a reservoir of . loosely compacted sediments buried beneath harder , denser rock and a . path is made to the surface . the seismic waves caused a movement of gases locked in the earth under the sea , pushing mud and earth up to the surface along with gas . these sudden islands are usually only . spotted after strong earthquakes , at least 7 - or 8-magnitude events . richard luckett a seismologist the british geological survey said that these mud volcanoes are relatively common in this area on both land and at sea . ` they occur where there is a reservoir of loosely compacted sediments buried beneath harder , denser rock and a path is made to the surface , ' he told mailonline . ` there is a subducting plate boundary in this region where the arabian plate is converging on the eurasian plate at about 2cm a year and being pushed beneath it . ` this is the same plate boundary responsible for the magnitude 7.7 earthquake . ' scientists believe gases associated with the melting at the plate boundary contribute to heating the mud in the reservoirs and making it more fluid . ` certainly mud volcanoes are most common near this type of plate boundary , such as in japan , ' said dr luckett . ` it is known that mud volcanoes can be triggered by large nearby earthquakes -- in fact the same thing happened in this area in 2001 . ` the exact mechanism for this triggering is poorly understood but the fact that mud volcanoes often occur without a triggering earthquake suggests that little extra impetus is required . ' to get a better idea of what the island is made of and how permanent it is , scientists will have to get samples of the material to see if it 's mostly soft mud or rocks and harder material . these types of islands can remain for a long time or eventually subside back into the ocean , depending on their makeup . a pakistani navy team reached the island by midday wednesday , navy geologist mohammed danish told the country 's geo television . he said the mass was about 60 feet -lrb- 18 meters -rrb- high , 100 feet -lrb- 30 meters -rrb- long and 250 feet -lrb- 76 meters -rrb- wide . the 7.8 magnitude quake struck 145 miles southeast of dalbandin in pakistan 's quake-prone province of baluchistan , which borders iran , on tuesday . ` there are stones and mud , ' he said , warning residents not to try to visit the island . ` gasses are still emitting . ' but dozens of people had already visited the island , said the deputy commissioner of gwadar district , tufail baloch , who travelled by boat himself to the island this morning . water bubbled along the edges of the island , in what appeared to be gas discharging from under the surface , baloch said . he said the area smelled of gas that caught fire when people lit cigarettes . dead fish floated on the water 's surface while local residents were visiting the island and taking stones as souvenirs , he added . dozens of people had already visited the island despite concerns over toxic gas . such land masses have appeared before off pakistan 's makran coast , said muhammed arshad , a hydrographer with the navy . after quakes in 1999 and 2010 , new land masses rose up along a different part of the coast about 282 kilometers -lrb- 175 miles -rrb- east of gwadar , he said . he said each of those disappeared back into the sea within a year during the monsoon season , a period of heavy rain and wind that sweeps pakistan every summer . he said that in the area where the island was created on tuesday , the sea is only about six to seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- deep . older residents of the coastal town recalled an earthquake in 1968 produced an island that stayed for one year and then vanished .", "summary": " the mountain-like island appeared 600m off pakistan 's gwadar coast .   the earthquake triggered a movement of gases in the earth under the sea .   this pushed earth up to the surface in something akin to a ` mud volcano '   such land masses have appeared after quakes in pakistan in 1999 and 2010 .
