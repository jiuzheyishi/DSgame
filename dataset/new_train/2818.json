{"text": "san diego here 's a scary thought : there 's a country where officials are suggesting that the visas of gay partners of u.s. diplomats be revoked and these individuals be put in jail -- not because the country recently outlawed same-sex relationships but to crack down on americans . in that country , the government is also curtailing the privileges traditionally granted to u.s. consulate staff , taking down protective barricades in front of the u.s. consulate and snubbing u.s. diplomatic officers . where do you suppose you 'll find this anti-american backlash brewing ? north korea ? cuba ? iran ? surely , it must be a place where the citizens hate the united states . perhaps it 's a political adversary with which relations have never been particularly good . nope . all this is happening in india , which has long been a good and dependable friend and ally to the united states , most recently during the war on terror . these are tense times in u.s.-india relations . and it 's all because of how agents with the u.s. marshals service treated devyani khobragade when she was recently arrested and detained . the 39-year-old deputy counsel general of india was taken into custody in new york on december 12 after she dropped her daughter off at school , and she was charged with visa fraud for allegedly lying on the application that she filled out to get permission for her nanny to legally work in the united states . court documents allege that she stated on the application that she was paying the nanny the minimum wage in new york -- $ 9.75 per hour , when she was really only paying her what worked out to be about $ 3.31 per hour . even that part of the story is fuzzy . imagine someone coming into your home and calculating what you 're paying a housekeeper or nanny or gardener by the hour , when you 're paying them a flat rate for the day . i know friends who have live-in nannies , and those baby sitters are essentially on-call around the clock . they 're probably making less than minimum wage as well , but with room and board thrown in . anyway , what happened next is n't being disputed by either side . khobragade was put in a holding cell with other female detainees and strip-searched . she eventually posted bond , and she was released . she is now staying at india 's permanent mission to the united nations . the u.s. marshals service claims that a strip-search is standard operating procedure and that none of its policies were violated in this case . a spokesman says that khobragade was treated just like anyone else . that 's the problem . khobragade is not just like anyone else . she is a diplomatic officer with limited immunity . she 's in the united states representing a proud country filled with reserved and modest people , many of whom consider a strip-search to be , as one indian official said ,  barbaric .  this is a country that in recent years has had good relations with the united states and where we have foreign officers stationed who we expect to be treated fairly and humanely . besides , she is not a violent criminal or a terror suspect , and she does n't appear to be a threat to public safety . if there is a labor law violation here , it would a civil crime , not a criminal offense . and if the u.s. government is going to throw the book at people who mistreat workers , i could -- as someone who writes about the immigration issue -- provide dozens of names of u.s. citizens , from farmers to soccer moms , who belong in a lineup . lying on a visa application is no small matter , but we 're still not sure that is what happened given how wages are sometimes arrived at . either way , it does seem that u.s. marshals might have overreacted in this case . like other law enforcement officers , many federal agents already get what is referred to as cultural sensitivity training . but , it turns out , what they really need is a crash course in international relations 101 . the indian government is incensed , and it has a right to be . there are questions about the procedure that agents followed in this case , and they need to be answered . those policies need to be reviewed . indian officials also want an apology , and they should get one . secretary of state john kerry should deliver it himself , going beyond what the state department said in a statement is kerry 's  regret  over the incident . questions of khobragade 's guilt or innocence can wait for another day . yet , decency and common sense can be dealt with now . those things tell us something went wrong in this case . it 's up to the obama administration to make it right before this diplomatic crisis gets any bigger . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of ruben navarrette .", "summary": " india is retaliating against the u.s. over treatment of consular official who was strip-searched .   ruben navarrette : the official was not a threat to safety and the charges are murky .   he says the marshals service may have overreacted and created a diplomatic furor .   navarrette : u.s. relationship with india is vital and should n't be lightly endangered .
