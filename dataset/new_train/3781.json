{"text": "why always me ? it was mario balotelli who first asked the question of himself , and years later we 're still no closer to finding an answer . the man just seems to be a magnet for everything : good and bad . the centre of attention , like he 's involved in a little exhibition game all of his own . and if we thought the white-hot atmosphere of istanbul 's ataturk stadium would make mario rein himself in a little after those penalty shenanigans in the first leg at anfield last week , we were very much mistaken . liverpool striker mario balotelli looks over at manager brendan rodgers after being substituted . rodgers failed to acknowledge balotelli after the striker was taken off in the 82nd minute . balotelli shakes hands with the coaching staff after being replaced by adam lallana . balotelli watches from the bench as the europa league tie goes into extra time . balotelli with team-mates and coaching staff during the penalty shootout . balotelli and sturridge could only watch the penalty shootout as they had been substituted . even before a ball had been kicked , as liverpool 's players walked out on to the pitch in their tracksuits 90 minutes before kick-off to a cacophony of boos and whistles from a typically hostile besiktas crowd , the television cameras inevitably zoomed in on the volatile italian . balotelli stared impassively ahead , blocking out the noise with the music on his headphones , and then spat on to the pitch as if on cue . at that stage we did n't know that he would be starting alongside daniel sturridge in attack for only the second time , and the first since a 3-0 win at tottenham hotspur at the end of august . there are many who have written off balotelli since then , and who 's to say liverpool would n't have considered cutting their losses and bringing in a replacement in january had sturridge not missed most of the season through injury ? but brendan rodgers has persevered with a young man who exasperated even his old mentor roberto mancini at manchester city and there have been encouraging signs in recent weeks , a late winner against tottenham preceding the only goal against besiktas at anfield . mario balotelli of liverpool is pushed by serdar kurtulus of besiktas after accusing necip uysal of diving . balotelli remonstrates with besiktas defender necip uysal during the europa league tie . balotelli was booked by referee damir skomina in the 11th minute for lunge at veli kavlak . even when he does well , however , balotelli often finds himself in bother and the talking point after the game was n't so much his winning penalty as the way he snatched the ball off captain jordan henderson to take it and the subsequent criticism from steven gerrard . having ended the first leg in controversy , balotelli was soon at it again here . the game was only moments old when he forgot rodgers 's pre-match instructions to be patient and pursued serdar kurtulus towards the besiktas corner flag , giving the defender a little nudge in the process . when kurtulus went sprawling on the turf , balotelli leaned down to remonstrate with him , raising the decibel level among the home fans even higher , if that were possible . the ataturk is not a place to go looking for trouble at any time , but particularly not on nights like this . at times balotelli seemed to be spoiling for it . when he was caught in possession deep inside his own half early on , he responded with a lunging challenge on veli kavlak which quite rightly earned him the first yellow card of the night from slovenian referee damir skomina . soon afterwards , he went stumbling backwards and fell on his backside while trying to control a relatively simple pass from sturridge . balotelli 's confidence never wanes , however , even when things are n't going his way . it is a quality of his , even though it did n't feel that way when he wastefully sent a freekick out of play and then followed it up by firing wildly over the bar from fully 40 yards before half-time . balotelli goes down under the challenge by besiktas defender serdar kurtulus . balotelli -lrb- left -rrb- appeals to the referee after being fouled in the second half in istanbul . besiktas midfielder veli kavlak feels full force of balotelli on thursday night . it was a more subdued balotelli after that , even more so when he limped to the touchline after an hour with a foot injury . the shoulders began to slump , the head went down . we 've seen the signs before . perhaps restricted by his earlier booking , it was no surprise that his half-hearted attempt at a challenge preceded the goal from tolgay arslan that levelled the tie in the 72nd minute . balotelli allowed gokhan tore to breeze past him on the left , failing to put in even a hint of a challenge as the besiktas danger man broke into the box and squared for substitute arslan to beat simon mignolet with a cracking effort . ten minutes later the board went up and mario was off , making way for adam lallana . there was a disbelieving look to the bench and a disconsolate walk to the touchline , helped on his way by a sympathetic pat on the arm from emre can . even though liverpool needed a goal at that stage , or very possibly a trusted penalty-taker for the shootout , balotelli 's contribution had dwindled to such a level that it appeared as if he had little left to offer . the look on his face told a different story . the same old story . why always me ?", "summary": " mario balotelli received a yellow card after just 11 minutes .   balotelli and daniel sturridge were paired up front against besiktas .   balotelli was substituted in the 82nd minute for adam lallana .   the striker did not look happy to be going off with extra time looming .
