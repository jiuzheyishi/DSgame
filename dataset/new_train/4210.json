{"text": "satellite images of north korea 's yongbyon nuclear facility have again raised questions about whether the country has restarted its plutonium production reactor -- regarded by western experts as a key component in the development of a nuclear weapon . researchers from u.s.-based groups examined satellite images from august 31 . they showed two columns of steam rising from a building , believed to house the reactor 's steam turbines and electric generators . the steam indicates that the reactor is in or nearing operation , wrote nick hansen and jeffrey lewis , in a 38 north blog post , a program of the u.s.-korea institute at sais . work to reopen the reactor progressed throughout this spring and summer , they wrote .  this is something they -lrb- north koreans -rrb- very much need to arm their arsenal , and that is really linked into what they see as marketing power on the international plane ,  jasper kim , founder of asia-pacific global research group , told cnn .  without this type of nuclear capability , or at least the perception of the threat of having nuclear capabilities , north korea really has few bargaining chips .  but pyongyang has gone down this path before . first completed in the 1980s , north korea agreed to shut the yongbyon facility in 1994 after backing down from a threat to withdraw from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty . it restarted the reactor in 2002 , before it was once again disabled in 2007 after a six-party agreement between china , the united states , north and south korea , japan and russia . in april this year , north korea stated that it would be  readjusting and restarting all the nuclear facilities  in yongbyon , which includes the uranium enrichment plant and the reactor , the country 's state-run news agency kcna said .  this work will be put into practice without delay ,  the north korean report stated at the time . analysts say it appears north korea has fulfilled its word . david albright and robert avagyan , from the institute for science and international security , examined the latest satellite images and agreed the venting appeared most likely connected to the operation of the reactor . they also wrote last month that north korea appeared to have greatly expanded a building used in the uranium enrichment process . the expansions and developments  provide north korea with the ability to expand its stocks of plutonium , as well as produce more highly enriched uranium for nuclear weapons ,  wrote albright and avagyan . they estimated that north korea would likely need two to three years to produce plutonium , which is essential in creating nuclear weapons .  there remains time to negotiate a shutdown of the reactor before north korea can use any of this new plutonium in nuclear weapons  they added .  if a shutdown is achieved in the next six months , the reactor would have produced very little plutonium . ", "summary": " researchers point to steam at north korean facility .   they write that it 's a sign that the reactor is near or in operation .   north korea has opened , shut , re-opened , reshut this reactor before .   north korea said in april it would restart nuclear facility in april .
