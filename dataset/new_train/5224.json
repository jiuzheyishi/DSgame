' chris idzikowski , director of edinburgh sleep centre , added : ` this new innovation can help towards attaining a good night 's sleep . the way it works supports our natural sleep / wake cycle . ` in darkness our brain 's -lrb- pineal gland -rrb- releases melatonin , the hormone of darkness which supports sleep . whilst dawn light is very important for keeping the biological clock ticking to the right time . ` the travelodge night sky room replicates the natural environment which our ancestors would have experienced in the savannah grasslands during the evolution of human sleep patterns .
