' ` you may feel it had nothing to do with her , it was to do with him , with his desires . ` you may feel he is a man who is flattered by the attention of very young , vulnerable girls . ' the prosecutor said it was interesting that his wife , emily forrest , was a ` very young-looking , petite woman with her own vulnerabilities . ' ` there is a word for it . it 's called grooming - being caring , being kind , being close , gaining confidence , gaining the trust of that person and then you can do what you want to do with them . ' he said it was not a case of romeo and juliet as they would have to have been ` equal ' partners in what happened , whereas forrest 's role in absconding was ` absolutely central . ' ` he was there running it . ' ` a teenager is n't going to get out of eastbourne , let alone out of the country . ' he . went on : ` you may well feel he is self-centred , mainly concerned with . his self , his needs and desires and not others , you may also feel he is a . coward . ' referring . to the eight days they spent on the run in bordeaux , in which they used . fake names to apply for jobs , he added : ` you may feel it is the oddest . school trip in which one teacher goes away with one pupil and school . activities include having sex with a 15-year-old and changing . identities . ' the schoolgirl 's mother wept in the public gallery as mr barton said that the worst ` betrayal ' had been of her daughter . family : jim and julie forrest -lrb- centre and right -rrb- arrive with their daughter carrie -lrb- left -rrb- , who defended her brother as a devoted uncle and godfather today . in court : emily forrest , pictured , fled lewes crown court in tears yesterday after giving evidence at the trial of her husband jeremy who absconded to france with his 15-year-old pupil . married : jeremy and emily forrest together before he allegedly ran off to france with a pupil . he said : ` she trusted him with all her vulnerabilities and he was the figure of authority and he wo n't be the first figure of authority who someone gets a crush on him and he wo n't be the last , but part of the role of a figure of authority is that you do not take advantage of it . ` you do not expect your school to invite people to have sex with your under-age daughter and you do not expect it to be the teacher . ' mr barton reminded the jury that forrest had decided not to give evidence and had not filed a statement of his defence . he continued : ` mr forrest , what is your defence ? ` you may feel this is the question he fears the most because , during his experience as a teacher , he may have heard some pretty lame excuses for homework not being done on time . upset : emily forrest , the wife of jeremy forrest , his as she left lewes crown court in east sussex yesterday . claims : forrest , pictured today , heard how friends had called him an outstanding teacher who had improved students ' grades . ` and he may think ` please , sir , i do n't . have a defence - my dog ate it ' is n't going to cut the mustard , is n't . going to stand up to scrutiny and that he had no defence at all . ` you may feel he is a maths teacher whose story does n't add up . i invite you to find him guilty as charged . ' forrest , who denies one charge of child abduction , declined to testify in his defence . judge michael lawson qc said the jury was ` open to draw inferences ' from this decision . the teacher wept as six character witnesses were read to the court from his behalf . his sister , carrie hanspaul , a mother-of-three from kent , described her brother as a doting uncle and godfather . she said : ` he 's very good-natured and extremely mild-mannered , ' adding that depression may have contributed to his recent actions . she said : ` jeremy had been in a very difficult relationship for the last six years but did n't want to worry anybody , especially our parents , with his problems . ` instead he withdrew more and more and i believe he became more and more depressed . ' ronald jaffa , defending , told the jury that forrest had gone with the girl to france because he feared she was suicidal . he said that this was a ` realistic situation ' and the defendant had acted to ensure her well-being . he said that it was not a case of romeo and juliet . the schoolgirl 's mother told lewes crown court she ` went mad ' at her daughter when she confronted her about forrest . he said : ` in that play the lovers died in the end , a pair of star-crossed lovers is the way shakespeare put it . ` fortunately jeremy chose to go to see her and go with her , what could have happened if he had not ? what would it matter if she had money or not , she could have hitch-hiked , she could have ended up in a city alone , desperate , suicidal . ' he added : ` she was very desperate , she had suicidal thoughts and she was assertive . if he had not taken her , the alternative consequences were likely to be much worse . ` if he had taken her back to her mother or the police , no-one would be able to stop her , it may indeed have been the catalyst for worse consequences . ' judge lawson adjourned the case until tomorrow when he will sum up the case before sending the jury out to consider its verdict . sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .", "summary": " jeremy forrest relying on character witnesses rather than speaking himself .   he appeared to have a black eye as he sat in court .   the prosecutor said it was not a case of ` romeo and juliet ' as they were not ` equal ' partners in what happened .   forrest 's defence said the girl was suicidal and if he had not taken her , the alternative consequences were likely to be much worse .   mrs forrest warned forrest to end contact with pupil before they fled .
