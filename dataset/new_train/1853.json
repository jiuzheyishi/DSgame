{"text": "an oxford professor who was found dead at a fellow academic 's home had suffered a mental breakdown in the last year , it was revealed . colleagues of eminent astrophysicist steven rawlings said he had been struggling with mental health problems since summer last year . they have become so bad that professor rawlings , 50 , had stepped down from his role in overseeing the team building the world 's largest radio telescope . professor rawlings had played a huge part in developing the square kilometre array -lrb- ska -rrb- - which will be able to look 13 billion years back in time to the beginnings of the universe . speaking out : professor rawlings ' widow linda -lrb- left -rrb- yesterday said she believes the death of her husband -lrb- right -rrb- was a ` tragic accident ' but he was unable to complete his project and also dropped out of his academic work at oxford university 's st peter 's college . best friend dr devinder sivia was yesterday released on bail as police downgraded the investigation into the academic 's death . mathematician dr sivia , 49 , had shared dinner at a local pub with professor rawlings on wednesday night and became increasingly concerned about his friend 's behaviour . staff at the bear hotel in wantage , oxfordshire , said frequent visitor professor rawlings was unusually subdued . former nasa worker dr sivia invited him to stay at his bungalow in southmoor , near abingdon , oxfordshire , but when they got to his home his friend apparently became increasingly agitated and apparently attacked dr sivia . in the altercation that followed , the professor collapsed on the floor from a suspected heart attack . dr sivia dialed 999 and alerted neighbours , but despite their efforts to resuscitate him he died at the scene . professor phil diamond , who had worked closely with professor rawlings on the ska scheme , told the newspaper : ` he became very withdrawn and dropped out of both his academic work and the ska . ' i was told he suffered some mental problems but i do n't know what caused them . ' i thought he was suffering from depression but he had shown no symptoms before , nor at this meeting in rome . ' held : dr devinder sivia has been bailed following the death of his colleague and best friend steven rawlings , who was found dead at the maths lecturer 's home . three decades ago : the friends circled in their first year at st john 's college , cambridge , in 1981 . professor rawlings distraught widow said last night her husband 's death was not murder . linda rawlings said : ` steve and devinder were best friends since college and i believe this is a tragic accident . ' i do not believe that steve 's death is murder and i do not believe devinder should be tarnished in this way . ' dr sivia 's brother gurdip insisted the death could only have been an unfortunate tragedy . he said of dr sivia : ` there is just no anger in him , ever . ` he would have walked away from any confrontation . he would never say boo to a goose . even if someone attacked him , i can not believe he would fight back . ' the maths lecturer was arrested on suspicion of murder but police now believe there may have been no criminal offence committed . lecturer : dr sivia worked in the maths department at st john 's college in oxford . guard : a police officer stands outside the home of dr sivia after the force launched a murder investigation into the death of professor rawlings . dr sivia , who teaches ` maths with natural sciences ' to chemistry and physics students at st john 's college in oxford , is apparently ` absolutely beside himself ' at the death of his best friend . the mathematician 's family said the two men had been close since meeting as young undergraduates at st john 's college in cambridge more than 30 years ago . his father , gurbakhsh sivia , 80 , said his son rang him from a police station after his arrest to say : ` dad , there 's been a tragedy and i 'm in police custody under suspicion . it 's being investigated but i 'm hoping it will be sorted out . ' professor rawlings and dr sivia co-wrote a book titled foundations of science mathematics , which was printed in paperback in 1999 . part of the oxford chemistry primers series , it provides explanations of mathematical principles for undergraduates studying for a wide range of science degrees . the book , available for # 13.99 , covers topics ` from basic arithmetic and algebra to calculus ' and was praised by reviewers on the internet , one of whom described it as ` brilliant ' . the reviewer added : ` i have found it so useful , as i am a physics undergraduate , for my course . ` it covers everything i need and will be useful to look back at maths i have done in the past , for future reference . mr sivia , a retired maths teacher from gravesend , kent , said the whole family was shocked . ` they were very , very good friends , inseparable friends . they were like brothers . my son is a good son and a dedicated teacher . he has very simple habits -- he never drinks , he never smokes . it 's unimaginable . ` they 've been friends ever since they studied at cambridge university together . i 've known him for 20 years . when my son was ill , steven would bring flowers and food to his house to help out . ' after hearing his son had been released , mr sivia said : ` although this is some ray of good news , it is still a tragedy as steven is not with us any more . ' the sivia family moved from punjab , india , when devinder was five . he was educated in england and studied science at cambridge , completing a first degree and phd before going to the united states to work for nasa at their space centre for three years . his brother gurdip , a warehouse worker from winson green , birmingham , said the british and australian governments both wanted him to work for them after nasa , adding : ` eventually the british government got him back and set him up in a laboratory at oxford . ' he said dr sivia was a former colleague of dr david kelly , the government weapons inspector found dead in woods near his southmoor home after he was named as the source of a report that tony blair 's government ` sexed up ' its iraq weapons dossier . ` he worked with david kelly and knew him well , ' said gurdip , 59 . ` they worked together i think and lived very near each other . ' he said his brother had never been in a serious relationship as he was ` married to his work ' . professor rawlings , a lead scientist in the world 's largest radio telescope project , lived with his wife in letcombe regis , near wantage , oxfordshire . in a statement issued by thames valley police , mrs rawlings said : ` steve was a well-loved , caring , intelligent , sensitive man . steve is a man of integrity , kindness and a very accessible person . ` steve was the love of my life and we have known each other all of these years and he has never changed , even though he has achieved so much and has all these qualities . i will miss him more than anything else in the world . ' police say a post-mortem examination proved inconclusive and further tests will be carried out over the coming weeks . detective superintendent rob mason , from the force 's major crime unit , said : ` we can confirm that the two individuals involved have been friends for over 30 years . ' i would emphasise that the police are investigating all potential circumstances that could have led to his death . ` we are mindful that ultimately the death may be a matter for a coroner 's inquest rather than a criminal court and i would ask for patience from both the media and the public while we continue our investigation .
