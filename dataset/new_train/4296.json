{"text": "the united states may be touting its strikes on isis targets in syria , but one of the terror group 's fighters says the hits are trivial at best . in an exclusive interview with cnn , a syrian isis fighter using the pseudonym abu talha said the militant group has been preparing for such attacks .  we 've been ready for this for some time ,  abu talha said .  we know that our bases are known because they 're tracking us with radars and satellites , so we had backup locations .  he taunted the u.s.-led coalition that has been pummeling isis targets in syria over the past week , including attacks on mobile oil refineries and vehicles .  we have revenues other than oil . we have other avenues , and our finances are not going to stop just because of oil losses ,  the 28-year-old militant said .  they thought they knew everything . but thank god , they do n't know anything . and god willing , we will defeat the infidels .  abu talha said he was among the isis fighters who took over mosul , iraq 's second-largest city , in june . he said even if coalition attacks impede isis , they 're not enough to stop isis ' mission of fortifying an islamic state across sunni parts of syria and iraq .  they hit us in some areas , and we advance in others ,  abu talha said .  if we are pushed back in iraq , we advance in northern syria . these strikes can not stop us , our support or our fighters .  u.s. president barack obama admitted the quick rise of isis in syria had been underrestimated at first . in an interview that aired sunday on cbs '  60 minutes ,  obama said the u.s. government  underestimated what had been taking place in syria  during its civil war -- allowing the country to become  ground zero for jihadists around the world .  isis defector speaks out . one man who recently left the ranks of isis also said the militants took precautions before coalition strikes .  they almost entirely emptied out the headquarters ,  the defector , using the name abu omar , told cnn 's arwa damon in turkey .  some equipment they hid in civilian neighborhoods . some they hid underground .  abu omar also said isis relies heavily on foreign members -- including westerners -- to carry out its mission .  the french , they have so much control -- they 're even more extreme than we are ,  the defector said .  they come from france , but it 's as if they have been part of the ` islamic state ' for years .  the 29-year-old said he believed in isis ' goal of creating an islamic state and left his wife and 3-year-old son behind to go fight . abu omar initially tried to defend the group 's atrocities -- including crucifixions , beheadings and indiscriminate killings . but eventually , the brutally became too much for him .  i used to hope that they would fix their mistakes ,  he said .  if they had , it would n't be like this .  when the united states and arab partners started pounding the isis stronghold of raqqa last week , many militants scattered . and abu omar found an opportunity to flee . but he still trembles when he talks , fearful he has a target on his back . abu omar said while he still dreams of a caliphate in the region , he is haunted by what he witnessed .  i saw a 70-year-old sheikh killed in front of me ,  he said .  the ` islamic state ' ca n't continue like this . ... there are a lot of youth who are joining -- 14 , 15 years old . maybe my voice can make them think again .
