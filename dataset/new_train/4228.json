{"text": "it 's been three years since japan was hit with its worst-ever earthquake , causing serious damage to fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant . the 9 magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami sent three of fukushima 's reactors into melt-down , shocking the world . japan , a fully industrialized country with high safety requirements , was facing a nuclear disaster of a similar scale to the deadly 1986 chernobyl accident , in soviet ukraine . as a result , many countries decided to review their energy policies . before the accident , 442 nuclear power reactors in 30 countries produced 14 % of all world 's electricity . this number dropped to just 11 % in 2012 , as 15 reactors exited service -- mainly in germany and japan . today , 435 reactors operate in 31 countries , and a further 68 are under construction . after the fukushima disaster , japan pulled back its nuclear ambitions , ordered large-scale inspections and introduced new safety regulations . all of its 48 remaining reactors have been kept offline and a proposal to restart the program awaits parliament 's approval . germany shut down eight of its oldest reactors almost immediately after fukushima , focusing instead on renewable energy , and phase-out all of its nuclear power by 2022 . switzerland adopted a similar approach when the government decided not to build any new reactors and phase out its nuclear production by 2034 . this was despite a national referendum in which a majority of people voted in favor of more reactors . but not all countries got scared . both france , which has the world 's highest share of nuclear power for its electricity production , and the u.s. , the world 's largest producer , reaffirmed their positions on the power source . both countries continue to invest heavily into safety improvements . all four  bric  countries are boosting their nuclear power production , with india aiming to supply 25 % and russia 45 % of their electricity from nuclear power by 2050 , and brazil planning to build five new reactors by 2030 . china is facing pressure to cut its pollution levels and reliance on coal . china already operates 20 reactors and aims to more than triple its nuclear capacity by 2020 . read more : the ` nuclear renaissance : ' what went wrong ? read more : five big questions about fukushima 's nuclear power mess . read more : inside fukushima damaged power plant . editor 's note : due to variations in terminology , various sources quote slightly different numbers of nuclear reactors worldwide . for the purpose of this report , cnn used world nuclear association data and considered only the reactors connected to the grid and supplying electricity to consumers as active .", "summary": " the fukushima nuclear disaster changed attitudes towards nuclear power .   germany shut down its oldest reactors and plans to phase-out nuclear by 2022 .   emerging markets are investing heavily into nuclear power .
