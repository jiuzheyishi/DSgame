{"text": "scientists have developed a synthetic ` poo ' that could cure nasty intestinal infections caused by the superbug clostridium difficile . c. diff is a toxin-producing bacteria that can multiply in the gut when healthy bacteria have been wiped out by antibiotics . it causes severe diarrhoea and other intestinal disease and can be fatal . faecal transplants may be an uncomfortable subject , but stools from healthy people have been used for some time to treat patients suffering from the hospital infection . the bacteria from a stool transplant can effectively ` reset ' the gut , allowing the body to overcome the infection . emma allen-vercoe looks at her stool substitute being created in the robogut . but while the transplants have been successful , the ` ick ' factor makes it difficult for many patients to accept them . there is also a small risk of passing on unknown pathogens from the donor that could later cause disease . now scientists from the university of guelph in canada have developed a substitute called repoopulate to replace human faecal matter . they tested it on two elderly patients with chronic c.diff infections , in a study published and also tested negative for the superbug six months later . ` it 's an exciting finding , ' said microbiologist emma allen-vercoe , who developed the treatment . interestingly , the two patients did n't see the return of c. diff despite taking further antibiotics later on for other infections . unusual experiment : the robogut at the university of guelph . clostridium difficile can overtake the guts of hospital patients . the synthetic stool is made up from . 33 different bacterial strains initially derived from a donor stool . they are purified and grown in a ` robo-gut ' , a complex system of flasks , . tubes and monitors that together mimic the environment of a large . intestine . the probiotic is prepared in a thick saline solution , which looks something like a ` vanilla milkshake ' according to allen-vercoe . this is then transplanted into patients using a colonoscopy . using synthetic poo for transplants . eliminates the risk of transmitting an infectious disease through faecal . bacteria because ` the exact composition of the bacteria administered is . known and can be controlled , ' allen-vercoe said . she added that later testing of stool samples from the two patients showed some features of the synthetic stool . had stabilised in their colons . ` in other words , the introduced microbes . were able to persist , ' allen-vercoe said . ` this is important because . most commercially available probiotics only colonise transiently .
