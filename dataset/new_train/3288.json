{"text": "when the nichol family was invited to a wedding at lake como in italy , i was rather hopeful i might catch a glimpse of the celebrity-strewn nuptials of george clooney and amal alamuddin who , at the time , were widely rumoured to be preparing to tie the knot on the shores of this most beautiful holiday destination . inexplicably , they decided to wed in venice - so my wife suzie , daughter sophie and i were able to focus fully on the equally delightful , and paparazzi-free , marriage of our close friends jo and mark . after landing at milan malpensa , and an hour 's stomach-churning car journey around the endlessly winding roads that border the lake , we arrived at lenno , a small village on the west bank of the lake , some 17 miles north of como itself . an absolute beauty : lake como , with the little town of bellagio adorning its shore , is a true italian wonder . the hotel albergo lenno occupies an enviable spot directly on the tree-lined promenade and opposite bellagio , one of the most famous and picturesque towns on the lake . our room was large , clean and comfortable with two balconies offering the most incredible views of the lake and surrounding mountains . it was a real delight to gaze out across the shimmering waters to the steepsided , verdant hillsides and watch the ferries ply their trade . a few of the more affluent tourists clearly had money to burn , so came and went by seaplane . as befits a small , family-run hotel , the albergo lenno staff were extremely friendly and efficient - small things such as printing out airline boarding passes , helping with translations and booking taxis and trains were all done with a smile . the y-shaped lake como is nearly 30 miles long and divides into two branches at bellagio . como sits on the south-western tip , lecco on the south-east . the crystal-clear waters plunge to 1,300 ft in parts , making this one of the deepest lakes in europe . a different part of italy entirely : george clooney and amal alamuddin married in venice in late september . lake como is an incredibly popular resort and , though they could easily be something of a tourist-trap in peak season , i was mightily impressed by the shoreside restaurants and bars where staff were friendly and prices reasonable . using a phrase book and pidgin italian , i managed to order up a veritable feast for dinner including fresh , crisp pizzas , large plates of delicious pasta , and wonderful bruschetta liberally dosed with garlic , basil and tomatoes . it was simple fare but very well done and staggeringly good value at just $ 49 -lrb- about # 38 -rrb- - and that included copious beer , wine and soft drinks . a boat trip around the lake took us past the luxurious villas of the rich and famous . richard branson is rumoured to own one and , apparently , another villa appeared on the x factor 's ` judges ' houses ' section of the show . the truly magnificent villa del balbianello , built for cardinal angelo maria durini at the end of the 18th century , has starred in many films including casino royale with daniel craig . standing on the tip of a steep promontory overlooking the lake , the sweeping gardens and high walls give this fabulous mansion a real air of a bond villain lair . making do with a non-celebrity wedding : the nichol family were denied a glimpse of the clooneys . sadly , the time for sightseeing was limited as we had to don our finery for the wedding . the ceremony and reception were held on the shore of the lake . bathed in sunshine , the backdrop of jagged peaks , passing boats , gleaming water and beautiful hillside villas provided a truly stunning location for such a memorable event . as the sun set over the lake , the wine flowed and the laughter and dancing became slightly more raucous . it may have been a celebrity-free wedding , but the nichol family were more than happy to have been invited and to experience the splendour and majesty of lake como . british airways -lrb- www.ba.com -rrb- offers return flights from heathrow to milan from # 110 and can arrange car hire . hotel albergo lenno -lrb- www.albergolenno.com -rrb- reopens on march 13 . double rooms cost from $ 80 -lrb- # 63 -rrb- including breakfast .", "summary": " rumours abounded that george clooney might marry next to lake como .   hollywood star married amal alamuddin in venice at the end of september .   lake como is italy 's third largest lake , after lake garda and lake maggiore .
