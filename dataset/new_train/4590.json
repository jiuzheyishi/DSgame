{"text": "pakistan is blocking access to facebook in response to an online group calling on people to draw the prophet mohammed , officials said wednesday . the pakistan telecommunication authority issued the order a day before  everybody draw mohammed day ,  scheduled by a facebook group with the same name .  obviously -lrb- the blocking of facebook -rrb- is related to the objectionable material that was placed on facebook . that is why it is blocked ,  said khoram ali mehran of the telecommunication authority .  we have blocked it for an indefinite amount of time . we are just following the government 's instructions and the ruling of the lahore high court . if the government decides to unblock it , then that 's what we will do ,  he said . the organization has not received any complaints from internet users about the blocking of facebook , he said . devout muslims consider it offensive to depict mohammed . there were riots around the world in response to a series of cartoons of mohammed in a danish newspaper in 2005 , and at least two european cartoonists live under police protection after publication of their drawings of the muslim prophet . mimi sulpovar , who started the facebook group , said she read about the idea on a blog after comedy central bleeped out part of an episode of  south park  that mentioned the prophet .  this is meant to be in protest ,  she said .  this is something i have felt strongly about for a long time : bullying by certain muslim groups will not be tolerated in a free country ,  said sulpovar , who is american . but ibrahim hooper , a spokesman for the council on american-islamic relations , said the idea behind the group was offensive .  islam discourages any visual representations of the prophets of god -- jesus , moses , mohammed , anybody -- because we believe it can lead to a form of idol worship ,  he said .  the majority of muslims worldwide object to any representation of a prophet of god ,  he said . the idea of  draw mohammad day  originated with a cartoonist who has since distanced herself from the idea , sulpovar and hooper said .  the whole campaign has been taken up by muslim-bashers and islamophobes ,  hooper said . but sulpovar denied being anti-muslim .  this extends beyond being able to draw mohammad ,  she said .  if it 's offensive to you , that 's fine , but i do n't feel it 's right to impose your belief on others through intimidation .  this is nothing to do with hate or bigotry ,  she said .  nobody is inciting violence or preaching open hatred towards individuals .  sulpovar said she is not a muslim but added that she had received  hundreds of e-mails from people trying to explain this to me .  one group member said she saw anger and fear on both sides of the controversy but felt that free speech could not be compromised .  this is a hot-topic debate , but so is abortion , illegal immigrants , gay marriage and politics . if we allow even a small compromise for one group , then the free speech on topics like abortion , illegal immigrants and politics can also be censored based on accusations that they cause violence or hate ,  autumn meadows said on cnn 's ireport .  hate speech is wanting a group eradicated , physically harmed or dead . i dont think drawing mohammed falls under that category ,  she said .  islam is not above criticism or cartoons . i believe in equality , and censoring mohammed while we can draw every other . figure in the world does not equal equality ,  she concluded . sulpovar said pakistan 's decision to block facebook was  ridiculous .  facebook is investigating the block , said debbie frost , the company 's director of global communications . sulpovar 's group and a similar one had attracted about 7,000 fans between them wednesday . groups opposing the idea had about 68,000 . cnn 's reza sayah contributed to this report .", "summary": " new :  bullying ... will not be tolerated in a free country ,  group founder says .   new : council on islamic-american relations calls idea offensive .   ban prompted by calls for users to draw pictures of the prophet mohammed .    draw mohammed day  was being organized by online group .
