{"text": "bacary sagna confirms he is leaving arsenal - click here to read . another year gone , and another arsenal first-team player has opted for pastures new . but unlike robin van persie two years ago , bacary sagna should not be subject to abuse . the right back announced on thursday that it was a certainty he will be leaving this summer , declining the club 's final three-year contract offer of # 80,000-a-week . and even though sagna looks to be joining a host of former gunners at manchester city , it 's hard to blame a player who has been a loyal servant at the emirates stadium . video scroll down to watch sagna show off impressive skills with french team-mate sakho . time to go : bacary sagna has confirmed he will leave arsenal in the summer . silver lining : sagna ended his arsenal career by winning the fa cup . the france defender was signed for # 7.5 million in 2006 , and has fought admirably during a eight-year stint which has provided little success . signing on with the hope of joining thierry henry , patrick vieira and robert pires as les bleus who lifted multiple trophies in north london , a fourth-place finish and limited european joy was the new realistic target . in the midst of the lowest lows , sagna was always one who would roll his sleeves up , never give in and urge team-mates to pick themselves up . it 's no wonder arsene wenger was so keen to break his ` no long contract for over-30s ' rule to keep one of his most consistent performers . sportsmail understands a # 150,000-a-week deal with city has been lined up , leading to many arsenal fans to criticise sagna for ` showing no respect ' and taking one final pay check . but after eight years of being heralded as one of the best full backs in the league with barely anything in the shape of trophies to back that up , is it not just one final challenge for a player still at his peak ? put simply , if it was about moving for silverware -lrb- as samir nasri justifies his move to manchester city -rrb- right now is not the time to do it . leaving under a cloud : samir nasri left arsenal for manchester city . all worth it : nasri has won two premier league titles since his move to city . ` anything we win here will come from the . heart and that 's what i want . ` it 's my dream and i see no point in . speaking about other teams when i have these dreams . ' i think other . people know that about me ; i 'm just hungry to win with arsenal and . that 's it . ' sagna 's reaction at the end of that fa cup final win , nine years after their last triumph , said it all . success is all he wanted at a club he obviously loves , and now he 's got that , why not let him respond to other club 's advances ? he , and the fans , have got what they wanted . after one of his finest seasons in an arsenal shirt battling back from injury , it 's the least sagna deserves . this stance was not applicable to robin van persie , nasri and emmanuel adebayor 's exits , though . van persie , back in 2011 , said : ` i 'm sure i could win things at another team in another country , but would it feel like our trophy , my trophy ? i 'm not sure it would . ` anything we win here will come from the heart and that 's what i want . it 's my dream and i see no point in speaking about other teams when i have these dreams . i think other people know that about me ; i 'm just hungry to win with arsenal and that 's it . ' those quotes - along with the pictures of van persie surrounded by arsenal bedsheets and posters as a youngster - were music to fans ' ears at the time , but now seem fake and twisted . the club stuck by the dutchman through countless seasons as he struggled with various knocks , but after one-and-a-half injury-free seasons scoring goals he had made his decision . a move to manchester united followed , and van persie even went on to write an open letter to arsenal criticising their ambition . the respect was long gone after that . time to go : robin van persie left arsenal after questioning their ambition . landing the big one : van persie won the premier league in his first season . nasri had the chance to be the ` next cesc fabregas ' after the spaniard left for his boyhood club barcelona -lrb- something he always admitted he was planning to do -rrb- . nasri could have been the hero of a side in need of one , he could have repaid wenger for putting trust in him at such a young age . he has been accused of taking the ` easy way out ' of arsenal , quitting as soon as some sort of crisis became apparent , and as soon as a suitable club threw money at him . the departure of adebayor - along with kolo toure and gael clichy - was n't so critical on the pitch , but the togolese angered fans with his attitude -lrb- and not least for sprinting the length of the pitch to celebrate a goal for manchester city against arsenal back in 2009 -rrb- . he constantly flirted with ac milan , and in fact wenger was fortunate to pocket # 25m for the striker . on his way : emmanuel adebayor left arsenal to join manchester city . bad move : adebayor celebrates scoring for city in front of the arsenal fans . all this is in such contrast to sagna , who was humble about his exit . take his quotes in l'equipe : ` it was an honour to grow in the shirt , ' he said . ` arsenal is a club that brought me a lot , both as a person and as a sportsman . even though we had been criticised for quite some time due to the lack of trophies , i spent some magical moments -lrb- at arsenal -rrb- . if i had to do , i 'd do it again . ' out of all that , his admission that he would do it again really stands out . at 31 years of age , the time is right for sagna to bow out , and arsenal can look for a younger , and perhaps cheaper alternative . serge aurier , calum chambers and atsito uchida have been linked with a move , but they will find it hard to match sagna 's ability , not least his dedication . the time is right for a thanks , and good luck .", "summary": " sagna announced on thursday that he will be leaving arsenal .   france defender signed for # 7.5 m in 2006 .   sagna has reportedly lined up a deal at manchester city .   arsenal will now look for a younger , cheaper option at right back .
