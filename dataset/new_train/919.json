' mr miliband said the british nhs was . the ` envy of the world ' but the prime minister had not been ` straight ' with the public over his plans . he added : ` if he does n't drop the . bill , i will make it a defining issue in the next general election . because i think these plans are dangerous . ` we are going to take this fight right up to the next election . ' it was also claimed today that mps may not debate the government 's controversial health reforms on the floor of the commons despite an e-petition calling for them to be scrapped reaching 140,000 signatures . under the government 's scheme , many . signatories hope that by putting their name to an e-petition they can . force mps to debate the issue in the house of commons . but . labour mp natascha engel , chairwoman of the backbench business . committee , said the amount of time allocated by the government meant it . was increasingly difficult to schedule debates on contentious issues . such as nhs reform . concerned : ed miliband , right , and shadow health secretary andy burnham , left , meet steven lowe and his son lincoln , 4 , during the visit to the royal bolton hospital . a number of rebel liberal democrats or dissenting tory mps would also have to back the drop the health bill petition as her committee can only schedule debates with cross-party support , she said . ms engel said she had ` big concerns ' there would not be enough time to schedule a debate in the commons . she said : ` we have loads of different debates waiting for allocation . the migration watch debate still has n't been scheduled . ` it 's such a contentious issue and it 's against the government 's position and it 's the government that allocates us time , so there is definitely a conflict of interests . ' accusations : during his visit today , ed miliband said mr cameron , pictured , had broken ` solemn promises ' at the last election to protect the nhs . the government 's website states any petition reaching 100,000 signatures ` could be debated ' in the house of commons , but this is not guaranteed . the procedure committee has said all e-petitions reaching six figures will trigger a hearing at least in westminster hall , a much smaller annexe where mps can hold debates which do not require a vote . the bill has also attracted opposition from health professionals and patients ' groups , while there have been reports of deep unease among tory cabinet ministers and even number 10 insiders about the legislation . on monday , downing street dismissed suggestions that its author , andrew lansley , should be sacked as health secretary and insisted ministers were ` fully behind ' the reforms . mr cameron is expected shortly to launch a new offensive to ` sell ' the bill to the public , saying at the weekend that he was ` at one ' with mr lansley . today , health minister simon burns hit back at mr miliband 's claims the tories had reneged on their pre-election promises . he said : ` ed miliband can talk the nhs down all he likes , but the truth is that services are getting better all the time - with shorter waits since the election , 820,000 more people able to access an nhs dentist , 15,000 fewer administrators , 4,000 more doctors and 600 more midwives . ` our plans deliver control for patients , power for doctors and nurses , and less bureaucracy . labour still have no plan to help our nhs meet the challenges of the future . their approach is simply one of cynical opportunism .
