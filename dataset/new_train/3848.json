{"text": "mps are to spend just two and a half days a week in parliament after michael gove told them they were not likely to be needed on thursdays . the government chief whip has informed tory mps that there will be no major legislation on thursday afternoons for the foreseeable future . it means they will arrive in westminster on monday lunchtime and could leave on wednesday afternoons . scroll down for video . chief whip michael gove has told tory mps that thursdays will be one-line whips , which means there will be no major legislation or debates . the house of commons has all but ground to a halt in recent months , with almost no legislation to debate . the coalition has reached a logjam , with the tories and lib dems unable to agree on major new laws with six months until the election . this week saw the final stages of the childcare payments bill debated on monday and the small business , enterprise and employment bill passed last night . but today the government has given labour time to force a vote on the european arrest warrant . tomorrow is given over to backbench business on ` money creation and society ' and ` devolution and the union ' . mr gove has sent an email to tory mps making clear that in future all thursdays will be a one-line whip -- meaning that are not required to attend . the commons was almost empty during a debate on iran on thursday november 6 . the scene is likely to be repeated in the coming weeks . david cameron suffered a humiliating first defeat on a coalition bill today after more than 40 mps rebelled in a vote to help pubs buy cheaper beer . the government had opposed plans to make it easier for pubs to purchase drinks from different brewers , but ministers were left embarrassed after they failed to head-off the backbench rebellion . chief whip michael gove faced shouts of ` resign ' and ` well done , chief whip ' , after 17 conservatives and 24 liberal democrats voted against the coalition government in its first legislative defeat since 2010 . the rebellion was particularly embarrassing for lib dem business minister jo swinson , who had spoken for the government during the debate , after the rebels included her husband duncan hames . matt hancock , who was one of the ministers responsible for the bill , was reportedly seen ` grovelling ' to the prime minister after the vote . some of the absent mps are thought to have been campaigning ahead of the rochester and strood by-election . departmental questions are held on thursday mornings , so some mps will be present . and others will be in westminster for thursday afternoon debates or meetings . but many will be able to return to their constituencies to work , and campaign for re-election in may next year . one tory mp said : ` michael was saying that thursdays are generally a one-line whip . he was emphasising as part of a bigger memo that they are likely to remain one-line whips . ' with no crunch votes to stay for , labour and liberal democrat mps are also likely to depart from westminster to return home to campaign for votes . a conservative spokesman said : ` as advice to conservative mps made explicitly clear , if there is a three line whip then mps will be required to be in parliament , just as has always been the case . ` and just as has always been the case , if there is not a three line whip , they are free to choose whether to work in their constituencies instead . ' despite running out of major legislation , the coalition will go on until may because of a law passed in 2010 creating fixed-term parliaments of five years . it was imposed to prevent the sudden collapse of the power-sharing deal between the tories and lib dems . but critics say it means the government has run out of steam and will limp on for months . deputy pm nick clegg yesterday defended the move . he told mps : ` we have legislated for a fixed-term parliament . ` that is an important constitutional innovation . i personally think that coalition governments of different compositions are more likely in future . ` that is why , among many other reasons , it is important that we do what we say and see through this parliament from end to end until may 2015 . '", "summary": " chief whip michael gove tells mps there will be no big votes on thursdays .   only a ` one-line whip ' for the foreseeable future so they can leave early .   coalition deadlock means there is no major legislation to debate .   fixed-term parliament means government will limp on until may 2015 .
