{"text": "the son of an artist at the centre of a row over a school mural featuring a golliwog last night insisted his father was ` no racist . ' but henry westwater said he could understand why the image , which sparked an on-going police investigation , was controversial -- and would have no objection if it was replaced . it was reported yesterday that a complaint about the 1930s painting - by rh westwater - had been logged by police scotland as a ` hate incident ' . the mural , which was painted in 1936 by rh westwater and features scenes from alice in wonderland across nine panels , features a golliwog . visiting parent margaret rocha , 43 , who is herself black , made an official complaint after touring wardie primary school in north edinburgh with her son who was at that time a prospective pupil . the image is contained in a mural , based on alice in wonderland , which was lovingly restored two years ago and now takes pride of place in the school 's assembly hall . last night henry westwater , 74 , of tain , inverness-shire , said golliwogs had once been common , though he could understand why the image had proved offensive . but he suggested treating the situation as a ` hate incident ' may be a flawed approach and said that while he would not want part of the mural to be ` hacked out ' , he could understand why some would want the golliwog image to be removed . mr westwater said : ` it was painted in 1936 , when people 's perception of things was somewhat different . ` i remember that i had a golliwog when i was a small boy ; many children did . they used to be popular . for this woman , her response to that image was obviously compelling and overwhelming . ` i saw photographs of the mural when it was restored , and i dug out my copy of alice in wonderland . ` my neighbour , for some reason , had collected 12 copies of alice in wonderland in different editions , and of course there was no golliwog in any of them . council bosses have resisted pressure to remove or cover up the artwork at the school in the north of the city - but have introduced extra anti-racism lessons . ` it may be he felt the fantasy element of the story gave him some licence to create a new character . ` but my father did n't have any views at all on other races , and he was certainly no racist . ' he added : ` i can see why it could be a bit offensive -- i did n't give our children or grandchildren golliwogs . ` this woman has every right to complain . but this painting is from another time . ` i would not wish to criticise the police , as i understand the legislation is framed in such a way that they are obliged to investigate complaints and i would n't want to presume to lecture the council 's education department . ` but for a  hate incident  , there has to be a  hater  - and that seems to be something missing from this case - while the artist -lsb- who died in 1962 -rsb- is long-dead . ' scottish artist robert heriot westwater , who painted a mural depicting alice in wonderland at wardie primary school in edinburgh in the 1930s . he added : ` i would n't like the mural to have a bit of it hacked out , but if someone feels strongly enough that it should be painted out , and replaced with something else , that would be okay . ' fife-born robert heriot westwater , who was born in 1905 , was responsible for well-known portraits of poet hugh macdiarmid and sir compton mackenzie , who wrote the comic novel whisky galore , later turned into a hit ealing comedy movie . last night police scotland said mrs rocha 's complaint was still being considered . mrs rocha was astonished to find the mural , which features scenes from alice in wonderland across nine panels . it was restored in 2011 with a # 17,600 grant from the heritage lottery fund -lrb- hlf -rrb- . mrs rocha , who said she would now find a different school for her son , said she found the image ` deeply offensive ' and struggled to believe the recent restoration had been be allowed . she said : ` i raised it with the headteacher and she shrugged her shoulders and did n't seem to think it was an issue . ` it 's an inappropriate image for a primary school hall . it 's one thing if it was a museum piece or an exhibition , where you might explain what a swastika was or ku klux klan outfit . ` it goes back to the american black sambo - the blacked-up face . ' in the mural , the golliwog is sitting on an alcove ledge above the alice in wonderland figure in the mural 's central panel . the mural and wardie school 's distinctive architecture are well-known in academic circles . colin mclean , head of hlf scotland , has contacted the school over the future of the artwork , with further discussions likely to take place later this week . last night the city of edinburgh council reiterated its position -- that it will not consider covering up the image . but officials have said they will now use additional teaching packs from show racism the red card campaign at the school . a council spokesman insisted the council and school took diversity and anti-racism extremely seriously .", "summary": " henry westwater said he understands why the image was controversial .   a complaint was made to police about the 1930s painting by rh westwater .   margaret rocha made an official complaint when she toured wardie primary school in north edinburgh with her son .   her son at the time was a prospective student .   image is in a mural based on alice in wonderland restored two years ago .
