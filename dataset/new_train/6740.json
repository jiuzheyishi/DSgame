' lancaster justified burns ' selection ahead of danny cipriani by suggesting that he had begun to climb out of his slump towards the end of the season . burns . agreed , adding : ` i feel confident now . in the last few games for . gloucester i was getting back to myself . in this environment , where . everyone knows their roles , i feel back to my confident self . prepared : new zealand became the first team in the professional era to complete an unbeaten season in 2013 . unbeaten : the all blacks failed to lose last year , winning 14 of their test matches in 2013 . bandaged : brodie retallick passes the ball during their training session at trusts stadium in new zealand . ` a big weight is off my shoulders . last season has been put to bed . ` i see myself as a player who thrives in the big games and big atmospheres . if i miss the first kick -- which i wo n't -- i 'll have to move on and deal with it . i am more mentally strong now . ' he will also have to be physically strong , especially when the all blacks ' monster centre , ma'a nonu , is rampaging around the midfield . burns expects plenty of traffic coming his way and added : ` i am sure to be targeted , but that is a gauntlet i have to relish . ' after a gaffe earlier in the week from new zealand lock brodie retallick , who could n't name a single england player and referred to courtney lawes as ` michael ' , the all blacks were at pains to avoid dishing up more motivation to their rivals yesterday . one by one , the home players made diplomatic noises about their depleted opponents . ` england are one of the best teams in the world , ' said full back israel dagg . ` i 'm sure whoever is playing will do a good job . it 's not going to be easy . ' wing ben smith was similarly wary , adding : ` england have shown they 've got a lot of depth . a lot of the guys playing for them this weekend have played in the last 12 months and they will have a lot of motivation . ' focused : new zealand refuse to fall for the ` poor england side ' front and expect a tough match . roar : sam whitelock -lrb- right -rrb- pushing himself to the limit with his ` confident ' new zealand team-mates . stretch : new zealand look determined to extend their unbeaten run at eden park on saturday . lock sam whitelock suggested that the big visiting pack could cause problems . ` if we do n't front up , we will be embarrassed , ' he said . and scrum-half aaron smith insisted the stereotyping of england in these parts as one-dimensional no longer applies . ` they play a good brand of rugby now , ' he said . ` england scored a lot of good tries during the six nations . they are a big animal and we have to show them respect . ' sadly , english hopes of an upset have been shattered . lancaster 's squad have sufficient fortitude to make a game of it but , ultimately , the gulf in experience and quality will be too great . if they can take the all blacks to the edge then next week -- when reinforcements are ready -- the ordeal could become an opportunity after all . tony woodcock v david wilson . the all blacks loosehead is a test veteran with 107 caps . the 33-year-old started all seven matches when new zealand won the world cup in 2011 , scoring the crucial try in the final . he is a potent scrummager ; a wily prop as well as a sturdy one . wilson must resist woodcock 's attempts to undermine england 's set-piece at the end of a season of considerable personal success . the giant bath tighthead has responded well when deputising for the injured dan cole , but he was under the cosh in a scrum contest with alex corbisiero during his club 's recent defeat to northampton in the amlin challenge cup final . richie mccaw v chris robshaw . this is the clash of the captains , who lead their respective sides as opposing openside flankers . mccaw is the master of his craft -- a legend of the modern era who has been named world player of the year a record three times . he is a renowned breakdown menace who attracts grudging admiration for his ability to keep referees onside while bending the laws to his will . robshaw has become widely admired as england skipper and is an energetic , influential and increasingly dynamic figure , but he is not known as a poacher of turn-overs . he must resist the black tide in the rucks , but will count on assistance from the likes of james haskell and joe launchbury . ma'a nonu v manu tuilagi . these wrecking-ball centres are not in direct opposition , as nonu will wear 12 for the all blacks and tuilagi is at 13 for england , but they have similar roles . both will be charged with generating space and front-foot attacking possession by blasting holes in the opposition defensive line . nonu is a fearsome runner who has added layers of guile and artistry to his game . tuilagi will serve as england 's attacking fulcrum and primary weapon . he is still developing the distribution range and awareness of his rival , but the strapping tiger is an explosive force of nature in midfield , as new zealand discovered to their cost at twickenham in 2012 .", "summary": " new zealand are unbeaten at auckland 's eden park since 1994 .   england are bidding to break that record with an understrength squad .   opening match against the all blacks will be the toughest test for stuart lancaster 's side .   fly half freddie burns says he will relish his opportunity in the starting xv .
