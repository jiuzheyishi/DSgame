{"text": "the world 's oldest tumour has been discovered in the rib of a neanderthal who lived around 130,000 years ago . scientists at the university of kansas took x-rays of the inch-long rib fragments - first found in the krapina rock shelters of croatia - and discovered parts of the inner bone were missing . following ct scans the scientists discovered that this was likely to have been caused by soft-tissue tumour known in modern-day patients as fibrous dysplasia . scans found that a small part of the inner bone network was missing and had been ` eaten away ' by a soft-tissue tumour . this condition is called fibrous dysplasia . fibrous dysplasia is an abnormal bone growth where normal bone is replaced with soft fibrous bone tissue . it can cause abnormal growth or . swelling of the bone . although it can occur in any part of the . skeleton the soft tumours are most commonly found in the skull , thigh , shin , ribs , upper . arm and pelvis . fibrous dysplasia is not cancerous but is rare and there is no known cure . the disorder is usually diagnosed in childhood or early adulthood . males and females of any race are equally affected . the bones studied by kansas university anthropologist david frayer and his team were first excavated more than 100 years ago in croatia . the site , known as the krapina rock shelter , in the north of the country held more than 900 neanderthal bones dating back from between 120,000 and 130,000 years ago . frayer wanted to scan the bones because many of them showed signs of trauma and marks that happened after the neanderthal had died . many of the 900 neanderthal bones found in croatia had evidence of trauma or possible bite marks . this scan taken during the 1980s by researchers in pennsylvania has a white area of overexposure which was the first evidence that a tumour had ` eaten away ' the bone . the detailed scans show exactly where the bone has been ` eaten away ' these marks suggest either cannibalism or burial rituals . researchers . from the university of pennsylvania took x-rays of the bones during the . 1980s and published a book containing all the radiographs . one of the inch-long rib fragments was shown to have sections of bone that were ` burned out ' in the x-ray images . ` burned out ' sections of x-rays suggest over exposure , and in the rib bones this overexposure was caused by missing bone in the inner part of the fragment . frayer used these images as a guide to take new , higher-resolution x-rays of the specimens . his team also scanned the bones using high-resolution microct scanners that doctors currently use on modern-day patients . the microct scan found that the ` spongy bone ' which should be on the inner part of the fragment was missing and may have been ` eaten away ' by a soft-tissue tumour . this type of tumour is seen in modern-day patients and is called fibrous dysplasia . fibrous dysplasia is an abnormal bone growth where normal bone is replaced with fibrous bone tissue . it can cause abnormal growth or swelling of the bone and although it can occur in any part of the skeleton , it is most commonly found in the skull , thigh , shin , ribs , upper arm and pelvis . fibrous dysplasia is not cancerous but is rare and there is no known cure . frayer reported the findings in the journal plos one . he told livescience : ` people . of that time did n't live as long as they did today ; plus , there were n't . very many of them compared to the egyptians and people today . ` finding evidence of tumors and evidence of cancers , is - . i do n't know if i want to say  lucky  - but there is n't a lot of . evidence for it . ' it was previously thought that climate change and a reduction in tree cover forced early man to stand up , but now experts believe the rocky african landscape played a far more significant role . describing the type of tumour that was found , frayer added : ` they range all the way from being totally benign , where you would n't . recognize them , to being extremely painful . ` the size . of this one , and the bulging of it , probably caused the individual . pain . ' previously the earliest known tumours were found in egyptian mummies dating back 4,000 years so this discovery predates this find significantly . a study released earlier this month discovered that neanderthals lost out to homo sapiens in the battle to survive because they were not clever enough to adapt . the . results showed that . modern man walked the planet much earlier than was believed and neanderthals died out much sooner than was estimated . neanderthals had larger eyes than homo sapiens but did not develop brain power in the same way . this meant that homo sapiens were able to outsmart and ultimately outlive neanderthals who had to use their brains more for physical rather than mental needs . neanderthals breastfed their babies for over a year - just like humans , according to new research . chemical . analysis of a neanderthal child 's tooth reveal it was reared on . mother 's milk for seven months with suckling continuing for the same . period coupled with solid food . the . change from breastfeeding to plants and grains can be established compound to calcium - in teeth enamel . this . enabled dr manish arora and colleagues at mount sinai school of . medicine in new york to discover the early life diet of a 10 to 12 . year-old child that lived in a cave in belgium around 100,000 years ago . the . brains of neanderthals were the same size as those of modern man but . more of it was used to focus on the physical needs of their larger . bodies . researchers from the university of york additionally found that early man began to walk on two feet because of rocky terrain and not climate change . the study found that our upright gait may . have its origins in the rugged landscape of east and south africa which . was shaped during the pliocene epoch by volcanoes and shifting tectonic . plates . hominins , human 's early ancestors , would . have been attracted to the terrain of rocky outcrops and gorges because . it offered shelter and opportunities to trap prey . but it also required . more upright scrambling and climbing gaits , prompting the emergence of . bipedalism .", "summary": " rib is up to 130,000 years old and was found in a cave in krapina , croatia .   scientists scanned the bone and found evidence of a soft-tissue tumour .   the earliest tumours previously discovered were found in 4,000-year-old egyptian mummies .
