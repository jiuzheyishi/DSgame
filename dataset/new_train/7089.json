{"text": "the top-ten beer-drinking states in the united states has been revealed - with new hampshire top of the beer-guzzlers . more than six billion gallons of the golden nectar were sold across all the states in 2011 , but there is a huge contrast between each states , with some states , such as connecticut , seeing as little as 21.8 gallons drank per person in 2011 . meanwhile , in new hampshire , north dakota and montana , more than 40 gallons are drunk per person . for anyone worried that the nation may be drowning in inebriation , they can rest assured that overall consumption is down , with figures from the beer institute showing that americans are drinking an average of 7.5 per cent less beer since 2003 . beer nation : 43 gallons of beer was consumed in new hampshire for each resident of the state , while connecticut was the most sober with just 23 gallons per resident . 10 . delaware9 . nebraska8 . texas7 . vermont6 . wisconsin5 . nevada4 . south dakota3 . montana2 . north dakota1 . new hampshire . scroll down for more information on each state . beer-drinking has fallen for the last three years in the u.s. -

the figures are based on the number of people living in each state aged over 21 . but it does not necessarily take into account each state 's unique properties - for instance , new hampshire 's alcohol taxes are about five or six per cent lower than their nearest neighbours . so it is not uncommon for residents from massachusetts , vermont , and maine to cross over the borders to pick up their alcohol intake - inflating new hampshire 's ratings . other quirks in local legislation also play a role - there are still states which do not allow alcohol sales on a sunday . meanwhile , all the states in the top 10 allow alcohol sales in gas stations and convenience stores , again making casual purchases or purchases from out-of-state visitors easier . pick your choice : beer taps in a georgetown bar . however there does seem to be a correlation between high amounts of beer purchased and the rates of beer drinking . a separate 2011 survey studied beer drinking across the entire u.s. , and 24/7 reports that the ten states with the highest number of beer sales were among the top states for binge drinking . around 18 per cent of new hampshire residents were classed as binge-drinkers -
