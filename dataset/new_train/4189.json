{"text": "washington when the nation 's capital was turned upside down friday with the announcement that justice john paul stevens was retiring after 40 years on the federal bench , he was miles away from the political circus -- literally and figuratively . the 89-year-old justice was quietly working on his caseload at his fort lauderdale , florida , condo , a second home that serves as his occasional refuge from the high-pressure atmosphere of the u.s. supreme court . it is doubtful his replacement will soon find any sanctuary in what could be a protracted fight over the shaky ideological balance of a mostly conservative high court . the 112th justice , by most measures , will have a tough act to follow , as he or she seeks to navigate the complex dynamics of a divided bench and gain a measure of the level of influence stevens enjoyed for the past two decades and more .  he is undoubtedly a leader on the court ,  said diane amann , a former stevens law clerk who is writing a book about him . names added to supreme court short list . she predicted president obama will replace a liberal with a liberal ,  and although the vote change -lsb- on a 5-4 conservative majority -rsb- may not alter very much in the short run , the absence of justice stevens ' leadership , his ability to build coalitions along people with very different ideas about things , will be something that will be hard to replace in the short term .  short-term considerations drive much of the politics over who the nominee will and should be . progressives worry obama may not get another high court pick and urge him to name a forceful advocate for the left .  the president now has an opportunity to name a worthy successor who will stand up for equal justice for all , not just the wealthy or powerful ,  said nan aron , president of alliance for justice , which describes itself as a national organization dedicated to advancing justice and democracy . the most important number at the court . the late liberal lion , justice william brennan , was noted for saying the most important number at the court was five , the votes need to command a majority on the nine-member bench . such practical concerns also figure in the white house calculus over whether their nominee will pass senate muster without fear of a filibuster .  the court needs a consensus-builder just as much as it needs a progressive firebrand ,  said doug kendall , president of the liberal constitutional accountability center , which describes itself as a  think tank , law firm and action center dedicated to fulfilling the progressive promise of our constitution 's text and history .   president obama 's next nominee needs to improve upon -lsb- justice sonia -rsb- sotomayor 's performance by articulating the differences between judicial conservatives and progressives and focusing on how the constitution and the law itself point in a progressive direction .  administration officials quietly acknowledge the desire to excite liberals in an election year with an outspoken judge willing to take on the right . they also know obama has his own liberal , but restrained . view of constitutional interpretation . most of his federal judicial nominees thus far have been noncontroversial , center-left candidates . many liberal activists say the president may be inclined to go the same route , choosing a nominee who will be spared a bruising confirmation . for their part , many conservative activists would not mind a fight , and their early rhetoric suggests they anticipate one . the judicial crisis network , a conservative advocacy group , warned obama against  packing the supreme court with rubber stamps instead of judges . to an activist judge , the constitution represents an inconvenient truth that they will distort , ignore , or defy to push their radical liberal agenda .  grudging acknowledgement . some conservative groups grudgingly acknowledge stevens ' influence and his ability to pull conservatives like anthony kennedy and sandra day o'connor onto his side in hot button-cases . when the chief justice is on the losing side of a case , stevens -- as senior associate justice -- gets to assign who writes the all-important opinion . that opinion becomes the voice of the court , whence its strength and influence derive . o'connor , for example , supported the liberal bloc in upholding affirmative action for college admissions in 2003 and was rewarded by being selected to articulate her view of the necessity , but also the limits , of diversity in school selection . that same year , kennedy joined four liberal justices in striking down state laws that banned homosexual sodomy and wrote a forceful opinion . he also issued landmark rulings against applying the death penalty for juvenile killers and those sentenced to die for non-homicides . stevens ' willingness to put aside ego and to rule narrowly on hot-button cases -- combined with an unmatched cordiality and kindness -- earned him quiet power and respect .  the distinctive thing about justice stevens that 's going to be hardest to replace is his attention to the individual case and his willingness to decide it in a way that really is n't determined by ideology ,  said christopher eisgruber , a former stevens law clerk and author of  the next justice : repairing the supreme court appointments process .   his intelligence , of course , has made him a very important contributor to that , but i think it 's really that distinctiveness to his approach that will be toughest to replace .  in some ways , the nomination of sotomayor last year represented perfect timing in a perfect political climate -- a president still in the glow of his first months on the job and the political desire to name a woman and a latino that put other liberal constituencies at bay . she was a candidate with a sterling resume who deftly maneuvered her way to confirmation . this time will be different , when the options are wider . some advocacy groups have weighed in . groups already weighing in .  we call on president obama to nominate a woman to fill this seat ,  said national organization for women president terry o'neill .  the supreme court is out of balance , with women making up a mere 22 percent of the bench . that 's simply not enough .  who else has a stake ? should obama : . -- name a non-judge or politician ? how about michigan gov. jennifer granholm or massachusetts gov. deval patrick ? sens. amy klobuchar , d-minnesota , and claire mckaskill , d-missouri , are frequently mentioned . and supporters of secretary of state hillary clinton sing her praises , though the white house monday tempered that talk by saying the president wanted her in her current job . -- how about an articulate academic ? stanford law school professors pamela karlan and kathleen sullivan have earned progressive praise . -- there are no asian-americans on the high court , or the federal appeals courts for that matter . harold koh , formerly dean at yale law school and now a top state department lawyer is a korean-american who would represent another history-making choice .  the president does n't seem to have the perfect-storm candidate this time that he did with sonia sotomayor ,  said thomas goldstein , a top washington attorney and founder of scotusblog.com .  there 's a delicate balance here . i think he 's likely to appoint somebody who 's more on the center left , someone like sonia sotomayor who the president believes really shares his values as a judge , but does n't generate the kind of political heat that would disrupt politics over the summer .  meanwhile , stevens remains his usual apolitical self , detached from the political storm . as usual , he 'll find time for his twice weekly tennis matches with his daughter . he returns to the bench next week for oral arguments , then will finish writing his remaining opinions . in two and a half months he will be gone from the court , but not forgotten .", "summary": " cnn 's bill mears says president obama has tough choice to make .   retiring justice john paul stevens had earned grudging respect from the right .   obama must balance competing pressures from liberals , conservatives , mears says .   mears : this supreme court nominee likely faces choppier water than sonia sotomayor did .
