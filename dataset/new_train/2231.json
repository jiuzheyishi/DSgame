{"text": "fannie mae said it will set aside the loan of a woman who shot herself as sheriff 's deputies tried to evict her from her foreclosed home . fannie mae foreclosed on the akron , ohio , home of addie polk , 90 , after acquiring the mortgage in 2007 . addie polk , 90 , of akron , ohio , became a symbol of the nation 's home mortgage crisis when she was hospitalized after shooting herself at least twice in the upper body wednesday afternoon . on friday , fannie mae spokesman brian faith said the mortgage association had decided to halt action against polk and sign the property  outright  to her .  we 're going to forgive whatever outstanding balance she had on the loan and give her the house ,  faith said .  given the circumstances , we think it 's appropriate .  residents of akron have rallied behind polk , who is being treated at akron general medical center . she was listed in critical condition friday afternoon , according to akron city council president marco sommerville . u.s. rep. dennis kucinich , d-ohio , mentioned polk on the house floor friday during debate over the latest economic rescue proposal .  this bill does nothing for the addie polks of the world ,  kucinich said after telling her story .  this bill fails to address the fact that millions of homeowners are facing foreclosure , are facing the loss of their home . this bill will take care of wall street , and the market may go up for a few days , but democracy is going downhill .  neighbor robert dillon , 62 , used a ladder to enter a second-story bathroom window of polk 's home after he and the deputies heard loud noises inside , dillon said .  i was calling her name as i went in , and she was n't responding ,  he said . he found her lying on a bed , and he could see she was breathing . he also noticed a long-barreled handgun on the bed , but thought she just had it there for protection . he touched her on the shoulder .  then she kind of moved toward me a little and i saw that blood , and i said , ` oh , no . miss polk musta done shot herself , '  dillon said . he hurried downstairs and let the deputies in . he said they told him they found polk 's car keys , pocketbook and life insurance policy laid out neatly where they could be found , suggesting that she intended to kill herself .  there 's a lot of people like miss polk right now . that 's the sad thing about it ,  said sommerville , who had met polk before and rushed to the scene when contacted by police .  they might not be as old as her , some could be as old as her . this is just a major problem .  watch polk 's neighbor describe what he saw  in 2004 , polk took out a 30-year , 6.375 percent mortgage for $ 45,620 with a countrywide home loan office in cuyahoga falls , ohio . the same day , she also took out an $ 11,380 line of credit . over the next couple of years , polk missed payments on the 101-year-old home that she and her late husband purchased in 1970 . in 2007 , fannie mae assumed the mortgage and later filed for foreclosure . deputies had tried to serve polk 's eviction notice more than 30 times before wednesday 's incident , sommerville said . she never came to the door , but the notes the deputies left would always disappear , so they knew she was inside and ambulatory , he said . the city is creating programs to help people keep their homes , sommerville said .  but what do you do when there 's just so many people out there and the economy is in the shape that it 's in ?  many businesses and individuals have called since wednesday offering to help polk , sommerville said .  we 're going to do an evaluation to see what 's best for her ,  he said .  if she 's strong enough and can go home , i think we should work with her to where she goes back home . if not , we need to find another place for her to live where she wo n't have to worry about this ever again .  for his part , dillon hopes his neighbor of 38 years can return to her home .  she loves that house ,  he said .  i hope they can get her back in . that would make me feel better because i do n't know what they 're going to put in there once she leaves .  he said the neighborhood is declining because so many people have lost their homes .  there 's a lot of vacant houses around here . ... now i 'm going to have a house on my left and a house on my right , vacant ,  he said .  that do n't make me feel good , because we were good neighbors , we trusted each other , and we looked out for each other .  this neighborhood is shot , to me , from what it used to be ,  he added .  when i moved here , if it were like it is now , i would have never moved here . but it was a nice neighborhood . ...  i 'll just tough it out . i 'm too old to start thinking about buying another house .  sommerville said that by the time people call for help with an impending foreclosure , it 's usually too late .  i 'm glad it 's not too late for miss polk , because she could have taken her life ,  sommerville said .  miss polk will probably end up on her feet . but i 'm not sure if anybody else will .  cnn 's jim kavanagh , brad lendon and mallory simon contributed to this report .", "summary": " new : company says it will return home to woman who shot herself during eviction .   neighbor climbs through window , finds woman bleeding .   congressman mentions incident during house debate on bailout .   kucinich :  this bill does nothing for the addie polks of the world  "}
