{"text": "eco-friendly led lights may damage your eyes , according to new research . a study has discovered that exposure to led lights can cause irreparable harm to the retina of the human eye . led lights have been touted as a super-efficient alternative to traditional bulbs because they use up to 85 per cent less energy and each bulb can last up to 10 years . in april , philips , the world 's biggest lighting maker , reported a 38 per cent jump in led light sales from last year . a spanish study has shown that the light emitted by led bulbs can damage the cells in the retina . some experts are now calling for a filter to be fitted in the bulbs -lrb- file picture -rrb- . they are already widely used in mobile phones , televisions , computer screens and can also be fitted as a replacement for traditional lighting in the home . leds are much more expensive that traditional bulbs - costing around # 25 for an equivalent 100w compared to around # 1 for an incandescent bulb - although manufacturers claim that consumers make their money back because the use such little energy . the government announced it was phasing out incandescent bulbs in 2007 after an eu directive banned their use . the 100w bulb was the first to go in 2009 and lower wattage bulbs continue to be phased out gradually . the ban caused public outrage as customers were forced to spend large sums of money on lighting that not only gave an unpleasantly ` cold ' light but also caused some people to report symptoms of itchy skin and headaches . the government 's enhanced capital allowance scheme , which was brought in to help cut uk carbon emissions , is also pushing the use of led lighting by offering businesses added tax relief if they use led and other low-energy bulbs . dr. celia sánchez-ramos , of complutense university in madrid and who led the study , explained that light from leds , or light-emitting diodes , comes from the short-wave , high-energy blue and violet end of the visible light spectrum . incandescent bulbs -lrb- left -rrb- are being phased out in favour of low-energy alternatives such as cfls -lrb- right -rrb- , but there are concerns about the safety of the new generation of so-called ` environmentally friendly ' lighting . she said that prolonged , continuous exposure to this light may be enough to damage a person 's retina . the retina is composed of light-sensitive tissue that is responsible for detecting light and in turn allowing us to see . ` this problem is going to get worse , because humans are living longer and children are using electronic devices from a young age , particularly for schoolwork , ' sánchez-ramos told thinkspain.com . enterprising : lighting shop owner kerry nicholau , from . twickenham , stockpiled 3000 incandescent bulbs after 75 watt bulbs were . phased out in 2011 . ` eyes are not designed to look directly at light -- they are designed to see with light , ' sánchez-ramos said . her comments are partly based on her 2012 study that was published in the journal photochemistry and photobiology . the study found that led radiation caused significant damage to human retinal pigment epithelial cells in vitro . sánchez-ramos added that modern humans . have their eyes open for roughly 6,000 hours a year , and are exposed to . artificial light for the majority of that time . some experts have called for the led lights to have built-in filters to cut out the blue glare . this is not the first time energy-saving . lights have come under scrutiny for safety reasons . compact fluorescent . light bulbs , or cfls , have been criticized for the high levels of mercury they contain as well as the uv radiation they can emit . led lights have also been blamed for the changing hues of masterpieces in art galleries . a study carried out by the university of antwerp earlier this year found that led lights were bleaching the paint on works by van gogh and cézanne .", "summary": " spanish research has shown that blue led light can irreparably damage the cells in the eye 's retina .   this is not the first time energy-saving bulbs have been criticised - fluorescent bulbs emit dangerous uv light .
