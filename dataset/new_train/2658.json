{"text": "at least one in six people worldwide does n't have access to clean water , and this contributes to about 1.5 million preventable deaths each year , according to the united nations . doc hendley , a top 10 cnn hero in 2009 , is trying to help change that . through his nonprofit , wine to water , the former bartender from north carolina has helped provide clean water to more than 150,000 people in 17 countries . wine-tasting events are one way hendley and his group raise the funds that enable them to distribute water filters and help install wells in communities around the world . and in april , bartenders from 16 countries donated their tips to the cause . hendley recently talked with cnn about the water crisis and his efforts to help people impacted by the syrian civil war and the recent typhoon in the philippines . cnn : what should people know about the water crisis ? doc hendley : it takes many women and children four and five hours , every single day , just to get water . and then it 's absolutely filthy , and it 's making their children sick . diarrhea kills more children under 5 than aids , malaria and measles combined . and 88 % of -lrb- those -rrb- deaths are caused by poor sanitation , unsafe drinking water and poor hygiene . a lot of people ask me ,  if this water crisis is so bad , how come we have n't heard much about it ?  well , here in the west , we help support things that we can empathize with . we know what it 's like to lose a loved one to a disease like cancer . we understand what it means to need a good , solid education for a child . so -lrb- those causes -rrb- get a lot of the spotlight . but it 's hard for us to empathize with the water crisis . we wash our cars ; we water our lawn . we just ca n't imagine what it 's like to not have access to water . cnn : why did you start working on this issue ? hendley : i began raising funds to support the fight against the global water crisis back in 2004 , and i had an opportunity to live in darfur , sudan , during the height of the genocide there . my job was to -lrb- work in -rrb- refugee camps and get them access to water . when i first started witnessing these women and children and the effort they would go through for a cup of water , and then to see actually the water that they were providing to their kids -- when you see that firsthand , you ca n't help but be changed . when i came home , it 's all i could think about . i dreamed about it . so i decided this is what i want to do with my life . cnn : why did you get involved in the situation in syria ? hendley : right now in syria , every single day , thousands of people are fleeing their homes because of this fighting ... going to an unknown future , with no resources . in these -lrb- displacement -rrb- camps , a lot of the men have either been killed or they 're all fighting , so it 's mostly populated by children and women . the vast majority is children . and as you know , a lot of these kids ' systems are very weak , and they 're drinking filthy water . my first thought was ,  let 's see if we can get some water filters into these camps .  another big reason for me was that the first country i worked in , sudan , was a predominantly muslim country , and i 've really felt a connection with the muslim world ever since . i really wanted to get out there and reach out , to show that we want to help in any way we can . cnn : what are you doing to help ? hendley : we created a partnership with zakat -lrb- a u.s.-based muslim charity -rrb- , and right now we 're actively working in two camps in the northwestern region , near border areas between syria and turkey . i was able to -lrb- go -rrb- inside some of these camps , inside syria . ... the living conditions , they 're terrible . on that trip , i was able to bring about 350 filters with me . until we can get each household to have their own water filter , which is the ultimate goal , we have a couple of distribution areas where people can come with their buckets of water and run -lrb- it -rrb- through a number of filters in order to clean it . when it 's not an emergency situation , we can go into an area and teach them , using their local resources , how to build their own water filter . but in a war zone , like what 's going on in syria , we just need to get a clean water fix immediately . syria is the very first location that we 're using these sawyer filters . we 're really excited about them . if they 're used properly , they will last 10 years and filter 250 gallons of water every day . cnn : do you ever worry about the risk ? hendley : going inside syria reminds me a lot of my time -lrb- in sudan -rrb- . when i was younger , i was a little more reckless ; i did n't have as much to lose . now i have a wife and two kids , and so i do find myself thinking ,  is this work really worth risking my life over ?  you know , when you see these families get to access clean water , it makes the answer pretty easy : of course it 's worth it . a lot of people think because the number is so big , what can one person really do ? it 's just too overwhelming . but if you think ,  i could help one other person or five other people or one village ,  you can make a huge difference . cnn : you were just in the philippines , where you and efren penaflorida , the 2009 cnn hero of the year , were helping people impacted by the typhoon . how did that go ? hendley : having so much support from efren and all of his contacts helped the process go much more smoothly than it normally would . we brought about 2,000 filters , and we 've been able to partner with a local water company , maynilad , that 's helping us provide 500 more . they are interested in doing even more , so with their support we now may be able to reach out to a huge number of people . that really upped the ante for us . ... there 's just so much to do in the philippines . there are so many disasters there -- not just typhoons , but earthquakes . and lots of villages we went to did n't have clean water before the typhoon , and now things are much worse . so there 's lots of work to do there , but we 're excited about having the chance to help . want to get involved ?
