{"text": "london for thousands of iraqi women and girls , the conflict that began in 2003 was only the start of their ordeals . in the chaos of war and the confusion , lawlessness and poverty that followed , an untold number have become victims of sexual traffickers , some within iraq and others sold over the borders . but the problem of trafficking has gone almost unreported , kept in the shadows by a combination of corruption , religious and cultural taboo and lack of interest by the region 's authorities in tackling it , researchers say . a report released by the london-based non-governmental group social change for education in the middle east -lrb- sceme -rrb- wednesday hopes to change that . entitled karamatuna , or our dignity , the study highlights the plight of girls as young as 10 or 12 who have been trafficked from post-war iraq into countries including syria , jordan , lebanon , united arab emirates and saudi arabia for sexual exploitation . other victims trafficked within iraq end up in nightclubs or brothels , often in baghdad , the report says . some of those brothels  have been established purely to meet the demand created by united states service personnel ,  it adds . launching the report , iman abou-atta , a clinical researcher who put her career on hold a year ago in order to produce the study , told a hearing at the house of lords in london that she had felt compelled to investigate after realizing the extent of the silence around the issue .  what i came across was closed doors , shame , the unwillingness of authorities of syria and jordan and the quietness of civil society on the issue ,  she writes in the foreword to the study . abou-atta also encountered resistance when she raised the issue with the british and u.s. authorities whose forces ' presence in iraq has been a contributing factor to the problem , she says . while sexual exploitation existed in iraq , as anywhere , long before the war began in 2003 ,  the invasion and instability that followed led to an environment where young women and girls became much more vulnerable to trafficking ,  she told the hearing . one iraqi non-governmental organization , the organization for women 's freedom in iraq , estimates that about 4,000 women , one fifth of them aged under 18 , disappeared in the first seven years after the war . although hard data is hard to come by , the group 's research suggests many were trafficked by criminal gangs nationally or internationally , or sold into forced marriage by their own families . hundreds of thousands of iraqis were displaced or made refugees by the war . prevented from working legally , some men have forced female relatives into prostitution to earn money for the family . others have taken advantage of others ' hardship . one case cited by the study is that of 17-year-old amira , whose impoverished father accepted a man 's offer to hire her for $ 200 a month to care for his handicapped wife . as well as housework , she was forced to have sex with the man 's son and friends . professional trafficking gangs also target young women after they flee home to escape forced marriage , abuse or violence , the report says . in a finding that may surprise some people , many of the traffickers within iraq are women , the study says . while some of those have themselves been victims of sexual exploitation , abou-atta says , others are in it for the easy money . other traffickers are taxi drivers who lure girls with false offers of help and then take them to brothels , or young men recruited by gangs who trick vulnerable young girls into eloping and then sell them into sexual servitude . some young victims are tricked into thinking a marriage proposal is genuine , abou-atta said -- and then after being sexually exploited are swiftly divorced and dumped in the streets , all honor gone in the eyes of conservative arab society . they are then easy targets for further abuse . once in the hands of the traffickers , the victims face a grim future . one girl , identified as shada , was left by her father at the syrian border , the study says . she was trafficked to damascus , where she was raped by five men and sold to a woman who forced her to work as a prostitute in nightclubs . many women forced into the sex trade then feel trapped , unable to leave because of threats to their family and a lack of any future in a conservative , predominantly muslim society that tends to see them as to blame for their  shame .  abou-atta , who spoke to some victims of sex trafficking in lebanon , said the women painted a dismal picture .  in the beginning it 's a nightmare ,  she said .  then they realize there 's no choice , they can not run away .  one woman recounted how when those who had trafficked her learned she planned to flee , they threatened to destroy the life of her daughter by making her shame public -- so she opted to stay , abou-atta said .  it comes to the price of their lives , the price of their families ,  she said . another cruel practice , particularly in syria , is the  mut ` a  marriage , in which a girl is married off for a price to a man on a friday , only for him to divorce her on the sunday .  research suggests that the rates at which these mut ' a marriages are carried out intensifies in the summer when male tourists visit syria from the gulf ,  the study says .  although this particular kind of marriage is not explicitly called prostitution , it is in effect sexual exploitation , often forced , as a means of either securing livelihood , or generating profit .  while anti-trafficking and prostitution laws exist in many countries in the region , the will to enforce them appears weak -- and they fail to offer much protection for the victims . in a move in the right direction , syria strengthened its anti-trafficking laws last year , the study says , and toughened the penalties against men involved in trafficking . however , women who have been forced into prostitution continue to face sanctions too . syria also deports iraqi refugees found illegally working in the country -- including women forced into the sex trade . meanwhile , provision of shelters , health care or psychological support for the stigmatized victims of sexual exploitation , who have little other chance of employment , is almost non-existent across the region , abou-atta said . she sees improved education and increased awareness as key factors in protecting future generations of women and girls . she also hopes to carry out more field research , to bolster what little hard evidence is available on an issue shrouded in secrecy . the group 's efforts were hampered over the past year by the arab spring uprising , which made access to many places difficult or dangerous . houzan mahmoud , of the organization for women 's freedom in iraq , which published its own report on prostitution in iraq last year , told the hearing the iraqi government had opposed her group 's work and tried to block its access to the media . she urged western governments to do more to put pressure on their arab counterparts to tackle sexual exploitation , and to ensure they do not send vulnerable asylum seekers back to a situation where they may be trafficked again . religious leaders should play a role by using their influence to change attitudes within society rather than demonizing women who are sexually exploited , she added . change wo n't be easy though . at the heart of the issue are the men who are happy to hand over money for sex -- and the corrupt officials at borders and elsewhere who turn a blind eye to what 's happening to vulnerable women .  the problem is there 's a demand for this , there 's a market for this ,  said mahmoud .  this is about money-making and profits . ", "summary": " study : years of conflict have made iraqi women vulnerable to sex trafficking .   thousands of women and girls are thought to have been trafficked in iraq and the region .   some girls as young as 11 have been sold as sex slaves in nightclubs , the report says .   the issue is shrouded in secrecy in a conservative , mostly muslim society .
