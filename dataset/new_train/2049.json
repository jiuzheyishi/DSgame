{"text": "los angeles , california it 's as tall as some of l.a. 's highest skyscrapers , but the only residents here are rats and cockroaches . welcome to the puente hills landfill , the largest rubbish dump in america . over 150 meters of garbage has risen from the ground since the area became a designated dumping site in 1957 . now , six days a week , an army of 1,500 trucks delivers a heaving 12,000 tons of municipal solid waste from the homes and offices of l.a. county 's millions of inhabitants .  this used to be a dairy farm ; a valley filled with cows producing milk . and now it 's a geological feature made out of trash ,  said edward humes , author of  garbology : our dirty love affair with trash  -- a book that charts the history of garbage in america . humes says most of the waste arrives straight from the bins of local residents .  if you 're like most of us -- most americans -- you 're making seven pounds of trash a day . across a lifetime that adds up to 102 tons of trash per person ,  he said . in 2010 alone , americans accumulated 250 million tons of garbage , and although recycling in the u.s. has increased by 34 % since 1960 , humes believes the country 's attitude to waste is still not sustainable .  it 's very convenient to roll your trash to the curb every week and have it disappear , but it 's a magic trick -- and really there 's not very much magic ,  he said .  we need to have less packaging ; use less disposable items ; -lrb- use -rrb- things that last longer ; make purchasing decisions that are more studied and less wasteful .  the environmental impact of landfill sites varies depending on how well they 're managed and resourced . however , typical problems include the contamination of soil and groundwater from toxic residues ; the release of methane , a greenhouse gas produced during the decaying process that is more potent than carbon dioxide ; and disease-carrying pests . tom freyberg , chief editor of industry publication waste management world agrees with humes that we should all be trying to reduce waste and increase the amount we recycle . however , he says it 's likely there will always be a need for landfill , and we should applaud those sites that are well managed .  what 's happening now compared to years ago is that the technology and practices around waste management have vastly improved . it might be hard to see it from the outside , but they -lrb- puente hills -rrb- have a state of the art landfill site ,  he said . indeed , the layers of waste at puente hills are meticulously separated by plastic membranes , designed to contain the brew of noxious chemicals that would otherwise leak out into the groundwater . the  leachate  is then collected and filtered to make it safe . the slums of mumbai : a model of urban sustainability ? in addition , the methane produced by the natural decomposition of materials inside the tower of trash is collected through a network of pipes and burned to generate electricity . the emitted methane from puente hills alone produces about 50 megawatts of power -- enough energy for 70,000 homes , according to los angeles county authorities . at present , just over half of all u.s. garbage is buried in landfills , a third is recycled and the rest is incinerated to produce electricity , a process known as waste-to-energy . a recent study by the u.s. environmental protection agency concluded that incinerating a ton of trash emits at least 35 % less greenhouse gas and yields 10 times more electricity than burying it and capturing the methane . so why does america still seem so in love with landfill ?  quite simply , it 's the most cost-effective option across most of the u.s. ,  said peter borkey , head of the oecd 's waste division .  incineration plants require a large critical mass of waste to be financially worthwhile . this is easy to accomplish in densely populated areas , but the costs associated with processing and transporting garbage rise very quickly as the population density lowers .  borkey believes that landfill reduction will prove difficult until producers of waste and the municipal authorities responsible for handling it are given the right incentives . he says that in europe -- where an eu directive on waste management has decreed landfill a disposal method of last resort -- large rubbish dumps are dwindling .  in places like germany and scandinavia , landfill now constitutes less than 5 % of total waste management ,  he said . but some landfill is unavoidable :  at present residual waste that can neither be burned nor recycled -- hazardous waste and incineration ash -- can only be confined in well-managed landfill .  in freyberg 's view , the public attitude surrounding the very idea of  waste  should be reformed .  the term does n't do the industry any favors . most of what we call waste can be reused , turned into fuel or new products altogether . we should instead think of it as a great resource . ", "summary": " l.a. is home to america 's largest landfill site , towering as high as a skyscraper .   americans accumulated 250 million tons of garbage in 2010 , most ends up as landfill .   but there is complex science behind a rubbish dump ensuring it is safe and sustainable .
