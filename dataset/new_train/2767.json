{"text": "the people of newtown , connecticut , on saturday are remembering a tragedy that convulsed the nation one year ago . a socially awkward young man walked into sandy hook elementary school with a rifle on december 14 , 2012 . adam lanza gunned down 20 children , ages 6 and 7 , and six adults at the school . then he killed himself . the people in this community of 28,000 in the southwest part of the state hope to grieve in private . town leaders have asked the news media to stay away .  there 's an emotional and economic toll that we pay when the media descends on us , so we ask for your forbearance after today and respectfully request that you allow us a time of peace and quiet ,  said pat llodra , the town 's first selectman , a role similar to that of mayor . in washington , president obama and the first lady observed a moment of silence and lit candles in honor of those lost in the massacre . obama devoted his weekly address on saturday to the one-year anniversary of the shooting .  as parents , as americans , the news filled us with grief ,  obama said in his address .  newtown is a town like so many of our hometowns . the victims were educators and kids that could have been any of our own . and our hearts were broken for the families that lost a piece of their heart ; for the communities changed forever ; for the survivors , so young , whose innocence was torn away far too soon .  obama honored the  impossibly brave  newtown parents  who stepped forward in the hopes that they might spare others their heartbreak . and they were joined by millions of americans -- mothers and fathers ; sisters and brothers -- who refused to accept these acts of violence as somehow inevitable .   over the past year , their voices have sustained us . and their example has inspired us -- to be better parents and better neighbors ; to give our children everything they need to face the world without fear ; to meet our responsibilities not just to our own families , but to our communities . more than the tragedy itself , that 's how newtown will be remembered ,  obama said . many news organizations said they 'll honor that request by not reporting in the city of newtown itself , but that was before friday 's shooting at arapahoe high in colorado . the news value of newtown has gone up . cnn will air a documentary about newtown at 7 p.m. et on saturday . media vow to remember newtown tragedy in respectful manner . nobody knows why lanza , 20 , killed the children and adults at the school , his mother at the home they shared , and himself . he had attended the school briefly , but that was years ago . last month , connecticut 's state attorney 's office released its official report that tried to piece together what happened . the investigation provided some insights into the life and actions of the gunman , but his motive remains a mystery . the report suggested that improving the delivery of mental health care to those with chronic mental illness may be an important element in reducing certain acts of violence , and that mass shooters are not  enthralled  with violent video games . after newtown , mental health gains prominence in gun debate . the unanswered questions deepen the tragedy of newtown , the second-deadliest school shooting in u.s. history , following the april 2007 slaying of 32 people at virginia tech . the shootings also caused a renewal of the debate over gun control . obama addressed that issue in his saturday remarks .  we have n't yet done enough to make our communities and our country safer . we have to do more to keep dangerous people from getting their hands on a gun so easily . we have to do more to heal troubled minds . we have to do everything we can to protect our children from harm and make them feel loved , and valued , and cared for ,  he said .  as a nation , we ca n't stop every act of violence . we ca n't heal every troubled mind . but if we want to live in a country where we can go to work , send our kids to school , and walk our streets free from fear , we have to keep trying . we have to keep caring . we have to treat every child like they 're our child . like those in sandy hook , we must choose love . and together , we must make a change .  newtown a year later .", "summary": " new : president obama remembers newtown .   one year ago , adam lanza killed 20 young children , 6 adults .   no motive has been uncovered for lanza 's actions .   town leaders have asked the media to respect town 's privacy .
