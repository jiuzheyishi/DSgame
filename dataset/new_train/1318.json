{"text": "it was dr johnson , that most sympathetic observer of human weakness , who said of his friend , the dramatist oliver goldsmith : ` no man was more foolish when he had not a pen in his hand , nor more wise when he had . ' this morning , therefore , offer a kind thought for kevin pietersen , who was once an england cricketer . with a bat in his hand he achieved remarkable things . with a pen he fools nobody but himself . and after the ecb document about last winter 's disastrous ashes tour was leaked on tuesday , pietersen looks very foolish indeed . in case you have n't heard , pietersen has just published an autobiography which seeks to ` blow the lid ' off cricket , in particular the people he used to play with before they tired of him . pietersen 's autobiography was written with the purpose of blowing the lid off cricket . the former england international did that , but he has also damaged his already soiled reputation beyond repair . 2009 : resigns as england captain after a rift with coach peter moores . 2010 : fined for an obscene twitter outburst after being dropped from odi squad . 2012 : sends provocative texts about andrew strauss to proteas . 2012 : reintegrated into team after missing out on a central contract . 2014 : sacked after ecb lose patience with his ashes tour behaviour . he has blown the lid off all right , but at the expense of damaging his own reputation , already soiled , beyond repair . even matt prior , the england wicketkeeper who feels the full force of pietersen 's fury , may decide that pity is the most appropriate response . for what the book confirms is the self-willed fall from grace of a cricketer who had the world at his feet yet never learned to show a straighter bat to that world , and who may now be wondering why so many people share andrew strauss 's unprintable opinion of his character . pietersen 's model for his book seems to be alice in wonderland , where words mean what alice wants them to mean . the world , viewed through the filter of pietersen 's imagination , is full of little men who were put on earth to halt his progress towards immortality . pietersen -lrb- left -rrb- was all smiles during an england training session with andrew strauss in august 2011 . what has made cricket-followers roar is pietersen 's confession that in 2012 , a summer disfigured by his betrayal of strauss , who was then a much-admired england captain , he blubbed in the dressing-room at headingley after he had made a wonderful century against south africa . why ? because he thought some team-mates were involved in a spoof twitter account which mocked his rampant egotism . ` i was completely broken , absolutely finished , mentally shot , ' he said -lrb- peeling an onion -rrb- in an interview to accompany the book launch . here we go again , everybody . it 's all about me , me , me ! english cricket is full of heroic tales . in 1933 , at brisbane , eddie paynter of lancashire left his sick-bed with a temperature of 102 to make 83 runs that helped win a test match . thirty years later , at lord 's , colin cowdrey went out to face the mighty wes hall with a broken arm to ensure the west indies did not win . pietersen described alastair cook 's captaincy of the england cricket team as ` weak ' and ` tactically inept ' most famously , at headingley in 1981 , ian botham responded to a run of wretched form that cost him the captaincy by giving the greatest all-round performance in the history of our game to turn a test , and a series , on its head . botham 's ashes , they still call it , and always will . that 's immortality . did paynter say : ` i shall stay in bed today ' ? did cowdrey say : ` it 's not worth it ' ? did botham say , as pietersen did at leeds : ` it 's not easy being me in this dressing-room ' ? not a trace of it . they pulled on their boots and strapped on their pads . ` blubber ' pietersen , on the other hand , went : ` boo hoo hoo , the rotters are being beastly ! it 's so unfair ! ' the rotters have always been unfair to pietersen on his ` incredible journey ' through cricket : my word , how he loves his ` incredibles ' ! they forced him out of natal when he was 20 and have made his life a misery ever since . only last week , surrey released him from his contract . it may have had something to do with the fact he was rarely spotted at the oval . where the england team is concerned , it has been evident for some time that , taken as a group , they are not the most attractive group of players . as for pietersen 's claims that a culture of ` bullying ' existed , we shall hear more anon and the revelations from other witnesses may not be in his favour . cricketers are not , on the whole , mean-spirited . in a team environment that tests the bonds of friendship or mutual respect , because of the months they are obliged to spend with one another , they tend to be collegiate creatures , happy to rub along with whoever they find alongside them . pietersen -lrb- left -rrb- pictured with graeme swann at the end of the fourth ashes cricket test in melbourne in 2010 . pietersen , pictured during the last ashes series , told his side of the story in his new autobiography . video pietersen blastst former england ` regime ' so it has always been significant pietersen has proved unable to find a companionable berth in any dressing-room he has shared . from durban to kennington , by way of nottingham and southampton , he has been mistrusted by colleagues who may have tolerated his selfishness but who rarely found a kind word to say for his comradeship . for all his inane prattle about ` buddies ' , pietersen found few allies and fewer friends . ` has our famous batsman failed ? ' a hampshire player asked reporters one day at southampton after hearing that pietersen had been dismissed in the lord 's test . ` oh dear , what a pity . we 're so upset . ' one may judge a man by his friends . one may also judge him by those he perceives to be enemies . evidently pietersen has little time for andy flower , the former coach , whose principled opposition to the genocidal robert mugabe is well-known ; to strauss , who enjoys the respect of everybody within the game ; and to paul downton , the managing director of english cricket , who has never made a foe in his life . he also called hugh morris , downton 's predecessor , who fought a courageous battle against cancer , a ` weak p *** k ' . upon receiving his 100th cap , pietersen described the england dressing room in november 2013 as ` the best environment that i have ever experienced ' only to then describe and deride a ` bullying ' culture within the team . the model for pietersen 's autobiography seems to be alice in wonderland ... he sees what he wants to see . clearly he is not the most rounded of men . unable to sense mood or interpret events in the way that a better balanced person would , he has come to rely on a small army of advisers who have not always served him well . all together now : me , me me ! his friends could have told him that it was unwise to cover his forearms with england tattoos before he had played a single test for his adopted country . they could have told him breathless attempts to be pally with famous players usually rebound on the groveller , and that words such as ` dude ' and ` buddy ' reveal the speaker to be a twerp . but they did n't . instead pietersen became cocooned in a tower of illusions and frustrations , railing against a world of deceivers , as self-deceivers often do . some cricket-lovers are sympathetic , to a degree . most washed their hands of him a long time ago . pietersen -lrb- right -rrb- has a series of high-profile supporters , including piers morgan -lrb- centre -rrb- . he should have been remembered for his magnificent strokeplay , and indeed his handful of superb innings will be recalled whenever people consider his cricket . but , after this latest shabby exercise in score-settling , the pietersen story will be known mainly for the lamentations of the most self-obsessed sportsman of our age . sir ronald harwood , the dramatist and oscar-winning screenwriter , also came to this country from south africa , and loves cricket with a passion . yesterday , reflecting on the pietersen imbroglio , he said something magnificent . ` there is such a thing as the spirit of the game , and that spirit has triumphed , to his disadvantage . ' meanwhile , somewhere through the looking-glass , alice wants a friend to hold her hand .", "summary": " with a bat in his hand kevin pietersen achieved remarkable things , but with a pen he fools nobody but himself .   pietersen wanted to ` blow the lid off ' cricket with his autobiography , which he has done , but he has also damaged his reputation beyond repair .   pietersen 's model for his book seems to be alice in wonderland , where words mean what alice wants them to mean .   one of the major revelations pietersen reveals in his book is that of the bullying culture he claims was present in the england dressing room .
