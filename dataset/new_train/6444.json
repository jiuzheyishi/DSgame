{"text": "the winter olympics may be over for another year but that has n't stopped an australian building a street version of the superfast sled - powered by jets . daz fellows ' luge is fitted with two thrusters that produce 200lbs -lrb- 91kg -rrb- of thrust each . fellows claims his design has the potential to reach 311mph -lrb- 500km/h -rrb- and he plans to take on the current world record of 115.83 mph -lrb- 186km/h -rrb- next year . scroll down for video . australian daz fellows , pictured , began working on his street luge last year . it has already undergone various road and wind tunnel tests . this test was carried out in new south wales earlier this week . the luge , pictured , is 9.84 ft -lrb- 3 metres -rrb- long and is fitted with two jet thrusters . the record for the world 's fastest street luge was set by jason bradbury on the set of the gadget show 's 200th episode in bentwaters parks , suffolk , in 2011 . fellows goes by the stage name daz the cowboy and is a tv stuntman from new south wales . he claims the board is a complete redesign of the streetluge dubbed jet luge . it is made from carbon fibre with a full carbon fibre fuel cell . at 9.84 ft -lrb- 3 metres -rrb- long , the luge has also been referred to as a ` man-sized ' skateboard controlled using a thumb accelerator , and lean steer turning . fellows claims his jet-powered street luge , also called jet luge , pictured , is capable of reaching speeds of up to 311mph -lrb- 500 km/h -rrb- . it has additionally been dubbed a ` man-sized skateboard ' the thumb-controlled wheel increases or decreases power by rolling a thumb over it to control speed . this wheel can be set at a pre-determined speed , or used as a dynamic accelerator . alternatively , . the luge can be fitted with a trigger grip control where the rider can . use their pointer finger to control acceleration . at full power , the turbines , pictured , produce 200lbs -lrb- 91kg -rrb- of thrust each , and afterburners on the tail add an extra 35 per cent to 43 per cent thrust . fellows hopes to beat the current world record of 115.83 mph -lrb- 186km/h -rrb- . fellows , pictured , goes by the stage name daz the cowboy and is a tv stunt man from new south wales . he claims the board is a complete redesign of the streetluge , pictured . it is made from carbon fibre with a full carbon fibre fuel cell . the entire powered system is routed to a kill switch cable attached to the rider , and in the event of an emergency the cable is pulled free and everything shuts down . a secondary unit is positioned behind , and in the event the rider can not see , a second person can hit that button and shut the entire system down . fellows became involved in , and was one of the original founders of , street luge in australia 1996 . the luge , pictured left , features lean steer turning . a wheel increases or decreases power by rolling a thumb over it to control speed . alternatively , the luge can be fitted with a trigger grip where the rider can use their pointer finger to control acceleration . it was designed and assembled by fellows over 18 months . following further wind tunnel tests , pictured , fellows will attempt to break the world record between april and august 2015 . by doing it during the australian winter , fellows claims it will help keep running temperatures down and maximise thrust output . his luge was designed and assembled with his team and involved hundreds of hours of design and testing . they have spent the last 18 months building the board from scratch . his record attempt will be carried out between april and august 2015 . fellows claims this is to help keep running temperatures down and maximise thrust output . dimensions . length : 9.84 ft -lrb- 3
