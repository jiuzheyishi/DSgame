{"text": " i am trayvon martin  has become the catchphrase for protesters expressing solidarity with the slain florida teenager and outrage over his killing . even president barack obama declared ,  if i had a son , he would look like trayvon .  but who really was trayvon martin ? there is plenty of speculation , including some bloggers who point to his recent school suspensions -- including for drug residue in his backpack -- and images of him sporting tattoos and a what appeared to be a gold tooth grill as possible evidence of a troubled teen . that portrayal is in stark contrast to the accounts from his family , friends , and teachers who described martin as an average 17-year-old .  he was a shy kid ,  said family friend and former football coach jerome horton .  he did n't want to be the center of attention ; that 's just not him .  he always walked with his hoodie and his headphones ,  recalled horton .  if he was n't on the phone , he was listening to music -- anyone that knows him knows that .  just like most any other teenager , martin enjoyed listening to music -- r&b was his favorite -- going to the movies and the roller rink with his friends , friends and family said . when martin entered high school , his childhood goals of a career on the football field were replaced with his dreams of working with airplanes .  he just loves getting on planes ,  said his father tracy martin . during the summer of 2009 , his parents -- who separated when martin was 11 , but shared custody -- enrolled their 14-year-old son in  experience aviation ,  a nonprofit program in opa-locka , florida , that introduces young people to aviation . the seven-week program is the brainchild of barrington irving , the youngest person ever -- and the first black pilot -- to fly solo around the world , a feat he accomplished in 2007 at the age of 23 . irving remembered martin as  a polite kid  who enjoyed flying .  when i first met trayvon he had a strong interest in football . he reminded me of myself because i had a strong interest in football until i fell in love with aviation ,  said irving . after graduating from the program , martin spent the following summer as a volunteer , assisting new students enrolled in the aviation program . during high school , martin also volunteered his time at the concession stand at forzano park where he played football since age 5 , on a team coached by horton and his father .  he would literally go to school and from school he would go to the park to volunteer to maybe about 8 , 9 o'clock and go home ,  said horton .  that was trayvon 's day , his week .  martin 's mother transferred him from miami 's carol city high school to dr. michael m. krop high school , closer to her home .  he was doing average in school , a little bit better when he was at carol city and then i had him transferred ,  sybrina fulton said , according to the miami herald .  i thought krop was a better school and i wanted a different environment for him . my oldest son has graduated from there .  in his junior year at krop , martin 's favorite subject was math , according to his father .  he was just an average student ,  he said . at krop , martin was suspended three times , according to records obtained by the miami herald , once for writing graffiti on a door and another time for school truancy . the third suspension took place the week of his death . martin was suspended for 10 days due to drug residue being found in his backpack . in an interview with cnn 's anderson cooper , sybrina fulton responded to her son 's suspension :  whatever he had dealings with the school , it was not criminal , it was not violent , he 's never been arrested .  darrell green , a fellow football player and close friend , said martin was no different from any other teen .  everybody gets in trouble ,  said green ,  everybody goes through it .  green remembered martin as a  positive person  and a  good friend .  during the 10-day suspension , tracy martin took his son with him to sanford , about four hours away from miami , while he visited his fiancée because neither he nor fulton wanted their son to stay in his hometown where he could enjoy his friends , said horton , who has been in close contact with martin 's father .  he was n't just suspended from school and up at sanford kicking it and having a good time ,  said horton . martin had only been to sanford a handful of times . his fateful walk to the convenience store for a bag of skittles and an iced tea on the evening of february 26 happened only because the teenager pleaded to leave the apartment , said horton .  the only reason he got a chance to go to the store is because he begged his dad to go ,  he said . at the time , his father and his fiancée had gone out to dinner and to watch a basketball game , leaving martin at the townhouse , according to martin family spokesman ryan julison . while walking to the store , martin was on the phone with his girlfriend , whom he had been talking to for over 6 1/2 hours throughout the day , the family 's attorney said , citing phone records . the girl , who did not want to be identified , said she told martin to run , but he refused , the family attorney said .  what are you stopping me for ?  martin asked a man later identified as neighborhood watch captain george zimmerman , according to the girl .  what are you doing around here ?  zimmerman asked in response . the girl said she then got the impression that an altercation was taking place and that someone had pushed martin , because the headset fell out of his ear , and the phone shut off . moments later , martin was shot and killed . the details of what happened are still murky . zimmerman has said through his legal adviser that he acted in self-defense after martin attacked him . the family disputes that , and witness accounts vary . fulton told cnn 's piers morgan that she believes zimmerman  hunted my son like an animal .  the teen 's killing has captivated the nation 's attention , with some saying this shooting of an unarmed teenager has exposed underlying racism . some also feel that it 's better to wait on the evidence before rushing to judgment on what happened that night . . others decry the  stand your ground  law that allowed zimmerman to walk away free of any criminal charges . as these broader issues continue to dominate the news headlines , the only thing that is certain is that sybrina fulton and tracy martin have lost their son . when asked for one word to describe trayvon martin , sybrina fulton chose  lovable ,  adding ,  i miss his smile .  asked what he would say to zimmerman if he had a chance to speak to him , tracy martin had many questions : .  i would ask him why did he in fact pick out my son , what was going through his mind that night ?  martin told piers morgan .  -lsb- did -rsb- he realize he 's destroyed an innocent child 's life ? my son had a future . my son was not one of these thugs in the night .  i would ask him , why did he in fact take my son 's life and how does he feel about taking my son 's life ?
