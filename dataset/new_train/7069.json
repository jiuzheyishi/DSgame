{"text": "historians seeking to identify a troop of fallen world war one soldiers could be one step closer to cracking the 99 year mystery after tracing the descendant of a young man killed in france in 1914 . the group of unknown soldiers , who fell during heavy gunfire during a battle in beaucamps-ligny , france , could be identified thanks to dna provided by the great-nephew of private frederick thompson , who was reported missing in action at the age of 20 . it is believed private frederick could be one of the 15 found at the site in france in 2009 . now , his great-nephew eric saunders , 61 , . from worcester , has submitted a dna sample in the hope it matches with . one of the sets of remains and proves it belongs to his relative . eric saunders has submitted a dna sample in the hope it will confirm one of the sets of remains of soldiers found in beaucamps-ligny , france , belongs to his great uncle . private frederick thompson -lrb- left and right , with his wife -rrb- was reported missing in 1914 at the age of 20 . historians believe he could be one of the 15 soldiers found in beaucamps-ligny , france , in 2009 . and historians from the commonwealth war grave commission hope that after the dna testing has been undertaken , they will finally be able to discover their identities and give them a military funeral 100 years on . the remains of the soldiers were uncovered by farmers digging up sewers in 2009 . private frederick thompson , killed in action early in the first world war , may be identified nearly a century after his death . archaeologists uncovered partial skeletal remains of 15 men - alongside toothbrushes , and brass buttons proving the men belonged to the 2nd battalion york and lancaster regiment - after their remains were uncovered by farmers digging up sewers in 2009 . one young soldier , private frederick thompson , killed in action early in the first world war may be identified nearly a century after his death , from dna provided by his great-nephew , in one of the first dna tests on the soldier 's remains . the commission managed to track down private thompson 's closest living relative , his great nephew mr saunders , and they are now awaiting the results of his dna test to see if private thompson will be the first unknown soldier to be identified . mr saunders said : ' i had no idea that any of my relatives served in the great war . i feel immensely proud to discover that my great uncle fought for his country . ' i was stunned to discover that he had been killed at the age of just 20 . ' i have grandchildren that age myself , and i ca n't even begin to imagine what those soldier 's poor mothers went through . ' i know it happened to a lot of people but it really hits home to find out that happened to one of my own relatives . ' i did n't really know anything about my mother 's side of the family . we were both shocked . the number of discoveries of remains varies from year to year , but since 2003 the commonwealth war graves commission has dealt with an average of about 18 cases each year . over the last decade the highest number of discoveries was in 2007 when 24 cases were found , while the lowest was 12 cases in 2011 . each case can involve multiple sets of remains - bomber crews for example commonly involve seven casualties - but generally discoveries are of one or two casualties at a time . the most common cause of discoveries are building work or farmers ploughing fields . the vast majority of cases are in france and belgium . in all instances , the responsibility for investigation and identification rests with the relevant service authority - the armed forces of the country for which the individual was serving . the commission 's responsibility begins when the remains are handed over for burial . the commission then identifies the appropriate cemetery - usually the closest commonwealth war cemetery in which there is space - manufacture the headstone , prepare the grave and care for the individual in perpetuity once the burial has taken place . ' i was very keen to give a dna sample to try and prove the identity of these unknown heroes . ` i 've . been told it may take several months to come back with a result , but i . hope i can do my bit to give those men the proper funeral they deserve . ` i 've said that i would like to attend the funeral ceremony for the men , even if it turns out not to be my uncle 's remains . i feel as though i have a bond with those men now . ' the 2nd battalion york and lancaster regiment had been based in ireland at the outbreak of the war , landing in france on september 9 , 1914 , and taking part in the battle of armentihres . the battalion then headed to fight with the 6th division along a line from preniesques to radinghem in an action that lasted from october 20 to 31 . all the men will be laid to rest in the same graveyard with full military honours , to mark the centenary of their deaths in october 2014 . an mod spokesman said : ` the use of dna can in some cases enable us to confirm the identity of remains that are discovered , but after many decades results may be inconclusive . we always take steps to make families fully aware of this possibility . ` dna testing is only used where there is a realistic chance of a positive match being obtained and may not be appropriate in all cases . ` the jccc historic casework team undertakes a unique and essential role in investigating where remains of british service personnel are found on wartime battlefields and is always mindful that their work often closes a chapter for families who have lost loved ones many years ago . ' historic find : beaucamps-ligny is situated to the west of lille in france .", "summary": " historians seeking to identify troop of fallen wwi soldiers found in france .   eric saunders provided dna sample to see if one was his great uncle .   private frederick thompson was reported missing in action at the age of 20 .
