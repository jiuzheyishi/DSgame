{"text": "cannabis does not slow the progression of multiple sclerosis , a large-scale study has concluded . the study at the peninsula college of medicine and dentistry at plymouth university is a blow to hopes that the drug could provide long-term benefits for patients with the debilitating nerve disease . despite promising signs in earlier , shorter studies , researchers found patients who took capsules containing tetrahydrocannabinol -lrb- thc -rrb- , a key active ingredient in cannabis , fared no better than those given a placebo . damning research : cannabis does not slow the progression of multiple sclerosis , a large-scale study has concluded . the trial involved 493 people with progressive ms at 27 centres around the uk and began in 2006 . participants took either thc capsules or placebo for three years . in the study known as cupid - cannabinoid use in progressive inflammatory brain disease - ms patients were assessed on both a disability scale administered by neurologists and another based on their own reporting . lead researcher john zajicek said : ` overall the study found no evidence to support an effect of thc on ms progression in either of the main outcomes . ' the results from the study , which was funded by the medical research council , were presented at the association of british neurologists ' annual meeting in brighton today . the research is a blow to hopes that the drug could provide long-term benefits for patients with the debilitating nerve disease . cannabis contains more than 60 different cannabinoids , of which thc is thought to be the most active , and many ms patients have long said the drug helps them cope with the effects of the disease . drug companies , too , have been interested in cannabis as a medicine . soon after he turned 40 , stephen , from suffolk , was diagnosed with ms. some five years later , separated from his wife , wheelchair-bound and re-housed in a bungalow , he was put on cannabis-based drug sativex . ` so far i 've taken it for six months . it looks like a breath freshener . i spray one burst under my tongue up to 15 times a day , from half an hour before i get up to just before i go to bed . it is alcohol-based , tastes unpleasantly bitter and is absorbed through the mouth 's lining within 30 minutes . ` it gives me relief from pain so i can relax or focus enough to make decisions . though i 'm in a wheelchair , it 's nothing like the limitations caused by continual intense pain . in fact , it 's been so effective that i 've stopped using painkillers . ` cannabis has given me back my quality of life . it has aided my sleep , which means i am less irritable and depressed . it has improved my eyesight and allows me to control my bladder and bowel more easily . ` i 've been able to sit at a computer and use voice-activated software . because it relaxes the body , it reduces the spasticity so i can even use an exercise bike . ` because of sativex , i 'm able to walk oscar the dog in my wheelchair twice a day . ' gw pharmaceuticals , working with bayer and almirall , recently started selling an under-the-tongue cannabis spray called sativex to relieve spasticity . . david nutt , professor of neuropsychopharmacology at imperial college london , who was not involved in the latest research , said the study 's failure did not mean cannabis had no role in helping ms patients . he said : ` it would be wrong to interpret these preliminary findings to mean that cannabis does not achieve its licensed use . ` cannabis is not licensed for limiting disease progression , it is licensed for dealing with spasticity and pain . ' professor zajicek 's study did find some evidence to suggest a beneficial effect in less disabled patients , but because this was seen in only a small group of people it was unclear how strong the effect was . the overall study population also experienced slower disease progression than had been expected , making it more challenging to detect any treatment effect , the researchers added . ms is a disease in which immune system cells destroy the myelin sheath that protects the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord . the most common type is relapsing remitting ms , affecting around 85 per cent of patients at the time of diagnosis . several drugs are available to treat this stage of the disease , including injections of beta-interferons and a new pill from novartis called gilenya . secondary progressive ms comes later and involves a sustained build up of disability .", "summary": " researchers found patients who took capsules containing thc , a key active ingredient in cannabis , fared no better than those given a placebo .   study assessed ms patients on both a disability scale administered by neurologists and another based on their own reporting .
