{"text": "ofsted inspectors are favouring ` trendy ' learning methods over traditional ` chalk and talk ' teaching , a report claims today . they prefer child-led activities to such an extent that it is ` inconceivable ' for teachers to allow pupils to learn from textbooks during a visit from the watchdog . an examination of ofsted reports by the think-tank civitas reveals that inspectors show an ` aversion ' to direct teacher instruction and like group work instead . guidance : ofsted inspectors , led by sir michael wilshaw -lrb- pictured -rrb- , are said to prefer ` trendy ' and ` jazzy ' teaching methods . this is resulting in staff putting on ` jazzy ' lessons to impress them , according to the study , playing the game : the enduring influence of the preferred ofsted teaching style . robert peal , a history teacher and education research fellow for civitas , examined 130 ofsted reports of secondary schools inspected between september and october last year . of these , 52 per cent showed a preference for lessons in which pupils learn independently from teachers and 42 per cent favoured group work . eighteen per cent criticised teachers for talking too much and the same proportion criticised lessons because the pupils were ` too passive ' . there was only one example of an inspector recommending a more teacher-led approach . two months later , ofsted issued new guidance for inspectors which stated they should not back one style of teaching over another in the course of their work . and in january this year , sir michael wilshaw , chief inspector of schools , wrote to inspectors saying : ` please , please , please think carefully before criticising a lesson because it does not conform to a particular view of how children should be taught . ' mr peal studied an additional 130 reports of inspections conducted between january and march this year to assess whether inspectors had taken the guidance on board . only 8 per cent demonstrated a preference for pupil independence and there were no reports of inspectors criticising teachers for talking too much . two per cent flagged up the ` passivity ' of pupils . but mr peal claims the changes are ` largely superficial ' and that ` fundamental problems ' remain because reports have simply been rewritten to ensure signs of ` bias ' are not included . inspectors have been given a list of ` banned ' phrases to prevent schools from thinking the watchdog has a preferred style of teaching . serco -- which is contracted by ofsted -- provided its inspectors with alternative ways of making comments in may . instead of writing that ` too much teacher talk dominates ' , it was suggested that inspectors could write ` explanations are not clear ' . techniques : an examination of ofsted reports by the think-tank civitas reveals that inspectors show an ` aversion ' to direct teacher instruction and like group work instead -lrb- file picture -rrb- . inspectors are also still backing child-led learning in verbal feedback to staff , according to mr peal . one teacher told civitas : ` too much teacher talk  is often verbally mentioned in feedback but , due to new criteria , not written down . ' writing in the report , mr peal claims inspections are ` distinctly in favour of child-centred teaching methods and prejudiced against more teacher-led alternatives ' . he said : ` teachers are accustomed to putting on  jazzy  lessons , replete with group work , role play and active learning in order to fulfil what has become widely acknowledged as the ofsted style . ` so strong is the inspectorate 's reputation for favouring trendy teaching methods that the idea of putting on a  chalk and talk  lesson or learning from a textbook with an ofsted inspector in the room has become inconceivable within the teaching profession . ' in june , ofsted announced a pilot scheme in the midlands to end grading teaching quality on each lesson observation form . instead , lead inspectors will form an overall judgment on teaching in the school from their team 's summaries . an ofsted spokesman said : ` as hm chief inspector sir michael wilshaw has repeatedly made clear , ofsted does not have a preferred teaching style . it is up to the classroom teacher to determine how they should teach . '", "summary": " study by think-tank civitas revealed inspectors prefer ` trendy ' methods .   it also suggests they show an ` aversion ' to direct teacher instruction .   this results in staff putting on ` jazzy ' lessons in order to impress children .
