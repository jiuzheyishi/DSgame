{"text": "fifty years is a long time in rock 'n' roll , and it 's said any old rocker who can remember back that far either was n't really there or did n't know how to have fun . but tony hicks insists he has a clear memory of everything that happened and did n't miss out on anything . as guitarist and vocalist with the hollies , he was there at the start of the group 's enduring success story , and in this , their golden anniversary year , is still belting out their classic hits to sell-out crowds . his personal high was their success with perhaps their most iconic song , he ai n't heavy , he 's my brother . ` i 'd found it browsing through a music publisher 's files and thought it would make a good change of pace for us . we went into the studio with it and booked a session musician to play keyboard . the hollies in 1964 : -lrb- from left -rrb- allan clarke , graham nash , bobby elliott , tony hicks and eric haydock . ` he was a shy , skinny young man called reg dwight , later to become elton john . we paid him # 15 , the going rate for the job at the time . ' young reg helped out on some of the hollies ' album tracks too after the departure of guitarist graham nash , who had played keyboards when needed . ` we knew reg because he was a staff writer with a music publisher we used . he was writing songs well before he became famous . ' one was your song . says tony , ' i thought it would be a good one for the hollies , and asked the publisher for permission to record it . he told me elton had recorded it himself and it was due to be released in the us . he said ,  but it probably wo n't happen for him , so wait until it 's all over .  ' at that time elton had had no luck breaking into the charts , with six flops . ` well , it did happen - your song became elton 's first big hit , and one that 's unfailingly identified with him . but it so easily could have been our song . ' as well as he ai n't heavy , the hollies ' other songs , including first big hit searchin ' , just one look , i 'm alive , look through any window , bus stop and carrie anne , have all stood the test of time . almost 50 years later : tony -lrb- second right -rrb- with the hollies last year . tony , now 67 , says modestly , ` to leave out even one of those songs when we do a show would be just plain rude . and we always get a standing ovation . does that sound flash ? well , maybe , but it 's true . ' the hollies were never short of self-esteem . ` the biggest names in pop were the beatles and the rolling stones . then there was us . we toured with the stones , as second on the bill . ` it was expected of us , as runners-up so to speak , to close the first half of the show . but we refused , insisting we went on just before the stones , as if to challenge them to  follow that  . ' did the notoriously status-conscious mick jagger object ? ` no , we were all good friends and the stones never lived up to their reputation as hard men . ` our manager was a tailor by trade , and he 'd turn up backstage , hoping to sell some clothes on the side . his best customer was keith richards , who 'd buy almost everything he was shown . there was no real rivalry . but we knew our place . and that was immediately before they went on . ' they were innocent times compared to the rock excesses of later years . drink and drugs were for the really louche . ` we 'd spend our days in coffee bars , which were great meeting places . there were very few clubs to go to at night , and they were places to hear new groups rather than get off your head . we 'd go to parties , but they did n't really do anything for us . ` there was very little outrageous behaviour , although i can remember us checking out of hotels in the morning and seeing the lounge piano balanced on the end of the diving board over the pool . did we do that ? who knows ... but we never got into the really wild stuff like throwing tvs out of the window . ' tony and drummer bobby elliott are the only remaining original members of the group 's classic line-up , and even they had replaced previous members as the group began to take off . bass guitarist eric haydock left in 1966 , followed two years later by graham nash , to become part of the supergroup crosby , stills & nash , while singer allan clarke has retired . there have been many stand-out moments in the last 50 years , says tony , not least an ivor novello award in 1993 for their outstanding contribution to british music , and their induction into the american rock 'n' roll hall of fame in 2010 . for a group as clean-cut as the hollies , some of the rock wildness that was played out before them was an eye-opener . jetset : the hollies - -lrb- from left -rrb- bobby elliot , graham nash , bernie calvert , allan clarke and tony hicks - at heathrow , departing for an american tour . on stage , at the albert hall : -lrb- from left -rrb- graham nash , allan clark , eric haydock , tony hicks and bobby elliot . ` in new york we were appearing with little richard . he was a crazy guy . one night backstage i found a cop holding a gun to richard 's head , telling him to calm down . big trouble all round , but i never found out what that was all about . ` richard had a fantastic backing guitarist who was obviously destined for greater things . his name ? jimi hendrix . he got a reputation for smashing his guitar on stage and setting fire to everything . i ca n't see health and safety allowing that now . ` we did try pyrotechnics ourselves , but learned our lesson when we had all these fireworks set up during one show , and they nearly took graham 's head off . we never used them again . in his early days tony had been an apprentice electrician , playing guitar with local group ricky shaw and the dolphins at weekends . he says , ` there was a group called the hollies playing around manchester and they wanted to turn pro , but their guitarist , vic steele , did n't . ' tony did , on the other hand . mild-mannered fun : the hollies celebrating : -lrb- from left -rrb- bernie calvert , tony hicks , bobby elliot and terry sylvester . ` so i was asked if i 'd consider replacing him . i got the bus to go to listen to them but could n't find where they were supposed to be playing . i popped into a club to ask for directions , and the place was packed out . the manageress said ,  oh , everyone 's here to see that new group , the beatles .  anyway , she told me where i could find the hollies , and i went there . for some reason i did n't want to go in , though , so i stood outside , listening to them through an air vent . i liked what i heard , they liked me , and it went from there . ' hicks and his wife jane have been married for 39 years and live in henley in oxfordshire . their son paul , 34 , is a grammy-winning recording engineer who also writes film music and plays in a band with george harrison 's son dhani . tony says , ` so it 's a family business now . when we had our first hit , we wondered if we could possibly stretch it out for two years . half a century has flown by and there 's still no end in sight . ' how did the hollies manage to avoid the rock 'n' roll excesses ? ` it 's the way we were brought up . we never looked for that sort of life . we just relied on our songs . and we must have done something right because we 're still here today .
