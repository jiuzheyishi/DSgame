{"text": "u.s. sen. john mccain says this summer 's ouster of former egyptian president mohamed morsy was  a coup ,  a description that goes against the statements so far from the obama administration . the white house has avoided using that term for the egyptian military 's ouster of morsy .  we have said we share the democratic aspirations and criticism of the morsy government that led millions of egyptians into the streets ... . we 've also said that the circumstances of -lrb- morsy 's -rrb- removal was a coup ,  mccain told reporters in cairo on tuesday . mccain also referred to the ouster as a  coup  in july , but he chose to reiterate that description on egyptian soil at a time when the country is roiling with unrest and violence in the ouster 's aftermath . he and sen. lindsey graham , both republicans , met with officials there to press for a quick return to civilian life . the senators were visiting the country for the first time since its president was removed from office . mccain said they were not in egypt to dwell on the past but to help the country move forward in a peaceful , democratic manner . he and graham also urged the government 's release of political prisoners . graham said violence will destroy a future for egypt , but he expressed optimism . u.s. aid to the country is one of the best investments in the world , he added .  we 're here to help find an egyptian solution to an egyptian problem ,  graham said . for the past 35 days and counting , the country has been strafed with violence during protests by muslim brotherhood supporters against egypt 's military-backed interim government . mccain and graham are expected to meet with government officials tuesday . they 'll also meet separately with the muslim brotherhood another time . the conflict erupted when egypt 's top general overthrew morsy , who became egypt 's first democratically elected president in june 2012 , after popular protests forced the resignation of hosni mubarak , who had ruled the country for 30 years . but a year into morsy 's term , many egyptians wanted him out , too . that 's when the military stepped in , naming an interim president and cabinet , who are laying the groundwork for a transition to a new , democratically elected government . but the muslim brotherhood and its supporters want none of it , taking to the streets and demanding that morsy be reinstated . clashes between the two sides have left more than 200 dead . human rights groups have accused the military of using excessive force . egyptian minister meets with u.s. , eu diplomats about violence . no coup here . the stalemate puts washington in a difficult spot . while widely labeled a coup , the obama administration has refused to refer to morsy 's ouster as such . if the united states formally calls the move a coup , it would have to cut off $ 1.3 billion in aid . and that  would limit our ability to have the kind of relationship we think we need with the egyptian armed forces ,  gen. martin dempsey , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , has said . the united states helps egypt because it 's one of only two arab countries -- along with jordan -- that have made peace with israel . if washington pulls its aid , it could affect prospects for peace in the middle east . egypt explained : 6 key questions . in the past 30 years , only israel has received more u.s. aid than egypt . the american senators , who are making the trip at the request of u.s. president barack obama , will press for an end to the political stalemate .  the egyptian military must move more aggressively toward turning over control to the civilian population , civilian organizations ,  graham , of south carolina , said when asked about the purpose of the trip on cnn 's state of the union on sunday .  the military ca n't keep running the country . we need democratic elections . the -lrb- muslim -rrb- brotherhood needs to get off the streets and back into the political arena and fight your differences there , and we need to put egypt back to work . if this continues , it 's going to be a failed state . that 's why we 're going .  embassies close in face of intercepted message .", "summary": " sen. graham wants  an egyptian solution to an egyptian problem     the circumstances of -lrb- morsy 's -rrb- removal was a coup ,  mccain says .   sens. mccain and graham are traveling at the request of president obama .   a longtime ally of the u.s. , egypt gets $ 1.3 billion in military aid a year .
