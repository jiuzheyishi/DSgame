{"text": "updated : . 18:06 est , 8 february 2012 . federal election officials say john edwards owes taxpayers more than $ 2.1 million in public matching funds improperly received after he dropped his 2008 run for the white house , yet disclosure reports show his failed campaign is still spending freely . edwards ' hopes for the democratic presidential nomination imploded in a sex scandal four years ago that left him facing criminal charges . but reports filed last week show his 2008 primary campaign spent $ 836,712 in 2011 on airfare , hotel rooms , cell phones and other expenses . money trouble : reports filed last week show john edwards ' 2008 primary campaign spent $ 836,712 in 2011 on various expenses - years after his presidential bid imploded . the campaign reported $ 2.1 million in cash remaining as of december 31 , a figure close to what the federal election commission says the former north carolina senator still owes the u.s. treasury . patricia a. fiori , one of four lawyers working for edwards in the fec case , said this week she could not comment , referring questions to the campaign . attempts by the associated press to find anyone who could comment for the campaign were unsuccessful . a phone number ms fiori provided to contact the campaign rang busy for days , even at midnight . judith ingram , the fec 's spokeswoman , said wednesday she could not comment on whether the agency has a pending enforcement action against edwards . indicted : the former senator was charged on june 3 for using nearly $ 1million in illegal campaign funds to help cover up an extramarital affair during his white house run . in a separate criminal case filed by the u.s. justice department last year , edwards , who made millions as a trial lawyer , is accused of concealing nearly $ 1 million provided by two wealthy donors to hide his pregnant mistress as he ran for president . politicians are barred by law from using campaign funds for personal expenses . the required year-end report filed by edwards on january 31 provides little insight into what political purpose some of the campaign 's recent expenses might serve . melanie sloan , executive director of the campaign-finance watchdog group citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington , said it 's not unusual for presidential campaigns to remain open years after the election is over , especially if there is an unresolved audit or unpaid debts . ` all they are allowed to do are activities to wind down the campaign , ' sloan said . ` if these are legitimate expenses , then the edwards campaign should be willing to explain them . ' edwards ' campaign reports show more than $ 15,000 spent in 2011 on airfare , though the destinations or purpose of the travel were not listed . in january , august and december , the campaign spent $ 2,268 for tickets on alaska airlines , a transcontinental carrier that does not offer flights between east coast cities such as raleigh or washington . most of the $ 12,811 in credit card charges for lodging were made to websites such as hotels.com and kayak.com , providing no information about where the rooms were booked , when or for what purpose . more than $ 266,000 was paid for salary , payroll and health insurance premiums , along with $ 1,116 for cell phones . though the campaign appears to have no office , it paid $ 428 to a bottled water delivery company . the largest expense , $ 315,000 , was paid to utrecht & phillips , the washington law firm fighting last year 's unanimous fec ruling that edwards must return its remaining funds to taxpayers . ` not guilty ' : edwards , pictured here with his daughter cate -lrb- right -rrb- after his indictment last year , denies any wrongdoing . the chapel hill street address listed for the number fiori provided belongs to the former office of edwards ' defunct anti-poverty foundation , the center for promise and opportunity . a receptionist for the management company that owns the building said edwards had not been a tenant for more than three years . julius l. chambers , listed as campaign treasurer on last week 's 2011 finance report , is a charlotte lawyer who retired as chancellor of n.c. central university . he did not return calls to his office . chambers ' assistant said he was no longer associated with the edwards campaign . the other woman : edwards is accused of using campaign funds to cover up his affair with rielle hunter , pictured here with their lovechild . lora m. haggard , who co-founded the georgia-based firm h+p political compliance , is listed as receiving an after-tax salary of nearly $ 70,000 from the campaign in 2011 , with paychecks issued every two weeks . her business partner , jay petterson , was paid more than $ 51,000 . ms haggard declined to speak . ` yes , i 'm handling the reports , but as long as the audit process is ongoing i ca n't comment , ' haggard said . she had no contact information for edwards or his campaign , she said . calls to the home of susan w. jackson , a chapel hill woman listed as getting more than $ 34,000 in biweekly payments , were not returned . edward l. niles , a former edwards campaign staffer who got nearly $ 31,000 in consulting fees , said the payments had nothing to do with his current job as targeting director at the atlas project , a political consulting firm in washington . he declined to say what work , if any , he performed for edwards in 2011 . ` you 'll have to talk to the campaign about that , ' niles said . when asked to provide the name of anyone at the campaign a reporter could try to reach , niles said he did n't know of anyone . a male voice who answered the intercom at the locked gate at edwards ' sprawling chapel hill estate hung up when a reporter asked to speak to edwards or anyone affiliated with his presidential campaign . edwards received more than $ 12.9 million in federal matching funds , the money generated from the $ 3 box that taxpayers can check on their tax returns . most of the public money came after he dropped out of the race january 30 , 2008 . for weeks the married candidate had been dogged by tabloid reports of an affair with campaign staffer rielle hunter . after withdrawing from the race and months of public denials , edwards eventually admitted he had fathered hunter 's baby . in july 2011 , edwards was indicted on six criminal counts related to campaign finance violations over the money used to hide hunter during the campaign . he has pleaded not guilty . a trial set to begin january 30 was delayed when edwards ' lawyer revealed in court filings that edwards has a serious heart condition that requires treatment . in the separate civil action , fec auditors concluded earlier this year that edwards ' campaign understated the amount of money it had on hand in its accounts on two separate occasions , failed to itemize more than $ 4.3 million in loan repayments and owed the government nearly $ 142,000 in checks the campaign issued that were never cashed . the federal audit also determined edwards got more than $ 2.1 million in public matching funds after his campaign was no longer eligible to receive such payments . the bipartisan federal election commission voted 6-0 on july 21 to order the edwards campaign to return the money . records show the campaign repaid the $ 142,000 in uncashed checks on sept. 1 , but has thus far failed to return the remaining taxpayer money . health scare : a trial set to begin january 30 was delayed until march when edwards ' lawyer revealed in court filings that edwards has a serious heart condition that requires treatment . edwards , who served a single term as a u.s. senator from north carolina , was the democratic vice-presidential nominee in 2004 . the current year-end report for his 2004 primary campaign , edwards for president , shows that earlier committee still lists nearly $ 334,000 in unpaid bills . about $ 65,000 of that remaining 2004 debt is owed to the chicago firm of democratic political strategist david axelrod , who in 2008 helped then-sen barack obama trounce edwards in the iowa caucuses . john kupper , a senior partner at akpd message & media , said the firm has little hope edwards will ever pay up . ` there have been no negotiations in years , ' kupper said . ` we 've written it off as uncollectible . '", "summary": " reports filed last week show campaign spent $ 836,712 on various expenses in 2011 .   indicted on charges of using campaign funds to cover up rielle hunter affair .   judge agreed to postpone criminal trial to march over edwards ' heart condition .
