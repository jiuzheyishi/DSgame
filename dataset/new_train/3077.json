{"text": "the world 's carbon emissions must be cut to zero by at least 2064 if the planet is to avoid the effects of climate change becoming out of control . scientists from the un have warned that emissions from human activities , such as burning fossil fuels , should hit net zero between 2055 and 2070 to prevent temperatures rising more than 2 °c above pre-industrial levels . other greenhouse gases , such as methane , nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons -lrb- hfcs -rrb- , need to follow suit so that , overall , greenhouse gas emissions reach net zero between 2080 and 2100 . scientists claim that carbon emissions from human activities , such as burning fossil fuels -lrb- pictured -rrb- , should hit net zero between 2055 and 2070 to prevent temperatures rising more than 2 °c above pre-industrial levels . a certain level of carbon is emitted naturally , but the report refers to reducing man-made emission to zero - referred to as net zero . the stark report , by the un environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- said that emissions need to peak within a decade , with all greenhouse gas emissions halving by mid-century , in order to avoid sea levels rising and dramatic weather conditions , such as widespread droughts . countries have already agreed to limit temperature rises to no more than 2 °c - beyond which dangerous impacts of climate change are expected - but unep said that if the world carries on as it is , greenhouse gas emissions will be ` way beyond safe limits ' . it warned that even if countries meet their existing pledges to cut emissions , the world will exceed the amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted to keep temperature rises within safe levels - by 10 billion tonnes by 2020 , and 17 billion tonnes by 2030 . countries have already agreed to limit temperature rises to no more than 2 °c - beyond which dangerous impacts of climate change are expected , such as melting ice caps and rising sea levels -lrb- illustrated -rrb- - but unep said that if the world carries on as it is , greenhouse gas emissions would be ` way beyond safe limits ' to have a good chance of staying below 2 °c , greenhouse gas emissions should drop by around 15 per cent or more by 2030 , compared to 2010 levels , and be at least 50 per cent lower by 2050 on the way to net zero emissions . the report said that there could still be room for some emissions at the end of the century if they are compensated for by measures that take in carbon , such as planting trees , to achieve ` carbon neutrality ' . but delaying taking stringent action now until after 2020 will lead to higher costs and greater risks to society . carbon emissions from human activities must be cut to net zero between 2055 and 2070 to prevent temperatures rising more than 2 °c above pre-industrial levels . other greenhouse gases , such as methane , nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons -lrb- hfcs -rrb- must reach net zero by the end of the century . emissions need to peak within a decade , with all greenhouse gas emissions halving by mid-century . delaying taking action until after 2020 will lead to higher costs and increased risks to our way of life . the emissions gap report is published ahead of un climate talks in lima , peru , which are working towards a new global deal to tackle climate change that it 's hoped will be agreed in paris next year . unep executive director achim steiner said : ` an increase in global temperature is proportional to the build-up of long-lasting greenhouse gases in the atmosphere , especially carbon dioxide . ` taking more action now reduces the need for more extreme action later to stay within safe emissions limits . ' wwf chief executive david nussbaum said the report was another stark reminder of the ` worrying chasm ' between what scientists said needed to be done to avoid dangerous climate change and what governments have promised to do so far . ` if we do n't close this  emissions gap  within this decade , our task will not only become harder and more expensive , but threatens the very survival of some of the world 's most vulnerable communities and habitats , ' he said . ` prevarication and delay are our enemies . as the report rightly notes , postponing rigorous action until 2020 will lock in much higher costs and risks later on . this is an unacceptable legacy to bequeath to our descendants . ` we must end the era of dirty fossil fuels and move to an era of clean renewable energy as fast as possible . ` we can not ignore one of the report 's key findings , namely , that energy efficiency offers a triple win : emissions reductions , energy security and green jobs . '", "summary": " scientists claim that carbon emissions from human activities , such as burning fossil fuels , should hit net zero between 2055 and 2070 .   action will stop temperatures rising 2 °c above pre-industrial levels .   greenhouse gases , such as methane and nitrous oxide , need to follow suit .   un environment programme report says emissions must peak by 2020 .   delaying taking action until after 2020 will lead to higher costs and increased risks to our way of life , experts warn .
