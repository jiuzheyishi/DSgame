{"text": "early this month , jim o'neill , the former goldman sachs economist who coined the term  brics  -lrb- brazil , russia , india , and china -rrb- , appeared on a weeklong bbc series in which he introduced yet another acronym to describe a new group of emerging economies , the  mints  -lrb- mexico , indonesia , nigeria and turkey -rrb- . the brics acronym kindled a lot of interest among investors eager to find the next  big thing ,  while increasing attention to a group of nations that suffered from ongoing economic crisis during the 1990s . but considering that the brics economies have not done so well in recent years , perhaps it 's not a good idea to introduce another acronym . doing so suggests that we focus on these nations ' economies while overlooking key differences in their political , economic , and social welfare systems . while working as goldman sachs ' chief economist in 2001 , o'neill was struck by how fast brazil , russia , india , and china 's economies were growing . this motivated him to introduce the brics acronym in a goldman sachs working paper titled  building better global economic brics .  even from an economic point of view , in recent years , though , the brics have not done so well . brazil 's gdp growth level declined from 7.5 % in 2010 to 0.9 % in 2012 , ; russia 's from 4.5 % in 2010 to 1.3 % in 2013 ; india 's from 10.5 % in 2010 to approximately 4.4 % in 2013 , while china 's decreased from 10.4 % in 2010 to a still substantial 7.6 % in 2013 . using the brics acronym also obscures the fact that these nations are rather different , ranging from democratic to authoritarian regimes . the brics vary considerably in their health and educational outcomes . while brazil and china have relatively successful public health care systems , brazil 's educational system lacks adequate resources and has n't succeeded at building a skilled work force , while china 's education system is producing a large number of skilled college graduates . russia and india 's governments are failing to adequately invest in health and education , the product of a lack of political commitment and inadequate funding . despite the appeal of the mints idea , those countries are not looking too good either . most are seeing lowered rates of economic growth . because of a decline in exports and industrial production , the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- slashed mexico 's predicted gdp growth rate from 3.9 % in 2012 to 2.9 in 2013 and 3.2 % in 2014 . in indonesia , the world bank projected that economic growth will slow from 5.6 % in 2013 to 5.3 % in 2014 , considerably lower than the 6.2 % average in 2012 . according to the imf , however , nigeria 's gdp growth is expected to rise from 6.2 % in 2013 to 7.4 % in 2014 , the product of increased oil exports , economic stability , and increased domestic consumption . yet the situation in turkey is n't as peachy . gdp growth decreased from 9.2 % in 2010 to 3.6 % in 2013 , with an oecd forecast of 3.8 % in 2014 . and just as with the bric nations , the mints exhibit different political institutions . mexico and indonesia are presidential democracies with relatively stable political coalitions . nigeria is also a presidential democracy challenged by political corruption and ethnic conflict . and turkey has struggled with corruption and a lack of toleration for dissent . while mexico and turkey have succeeded in extending universal health care coverage for the poor and providing medical services , their education system , as well as indonesia and nigeria 's , are weak , leading to a low level of college graduates and a small skilled labor force . indonesia and nigeria 's health care systems have also had insufficient resources , doctors and nurses . adopting the mints acronym could lead us to expect too much , too soon . there 's a lot more to an emerging nation than its economy : if citizens lack good health care and access to quality education , the country is unlikely to realize its potential . indeed , even jim o'neill admits that it 'll take at least 30 years to see if the mints become economic powerhouses . therefore , let 's give the mints a bit more time to nurture their economies , strengthen their political institutions , and more importantly , invest in their people before we make them models for the rest of the world . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of eduardo j. gómez .", "summary": " inventor of the brics concept has a new acronym for a group of nations to watch .   eduardo j. gómez : the notion of mints may have similar flaws to the brics .   mint nations -- mexico , indonesia , nigeria , turkey -- face big and different challenges , he says .   give them time to develop further before making them models for the world , he says .
