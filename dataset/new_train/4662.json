{"text": "washington facing low approval ratings and constant republican criticism as his re-election campaign starts up , president barack obama challenged congress on thursday night to put the good of the nation over political benefit and pass a huge jobs plan he proposed . in a speech to a joint session of congress , obama told the legislators to  stop the political circus and actually do something to help the economy  by quickly approving the $ 447 billion package of measures so he can sign it into law .  the people of this country work hard to meet their responsibilities . the question tonight is whether we 'll meet ours ,  obama said to applause .  the question is whether , in the face of an ongoing national crisis , we can stop the political circus and actually do something to help the economy . the question is whether we can restore some of the fairness and security that has defined this nation since our beginning .  obama also told legislators that they should quickly pass his plan , called the american jobs act .  there should be nothing controversial about this piece of legislation ,  the president said .  everything in here is the kind of proposal that 's been supported by both democrats and republicans -- including many who sit here tonight . and everything in this bill will be paid for . everything .  obama said he will ask congress to increase the $ 1.5 trillion target in deficit reduction being pursued by a special joint congressional committee to cover the cost of the american jobs act . he said he will propose his own deficit-reduction plan on september 19 that would reform entitlement programs such as medicare while changing the tax system to end loopholes , lower the corporate tax rate and increase taxes for the wealthy . in essence , obama resurrected his push for a so-called  grand bargain  -- a comprehensive deficit reduction package that includes all the drivers of government spending and deficits , including those traditionally favored and protected by both parties . republican reaction ranged from an expressed interest in trying to work out compromise to outright rejection and criticism of what was labeled a repeat of failed policies from the past . house speaker john boehner , who backed out of talks with obama on a major deficit reduction-deal deal earlier this year , said the proposals the president outlined  merit consideration ,  and added that he hoped for serious consideration by the white house of republican ideas .  it 's my hope that we can work together to end the uncertainty facing families and small businesses , and create a better environment for long-term economic growth and private-sector job creation ,  said boehner , r-ohio . conservative sen. jon kyl , r-arizona , was much more critical .  president obama , perhaps not knowing what else to do , is simply calling for more of the same , as if giving us more of the failed policies of the last two-and-a-half years will somehow yield different results ,  kyl said in a statement .  i believe president obama 's new ` stimulus ' will further delay economic recovery and continue to inflict harm on so many americans .  the senate 's top democrat , meanwhile , said obama 's proposal will present a  litmus test  for republicans .  i hope they -lrb- republicans -rrb- will show the american people that they are more interested in creating jobs than defeating president obama ,  senate majority leader harry reid of nevada said in a statement .  experts from the ratings agencies to federal reserve chairman ben bernanke have said that political gridlock is the main obstacle standing in the way of our economic growth . it is time to put jobs and the economy ahead of partisan politics .  \\ . that point resonated with veteran republican sen. john mccain of arizona , who joked on cnn that the president 's poll numbers were very bad , but  have you seen congress ' numbers ?   we seek approval , too ,  mccain said . according to obama , the purpose of the proposed jobs legislation is  to put more people back to work and more money in the pockets of those who are working .   it will create more jobs for construction workers , more jobs for teachers , more jobs for veterans , and more jobs for the long-term unemployed ,  obama said .  it will provide a tax break for companies who hire new workers , and it will cut payroll taxes in half for every working american and every small business . it will provide a jolt to an economy that has stalled , and give companies confidence that if they invest and hire , there will be customers for their products and services . you should pass this jobs plan right away .  he also told republicans he would take his case directly to the american people , and called on  every american who agrees to lift your voice and tell the people who are gathered here tonight that you want action now .   tell washington that doing nothing is not an option ,  obama said . white house spokesman jay carney told cnn that obama will send congress jobs plan legislation next week . obama 's plan comes as unemployment remains lodged at 9.1 % with no new jobs reported in august , raising fears of a possible return to recession . with 14 months to go until the presidential election , he wants the plan -- as well as the speech to congress to present it -- to clearly illustrate to the american public the ideological differences between his policies and those of the republican right . the mood in the house chamber was jovial before the speech , with vice president joe biden playfully hugging speaker john boehner when he arrived at the dais . democratic legislators repeatedly applauded during the address . house republican and white house sources told cnn that obama called boehner and mcconnell on thursday afternoon to preview the speech . even so , a legislative struggle is certain . republicans call for corporate tax cuts and deregulation as steps to spur job growth , opposing what they label new stimulus spending . the democratic leader in the republican-controlled house -- rep. nancy pelosi of california -- asked the ranking democrats on committees that will consider the legislation proposed by obama to urge their republican chairmen to  schedule immediate hearings and legislative action  on the measures . boehner , meanwhile , invited 12 business leaders -- dubbed  job creators  in his statement -- who have been affected by regulations enacted by the administration to attend the speech . these are  people with real world experience on how the regulations coming out of this administration are impeding their ability to grow their business and create jobs ,  boehner 's statement said . at least five republicans -- two senators and three house members -- did n't plan to attend the speech , which senate minority leader mitch mcconnell said was more of a political event than a policy statement .  by all accounts , the president 's so-called jobs plan is to try those very same policies again and then accuse anyone who does n't support them this time around of being political and overly partisan , of not doing what 's needed in this moment of crisis ,  mcconnell , r-kentucky , said thursday morning .  this is n't a jobs plan . it is a re-election plan .  anticipating such criticism , obama said he was proposing needed and logical measures that traditionally receive broad support .  this is n't political grandstanding . this is n't class warfare . this is simple math ,  he said .  these are real choices that we have to make . and i 'm pretty sure i know what most americans would choose . it 's not even close . and it 's time for us to do what 's right for our future .  obama said his plan would increase the current payroll tax cut to put additional money in the pockets of americans at a cost of $ 175 billion . the current cut , which has cost $ 112 billion so far , allows employees to pay 4.2 % instead of 6.2 % on their first $ 106,800 of wages into social security . obama 's proposal included extended unemployment benefits , which were lengthened to the current 99-week maximum in 2009 . top democrats argue that such money will immediately be pumped back into the economy in the form of new consumer spending . in addition , the plan proposes $ 60 billion for infrastructure development such as repairing roads and bridges , including establishment of an infrastructure bank to help finance such projects . other provisions in the president 's proposal include money to refurbish schools and provide state aid for teachers and first responders , and tax incentives for small businesses to hire the long-term unemployed and military veterans . looking abroad , the president also renewed his push for congressional approval of stalled free trade deals with south korea , colombia and panama . the measures , despite the congressional roadblock , have relatively broad bipartisan support . the president took aim at tea party conservatives who call for deep spending cuts to shrink government instead of the comprehensive approach he advocates .  in fact , this larger notion that the only thing we can do to restore prosperity is just dismantle government , refund everyone 's money , let everyone write their own rules , and tell everyone they 're on their own -- that 's not who we are ,  obama said . he repeatedly urged the legislators to  pass this jobs bill ,  using a rhetorical flourish that regularly prompted cheers and applause form democrats .  no single individual built america on their own ,  obama said .  we built it together . we have been , and always will be , one nation , under god , indivisible , with liberty and justice for all ; a nation with responsibilities to ourselves and with responsibilities to one another . members of congress , it is time for us to meet our responsibilities .  cnn 's alan silverleib , charles riley , jessica yellin , brianna keilar , tom cohen and mariano castillo contributed to this report .", "summary": " new : sen. reid says the plan is a litmus test for republican intentions .   obama wants
