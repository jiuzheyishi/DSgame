{"text": "little miracle : keiron guess recovering from the attack at home with his mother stacey . to see his brave smile , you would . hardly believe that it is only six weeks since two-year-old keiron guess . nearly lost his life when a neighbour 's crazed dog ripped his face to . shreds . the toddler was . given a 50/50 chance of surviving the savaging by the pet , thought to be . a staffordshire bull terrier or similar . although . the dog was destroyed , its owner can not be prosecuted because the . attack took place in a private garden , rather than on a public street . yesterday , . keiron 's parents called for action to close this ` loophole ' in the . dangerous dogs act . unlike in scotland or northern ireland , the law in . england allows ` devil dog ' owners to escape prosecution in cases such as . this . the dog , named ratty , . belonged to 15-year-old shovell king and his unemployed father garfield . king , of swindon . and far from showing any shame or remorse for the . attack , shovell later took to facebook to declare : ` i could n't give a . toss . ' his father blamed the . boy 's parents for not keeping a closer eye on him , insisting : ` if . you 're a parent you have to look after your children 24 hours a day . if . it was n't a dog it could have been a paedophile . ' last . year , during a drugs raid at the house , the dog had attacked two police . officers and not even a blast from a taser stun gun could subdue it . yesterday , . keiron 's mother , stacey drury , 22 , said : ` you do n't see a child looking . like keiron , because they do n't normally survive an attack like that . ` doctors gave keiron just a 50/50 chance of survival . it 's nothing short of a miracle that he is here at all . ' before the attack : the toddler needed seven hours of surgery to rebuild his face after being attacked by shovell and garfield king 's staffordshire bull terrier ratty outside his home in swindon . keiron . spent a week in a coma , and even when he came round it was several days . until the family realised the sight in one of his eyes had been saved . ` like father , like son ' : garfield king , whose 15-year-old son shovell said he ` could n't give a toss ' that his dog had savaged little kieron . his . father anthony guess , 25 , said : ` we were n't sure how much he would be . able to see out of his eye until my dad visited and he shouted out , .  grampie ! ' keiron is now . out of hospital , but his mother says : ` he used to be happy and smiley . all the time . now he does have bursts of anger . and he has terrible . nightmares and he 'll wake up dripping with sweat and screaming and . thrashing about . ` he saw a dog in the street the other day and he was petrified and said ,  dog bite , dog bite !  . ' the . couple told of the moment when doctors gave them just ten seconds to . kiss their mauled son goodbye before taking him for immediate surgery , . warning that it could be their last chance to see him alive . miss . drury said : ` i could n't kiss his face -- it was n't there any more . so i . kissed his stomach and told him ,  mummy loves you  . ' it . is only thanks to the expertise of surgeons who performed a ten-hour . operation that keiron , who had to have most of his face reconstructed , . survived . the attack . happened on the jubilee bank holiday weekend early last month , as the . couple were at their home with keiron and their other son , four-year-old . mackenzie . keiron 's . grandfather , dave guess , 49 , had been helping to renovate the family 's . bathroom and walked out to his van when the two boys followed . their . mother , who is pregnant with the couple 's third child , said : ` seconds . later we came out . we could see mackenzie -- but not keiron . ' they . began a frantic search and realised that the toddler had wandered into . the kings ' back garden only when another neighbour yelled : ` a dog 's got . him ! a dog 's got him ! ' despite . being bitten himself , mr guess snr managed to get keiron away , and his . son said : ` i saw dad with keiron cradled in his arms , but it did n't look . like keiron . ` all i could see was bubbles of red coming out of his face . his nose had gone . ` his eye was ripped open . basically his whole face had been ripped to shreds . ` it was horrific -- like something from a horror film . not something you see in real life . ' paramedics . arrived within minutes , followed by an on-call doctor , police cars and a . helicopter ambulance which landed in the nearby park . during the mayhem , keiron 's ear , which had been found near the scene , was handed to paramedics in a handkerchief . aggression : two pit bull-style dogs seen leaping up at shovell king 's house near to where keiron was attacked . mr guess jnr recalled : ` stacey was on the floor crying . some bloke was trying to comfort me because i was just in tears . ` you 're . meant to protect your kids are n't you ? more than anything i was angry .
