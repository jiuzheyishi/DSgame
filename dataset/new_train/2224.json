{"text": "filipinos are used to typhoons . i grew up in the philippines knowing it has two seasons -- the  wet  and the  dry .  more than 20 typhoons whip through the philippines in a year . i could smell the rain when it was coming . i knew that if the moon had a ring around it , there would be rain the next day . i knew that the excited twittering of birds also meant rain was coming . at a young age , i could gauge just how strong the typhoon was , not only based on the storm signal warnings , but on how thick and dark the clouds were , how heavy the rain fell , how strong the wind blew . it became instinctive to know how dangerous a storm was . in cebu city , where i grew up , a siren would blow the warning signals when a typhoon was approaching . storm signal no. 1 meant rain and some wind , but we still went to school . no. 2 meant stronger rain and wind . we were excused from school , but it was safe enough to go to the movies or to a friend 's house . we would also listen to announcements on the radio . we knew a storm was coming , but the radio news gave us an inkling of its severity . we took storm signals nos. 3 and 4 seriously and stayed indoors because it meant the rain and wind were very powerful . the streets would flood ; branches of trees could break ; trees could be uprooted , corrugated metal roofing could come loose and fly about , electric power lines could break . it was dangerous to be outside . we stayed home with canned goods , water , candles and matches , because it was a given that electricity and telephones would be cut off during typhoons . we waited out the storm in the safety of our homes . that 's how it is ; that is what the filipinos expect and do when a storm is coming . even before the western media started focusing on super typhoon haiyan , i 'd been following the news on the internet . friends in cebu , philippines , who had just been battered by the 7.1 magnitude earthquake last october 15 , were giving me a blow-by-blow account as they hunkered down and waited for haiyan . after the super typhoon passed , someone jubilantly e-mailed ,  we survived .  facebook pictures were posted of the damage in cebu city , which did n't look too bad : streets littered with debris , trees uprooted , cars flipped over on their sides , some roofing damaged , store signs askew . and so for a few hours at least , a sense of relief washed over me -- until a friend received a text message from the parish priest of odlot in northern cebu : .  church no more roof and ceiling . 95 % of parishioners homeless . we need help . food and water .  deep inside , i had known that a country ca n't get away unscathed when a super typhoon like haiyan hits it , and the text from father desuyo brought me back to reality . as communications resumed , the world understood the awful destruction that haiyan had wrought in samar , leyte , northern cebu , and other parts of central philippines . it has been painful to see images of villages destroyed , of people wandering around in the midst of all the rubble , of survivors holding up signs begging for food and water . what i find most nerve wracking are the pictures of the dead lying by the roadside or under rubble . filipinos have much respect and love for their dead , and so these images indicate just how desperate survivors are that they ca n't take the time to bury their loved ones . i ca n't help but wonder what went so wrong . why were filipinos caught off guard ? why did n't the government plan better for haiyan -- or yolanda , as the super typhoon is called in the philippines ? why have so many people died ? why are survivors left on their own ? i have no doubt that the survivors and victims of haiyan had done their part : like they always have , they had stocked up on basic necessities and hunkered down in the safest place they could think of . but here 's the thing : even though filipinos knew that haiyan was the strongest typhoon in recorded history to make landfall , they did not have the collective memory of something this powerful . no one expected the great destruction of haiyan . no one expected its 15 - to 20-foot tsunami-like surge . here 's the irony : many people died in the evacuation centers or gymnasiums or churches where they sought refuge , from drowning and from the buildings collapsing . here 's a fact : the death toll will rise because the philippines has 7,100 islands , and in those islands , many coastal villages have not yet been accounted for . now , haiyan will never be forgotten . the super typhoon is part of the filipinos ' collective memory , when before , it was unimaginable . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of cecilia manguerra brainard .", "summary": " cecilia brainard grew up in the philippines ; where people deal with about 20 typhoons a year .   she says signal 1 meant rain and some wind ; 2 was no school , 4 was hunker down .   everyone took shelter as usual , she says , but haiyan was beyond anyone 's experience .   brainard : now , super typhoon haiyan will haunt filipinos ' collective memory .
