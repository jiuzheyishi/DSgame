' the official announcement of the twins was only made last month , with the palace releasing a statement that read : . ` the prince and princess of monaco are happy to confirm they are expecting twins at the end of the year . ' with an average of 3.5 sets of twins born per 1,000 pregnancies , an instant family of two babies - even royal ones - is n't unusual . georg friedrich , prince of prussia is one royal parent of twins , who with wife princess sophie of isenberg welcomed carl friedrich and louis ferdinand in 2013 . another is crown prince frederik of denmark and his wife mary , who became parents to prince vincent and princess josephine in 2011 . prince louis alphonse , duke of anjou is yet another royal father of twins , following the birth of prince louis , duke of burgundy and prince alphonse , duke of berry , to his wife maría margarita vargas santaella in 2010 . but although royal twins are fairly frequent among european dynasties , among them the monégasque couple , british royals are an entirely different story with just one set born in the last 2,000 years . born to king james i of scotland and his wife joan beaufort in 1430 , alexander and james were the first and only twins born to british royal parents . tragically though , alexander , the eldest of the two , died before reaching one - with his younger brother later taking the throne of scotland as james ii . during his marriage to mary of guelders , james sired no fewer than seven children , all of them in separate pregnancies . despite the lack of british royal twins , odds have shortened on another double birth - for the duke and duchess of cambridge - taking place . while the monégasque rules of succession are clear , the british rules are n't set in stone , although as the new baby - or babies - will be spares , the question of who inherits what is less vexed . in theory , with prince george already in the royal nursery , the new babies would come behind him with the elder becoming the spare while the younger would have no real role . as for which parent is responsible for the monégasque royal twins - or the british ones , should they come to pass , consultant gynaecologist dr andrew paterson says both could be behind a multiple birth , although the mother is the more likely candidate . ` twins are not genetically based , ' he explains . ` monozygotic twins are more rare and when a single fertilised egg divides in two , creating identical twins . ` another way is when a mother release two eggs at ovulation and both are fertilised , creating non identical twins . ` if either the mother or the father have twins in their family , the chances of them having twins is higher .
