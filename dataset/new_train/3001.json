{"text": "a family who moved home so they could send their son to a primary school found they were still outside the catchment area - and now face 12 bus journeys a day to take him elsewhere . parents kelly , 26 , and david taylor , 33 , of huddersfield , west yorkshire , uprooted so five-year-old aiden could go to the same school where he attended nursery . but the family soon found out that they were still outside the catchment area - by just a dozen houses - and were refused a place after a council allocated them a school further away . bus stop : kelly taylor , of huddersfield , west yorkshire , is pictured with her five-year-old son aiden . the boy 's father faces 12 bus journeys to take aiden and his brother justin to school . because of the decision , mr taylor will now have to make 12 bus journeys a day - two buses in each direction , six times - to get both aiden and his younger brother to the correct school and back . the family moved in may last year to ensure that aiden was able to go straight from nursery with his friends to st thomas church of england primary school in the bradley area of the town . but aiden has been home-schooled since september while his parents battle to get him into the school where he went to nursery . his brother justin , three , currently attends the nursery where his mother and her siblings also went to school . but the couple have lost an appeal for aiden to attend - as the school is said to be full . however , the family home is about half a mile from st thomas - while rawthorpe st james church of england school , which has been offered by kirklees council , is around 1.5 miles away . and if aiden ends up having to attend rawthorpe st james , the family will also move justin there , resulting in the 12 bus journeys for mr taylor each day . ` he 's bored ' : aiden 's parents moved house so he could go to the same school where he attended nursery - but the family soon found out that they were still outside the catchment area . map : as a consequence of the council 's decision , mr taylor will now have to make 12 bus journeys a day across huddersfield in order to get both aiden and his younger brother to the correct school and back . justin , three , currently attends nursery at st thomas church of england primary school , which is half a mile from the family home . aiden , five , is currently home-schooled . if aiden ends up going rawthorpe st james church of england school , which has been offered by kirklees council , the family will also move justin to the nursery there . two buses are required to make it from the family home to rawthorpe st james . and because justin will take part in half-day nursery , the father would have to take him into school separately to aiden . this would therefore result in : . aiden was first on the list for a place at st thomas but the family have heard that another child has moved into the catchment area and leapfrogged them despite living further away from the school . mother-of-two mrs taylor , a senior healthcare support worker , said : ` if aiden got in then there would be more chance that justin would get in because he would have a sibling there . ` we 've all got links to the school and we still think it is a really good school . i would say it is a slim to none chance that he will get in now that he has dropped down to second place on the list . ` another child has moved in to the catchment area but they are further away from the school than us . the road opposite us are in the catchment area and if we had moved into the end of our road we would have been fine . ` the council allocated him rawthorpe but it is much further from us then st thomas is . when we moved we just assumed it was ok because it is so close to the school . ` it 's hard to get hold of a map of the catchment areas and the first time we saw one was when i registered him for the reception . he was already in the nursery and we just assumed he would move up . ` the woman at the school showed me a map and i thought it wo n't make much difference but we got a letter through from the council saying he had been allocated rawthorpe . mummy : mrs taylor said the family are ` devastated ' at not being able to get aiden into their preferred school . where aiden 's parents want him to go : the family moved to ensure aiden was able to go straight from nursery with his friends to st thomas church of england primary school -lrb- pictured -rrb- in bradley , huddersfield . ` the school said  oo you 're just outside  and i never thought it would n't make a difference . if you look at the map it 's such a small difference you might not even see it . the line on the map just skips our house . ' ` devastated ' : mrs taylor , pictured with aiden , said the family spent # 1,000 to move closer to the school . the family spent # 1,000 to move closer to the school and are not planning to move again as they do not believe it will guarantee their children a place . mrs taylor said : ` we are devastated . we have considered moving again to be inside the catchment area but we have worked out it would cost us # 1,380 and that would only move him up to first , not guarantee a place . ' if the family accepted the council 's offer , they would also put justin in the rawthorpe nursery , which would involve a total of 12 buses a day for the boys ' self-employed car valeter father , mr taylor . there is a school bus but aiden is said to be afraid to travel alone . mrs taylor said : ` i ca n't drop aiden off at school due to my working hours and his father does n't drive , so it would mean 12 buses a day for david including half-day nursery for justin . ` aiden has a phobia , he wo n't go alone on the school bus , and he does n't adjust very well to change . i explained all this at the appeal but they did n't seem interested . ` he 's getting bored of being home schooled and he just wants to see his friends . i 'm trying to keep him interested and keep him in a routine but it would be better if he was in a school . ` it did start off very well but now we are very concerned as aiden seems bored , and his behaviour has drastically deteriorated . we are constantly trying to keep him cheerful , but it is stressful . ' the appeal officers also suggested aiden could attend christ church academy in the deighton area of huddersfield , despite being told it was full by the kirklees officer present . further distance : the family home is about half a mile from st thomas school - and rawthorpe st james church of england school -lrb- pictured -rrb- , which has been offered by kirklees council , is around 1.5 miles away . gill ellis , the council 's assistant director for learning and skills , said : ` children are more likely to be allocated to a particular school if they live within the catchment area . ` all reception places at st thomas were already full . places were allocated based on the school 's oversubscription criteria and we were unable to allocate any more - an independent appeals panel has supported that decision . ` our advice to parents is always to state more than one preference when applying for a school place . when an application only names one preferred school , and when that school is full , parents can only be offered a place at the nearest available school . ` if a family also name a school that is within their catchment area , this can help in securing a place nearer to home . whilst we sympathise with any family in this situation , it does highlight the important of naming more than one school preference .
