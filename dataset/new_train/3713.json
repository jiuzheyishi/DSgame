' asked why the goals have dried up in recent weeks , with united scoring just five times in their last six games in all competitions , mata replied : ` i do n't know why . i 'm sure we will create chances again and i 'm sure we will score goals again because we have very good strikers and very good midfielders . the chances will come for sure , hopefully this saturday . ` we 've played very good football in some games , especially in november and december . we have to look back at how we did it and to do it again -- because i think we can do it . ` the way the manager wants to play is attractive for the fans and attractive for the players . i really like it . it 's just a matter of doing it how he wants . ' mata was on the scoresheet -lrb- right -rrb- as united won 3-0 against fierce rivals liverpool in december . mata has settled in among a growing number of spanish speaking players at old trafford following united 's # 150m transfer spending last summer . he added : ` sunday was one year exactly . obviously last season was not the best year in the history of the club but i 'm very happy here . ` i 've scored some goals , i 've assisted on with some goals . i 'm looking forward to doing it more and more and trying to help the team get back to fighting for the title . this is what we have to do . ' the arrival of angel di maria , radamel falcao and ander herrera has increased the competition for places among united 's gaalacticos . it has led to problems accommodating them all but mata insists that he is happy with his playing time this season . angel di maria -lrb- right -rrb- is one of many spanish speakers at old trafford , along with mata . ` he is trying is to put the players in positions for the sake of the team , ' said the 26-year-old . ` obviously we have a lot of players and it 's difficult for him to figure out how to do it . ` i guess it has to be difficult for the manager to choose from all the players we have , especially in attack . but i think it is also good for him because he has so many options . ` he is experienced enough to handle it . for me personally , i feel very good and i 'm just trying to help the team with my qualities . ` i think you have to see it after the season has gone to see how many games i play , to see how important i was for the team . i feel important and i 've played a lot of games so far so i 'm happy . ` there is a lot of competition for the first xi in the team , not just for me , so i 'm happy that i 've played a lot of games and i 'm looking forward to playing more before the end of the season .
