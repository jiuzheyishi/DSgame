{"text": "one of the jurors who acquitted george zimmerman said she had  no doubt  he feared for his life in the final moments of his struggle with trayvon martin , and that was the definitive factor in the verdict . the woman , who was identified just as juror b37 , spoke exclusively to cnn 's  anderson cooper 360  on monday night . she is the first juror to speak publicly about the case . she said she believes zimmerman 's  heart was in the right place  the night he shot martin , but that he did n't use  good judgment  in confronting the florida teen .  i think george zimmerman is a man whose heart was in the right place , but just got displaced by the vandalism in the neighborhoods , and wanting to catch these people so badly that he went above and beyond what he really should have done ,  she said . fringe protesters turn violent in la after zimmerman verdict .  but i think his heart was in the right place . it just went terribly wrong .  if anything , zimmerman was guilty of not using  good judgment ,  the juror said .  when he was in the car , and he had called 911 , he should n't have gotten out of that car ,  she said . she also said she believes martin threw the first punch in the confrontation that followed .  i think george got in a little bit too deep , which he should n't have been there . but trayvon decided that he was n't going to let him scare him ... and i think trayvon got mad and attacked him ,  she said . zimmerman felt his life was in danger before shooting martin , and it was his voice that was heard screaming for help in 911 calls , the juror said she believes .  he had a right to defend himself ,  she said .  if he felt threatened that his life was going to be taken away from him , or he was going to have bodily harm , he had a right .  race perhaps simplest disagreement in post-trial cnn interviews . split vote . an initial vote was divided . three of the jurors first voted zimmerman was guilty , while three voted he was not guilty , she said . juror b37 was among those who believed he was not guilty from the start .  there was a couple of them in there that wanted to find him guilty of something and after hours and hours and hours of deliberating over the law , and reading it over and over and over again , we decided there 's just no way , other place to go ,  she said . jurors were not identified by name during the trial , which sparked a broad debate about gun laws and race in america . the juror said she did not believe zimmerman profiled martin , who was african-american , because of the color of his skin . now that he 's free , can zimmerman make a living ? she believes he thought martin was suspicious because of the way he acted .  anybody would think anybody walking down the road , stopping and turning and looking -- if that 's exactly what happened -- is suspicious ,  she said .  i think all of us thought race did not play a role ,  the juror said .  we never had that discussion .  juror : jeantel was n't a good witness . at one point during the interview , she grew emotional and her voice cracked . she said jurors cried after putting in their vote .  it 's a tragedy this happened . but it happened ,  the juror said .  and i think both were responsible for the situation they had gotten themselves into . i think both of them could have walked away . it just did n't happen .  martin 's friend ` upset , angry ' by verdict . book plans canceled . the juror was planning to write a book about her experience with the case , literary agent sharlene martin said before her interview aired . but hours later , the agent released a statement from juror b37 saying she would no longer write one .  now that i am returned to my family and to society in general , i have realized that the best direction for me to go is away from writing any sort of book and return instead to my life as it was before i was called to sit on this jury ,  the juror said .  i realize it was necessary for our jury to be sequestered in order to -lrb- protect -rrb- our verdict from unfair outside influence , but that isolation shielded me from the depth of pain that exists among the general public over every aspect of this case .  verdict does n't end debate in martin 's death .", "summary": " the juror says she will no longer write a book about the trial .   the juror says she believes both zimmerman and martin could have walked away .   an initial jury vote was split -- three guilty , three not guilty -- she tells cnn .    his heart was in the right place . it just went terribly wrong ,  the juror says about zimmerman .
