{"text": "dhaka , bangladesh the bangladeshi government has been asked to find a compromise to bring an end to the grameen bank crisis created by removing its founder , microcredit pioneer muhammad yunus .  we remain hopeful that a compromise solution can be reached to the satisfaction of all parties ,  said robert o. blake , u.s. assistant secretary of state for south and central asian affairs , as he was wrapping up his four-day bangladesh visit on tuesday . yunus  has brought great honor to bangladesh , and we in the united states have been deeply troubled by the difficulties he is currently facing ,  blake said at a press conference at american club in dhaka . blake said failure to achieve a compromise would have some effect on bilateral relations between the two countries .  as a friend and partner of bangladesh , we are concerned about the dampening effect this will have on civil society in general and on the integrity and effectiveness of grameen bank in particular ,  he said .  we see it is a distraction and an unnecessary departure from all great work being done in bangladesh ,  he said . blake , who arrived in dhaka on saturday , met with prime minister sheikh hasina ; khaleda zia , leader of the opposition in parliament ; finance minister ama muhith ; senior government officials , yunus and civil society members . earlier this month , the 70-year-old yunus was removed from grameen bank , which he founded three decades ago . the central bank of bangladesh , the regulatory authority in the south asian nation , cited his age in explaining his removal as managing director . the government , which has a 25 % stake in grameen , said the bank 's rules required yunus to end his service when he turned 60 . yunus challenged the order and filed a petition with the high court , which finally upheld the government order . yunus and nine directors of his grameen bank again filed two petitions with the appellate division of the supreme court seeking a stay of the high court order . the petitions are now pending with the appellate division , and the case is expected to come up for hearing by the end of march . grameen 's work cast a global spotlight on microcredit , a then-novel idea of making small loans to poor people who would not qualify for standard bank loans . for their efforts , yunus and grameen bank won the nobel peace prize in 2006 . he also was awarded the american presidential medal of freedom and a congressional gold medal . blake said of yunus :  his work over the past decades to lift millions of women out of poverty is internationally recognized .  as blake met hasina , also present was former world bank president james d. wolfensohn , one of the founders of friends of grameen , an international forum supporting yunus and his grameen bank . he was in dhaka on a private visit . earlier , u.s. senator john kerry , d-massachusetts , said in a statement that he was  deeply concerned  about the efforts to remove yunus as managing director of the bank .  the international community will watch this situation closely , and i hope that both sides can reach a compromise that maintains grameen bank 's autonomy and effectiveness ,  said kerry , who is chairman of the senate foreign relations committee .  institutions like the grameen bank make a significant contribution to bangladesh 's development and democracy , and professor yunus ' lifelong work to reduce poverty and empower women through microloans has deservedly received worldwide attention and respect ,  kerry said . yunus ' supporters have said the government 's effort to remove him has little to do with age and much to do with opposition to microcredit and grameen 's execution of it . critics of microcredit have charged that lenders were making big money from small loans . others have suggested that the actions against yunus are politically motivated , a claim denied by the government . yunus ' supporters say he has been under fire for criticizing politicians and trying to form his own political party four years ago during an interim , unelected , military-backed government . that party was later abandoned .", "summary": " state department official says u.s. is  deeply troubled  by the situation .   yunus and nine grameen bank directors have petitions pending before appeals court .   nobel peace laureate muhammad yunus was removed as head of bank he founded .
