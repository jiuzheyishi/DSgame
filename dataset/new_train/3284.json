{"text": "car manufacturers may be working on eco-friendly cars using hydrogen fuel cells and ` green ' electricity . but three amateur inventors have come up with a steam-powered bike that uses sustainable wood chips for fuel . the cornish trio are testing their bike on local moorland and hope their biogas engine could one day be used to power homes and other machines in a more eco-friendly way than diesel . scroll down for video . a new approach to cycling : three amateur inventors have come up with a steam-powered bike that uses sustainable wood chips for fuel . richard backborow , graham waldren and mat thompson are pictured from left to right . the machine is endorsed by celebrity chef hugh fearnley-whittingstall and is a cross between a bicycle and trike . it works by woodchips being burnt inside the contraption 's biomass engine , which gives off gas that is condensed into steam . rather than pedalling , the rider uses their feet to pump air into the ` expansion motor ' to generate one horsepower -- making the machine three times more powerful than the average cyclist . inventor craftsman graham waldren designed and built the bike with his friends richard blackborow , a gallery curator , and mat thompson , who works in healthcare . friends in high places : the machine is endorsed by celebrity chef hugh fearnley whittingstall -lrb- pictured -rrb- and is a cross between a bicycle and trike , relying on wood chips for fuel . for when the chips are n't down : the bike works by burning wood chips -lrb- pictured -rrb- inside the contraption 's biomass engine , which gives off gas that is condensed into steam . rather than pedalling , the rider uses their feet to pump air into the ` expansion motor ' to generate one horsepower . the bike uses wood chips for fuel . the chips are burnt inside the contraption 's biomass engine , which gives off gas that is condensed into steam . rather than pedalling , the rider uses their feet to pump air into the ` expansion motor ' to generate one horsepower -- making the machine three times more powerful than the average cyclist . they are currently testing their new technology on moorland near zennor , cornwall and hope one to day to see it power homes and other devices . mr waldren said : ` no-one has made any developments in steam technology for 200 years . ` the motoring manufacturers are locked into what they are doing . the funding does n't exist for this . ` once we can put together the engine it will be a platform to demonstrate what we are doing and give us data . ' the bike can currently do around 25 miles for every 2.2 lbs -lrb- 1kg -rrb- of wood chips and takes about five minutes to start up . mr thompson explained : ` it wo n't replace the car , it might not work for bikes , but -lsb- it may work -rsb- for a small generator , for taking you off grid . the unusual bike is being put through its paces on the moors of zennor in cornwall -lrb- shown on this map -rrb- . the trio of inventors hope one to day to see their biogas engine power homes and other devices . here , they release a flame from the prototype engine . ` we do n't have a lot of trees in cornwall but there will be countries that could use this technology . ' the trio say renewable energy experts from the university of exeter have expressed an interest in their designs . they are currently raising funds via the crowdfunder website for further research into the so-called phoenix project , which is backed by river cottage boss fearnley-whittingstall . he said : ` i ca n't resist getting behind these guys , if only so i can get a step closer to my dream of a carbon neutral wood-chip powered flail mower for river cottage . and maybe an eco-jet ski . '", "summary": " three inventors from cornwall came up with the steam-powered vehicle .   they hope the biogas engine could one day be used to power homes .   wood chips are burnt inside the vehicle 's biomass engine and riders pump air into an ` expansion motor ' to generate one horsepower .   invention is being tested on moorland near zennor and the machine is endorsed by celebrity chef hugh fearnley whittingstall .
