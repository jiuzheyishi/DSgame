{"text": "bullying and campaigns of abuse were ` endemic ' in a secretive police union which ` cynically exploited ' the plebgate scandal , a damning report reveals today . hardline members of the police federation ` disgracefully ' hounded senior officers , threatened dissenting staff with the sack and used ` guerrilla ' tactics to halt government plans to shake-up pay and conditions , it says . federation chairmen and politicians - including home secretary theresa may - routinely suffered ` personalised ' attacks from militant officials determined to scupper sweeping reforms . hardline members of the police federation , pictured , ` disgracefully ' hounded senior officers , threatened dissenting staff with the sack and used ` guerrilla ' tactics to halt government plans to shake-up pay and conditions , the report says . important business was discussed ` aggressively , in public , at 10 o'clock at night after a considerable amount of alcohol had been consumed ' , a whistleblower told the home affairs select committee . the cross-party panel of mps also criticises the federation for ` unnecessarily ' stashing # 70million of members ' money - including some in hidden so-called ` no. 2 accounts ' held by local branches - and hand back # 120 each police officers . and the committee warns if the notorious organisation - effectively a union - fails to reform , it would be ` derelict ' of the government not to introduce tough new laws . police minister damian green has already fired a shot across the bows of the organisation - representing 125,000 rank-and-file officers - by ordering it to act ` in the interests both of the police and the public ' to avoid legislation . the scathing report comes ahead of the federation 's annual conference in bournemouth next week . members will vote on a package of reforms recommended in an independent review by ex-home office mandarin sir david normington . the federation is still reeling from the fallout from plebgate which led to the resignation of tory chief whip andrew mitchell , its political campaigning and the mail 's revelations about ` extravagant ' credit card spending and off-shore accounts . a survey of rank-and-file officers found almost 75 per cent thought the federation did a ` poor job ' speaking up for members and 91 per cent said it ` should change ' . federation chairmen and politicians - including home secretary theresa may , pictured , - routinely suffered ` personalised ' attacks from militant officials determined to scupper sweeping reforms . the 23-page report said the federation had treated successive national chairmen - including outgoing steve williams and paul mckeever , who died last year - ` quite disgracefully ' . they endured ` persistent attempts to undermine and destabilise ... by bullying and personal attacks ' . in a letter written to the federation 's 30-strong top committee , mr williams wrote that he had ` continually been criticised , ridiculed and verbally ridiculed ... and my integrity questioned ' over his stance on the normington review . he added : ` whilst accepting emotions are running high in the advent of inevitable change , at times i have genuinely felt that i have been gratuitously and cruelly bullied and humiliated . ' the report said chairmen trying to implement reforms became ` enmired in interminable , internecine power-struggles which would not have been out of place in a medieval court . ' mps also attacked the federation 's decision to appoint a controversial public relations firm run by former radio ` shock jock ' jon gaunt - the son of a policeman - as a ` serious error of judgment ' . the organisation secretly paid # 10,000-a-month for advice on using ` guerrilla tactics ' against the government weeks before the plebgate scandal . the hostile media strategy called for a military-style ` blitzkrieg ' to halt radical change . in september 2012 , then chief whip mr mitchell and a policeman clashed at the gates of downing street . mr mitchell was accused of calling police officers ` f ****** plebs ' - something he has always vehemently denied . he has insisted the row was hijacked by federation officials for political ends . keith vaz , the committee 's labour chairman , said : ` we were shocked by the scale of bullying that we found at the federation 's headquarters ' earlier this month , mr gaunt admitted he saw the plebgate affair as an ` absolutely fantastic ' opportunity to promote the police agenda . but the strategy backfired because three officers who called for mr mitchell 's resignation following the incident have been sacked and a fourth , pc keith wallis , 53 , was jailed for misconduct after admitting lying about witnessing the row . branding the contract with mr gaunt ` inappropriate ' , the committee said he had ` damaged , rather than enhance ' the organisation 's reputation . it said : ` mr gaunt cynically sought to exploit the plebgate incident as part of a manipulative media strategy which included what he described as  blitzkrieg  and  guerrilla  tactics . this entire episode does the federation no credit at all . ' the report follows a string of revelations by the mail on accusations of bullying and lavish spending by the federation . concerns were raised over significant amounts of money put through on corporate mastercard credit cards , with some four-figure bills believed to have come after a conference organised by the scottish police federation last november . officials were also accused of bullying at the federation 's plush # 26million headquarters in leatherhead , surrey , which was built in 2007 and boasts a 55-room hotel with a bar , swimming pool and 11 two-bedroom grace-and-favour apartments . keith vaz , the committee 's labour chairman , said : ` we were shocked by the scale of bullying that we found at the federation 's headquarters . it rivals any popular soap opera . ` it is disgraceful that any chairman should have been hounded out for championing long-overdue reforms . ' he added : ` our police service is the best in the world but its reputation has been extensively damaged by the federation suffering a sustained period of self-inflicted harm .
