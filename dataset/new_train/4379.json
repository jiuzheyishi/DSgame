{"text": "by 2050 , minorities will be the majority in america , and the number of residents older than 65 will more than double , according to projections released thursday by the u.s. census bureau . the census bureau looks at 2000 results and assumptions about future childbearing , mortality rates and migration . minorities , classified as those of any race other than non-hispanic , single-race whites , currently constitute about a third of the u.s. population , according to census figures . but by 2042 , they are projected to become the majority , making up more than half the population . by 2050 , 54 percent of the population will be minorities . minority children are projected to reach that milestone even sooner . by 2023 , the bureau said , more than half of all children will be minorities .  part of it is a higher fertility rate for some of the minority groups , hispanics in particular ,  said dave waddington , chief of the census bureau 's population projection branch , which issued the report .  those groups also tend to be more of the childbearing age . non-hispanic white people tend to be a little bit older .  the projections are based on census 2000 results and assumptions about future childbearing , mortality rates and net international migration , the bureau said . the group predicted to post the most dramatic gain is the hispanic population . it is projected to nearly triple , from 46.7 million to 132.8 million , from 2008 through 2050 , the bureau said . its share of the total u.s. population is expected to double from 15 to 30 percent .  thus , one in three u.s. residents would be hispanic ,  the census bureau said in a news release . the african-american population is projected to increase from 41.1 million to 65.7 million by 2050 , going from 14 percent of the u.s. population to 15 percent . the asian-american population is expected to increase from 15.5 million to 40.6 million , or from 5.1 percent to 9.2 percent of the population . among the remaining races , the bureau said , american indians and alaska natives are projected to increase from 3.9 million to 8.6 million , going from 1.6 percent to 2 percent of the u.s. population . native hawaiian and pacific islanders are expected to more than double , increasing from 1.1 to 2.6 million . in addition , the number of u.s. residents identifying themselves as being of two or more races is projected to more than triple , increasing to 16.2 million from its current 5.2 million , the census bureau said . meanwhile , the non-hispanic white population is not expected to post dramatic gains in the same period . by 2050 , whites are expected to number 203.3 million , slightly increased from the 2008 number of 199.8 million . whites will comprise 46 percent of the u.s. population by 2050 , down from the current level of 66 percent , the bureau said , as the group is projected to lose population in the 2030s and 2040s . by 2030 , all baby boomers will be age 65 and older -- comprising nearly 20 percent of u.s. residents , or one in five americans , the bureau said . by 2050 , the 65-and-older age group will increase to 88.5 million , more than doubling its current number of 38.7 million . meanwhile , the number of those age 85 and older is expected to more than triple , from 5.4 million in 2008 to 19 million by 2050 . non-hispanic whites make up most of the baby boomers , waddington said .  they 're in a higher mortality rate ... nonminority groups tend to be older and dying off faster  instead of reproducing at the rate projected for minorities . obviously , the projections will have  very strong policy implications ,  he said -- medical care for an increasingly elderly population , for instance , educational needs for increasing numbers of minority children and economic effects for the labor force .  who 's going to do the jobs that are characteristically held right now by certain types of people ?  waddington said .  all those things are subject to change .  the united states is projected to reach the 400 million population milestone in 2039 , according to bureau projections . by 2050 , the population is expected to be 439 million . of those , 235.7 million are expected to be minorities . as u.s. cities and towns have increasingly become more diverse , census officials knew the day of a majority minority would come , waddington said . and  the aging one is sort of simple ,  he added .  that 's demography 101 .  other highlights from the report released thursday : . • by 2050 , 62 percent of the nation 's children will be minorities , up from 44 percent today . of those , 39 percent are projected to be hispanic , up from 22 percent in 2008 , and 38 percent are projected to be white , down from 56 percent in 2008 . • the percentage of the u.s. population between the ages of 18 and 64 -- the  working age  population -- is projected to decrease to 57 percent in 2050 from 63 percent in 2008 . • the working-age population will become more than 50 percent minority in 2039 , and by 2050 will constitute 55 percent of the population . • by 2050 , the working-age population will be more than 30 percent hispanic , up from 15 percent in 2008 ; 15 percent african-american , up from 13 percent in 2008 ; and 9.6 percent asian , up from 5.3 percent in 2008 . waddington said the timelines are not written in stone .  it 's a projection . and things like the baby boom generation could n't be predicted .  major changes in policy affecting families and children , or a major policy affecting immigration , could have an impact on the expectations , he said . the nation 's undocumented workers -- estimated at 12 million or more -- are included in the projections , waddington said . census data includes all u.s. residents , regardless of their legal status , he said . cnn 's ashley broughton contributed to this report .", "summary": " census : by 2050 , 54 percent will be other than non-hispanic , single-race whites .   number of u.s , residents older than 65 expected to more than double .   hispanic population projected to make the largest gains .   census official says the timelines are not written in stone .
