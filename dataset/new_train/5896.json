' longevity : the couple first met in 1942 at a dance at the town hall -lrb- where they had an argument over who would dance with mary -rrb- . dance partners : ` we met in the town hall at a dance . i used to love dancing and that was something we used to do often in those days ' said mary . the couple first met in 1942 at a dance at the town hall in hessle near hull when edwin was stationed from his role as an anti-tank rifle operator with the south lancashire regiment during world war two , and mary worked in an aircraft munitions factory . they married just eight months later on january 2 , 1943 in hessle parish church . mary said : ` we met in the town hall at a dance . i used to love dancing and that was something we used to do often in those days . family : couple have 10 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren . ` edwin asked if he could have the last waltz and i said yes . it turned out that he was arguing with a friend over who would ask me and edwin won - so you could say we even met because of a row .

' ` despite our little tiffs we are still as firmly in love now as we were back them . i do n't think the majority of people these days who are getting together will last like we have . ` the problem is it 's too easy for people to pack marriage in rather than stay together now and give it a go . ` when edwin tells me off for not putting things away after i 've used them i just tell him i 'll put them away when i 'm good and finished with them .
