{"text": "how do you follow a phenomenon like frankel ? it is 18 months in april since one of the greatest horses ever to grace the planet retired in a blaze of glory , with his 14th race win from 14 starts to take his career earnings just shy of # 3 million -lrb- $ 5 million -rrb- . it led to a rating of 147 from timeform , making him the highest-rated horse since the records began . his trainer henry cecil , who passed away last year following a battle with cancer , said of the horse with a top speed of 42 mph :  he 's the best i 've ever seen . i 'd be very surprised if there 's ever been a better horse .  frankel was once described as a  lightning strike of genetics , which may not be repeated for 100 years .  jockey tom queally was on board for the duration of his career and likens him to the  usain bolt of horse racing .   really , you can compare him to any of the greats in any sport , in fact in any walk of life and that 's him . he was just head and shoulders above everyone else .  today , frankel stands in a luxury stable at banstead manor stud in southeast english county of suffolk , fed and watered and walked out to breed with the world 's fastest and most famous horses . the world 's wealthiest horse owners pay # 125,000 -lrb- $ 210,000 -rrb- for every impregnation , as they try to unearth the next frankel . in his first season alone , he covered 133 mares . queally admits that part of him will be excited to get the opportunity to ride these offspring in future , but he is also under no illusions about the reality of life after frankel . following that last race , he asked :  everything 's going to be an anticlimax after frankel is n't it ?  in reality , he knew the answer .  no-one can compare to frankel , no one will ever compare to him as every moment spent on his back was a special moment ,  the irishman told cnn .  there 's different eras in different sports and inevitably people will always make comparisons . but i 'm a realist , i know i wo n't ever ride a horse like that again . it 'll be fun to ride his impact . i think we 'll still see frankel 's impact on horse racing in that regard . i think he 'd like the idea he 's still making a mark .  frankel 's temperament is not quite like that of some of the great racehorses , who are often jittery , tetchy animals , highly sprung and highly strung . in contrast , frankel has always been a fairly placid soul . but even a year and a half on from that moment he last delighted packed stands as he ripped up the turf at ascot to win the champions stakes , queally can still easily recall his majesty .  he was just a superstar , pure and simple ,  says queally .  he had an enormous amount of ability and he just dominated simply because he was far superior to everyone else . he had a lovely temperament and was just very professional in every way imaginable .  he was n't that easy to ride to start with -- he had a bit of a hold but he just got easier . i think part of it was down to his intelligence . he was such a quick learner and , by the end of it , i 'd just push a button and he 'd go . there was never once a time when i thought he 'd lose .  life after frankel has changed markedly for queally and those around him . after cecil passed away , aged 70 , queally -- who had been the official jockey at the trainer 's warren place stables in newmarket -- has since opted to go freelance . a once great team has dissipated but frankel lives on , as does the memory of what he achieved . queally 's home is littered with memories of him , from the trophies to photographs of the pair 's famous victories . however , queally has seen him just once since their final day in action together , but there remains an indelible bond between jockey and horse .  i know it sounds strange but we got on well ,  he says .  i 'd chat to him a lot when racing , trying to relax him or maybe just me .  it seemed important as there was always such hype when we raced . i would n't say there was pressure as i was always happy on his back , and really i always knew the result .  but the issue for queally is that he has achieved his career high , at least in terms of the absolute class of the horse that follows him . however , he now distances himself from that earlier  anticlimax  comment .  there 's an element of anticlimax in that they 'll never be another one like him , but then there 's two other parts ,  he explains .  one is that i was very lucky to have ridden him in the first place but the other thing is that i have other career goals .  as a freelance rider , you hope to get some top rides . basically how it works is my agent will get contacted about certain rides and then they get lined up . i still want to compete in the top races immaterial of who i 'm riding , to win things like the der however , one thing he is aware of is that should he ride another trailblazer of the track , the comparisons will inevitably come to the fore .  i know that the first question i 'll be asked about will always be frankel ,  he says .  and i 'm okay with that .
