{"text": "nursing both a badly broken arm and a fractured leg , you would think i could reasonably expect a little sympathy -- especially in a doctor 's surgery . what i got was the opposite . arriving at my gp practice for a check-up , i found that the cast on my arm plus the orthopaedic boot i was wearing made it difficult to use the touch-screen system to announce my arrival -- so i queued to ask the receptionist if she would check me in at her computer instead . but rather than taking a few seconds to help me out , with a look of triumph in her eyes she sneered : ` why do n't you use your other hand ? ' and sent me hobbling back to the screen . left shaken : jeannette kupfermann was shocked by the callous treatment she received from her gp 's receptionist . i was fairly shaken , but did n't argue because so many gp 's receptionists appear to have diplomas in sour-faced indifference . the callous , supercilious , rude and apathetic attitude of many of them must surely top most people 's list of complaints against the nhs . when we are sick , vulnerable and anxious , the surgery is our first point of contact . yet all too often the waiting-room staff are less guardian angels than dragons at the gate . i 've heard complaint after complaint about the bad attitudes encountered by my friends and family . many have spoken of their frustration at being fobbed off and even lied to . many , like me , felt dehumanised and humiliated . none are surprised to read stories of people treated appallingly by their gp 's admin staff , such as the woman last month who was forced to wait outside by a busy road after a doctor 's receptionist said her sick 16-month-old baby was crying too loudly . rarely , if ever , are these people challenged , as they hold us over a barrel . while i accept there are plenty of good , hard-working doctors ' receptionists out there who strive to help patients , i also know there are many who can be real battleaxes . an offended receptionist equals no appointment . but after my own upsetting experience , i told my doctor what had happened . he seemed at a loss to explain and apologised . i later wrote a strong letter to the practice manager , who told me that not all staff had received their full training yet , as if that were any excuse . but as we all know , this kind of attitude tends to be the rule -- and for the elderly , in particular , it can be a nightmare . it often starts with a phone call you 've been poised to make since dawn , as having your finger on the redial button the moment surgery phone lines open is your only chance of getting through . each month , 23 million people -lrb- more than three times the population of london -rrb- visit their gp surgery or practice nurse . my friend peggy , a 92-year-old widow from kent who suffers from several painful illnesses that need continual monitoring , recently had a shocking experience . ` i was ringing to get some blood test results , ' she told me . ` it was difficult getting through , but eventually i spoke to a receptionist and told her i 'd been asked to make an appointment to see or speak to the doctor about them . ` she told me to hang on a moment while she spoke to the doctor . i waited and waited . a good 15 minutes passed before i had to hang up . ` an hour later i rang again , and when i got the same woman i asked her why she 'd left me hanging on the phone . she replied rudely :  because i had nothing to tell you .  ' eventually , peggy rang again and was put through to another receptionist who also put her on hold . dragons : like ros from monsters inc. many waiting room staff leave patients feeling humiliated and dehumanised . ` she promised me faithfully she 'd call back , ' says peggy . ` but again i waited and waited . it 's been days now and i have n't heard a thing . ' to me , this illustrates perfectly all that is going wrong at reception -- especially with the elderly , who get anxious about problems but are brushed off like irritating flies . no wonder they are so disheartened and either give up -- putting their health at risk -- or go to a&e . and every busy working mother will identify with the frustration of berkshire woman elizabeth harris . ` i 'd managed to get an appointment about getting some acne lotion for my 14-year-old daughter , ' says elizabeth , who is in her 40s . ` i saw the doctor , got the prescription and went next door to the pharmacy , where i was told that the lotion was n't available any more . ` i rushed back into the surgery -- i was already late for work and had to fit in another appointment -- but by then there was a long queue . ` i explained what had happened to the receptionist and asked if there was any chance she could ask the doctor if she could write me another prescription . ` she just said :  no , i ca n't . you 'll have to ring in the morning to see the doctor again .  i pointed out that the next day was saturday , when they took only emergencies , but i might as well have been talking to a brick wall . ' it 's no surprise that figures released in 2012 showed that complaints to family doctors were running at 1,000 a week , with a rise in grievances about surly receptionists . complaints : many others share jeannette 's frustrations . so what has gone wrong ? ` the nhs sometimes forgets that it 's a service provider and should put the patient first , ' says one senior nurse . ` there are too many people trying to get into too few surgeries , and doctors condone their receptionists ' behaviour because it keeps the patients at bay . ` it reflects the state of everything else in the nhs -- but that does n't excuse their terrible manner . ' heather adlam , a business trainer who runs workshops for gp receptionists to help them improve their communication skills , agrees . ` we think we 're getting something free and do n't have the right to expect too much , ' she says . ` but it 's not  free  . ` it 's part of the insurance we took out with the government -- we 've all paid an awful lot into it . ' as for me , i believe the situation simply reflects how impersonal gp surgeries have become . providing forms to fill out , stating your level of satisfaction with all stages of a gp visit , might help.this way , patients could remain anonymous . after all , none of us wants to deal with confrontation and risk not getting an appointment . but until we do so -- in a civilised way -- and end the intimidation , this callousness will continue .", "summary": " nursing broken bones , jeanette was shocked by callous gp receptionist .   all too often waiting room staff are less guardian angels and more dragons .   in 2012 complaints to family doctors were running at 1,000 per week .   many patients are left feeling dehumanised and humiliated .   getting an appointment becomes a frustrating struggle .
