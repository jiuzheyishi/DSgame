{"text": "on the same day that thousands of women stood up to participate in one billion rising , billed as the largest mass action to stop violence against women and girls , the sad news came from south africa that yet another woman was killed . the reason we took notice of 30-year-old reeva steenkamp 's death among so many others killed every day is the shocking news that the man charged with killing her , her boyfriend , is none other than oscar pistorius , the athlete known as  blade runner ,  a double amputee whose olympic feats on prosthetic carbon fiber legs made him an international superstar . we do n't know what the investigation will uncover , but steenkamp 's life is now lost . coincidentally , the pistorius case happens around valentine 's day , the date that rising activists marked to bring focus on the crisis of violence against women . nike 's bullet ad with pistorius backfires . brutal attacks against girls and women have stirred the world 's conscience with increasing frequency in recent months . there is no question that many societies are finally becoming fed up with the much-too-common practice of attacking , raping and killing women that goes on in all corners of the world . the perpetrators of these crimes are invariably cowards , using superior physical force to intimidate or exert power . we have come to know some of their victims . remember malala yousafzai , the pakistani girl targeted by the taliban because she proclaimed that every girl has a right to an education . she has survived and vowed to continue her struggle despite the taliban 's promise they will try to kill her . the contrast in courage could not be starker . then there is nirbhaya , the new delhi university student who was gang raped in a bus . she died of her horrific injuries , but her assault moved india and the entire world so deeply that her legacy has fueled the battle to stop this violence . earlier this month , in a case gruesomely reminiscent of nirbhaya , 17-year-old anene booysen was raped , mutilated and left for dead , in the south african city of capetown . just as malala has inspired girls to demand an education , nirbhaya has awakened india to the need for better laws and law enforcement to protect women . and , until the authorities get their act together , fierce indian girls are learning self-defense . no wonder the billion rising celebrations have been such a hit all over india . organizers say  risings  are taking place in 203 countries . if true , that means women in a majority of countries on earth could heed the call to stand , and to dance . yes , to dance as a sign of  solidarity , purpose and energy  to  shake the world .  a global push to end violence with song and dance . amid the celebration , however , it 's important to keep in mind what the occasion marks . according to u.n. statistics , one in three women will experience violence in her lifetime , including beating , rape or assault , making such violence a more prevalent problem than aids , malaria or any other disease . it means 1 billion women alive at this moment will become part of that statistic , hence the one billion rising . women used to keep their assaults quiet , out of shame or fear of being ostracized . but less so today . there 's lara logan , the cbs correspondent attacked by thugs in cairo 's tahrir square while covering the egyptian revolution , one of countless women assaulted in egypt by gangs of men . some female democracy protesters , fighting for their rights , were later subjected to  virginity tests  by the egyptian military . the problem has deep roots and far-reaching ramifications . women have endured the use of rape as a weapon of war , and domestic violence as a tool of control at home . domestic violence is one of those old traditions that should have died long ago . a 2012 study by unicef found most youngsters in india believe wife-beating is justified . but other surveys found the problem knows no national boundaries . the u.n. says about 14,000 russian women die every year from domestic violence . in some countries , women are subjected to violence as retaliation for other family members ' or their own perceived offenses in so-called  honor killings .  in war zones , fighters rape women to humiliate their enemies , to perpetrate  ethnic cleansing  and to force people to leave . an incredible 92 % of liberian women in one study said they had been raped in that country 's war . as you read this , women are being raped in syria , in the congo and in other countries where wars rage . after the violation , many of them will be rejected by their families . violence against women tends to go hand in hand with lack of equality . it also is a sign of a malfunctioning society . it is a stubborn problem , but one that responds to measures , such as those just approved after a perplexing political battle in the united states . as the world changes , as countries emerge from poverty and people fight for their rights , we can look to the level of violence against women as one of the gauges of their success . the arab human development reports of 2002 and 2005 said the low status of women is one of the reasons arab countries had stagnated , calling the rise of women  a prerequisite for an arab renaissance .  pistorius ' south africa , a country with a storied history in the fight for racial equality , has a disturbing record of violence against women . around the world , the awareness and determination of women to stand up to violence are a major step forward . but tragedies such as the killing of steenkamp in south africa , one of countless occurring just today , are a reminder of the urgency of the cause . any country , any society that wants to move forward and earn a place of honor among the nations must make it a priority to teach men from the earliest age that violence against women in any form is unacceptable , and those who hurt or intimidate women should be punished .", "summary": " one billion rising mass action is raising awareness of violence against women .   frida ghitis : oscar pistorius faces murder charges in death of his girlfriend .   ghitis says people are taking notice , with the assault on malala , the death of nirbhaya .   ghitis : the death of steenkamp is a reminder of the urgency of the cause in
