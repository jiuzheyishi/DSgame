{"text": "a worker at the fukushima nuclear plant accidentally pushed a button turning off power to the four badly damaged reactors yesterday . japan 's nuclear regulation authority said that a worker carrying out inspections had turned off pumps injecting cooling water into the unstable reactors . the plant operator , tokyo electric power co , or tepco , pours hundreds of tonnes of water a day over the reactors to keep them cool after a devastating earthquake and tsunami in march 2011 triggered meltdowns and explosions . a worker at the fukushima plant accidentally turned off power to key cooling systems yesterday , but japan 's nuclear regulator sought to reassure people that a backup system had immediately kicked in . despite the employee 's blunder , officials say a backup system kicked in immediately . it is just the latest in a string of worrying mishaps which reveal just how vulnerable the power plant still is , two years on from the disaster . earlier this year , tepco lost power to cool spent uranium fuel rods at the plant after a rat tripped an electrical wire . and just last week the company also found that 430 litres of highly radioactive water had leaked from one of the hastily built storage tanks . reactors three -lrb- left -rrb- and four -lrb- right -rrb- were badly damaged in the natural disaster which caused the worst nuclear emergency since chernobyl in 1986 . the tank lacked a gauge designed to warn people when it is dangerously full , meaning workers overfilled it . tepco said the water spilled out of a concrete barrier surrounding the tank and believed that most of it reached the sea via a ditch next to the river . a further 300 tonnes of contaminated water leaked into the ocean back in august , which is on top of the 300 tonnes of groundwater which the company admitted could be seeping into the ocean per day . japan 's government stepped up support for the embattled utility last month , pledging half a billion dollars to help contain contaminated water . fires burned for days at the plant following the 2011 crisis as workers struggled to cool the nuclear fuel . as well as battling to keep the reactors stable , tepco is also in the middle of a complex decommissioning plan which could take decades to complete . yesterday 's mistake has seen the company 's shares drop 7.6 per cent as confidence drains away from the embattled energy provider . the continuing disaster is the worst nuclear accident anywhere in the world since an explosion at now-infamous russian power station chernobyl in 1986 . fires burned for days at the shattered plant while workers slept in contamination masks on lead floors just 300 meters from the reactors which spewed radiation into the atmosphere . they were left to survive on emergency rations after drivers , fearing radiation poisoning , refused to take supplies to the site . conditions got so bad that an army of hundreds of pensions - dubbed the ` suicide corps ' - volunteered to take on work to spare the 1,000 or so younger people who were drafted in . the mistake highlights just how vulnerable the power station still is , even two years on from the disaster . tokyo electric power company are in the process of decommissioning the plant , but admit it may take decades -lrb- picture from 2011 -rrb- . the dangers faced by those at the site was underlined in july this year when masao yoshida , the boss of fukushima , died from cancer aged just 58 . yoshida stayed at his post following the tsunami and lead efforts to stabilise the reactors , despite fearing several times that he and his workers would be killed and the crisis went from bad to worse . even now , levels of radiation around the plant are dangerously high . in january this year a fish caught in the ocean nearby had 2,500 times the legal limit of radiation allowed for human consumption . a series of nets have been installed under the water to prevent the contaminated fish migrating , but scientists are still worried these fish could be eaten by larger predators , passing the radiation along . the fish showed no signs of mutation , and so would be indistinguishable from a healthy animal .", "summary": " worker accidentally pushed button cutting power to water pumps .   hundreds of tonnes of water must be injected into reactors every day .   japan 's nuclear regulator said backup system kicked in immediately .   over 300 tonnes of contaminated water have leaked in last three months .   that is on top of 300 tonnes of groundwater seeping into pacific every day .
