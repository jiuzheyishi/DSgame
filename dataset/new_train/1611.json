{"text": "boys really are more competitive than girls ... but only if they come from rich families , say researchers . a study of 15-year-olds found there was a gender gap in the risks they were prepared to take to make more money in a series of maths tests . the norwegian youngsters were able to earn one krone if they answered a simple question correctly or three kroner if they gambled on the harder option . boys are from mars ... the study found that among well-off participants , boys were much more aggressive than girls . professor bertil tungodden said that both biology and culture impact the results . of the boys , 51 per cent chose the competitive alternative , compared with 31 per cent of the girls . but when the researchers , from the norwegian school of economics in bergen , asked participants about their family circumstances , it became clear class was an important factor . the scientists found that boys from poor families were on the same level as girls from a similar background . but among the well-off participants boys were much more aggressive . professor bertil tungodden , of the norwegian school of economics , . bergen , believes if biology is the decisive factor it has consequences . for politics . he said : ` our point is if the difference in . competitiveness is a result of women being discriminated or oppressed it . lends legitimacy to politics which aims to balance this difference . ` however , . if our finds primarily reflect basic biological differences the . challenge becomes how to relate to this . ` of course it is never only the . one or the other . we believe both culture and biology are at play here . ' a similar american study from 2007 found 73 per cent of the men were competitive , against just 35 per cent of the women . cultural impact : according to professor tungodden the studies indicate a lack of competitiveness may be a reason why women do not become top leaders . earlier research among the maasai tribe in tanzania , a very patriarchal group , found the men were most competitive whereas women wear the trousers in the matriarchal khasi people of india . they were even slightly more competitive than the maasai men . prof tungodden said : ` based on these finds it has been argued competitiveness is culturally determined . ` while it is one thing to look at cultures which are extreme in terms of gender differences , what may be found in the most gender equal society in the world ? ` if measures towards gender equality works in regard to competitiveness the gender differences ought to be smaller in countries such as norway . ' but that is not the case . according to prof tungodden there are dramatic gender differences among the top executives in norway , with just ten to fifteen per cent women . he said : ` the studies indicate a lack of competitiveness may be a reason why women do not become top leaders . ` this does not necessarily mean they ought to compete more . perhaps we need to think differently about the way we recruit top leaders . the most competitive candidate is not necessarily the best leader . '", "summary": " boys from poorer families on the same level as girls from similar background .   among the more well-off participants , boys were much more competitive .   both biology and culture affect competitiveness , claims norwegian study .   suggests that it may be the reason there are not more women leaders .
