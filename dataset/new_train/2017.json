{"text": "remember the celtic tiger ? it was billed as a dream for ireland ; emigration slowed as tech giants like apple , dell and intel set up manufacturing plants on the outskirts of dublin . they were attracted by a young , well-educated english-speaking island in the heart of the euro zone . other foreign firms set up call centers and back office operations , attracted by a corporate tax rate at 10 % -lrb- now 12.5 % -rrb- . dublin buzzed and property prices shot up . banks were encouraged to loan money to the fast growing building sector and everyone was flipping houses as prices soared . then it spread to the rest of the country as tax breaks led to housing estates being built in remote parts of the country , miles from services and jobs . these loans were then bundled up and used by the bankers and builders to invest in property overseas . everyone seemed happy . we know what happened next . by november 2010 the government went cap-in-hand to europe and the imf for an 85 billion euro -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- bailout as the country took on all the debt of collapsing banks . with that came massive austerity ; about 20 % of the country 's gdp has painfully been cut -- through budget cuts such as social welfare reductions , pension freezes , tax rises . three years on . where is ireland now ? the answer lies in dublin . as the city led the bust , it 's clear that the capital is leading the recovery on the back of social media . and i am promised it 's different this time . once empty buildings and warehouses in the docklands are filling up with the next generation of young well-educated irish graduates working at the next generation of american tech names -- google , facebook , twitter , trip advisor , ancestry . there are also japanese , chinese and german tech firms setting up here , attracted by the language skills they ca n't find at home . the cloud has come to dublin and is enveloping the silicon docks . there certainly is an argument that some of these firms are attracted by more than a multilingual young employment pool . even with a rock-bottom corporate tax rate , some of the firms use tax efficiencies to not even pay that on their european sales . but looking beyond that , having these firms growing in dublin has led to a score of much smaller , indigenous start-ups riding on the back of the bigger boys who set the tone . and they can be right next store thanks to plenty of cheap office space -- space none could have affording five years ago . this simply did not happen when the likes of dell was assembling pcs on the outskirts . now , next to them are also the incubators , private equity firms , coffee shops and hip new hotels that all seem to be needed for this kind of area to thrive . so , where greece and spain have surely lost credibility in the eyes of the business community , ireland has actually gained traction . it 's benefited so much from the changes , that forbes magazine just named ireland as the best place in the world to do business -- a first for ireland . it may not sound ideal for employees , but forbes pointed out that real wages fell 17 % during the height of the crisis , and with unemployment near 13 % , there is a large pool of well-educated young people looking for work . add to that the controversial 12.5 % corporate tax rate , and forbes wrote  ireland still maintains an extremely pro-business environment .  what about the rest of the country ? the recovery is far from reaching everywhere . emigration from villages has soared as many small firms , built on the back of construction , collapsed . others that may have focused on exports-led industries that suffered when europe and the usa went through the economic crisis . social welfare payments have been slashed , and contributions to charities have been slashed too , seen as a  perfect storm  for the poor as one charity told me . of course the unemployment rate falls when people leave . charities say the long-term unemployed are n't about to get these social media jobs , nor even the ancillary jobs in the bars and hotels . so , the government is using groups like  connect ireland  to tempt more companies to the areas outside dublin and cork . but many mortgages are under water , house prices are only now beginning to go higher , and the government will continue to slash budgets in 2014 . now it also has to attract investors to buy its bonds on the open market so the country can start to pay back that 85b euro loan . it has to achieve all this without a healthy bank sector and with unemployment still in double digits . look around dublin and you can see the change -- building cranes are popping up , shops and pubs are buzzing and traffic jams are back . it 's unlikely to spread to the rest of the country anytime soon , if ever , and it 's unlikely to ever be labeled the  celtic tiger  again . shall we call it the celtic cloud ?", "summary": " in 2010 , ireland asked for an 85b euro bailout as it took on collapsed banks ' debts .   massive austerity followed , with approximately 20 % of the country 's gdp cut .   three years on , forbes has named ireland the best country to do business in .   jim boulden says dublin is leading its recovery on the back of social media .
