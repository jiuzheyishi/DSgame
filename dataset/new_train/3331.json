{"text": "professor sir bruce keogh , pictured , has warned of the risks to cross-border healthcare in the event of a yes vote in the referendum . a vote for independence would create a ` hadrian 's wall of health ' between england and scotland , the medical director of nhs england warns today . writing exclusively in today 's mail , professor sir bruce keogh warns of the risks to cross-border healthcare - with 44,000 scottish patients treated in england last year alone . in a separate warning , scotland 's struggling nhs is facing devastating cutbacks of # 450million under the snp , an explosive secret dossier has revealed . the confidential paper seen by the scottish daily mail , kept under wraps in the run-up to the referendum , shows that health board chiefs are preparing to make huge savings in 2015 and 2016 . sir bruce today destroys alex salmond 's claims that a no vote could lead to the destruction of scotland 's devolved public health service , pointing out that ` the people of wales , england or northern ireland could not privatise the scottish nhs even if they wanted to ' . nhs england chief executive simon stevens also waded into the referendum debate last night , arguing that a yes vote means a ` bilateral agreement ' may have to be drawn up to allow scots patients access to specialist health services in england . that mean hundreds of patients currently on the waiting list could face an even longer delay for life-saving heart , lung and liver transplants . even though it has been fully devolved to holyrood since 1999 , the future of the nhs has been put at the forefront of the battle for independence by the snp . mr salmond and his ministers have claimed that voting for separation is the only way to protect scotland 's nhs budget -- which can be indirectly affected by health spending in england - and the spread of ` privatisation ' from south of the border . however , any private contractors in england are still paid from the public purse , and the budget for england 's nhs is scheduled to increase from # 105.6 billion in 2013-14 to # 110.4 billion in 2015-16 . the world-renowned institute fiscal studies last week revealed how the scottish government has actually been cutting health services in recent years while there have been funding increases in england . now , a document released to the mail shows how scotland 's nhs chiefs discussed ` significant challenges ' and further cutbacks at a meeting on august 6 . former prime minister gordon brown used a speech today to accuse the snp of ` perpetrating a lie ' about protecting the nhs with independence . the snp are ` perpetrating a lie ' about protecting the nhs with independence because holyrood already has the power to keep the health service in public hands , former prime minister gordon brown has said . mr brown said the nationalists should make way for a labour government in scotland if they continue to insist they are ` powerless ' to protect the nhs without a yes vote in the independence referendum . the snp has argued that the health service north of the border is at risk due to health policies at westminster , despite the area being devolved to the scottish parliament . speaking at a campaign event in clydebank , west dunbartonshire , mr brown said : ` the nhs lie of the scottish national party has been exposed . the scottish parliament can keep the nhs in public hands with its existing powers . ` if the snp continue to say they are powerless to protect the nhs in scotland , let them make way for a labour government in scotland and we will protect the nhs . ' mr brown said the labour party would never allow the health service to be privatised in scotland . ` it is the snp who are perpetrating a lie about what the nhs can and can not do in scotland , ' he said . ` over these next few hours , you must remind the people in scotland the nhs has the powers and the scottish parliament has the powers to fund the health service , to protect the health service , to stop any privatisation , and to keep the health service in public hands . ' it estimates a reduction in day-to-day spending of # 210million in 2015-16 , rising to # 224million in 2016-17 , warning that annual savings will need to increase from 2 per cent to 3.5 per cent . ` significant revenue pressures will be realised in 2015-16 and 2016-17 , primarily due to the combined effect of a reducing increase in baseline funding , the project impact of the pension revaluation -lsb- contribution increases -rsb- and loss of national insurance rebate and the cost of funding of the drugs budget -- largely due to changes to access to rare and ultra rare drugs , availability of new treatments or extending use to new indications , ' it states . ` the total savings required will be # 400million-to - # 450million in addition to savings required in 2014-15 . ' it adds : ` limited time is available to plan for 2015-16 and 2016-17 and immediate action is required to collectively assess the options that will ensure that nhs scotland can operate within its overall allocation and that we can continue to provide quality , safe and effective care to our constituent populations . ' last night , scottish labour leader johann lamont said : ` these papers show that the snp have a secret agenda to cut health spending after the referendum . ` alex salmond was elected on a manifesto to protect health spending and now he is planning cuts but has decided not to tell anyone until after thursday 's vote . ' writing in today 's mail , professor sir bruce keogh argues against ` trivialising ' the challenge facing health services with 'em otional political soundbites ' . and in a new report , simon stevens , the chief executive of nhs england , states : ` the scottish parliament has run its own nhs for the past 15 years , with freedom to set its own health spending . that will continue regardless of the result of their independence referendum . ` however , scottish patients currently make use of a number of specialist health services throughout england , such as heart/lung/and other organ transplants as well as numerous specialist cancer treatments . alex salmond , pictured , and his ministers have claimed that voting for separation is the only way to protect scotland 's nhs budget . a vote for independence would create a ` hadrian 's wall of health ' between england and scotland , the medical director of nhs england warns today . ` were scotland to decide to cede from the united kingdom , the legal status of scottish patients wishing to access these services south of the border would change . ` this would require a new bilateral agreement , or if scotland were accepted into the eu/european economic area then scottish patients could in theory be treated here on the same basis as , say , a patient from belgium or slovakia . ' responding to the leaked document , a scottish government spokesman said : ` we have and will go on protecting and increasing the nhs budget , and our latest # 12.1 billion resource budget reflects a funding increase in real terms for both 2014-15 and 2015-16 . ` more than # 1.5 billion has been ploughed back into frontline services through efficiency savings in nhs scotland over the last six years thanks to the three per cent target set by this government . ` this paper is part of the regular discussions among nhs leaders to plan for nhs scotland 's future . health boards have submitted their plans for how they continue to deliver quality care and treatment within their allocated funding . ` like all healthcare systems around the world , scotland 's nhs needs to continue evolving . ' no campaign 's fury over secret nhs cuts as charles kennedy makes bid to be union 's unlikely saviour . charles kennedy and danny alexander today hit out at alex salmond for suggesting that scottish independence could save the nhs . the two liberal democrat heavyweights pointed to a secret report warning that scottish health services face # 400million of cuts as proof that the nhs is not safe in the snp 's hands . their intervention came as mr kennedy , the former party leader , was being promoted as an unlikely last-minute saviour of the union . the lib dems unveiled a new campaign poster with a huge picture of mr kennedy on the side , leading him to say ` they 're keeping the best till last ' . billboard : the liberal democrats today sought to put forward charles kennedy as a ` big beast ' of the union campaign ; mr kennedy is pictured alongside danny alexander , jo swinson and willie rennie . mr salmond has repeatedly insisted that the nhs in scotland will be subjected to increasing privatisation if the uk stays together . but at a campaign event in glasgow today , mr kennedy reminded voters that the nhs , bbc and pound had been created using the resources of the whole of britain . ` these achievements were built without borders , and to put down artificial borders in the 21st century is absurd , ' he said . ` the snp ran up the flag of fear , saying that if you vote no you would be complicit in bringing about the break-up of the nhs . ` but ministers have been sitting on a report warning of a # 400million shortfall in the nhs in scotland . ' fightback : mr alexander and mr kennedy both claimed that the nhs would face huge cuts under the snp . mr alexander , the chief secretary to the treasury , added : ` the big news on the nhs is the # 400million of cuts . ` we know that a yes vote would mean deep cuts to public services , year after year after year . ' the use of mr kennedy on the new poster suggests that the ex-leader , who was forced to resign in 2006 after struggling with a drinking problem , is being set up as a ` big beast ' who can tackle the charismatic alex salmond in the run-up to thursday 's vote . ` maybe they 're keeping the best till last , you never know , ' he said today - after pointedly describing himself as a member of the ` scottish liberal democrats ' . mr alexander added : ` charles is one of the most respected political figures here in scotland . ` it 's very important that people hear from charles kennedy and the liberal democrats . ' junior minister jo swinson , the mp for east dunbartonshire , said : ` charles is a fantastic asset . he 's well-loved - he absolutely the right person to be the liberal democrat representative .
