{"text": "when candida l. gutierrez 's identity was stolen , the thief did n't limit herself to opening fraudulent credit and bank accounts . she assumed gutierrez 's persona completely , using it to get a job , a driver 's license , a mortgage and even medical care for the birth of two children . all the while , the crook claimed the real gutierrez was the one who had stolen her identity . the women 's kafkaesque nightmare puts a face on ` total identity theft , ' a brazen form of the crime in which con artists go far beyond financial fraud to assume many other aspects of another person 's life . the scheme has been linked to illegal immigrants who use stolen social security numbers to get paid at their jobs , and authorities fear the problem could soon grow to ensnare more unsuspecting americans . defrauded : houston school teacher candida gutierrez , pictured had her identity stolen several years ago and has been battling with the government since . gutierrez learned her identity had been hijacked when she was turned down for a mortgage more than a decade ago . now she trudges to the social security administration with her birth certificate , driver 's license , passport to prove her identity . ` when she claimed my identity and i claimed it back , she was informed that i was claiming it too , ' said gutierrez , a 31-year-old houston elementary school teacher . ` she knew i was aware and that i was trying to fight , and yet she would keep fighting . it is not like she realized and she stopped . no , she kept going , and she kept going harder . ' a 32-year-old illegal immigrant named benita cardona-gonzalez is accused of using gutierrez 's identity during a 10-year period when she worked at a topeka company that packages refrigerated foods . for years , large numbers of illegal immigrants have filled out payroll forms using their real names but stolen social security numbers . however , as electronic employment verification systems such as e-verify become more common , the use of fake numbers is increasingly difficult . now prosecutors worry that more people will try to fool the systems by assuming full identities rather than stealing the numbers alone . for victims , total identity theft can also have serious health consequences if electronic medical records linked to social security numbers get mixed up , putting at risk the accuracy of important patient information such as blood types or life-threatening allergies . federal trade commission statistics show that americans reported more than 279,000 instances of identity theft in 2011 , up from 251,100 a year earlier . while it is unclear how many of those cases involve total identity theft , one possible indicator is the number of identity theft complaints that involve more than one type of identity theft - 13 percent last year , compared with 12 percent a year earlier . when gutierrez 's identity was stolen , the thief did n't limit herself to opening fraudulent credit and bank accounts . she assumed her persona completely , using it to get a job , a license , a mortgage and even medical care for the birth of two children . nationwide , employment-related fraud accounted for 8 percent of identity theft complaints last year . but in states with large immigrant populations , employment-related identity fraud was much higher : 25 percent in arizona , 15 percent in texas , 16 percent in new mexico , 12 percent in california . prosecutors say that the longer a person uses someone else 's identity , the more confident the thief becomes using that identity for purposes other than just working . ` it is such a horrible nightmare . you get really angry , and then you start realizing anger is not going to help . but when you have so much on your plate and you keep such a busy life , it is really such a big inconvenience . ' once they have become established in a community , identity thieves do n't want to live in the shadows and they seek a normal life like everybody else . that 's when they take the next step and get a driver 's license , a home loan and health insurance . ` and so that is a natural progression , and that is what we are seeing , ' said assistant u.s. attorney brent anderson , who is prosecuting the case against gutierrez 's alleged impostor . gutierrez first learned her identity had been hijacked when she was turned down for a mortgage more than a decade ago . now each year she trudges to the social security administration with her birth certificate , driver 's license , passport and even school yearbooks to prove her identity and clear her employment record . she spends hours on the phone with creditors and credit bureaus , fills out affidavits and has yet to clean up her credit history . her tax records are a mess . she even once phoned the impostor 's kansas employer in a futile effort to find some relief . both women claimed they were identity theft victims and sought to get new social security numbers . the social security administration turned down the request from gutierrez , instead issuing a new number to the woman impersonating her . federal trade commission statistics show that americans reported more than 279,000 instances of identity theft in 2011 , up from 251,100 a year earlier . and in another ironic twist , gutierrez was forced to file her federal income tax forms using a special identification number usually reserved for illegal immigrants . ` it is such a horrible nightmare , ' gutierrez said . ` you get really angry , and then you start realizing anger is not going to help . ... but when you have so much on your plate and you keep such a busy life , it is really such a super big inconvenience . you have to find the time for someone who is abusing you . ' when gutierrez recently got married , her husband began researching identity theft on the internet and stumbled across identity theft cases filed against other illegal immigrants working at reser 's fine foods , the same manufacturer where cardona-gonzalez worked . he contacted federal authorities in kansas and asked them to investigate the employee working there who had stolen his wife 's identity . the alleged impostor was arrested in august , and her fingerprints confirmed that immigration agents had encountered cardona-gonzalez in 1996 in harlingen , texas , and sent her back to mexico . cardona-gonzalez did not respond to a letter sent to her at the butler county jail , where she is awaiting trial on charges of aggravated identity theft , misuse of a social security number and production of a false document . her attorney , matthew works , did not respond to phone calls and emails seeking comment . court filings indicate the two sides are negotiating a plea agreement . citing privacy issues , the social security administration declined to discuss the gutierrez case . reser 's fine foods did not return a message left at its topeka plant . anderson expects more cases of total identity theft ` because we all know what is going on out there - which is thousands and thousands of people who are working illegally in the united states under false identities , mostly of u.s. citizens , and very little is being done about it . but we are doing something about it , one case at a time .
