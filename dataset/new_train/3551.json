' ` so , from the bottom of my heart , i am very , very sorry for my participation in this production and any harm it may have caused , ' the striking brunette said into the camera . the ` drunk girl in public ' video was posted on youtube november 11 and quickly became a hit with people across the internet expressing outrage at the several sober men who came up to the actress - who was pretending to be intoxicated while staggering down hollywood boulevard - and tried to coax her back to their homes . just two days later , one of the men who appeared in the video came forward to reveal that the whole thing was staged by a viral marketing company and they were just following prompts from directors stephen zhang , 20 , and seth leach . and when one of those men posted on facebook to express his anger that he had been portrayed as a predator , one of the filmmakers tried to silence him with free drinks and the promise of future work . the real ` drunk girl ' : the woman in the video is a 24-year-old la-based actress and model , who goes by the nickname ` jennifo ' setting the record straight : box said that she was hired to take part in what she had been told was a ` light-hearted ' prank . truth comes out : the striking brunette said that all the men featured in the video were ` perfect gentlemen ' the video follows 24-year-old model jennifer box as she pretends to be seriously intoxicated , walking down hollywood boulevard and asking men for directions to the bus stop that will get her to culver city . shockingly , of the five men featured , only one actually offers her assistance , while the rest attempt to lure her back to their homes - despite her obviously drunken state . two sources told the smoking gun that men in the video were approached on the street and asked to participate in a ` comedic , hidden camera ' video . one man who decided not to appear in the video , says he was told it was a ` student video ' and that it appeared they had no releases or paperwork to sign . mike koshak is one of the men who agreed to participate in the video and is filmed in a blue tank top , telling the tipsy woman : ` you 're in no shape to be walking around like this ' before leading her in the direction of his home where there is ` more beer ' . mike koshak , pictured right , said he was asked to participate in what he thought was a student video , in which he followed the direction of its creators . in the video , he is interrupted talking to the woman by another man who also then tries to take advantage of her . but both mr koshak and his boss deny the film 's authenticity , saying he was just trying to help the student filmmakers out . christine peters is the owner of la epic , a company which arranges nightclub crawls , and she said mr koshak worked selling tickets to tourists . he was wearing a tank-top advertising the business when he was approached by the video 's creators on the street to ` say a couple of lines for a comedy sketch . ' ` they made it seem like he was trying to take the girl home , ' she said , adding that her business does not ` condone such behavior . ' mr koshak has also spoken out about the video on facebook , writing that it ` was all staged and all of the people in it were acting ' . the first man -lrb- pictured -rrb- tries to lure jennifer back to his apartment with the promise of a water bed . but the authenticity of the film has now been called into question after those who appeared in it say they were told they were acting in a student video . the video ` does not portray myself or any of the other people in it correctly , ' he said , adding that it 's a ` false a ** portrayal and i was lied to about what the video even was . faulty a *** shit . ' after publishing the post , he says he received a private facebook message from mr leach who tried to convince him to keep quiet . ` the important thing to consider is that this video is going to get you well known and have a future with us and our company , ' he allegedly wrote . ` we are going to be huge and you are part of it , ' mr leach also said , before inviting him out for a night of free drinks . ` just go with it dude , you are in our team now and we will take care of you . ' mr leach himself appears unconcerned about the latest claims . last tuesday , he boasted on facebook about the video 's success and to say he was leaving la for a few days and will be ` creating some more viral videos for your viewing and learning pleasure ' . ' i just want to help you ' : the video showed another man trying to get the young woman into his car . in the video , only one man -lrb- pictured -rrb- offered to help the woman find her bus stop .", "summary": " jennifer box , 24 , from los angeles , posted her apology video on youtube .   said she was hired as an actress to portray a drunk girl in the november 11 viral hit .   the video showed men trying to take advantage of an inebriated miss box .   actress said all the men in the clip were ` perfect gentlemen '   the men featured revealed last week they were asked to act in student film .   they say they played characters at the direction of the film 's creators .
