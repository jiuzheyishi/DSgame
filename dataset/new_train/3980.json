{"text": "families worried that their elderly relatives are being abuse by care home staff are to be given official advice on how to secretly install cctv cameras . care home watchdog , the care quality commission , will issue guidance in the new year explaining how to best monitor staff . a spokeswoman told mailonline the cqc ` understood that there are circumstances where some people will feel that is the right thing for them ' . crucial : gladys wright 's son captured her abuse on cctv . daniel baynes was jailed for four months after he was caught abusing the 79-year-old dementia sufferer . the decision to publish official guidance helping concerned families install cameras was signed off by the cqc 's board today . it is hoped that the vigilance of family members will help to maintain high standards of care for elderly and vulnerable people . the advice will also be aimed at managers who suspect malpractice among their staff . the cqc 's chief inspector andrea sutcliffe , said : ` we know that exploring the potential use of hidden and public cameras in care homes and other care settings is a really sensitive issue -- and one that provokes a huge range of debate and opinion . ` the information we will publish for providers makes clear the issues we expect them to take into account -- for example , consulting with people using the services and staff -- if they are considering installing hidden or public cameras . ' i hope the information we will publish for the public will help them make the right decisions in difficult circumstances and i look forward to making sure that this information is written in a way that is most useful for them . ' smaller families , longer life expectancy and late parenthood in life mean the number of ` sandwich carers ' who have to care for or arrange the care of their parents as well as their children is growing . but ms sutcliffe added : ' i am clear that any form of surveillance can not be seen as the only way to ensure people are receiving safe , high-quality and compassionate care . we need enough staff , properly trained and supported who really care to ensure people get the services they have every right to expect . ' care and support minister norman lamb , said cameras had ` helped to expose terrible cruelty and neglectful care ' . he said : ' i welcome this new information . decisions about using surveillance are extremely difficult -- there is always a balance to be struck between protecting people and respecting their right to privacy -- but this information will help families to make the right choice for them . ` we are committed to preventing poor care from happening in the first place and have introduced tougher standards for inspecting care services as well as measures to shut down those that are n't up to scratch . ' faderera grace bello was jailed for carer ill treatment and wilful neglect after veronica davis secretly filmed bello poking her mother bridget rees in the face . the information from the health watchdog comes after a string of scandals in care homes which were brought to light by relatives ' undercover filming . in june daniel baynes was jailed for four months after he was caught abusing 79-year-old dementia sufferer gladys wright on a hidden camera installed by her son james . he and two colleagues , tomasz gidaszewski and janusz salnikow , were captured swearing at mrs wright and manhandling her at granary care home , in wraxall , north somerset . a month later faderera grace bello was jailed for carer ill treatment and wilful neglect after veronica davis secretly filmed bello poking her mother bridget rees in the face . dementia sufferer and former nurse mrs rees was left with bruises after the ill treatment at the nhs mary seacole nursing home in hoxton , east london . following the mistreatment mrs rees died in may aged 92 . the news comes as a survey found that choosing care for an elderly parent is one of the most stressful decisions we will ever make . it ranks higher than getting married , choosing a school , getting divorced or buying a house in terms of worry . smaller families , longer life expectancy and late parenthood in life mean the number of ` sandwich carers ' who have to care for or arrange the care of their parents as well as their children is growing . an estimated 2.4 million britons now have to juggle their responsibilities for both parents and children . some 84 per cent of the 259 men and women questioned by the poll , which was carried out by the cqc , said that deciding how to care for an elderly relative had been very stressful or quite stressful -- making it the top choice . this decision could be about whether they are well enough to stay in their own home -- or it could be about which care home will look after them best . financial worries , fears over the standard of care and guilt about putting a relative into a home were all likely to contribute to the mental turmoil . and many people are forced to sell their parents ' home to meet the high fees required to keep them in care . a care home worker was jailed and two of his colleagues received non-custodial sentences after they admitted ill-treating a 79-year-old dementia sufferer . bristol crown court was shown video showing a distressed gladys wright being pushed , shoved and pulled on a number of occasions , while subjecting her to a tirade of verbal abuse . the camera had been secretly set up by her son , who had concerns about her treatment . daniel baynes , tomasz gidaszewski and janusz salnikow can be heard calling the helpless pensioner a ` nasty aggressive bitch ' and telling each other to ` f *** her ' , throughout the recordings . the camera placed in gladys wright 's room revealed an appalling catalogue of abuse by workers at the # 800-a-week facility . on one occasion baynes , 24 , attempts to force mrs wright 's eyes open , while on another pushes the clearly distressed pensioner onto the bed , while attempting to change her , before applying his weight on her legs to hold her down . salnikow , 25 , while changing mrs wright for bed , is shown to hold the nape of her neck before forcing her backwards into her chair by grabbing her chin . her son james set the device up to reassure himself the treatment his mother was receiving in the specialist granary care home , in wraxall , north somerset , was unlike the horror stories he had read about . the men , who were suspended from their positions as soon as the evidence came to light , pleaded guilty to the abuse , which took place in october and december 2012 . baynes , of bath , was handed four months behind bars after admitting three counts of ill treatment or neglect of a person who lacks capacity , and another of theft after he was caught stealing mrs wright 's food . salnikow , of southmead , bristol , who practised yoga while in the dock , was given two months in prison , suspended for two years after admitting three counts of ill-treatment . gidaszewski , of nailsea , north somerset , was sentenced to 180 hours of unpaid work for admitting one count of the same . despite the sentences however mr wright believes nothing will change until 24 hour cctv is placed in all homes . speaking afterwards he said : ' i wish i recorded nothing but good behaviour . that would have been the best outcome . ' i had no reason to believe there would be problems , because she would n't have gone there in the first place . ' i believe we 'll be seeing many more instances of the abuse of vulnerable individuals and know this will not improve until we see the implementation of cctv in these homes .
