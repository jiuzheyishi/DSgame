{"text": "federal agents have arrested more than 90 people and seized about five million packets of synthetic drugs , known on the street as bath salts , k2 and spice . the operation is the first u.s. nationwide crackdown on ` designer drugs ' , the drug enforcement administration said yesterday . the dea said the haul from multi-agency raids in more than 100 u.s. cities included 4.8 million packets of synthetic cannabis , 167,000 packets of ` bath salts ' and more than $ 36million in cash . operation log jam : federal agents have arrested more than 90 people and seized about five million packets of synthetic drugs , known on the street as bath salts , k2 and spice . operation log jam involved the dea , five federal agencies , state and local police . dea administrator michele leonhart said in a statement : ` it has disrupted the entire illegal industry , from manufacturers to retailers . ` together . with our federal , state and local law enforcement partners , we are . committed to targeting these new and emerging drugs with every . scientific , legislative and investigative tool at our disposal . ' synthetic drugs - with street names . like bath salts or plant food - mimic more traditional illegal narcotics . like cocaine , lsd , mdma and methamphetamine , and have rapidly grown in . popularity . bath salts have been blamed in several incidents of erratic and violent behaviour across the u.s. smokable herbal blends marketed as . spice , k2 , blaze , and red x dawn and labelled as incense contain illegal . psychoactive compounds that mimic thc , the active ingredient in . marijuana . bath salts are likely to be stimulant drugs such mpdv or ephedrine . bath salts does not refer to a single chemical , but instead to a range of synthetic drugs that can be sold legally in the u.s. as long as they are not marked for human consumption -- hence the misleading name . drugs such as mpdv are highly potent stimulants , similar to some amphetamines , and in mpdv 's case particularly , cause a strong compulsion to ` redose ' with more of the drug . in high doses , such drugs can cause violent and unpredictable behaviour , and terrifying hallucinations -- and the compulsion to take more of the drug continues , even once the ` high ' has begun to make the user feel bad . they have become popular among teens and young adults . new research suggests the drug affects the brain in the same way as cocaine . the drug 's active ingredient is mephedrone . scientists have shown that mephedrone acts the same way as cocaine in the brain - giving it the potential for abuse and addiction . studies were conducted on mice using a technique developed in the 1950s - intracranial self-stimulation -lrb- icss -rrb- - that measures a drug 's ability to activate reward circuits . in icss studies , animals are trained to perform a behavioural task - pressing a lever or button with their nose or spinning a wheel - to receive a reward . mice were implanted with brain stimulating electrodes , with measures of their wheel spinning effort made before , during and after they received various doses of either mephedrone or cocaine . dr carl malanga , of the university of north carolina , explained : ` one of the unique features of icss is that all drugs of abuse , regardless of how they work pharmacologically , do very similar things to icss : they make icss more rewarding . ' results of the behavioural brain research study showed cocaine increased the ability of mice to be rewarded by self-stimulation and mephedrone did the same . on july 9 , president barack obama signed into law legislation passed by congress to permanently ban the sale of bath salts in the u.s. ` bath salts ' have been implicated in a recent spate of violent attacks across the u.s. : .", "summary": " operation is first u.s. nationwide crackdown on ` designer drugs '   dea said the haul from raids in more than 100 u.s. cities included 4.8 million packets of synthetic cannabis , 167,000 packets of ` bath salts ' and more than $ 36million in cash .
