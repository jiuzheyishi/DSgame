{"text": "an empty piece of land on the world-renowned sandbanks peninsula has gone on the market for # 6.25 million -- more than the price of a 38-bedroom castle in the scottish highlands . the muddy plot , the latest in the so-called millionaires ' row to go on the market , is now priced at # 2m more than when it came with two houses . despite being empty , the plot is the same price as an entire estate on the south shore of loch rannoch , perthshire , which includes a castle , a swimming pool , 12 extra villas or bungalows , a sports hall , a golf course , a shooting range and an army assault course . if it sold at the asking price , the plot - which measures 27m by 18m - will equate to a staggering # 1,161 per square foot . scroll down for video . this narrow empty plot of land in the world-renowned sandbanks area has gone on the market for a staggering # 6.25 million . the plot , the latest in the so-called millionaires ' row to go on the market , is now priced at # 2m more than when it came with two houses . the area , which measures 27m by 18m and already has planning permission , will equate to # 1,161 per square feet if it sells for the asking price . but looking at it from another point of view - literally - it 's perhaps easy to see why the small area has gone on the market for such an eye-watering sum . the reason that the sliver of land is set to fetch such an eye-watering sum is because it backs onto the beach and is located on the narrowest part of the peninsula , meaning that it boasts two-way views , including over poole harbour . a property two doors down holds the record for the most expensive house on the peninsula per square foot . the detached house sold last year for # 3.45 million , which worked out as # 1,725 per square foot . sandbanks is said to be the fourth most expensive place in the world - behind london , manhattan and tokyo - to buy property and counts harry redknapp and his son jamie among its residents . prices in the area have soared in the past few years , with prospective buyers even able to get more for their money in the exclusive london neighbourhood of mayfair . at the moment , # 6.75 million could give buyers a two-bedroom flat , within spitting distance of hyde park . the latest plot in the exclusive resort has gone on the market after the owner decided to stay put in the house he currently rents . the owner initially bought the land , which included two 1960s houses , with the intention of building his dream home in their place . but while the planning application was being considered , he fell in love with the property he was living in and decided to remain there . he went ahead with knocking down the two houses on the sandbanks plot , later securing permission for two four-bed houses , complete with their own gym and swimming pool . the planning permission stipulates that the twin properties would be 4,370 sq ft and 4,023 sq ft respectively and would be set over four floors with a terrace running all the way around . but whoever buys the land could face spending an additional # 1million on building the new homes . when the existing owner bought the property , it consisted of two houses -lrb- pictured -rrb- which he knocked down to make way for his dream home . the site , situated in the sought-after resort of sandbanks , backs onto the beach and boasts two-way views , including over poole harbour . whoever buys the plot will face spending about # 1m each on building the two new homes , which will be four-storey and four-bedroom . the owner intended to build his dream home on the plot but decided to stay in his current property , despite obtaining planning permission . the properties would be 4,370 sq ft and 4,023 sq ft respectively , set over four floors with a terrace running all the way round to enjoy the views . sandbanks is said to be the fourth most expensive place in the world - behind london , manhattan and tokyo - to buy property . the prospective buyer will also count harry redknapp among their neighbours . the qpr manager bought his ultra-modern property with his wife sandra for # 3million in 2001 and commutes daily from his waterfront home to qpr 's london-based ground loftus road . troubled footballer paul gascoigne also reportedly moved to the exclusive resort earlier this year , where he is said to be renting a flash penthouse apartment . other notable residents include a number of well-known names in football such as crystal palace manager tony pulis , former player and manager graeme souness , and mr redknapp 's son jamie . computer magnate sir peter ogden also has a home there . adrian dunford , of tailor made estate agents which is selling the empty plot , said : ` this is one of the few plots left along that section , most of the houses have now been replaced with new properties . ' a lot of those have been turned into apartments so they 're unlikely to change again . a property in that particular area , two doors down from this one , holds the record for cost of a house per square foot . ` one of the reasons why the properties on that section go for so much is because of the two-way views . historically that section has always been sought-after and the most expensive . every home in the sandbanks community -lrb- pictured from above -rrb- is within just a few minutes ' walk of the beach , with most enjoying stunning views over the harbour or out to the english channel . the property market on the peninsula has shot through the roof in the past few years , with many houses being demolished and replaced with cutting-edge new properties to meet demand -lrb- pictured -rrb- . ` on the peninsula the houses are much larger , 13-14 ,000 sq ft , they will change hands for # 8million , but this bit is the narrowest part of sandbanks so the houses there can only be about 4-5 ,000 sq ft. ' he added : ` generally they are second homes on that stretch but we are seeing a change in fashion . historically everybody wanted large homes but we are seeing more people very happy to live in something smaller and easier to manage . ' a lot of people are using them as their main home in the uk but then also have another home in france , barbados or monte carlo . it means they do n't have a huge maintenance bill when they 're away . ` in that area people are only going to move when they pass away , because where do you move from there ? you 've got a nice plot , with two-way views , waves crashing on the beach - it 's a great place to live . ' the empty plot is more than the price of an entire estate on the south shore of loch rannoch , perthshire , which includes a 38-bedroom castle . the # 6m estate , which has this view , includes a swimming pool , 12 extra villas or bungalows , a sports hall , a golf course and a shooting range . located on a small peninsula stretching across the mouth of poole harbour in dorset , sandbanks - nicknamed ` britain 's palm beach ' - is known for both its picturesque beach and the high value of its sought-after property . by area , sandbanks and surrounding lilliput , branksome park and canford cliffs boasts the fourth highest land value in the world and the uk 's largest concentration of expensive properties outside london . sandbanks 's popularity is attributed to its seclusion , and every home in the community is within just a few minutes ' walk of the beach , with most of them enjoying stunning views over the harbour or out to the english channel . houses were first built on sandbanks in the late 19th century , but it was not until the 1960s when a property boom saw the peninsula - measuring less than half a square mile - become more and more built-up , turning into a millionaires ' row filled with luxury beachfront mansions . the property market on the peninsula has shot through the roof in the past few years , with many houses being demolished and replaced with cutting-edge new properties to meet demand . in july 2009 a 14,990 sq ft -lrb- 1,393-square-metre -rrb- empty plot of land on the peninsula was put up for sale for # 13.5 million -- the equivalent of nearly # 10,000 per square metre . in may , a bungalow bought for just # 1,000 almost a century ago -lrb- around # 40,000 in today 's money -rrb- and now a luxury holiday home was reported to be now worth # 5million - a 500,000 percent increase in value . earlier this year a tatty 1950s three-bedroom sandbanks bungalow which would be worth just # 200,000 in most other parts of the country went on sale for an eye-watering # 2.25 million . prospective buyers could even get more for their money in mayfair , where # 6.75 m could buy you this two-bedroom flat . in march , an empty plot on the exclusive enclave went on sale for # 3million - double what it had sold for before its old bungalow was knocked down . last year , 15 homes were sold for a combined total of # 80million as sandbanks ' reputation has continued to grow . mr dunford added : ` the land is worth more without the old houses on it because it 's all about the potential use of the land . ` generally you can get more square footage in a modern build than you could just ten years ago . properties now can build one or two floors higher so you get a larger house and a more popular layout . ` most of the older properties are only two storeys and generally do n't take full advantage of the two-way view . construction now with no pillars or internal walls means you can sit in your kitchen and look both ways with no obstruction . you just ca n't get that in a 1970s build . ` the key thing that drives the value is we 're surrounded by water . what you have got in sandbanks is all you have , it 's not like a rural place where you can expand and build a new village . and the more popular it becomes the more in demand plots like this are . if you want to be here you have to pay the money and people selling know that . '", "summary": " the area , which measures 27m by 18m , will equate to # 1,161 per square foot if it sells for the huge asking price .   land has planning permission for two four-bed houses with their own gym and swimming pool , set over four floors .   owner bought land and demolished the two 1960s homes with intention of building his own dream property instead .   plot is same price as an entire estate in perthshire , which boasts a 38-bedroom castle , 12 villas and a golf course .   sandbanks and surrounding areas boasts fourth highest land value in the world after london , manhattan and tokyo .
