' mr mayo added both defence and prosecution agree davenport currently has # 14m of assets which are available for confiscation . the conman 's defence team argue he should repay # 8m , and assert that the london mansion should not be part of proceedings . they will argue # 6m should be seized from his swiss and monaco bank accounts , just # 0.8 m in property assets , and # 97,000 from a separate property deal . davenport bought the sierra leone high commission in 1999 for # 3.9 m while the country was embroiled in civil war . davenport 's web page boasted : ` welcome to the website of edward davenport , one of london 's most flamboyant and best known entrepreneurs as well as a true english gentleman from an established british family .
