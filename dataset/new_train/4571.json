{"text": "speculation continues to swirl around the potential involvement of violent video games in adam lanza 's rampage at sandy hook elementary school in december . the official investigation has yet to release its report , but consistent accounts indicate lanza was an enthusiastic player of violent games . on monday , cbs news raised eyebrows with a report citing unnamed law enforcement sources conjecturing that lanza was motivated in part by violent video games as well as norway shooter anders breivik . the investigating connecticut police later said that 's  all speculation .  according to the hartford courant , we know that when the police searched lanza 's home after the shooting , they found thousands of dollars ' worth of violent video games . we also know that lanza 's mom let him play games while she traveled . news : report -- sandy hook shooter tried to emulate norway massacre . but just because violent video games seemed to have been a part of lanza 's life , as with many young men , we can not jump to conclusions . the reality is that there is no evidence linking violent games to mass shootings . we tend to return to this particular element , and it 's interesting to see how quickly people like to latch on to this noncorrelation as if it were truly meaningful . the notion that mass homicides are linked to violent media was debunked as far back as 2002 by the u.s. secret service , which found that school shooters did n't consume high levels of violent media . but as a society we tend to focus on video games because it 's easy to do so . for example , in the recent case of nehemiah griego , a 15-year-old boy accused of killing his family in new mexico , the police seemed to have been obsessed with violent games during a press conference . the police representative shifted a reporter 's question about illegal drugs to video games , the gist of which seemed to be that the boy enjoyed talking about  modern warfare .  however , other reports suggested the boy 's access to violent games or television had been restricted by his family . in the weeks since the newtown , connecticut , massacre , there have been a host of high-profile crimes committed by older men . william spengler , 62 , shot and killed two firefighters and apparently killed his sister in new york . jimmy lee dykes , 65 , killed a bus driver and kidnapped a 5-year-old boy in alabama . and douglas harmon , 70 , killed two people at a phoenix law office , police said . these older men do n't fit the profile of video game players , yet they all did something horrible . zakaria : do n't blame the video games . curiously , no one seems interested in investigating the effects of media popular among the elderly . our attention to video games in the cases of some shootings but not others is what psychologists call confirmation bias , and it creates the illusion of a correlation where there is none . it 's worth asking ourselves why we keep returning to video games despite the lack of evidence to support its link to violence . of course , this kind of association is not new . some scholars blamed television for the crime wave of the 1970s and '80s , which has since vanished . and comic books in the 1950s were blamed by psychiatrists for not only delinquency but homosexuality -lrb- batman and robin were secretly gay it seemed . i 'm not making this up -rrb- . in hindsight , these strands of associations look ridiculous , but in the moment they served a purpose . opinion : nra 's video game smacks of hypocrisy . rare though they are , mass shootings often strike at schools , malls , churches , theaters -- places we all go in places we all live . one of the questions asked repeatedly after the newtown shooting is why lanza did what he did . to say that he was an evil young man who cruelly inflicted suffering on others simply because , in his mind , life had given him the shaft is not satisfying . we want to control the uncontrollable , predict the unpredictable . we want to understand why an impossible to understand event happened and give ourselves some illusion of control . if violent video games were some small but critical component of lanza 's motivation , why we could just get rid of such games and make this whole problem go away . it 's a tempting belief but absolutely wrong . tech : after newtown , shoppers think twice about violent video games . if we could make it legal to regulate violence in games , would that have stopped lanza or any of the other mass homicides through history ? no , not a one . we should not be distracted from looking for the real contributing factors to societal violence .", "summary": " consistent accounts indicate that adam lanza played a lot of violent video games .   christopher j. ferguson : there is no evidence linking video games to mass shootings .   he says people tend to see an illusion of correlation when there is none .   ferguson : even if we can regulate violence in games , it would n't stop mass shooters .
