{"text": "the search for a u.s. man who allegedly abducted his two young sons last week focused monday on cuba , with a florida sheriff 's department saying it had received information that the man , his wife and sons had arrived in the island nation , possibly by sailboat . a state department official in washington told cnn that the u.s. interest section in havana  is aware of this case and is in contact with local authorities to get more information .  the official would not comment further , citing  privacy considerations .  authorities believe the father , joshua michael hakken of louisiana , abducted his sons chase , 2 , and cole , 4 , early wednesday after breaking into the florida home of the children 's grandmother and tying her up . in havana , lynn roche , an official with the u.s. interest section , said section officials could n't discuss any case of an american who has n't signed a privacy act waiver . and an official with cuba 's foreign ministry said monday evening that his agency was unaware of the case and had not received any requests for help from u.s. officials . the boys had been removed from the care of hakken and his wife , sharyn patricia hakken , last year , and on tuesday , the couple 's parental rights were terminated in louisiana , investigators say . the abduction report triggered an amber alert for the children , but there were no reported sightings . joshua hakken , described as an anti-government protester , was believed to be armed , according to the hillsborough county sheriff 's office in tampa , the site of last week 's alleged abduction . investigators believed his wife was with him . on monday , the sheriff 's department released a statement saying it had  received information that the hakken family had arrived in cuba .  the brief statement did not offer any specifics about the information but added ,  we are currently working with the federal bureau of investigation who is in contact with the u.s. state department to verify this information .  that followed a statement friday from the same department saying it had obtained information that joshua hakken recently bought a 25-foot sailboat . there is no extradition treaty between cuba and the united states , although there have been recent cases in which americans sought for crimes in the united states and discovered in havana have been sent back by the cubans . the fbi currently estimates there are around 70 fugitives from u.s. justice in cuba , which is one of the reasons cuba remains on the u.s. list of countries that support state terrorism . most of the american fugitives in cuba have been there for decades and have ties to revolutionary movements or radical groups . on thursday , the police department in slidell , louisiana , issued its own statement offering background on the hakkens and why the boys were taken from the parents last year . in june of 2012 , slidell police responded to a disturbance report at a hotel where joshua and sharyn hakken were staying with their sons , the police statement said .  when police arrived , both mr. and mrs. hakken were acting in a bizarre manner that alarmed officers . they were talking about ` completing their ultimate journey ' and were traveling across the country to ` take a journey to the armageddon , '  the slidell police statement said , adding ,  let it be noted that both of their children were present in the hotel room at the time .  because of the parents ' behavior and  the fact that narcotics and weapons were located inside of the hotel room ,  the children were taken by child welfare officers , and joshua hakken was arrested on drug charges , the statement said .  approximately two weeks later , slidell police were notified that mr. hakken had shown up to the foster family home ... with a firearm demanding the return of his children ,  the slidell police statement continued .  the foster parents called 911 , and mr. hakken fled without his children . we have heard nothing until -lrb- wednesday -rrb- .  at some point over the past few months , the children were sent to tampa to live with their grandmother , patricia hauser , the mother of sharyn hakken .  somehow they found out where the kids were ,  said detective larry mckinnon of the hillsborough county sheriff 's office . sheriff 's investigators say joshua hakken entered hauser 's home at 6:30 a.m. wednesday . she told police that he tied her up and fled with the children in her silver 2009 toyota camry . that vehicle was found later that day just a couple of blocks away from the home . those investigators told cnn they believe joshua hakken joined up with his wife , who was waiting in their pickup truck , and the family drove to a parking garage . a short time later , investigators said , hakken is believed to have taken a sailboat out of a private slip in nearby madeira beach . surveillance images showed the boat sailing into the gulf of mexico about three and a half hours after the boys disappeared from their grandmother 's home , investigators said , adding that the photos showed adults and children aboard . cnn 's patrick oppmann in havana , rich phillips and kim segal in miami , elise labott and emily schultze in washington , and dave alsup and joe sutton in atlanta contributed to this report .", "summary": " authorities believe joshua hakken abducted his two
