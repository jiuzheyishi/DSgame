{"text": "it 's too soon to say what steps the united states will take against isis in syria , president barack obama said thursday .  i do n't want to put the cart before the horse ,  obama told reporters during a white house news briefing .  we do n't have a strategy yet .  obama said he 's asked america 's top defense officials to prepare  a range of options  about what the united states could do to go after isis in syria , which he described as  a safe haven  for the sunni extremist group that calls itself the islamic state . the president 's remarks follow days of speculation about whether the united states had a plan to go after isis in syria .  we need to make sure that we 've got clear plans , that we 're developing them . at that point , i will consult with congress and make sure that their voices are heard ,  obama said .  but there 's no point in me asking for action on the part of congress before i know exactly what it is that is going to be required for us to get the job done .  torture allegations . the washington post on thursday reported that journalist james foley , who was decapitated by isis , was tortured during his captivity . specifically , foley was waterboarded , the newspaper reported , citing unnamed sources familiar with the treatment of abducted westerners . waterboarding is a controversial technique that was used by the u.s. in its war of terrorism . waterboarding is a interrogation technique where water is poured over a cloth covering the subject 's face , creating the sensation of drowning . a senior u.s. official declined to confirm to cnn if the waterboarding claims are true , saying that such details would not be discussed out of sensitivity to the families of those still being held .  as we have said , hostages held by isil are at risk every day they are in isil 's custody , given what we know about the nature of this brutal group ,  the official said , using an alternate acronym for isis . ` we 're not going to do that alone ' but the president made clear any plan to go after isis in syria would take time and require a regional strategy .  we 're not going to do that alone ,  he said . the president said he was sending secretary of state john kerry to the region to work on building a coalition needed to face the threat of isis militants .  clearly , isil has come to represent the very worst elements in the region that we have to deal with collectively , and that 's going to require us to stabilize syria in some fashion ,  obama said .  and stabilizing syria means that we 've to got get moderate sunnis who are able to govern and offer ... a real alternative .  but that may prove to be problematic . syria 's ally , russia , has repeatedly blocked attempts by the u.n. security council that call on president bashar al-assad to step down as part of an effort to end the civil war that has wracked the country for three years . among the options obama said he requested from the u.s. military were plans to make sure isis does not overrun iraq . u.s. airstrikes in iraq are working , he said .  the terrorists of -lrb- isis -rrb- are losing arms and equipment ,  obama said , and iraqi and kurdish forces are making inroads . but  the idea that the united states or any outside power would perpetually defeat isis ... is unrealistic ,  obama said , insisting that a strong , trusted iraqi government is critical to ousting the islamist terror group permanently . what can the u.s. do against isis , and could it work ? isis claims mass execution in syria . isis said thursday that it has executed at least 250 syrian soldiers at an air base in the northeastern city of raqqa . the group said on one of its official websites that it killed the soldiers wednesday . it also claimed to have killed 600 government soldiers in the fight for the tabqa air base since august 19 . the syrian observatory for human rights , meanwhile , reported that 200 syrian soldiers and 346 isis fighters died in the fight for the air base , which was considered the military 's last holdout in eastern syria . hundreds more were wounded , the london-based activist group said . isis claims that a video it posted online thursday shows syrian soldiers being paraded through the desert in their underwear . another video posted by syrian activists purportedly shows bodies lined up on the ground . later , isis posted a video that it says shows captured kurdish soldiers , known as peshmerga , wearing orange clothing similar to that worn by by american journalists james foley and steven sotloff in other videos posted by the militant group . three masked men appear to decapitate one of the orange-clad soldiers in front of a mosque in mosul . in the video , titled  a message with blood to the leaders of the america kurdish alliance ,  isis demands that the kurdish government withdraw its forces from areas where it is battling the group . cnn could not independently confirm the claims or the authenticity of the videos . a 13-year-old witness to isis ' beheadings , crucifixion in syria . fighting flares near mosul dam . the videos come amid reports of fresh fighting between isis and kurdish forces near iraq 's mosul dam and the burning of oil wells near the strategic town of zummar . the peshmerga are battling the militants near the town , important because of its location to the main thoroughfare that connects mosul to the syrian border , as well as near the mosul dam and the strategic ain zala oilfield , which isis forces seized from the kurds this month , said faud hussein , chief of staff for kurdish regional president masoud barzani . torching the three oil wells that make up the ain zala oilfield is an apparent effort by isis fighters to try to interrupt a peshmerga advance on isis positions , hussein said . the extent of the damage to the oil fields was n't immediately known . the fighting comes nearly two weeks after thousands of peshmerga and iraqi commandos ousted isis forces for control of the dam , a crucial facility that provides electricity for millions of people in iraq . kurdish officials have credited u.s. airstrikes against isis with helping peshmerga forces push back against the extremists , whose breathtaking gains and brutal tactics captured the attention of world leaders . u.s. airstrikes in syria ?", "summary": " report claims james foley was waterboarded by isis captors .   no point in asking congress for action without having a plan , obama says .    we do n't have a strategy yet  to deal with isis in syria , he says .   militant group says it executed hundreds of syrian soldiers .
