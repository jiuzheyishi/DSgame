{"text": "picture this scene : you 're just digging into your restaurant meal , the wine is flowing and the ambiance is perfect -- and then , bam ! your dining companion swats away your hand , scolding you for touching the appetizer before she could take a photo . sound familiar ? the trend of photographing one 's food , brought about in large part by apps like instagram , can seem obnoxious on many levels . but mark hill , director of photography at turner broadcasting systems inc. , says it 's all about preserving memories .  meals are special times for people ... the picture of the food is a representation of that moment ,  he said .  food is very fleeting in our lives . it 's on our plate and 20 minutes later it 's gone and we have an empty dish .  those meals become even more special when they are being enjoyed while traveling . looking back on a photo of a meal eaten overseas can conjure up the sights , sounds , scents and tastes of the trip . this spring , chef and author anthony bourdain will take his adventure-seeking appetite -- and cnn viewers -- along on a journey of cultures and cuisine from around the world on his new show ,  parts unknown .  bourdain 's tasty excursions may not be something we can all do for a living , but from the coastal piers of new jersey to the mountainous terrains of northern africa , you 've experienced amazing off-the-beaten-track meals , too . here are some of your favorite food photos and the stories behind them . getting the local fixings . it was early january of this year when caroline cheung and her fiance decided to escape the grind of their torrance , california , lives and head down to the galapagos . while traveling through tortuga beach , they were greeted with sunshine , warm waters and the faint sound of salsa music playing in the background . the music caught cheung 's attention , but it was the incredible aroma of food that drew her closer .  we watched three ladies prepare and cook fresh fish in a makeshift kitchen with a portable stove and mini-fridge ,  she said .  it was not really a restaurant , but more like an outdoor public space by the pier with a few plastic tables and chairs , and many local people standing by , waiting for their turn to have a seat ,  she said . intrigued , she decided to stand in line , where she learned the place offered one dish .  it was a whole fish that was previously marinated , then dipped in a batter and deep-fried to crispy perfection ,  she said .  it was served with pickled , spicy onions , fried plantains and rice .  to her surprise , she says the fish , served on a simple styrofoam plate , was one of the best dishes she tried during her trip .  it was such a simple dish , served without fanfare , yet a real delight .  eating with the city . a low-key dinner can sometimes be the most appetizing ; at least gary ashley thinks so . after days of hiking through the grand atlas mountains , ashley and his travel partner , john , decided to take a much-needed rest at their riad in marrakech , morocco . a riad is akin to a western-style bed and breakfast . they could have gone to an upscale restaurant to celebrate their trip and john 's birthday , but instead they decided to dine on the rooftop of their riad , which overlooks the city . they ordered the marrakech chicken , which is widely served across the country . the dish consists of chicken slow-cooked as a stew in a tagine -- a traditional moroccan cooking vessel -- and flavored with whole green olives , preserved lemons and moroccan spices . it was served on a fluffy bed of couscous .  it was exceptionally tender and moist and flaked from the bone . the spices were quintessentially moroccan , and the preserved lemon is something not commonly used here in the west ,  he said . but it was n't just the dish that he says was the best part of the meal . it was the ambiance of their dinner as well .  the riad siwan had a beautiful rooftop dining area from which we could see most of the city ,  he said .  the sun was setting and evening calls to prayer were coming from the minarets of the nearby mosques . it was john 's birthday and the food , the atmosphere were perfect . photographs were in order .  crossing state lines for a tasty getaway . for pennsylvania resident cherie capostagno , there are no mountains to cross to find a delicious dish . in fact , her favorite food is just across state lines . the drive to belmar , new jersey , always brings feelings of nostalgia and hunger for her and her husband , vince . they slip away from home -- and work -- to escape the occasional stresses that build up from their jobs . a few times a year , they make their way to the new jersey coast to visit their favorite restaurant , klein 's , which she says is known for its delicious lobster dishes . but besides the tender lobster meat steaming fresh out of the shell , she says the seafood joint is simply inviting .  the restaurant has a fish market in the front and you can watch the guys shuck fresh oysters or you can buy fish at the market if you 'd like ,  she said . if the market is n't your ideal setting , you can walk onto the restaurant 's deck , overlooking shark river inlet .  we like to sit on the deck and watch the gates open to let the boats go through or watch people paddle-board by ,  she said . but it 's the little gems that bring delight to their meals , like seeing swans , like sammy , swim up to the restaurant .  sammy the swan adopted the place as his home and the staff goes down to the dock to play with him ,  she said .  he swims right up to the tables and at first you are n't sure , but then you realize that sammy is a regular .  finding a homemade meal in a new place . whether it 's trekking through the mainland of china or swimming in the waters of tonga , traveling is a way of life for natalie montanaro , who works for the peace corps reserve . so that means she is always trying new dishes . but the south carolinian said her favorite dish is nothing luxurious . instead , it 's a fresh fish salad called ` ota ` ika . ` ota ` ika is a polynesian dish made with raw fish that is marinated in lemon juice for several hours before it is smothered in a rich coconut milk and mixed with an array of veggies . montanaro heard people raving about it while she worked as a teacher in tongatapu , tonga .  at first i was skeptical since i 'd never eaten any raw fish other than in sushi ,  she said .  but the seafood here is top rate and it 's so fresh you almost want to eat it right out of the water .  the tropical climate and fresh fish was enough of a reason for her to muster up her courage and give the polynesian dish a try .  i was completely won over by the lovely taste and texture ,  she said . she adored the dish so much she even learned how to make it .  but it will never be the same without the local fish and coconuts along with the tongan company and atmosphere , of course .
