{"text": "it 's the game on many-a-young-person 's wish list . and for those who ca n't wait for its release on next-gen consoles , lego marvel super heroes has finally arrived on their rickety older brothers . but do n't expect to be punished for your impatience -- for tt games have squeezed every last drop of processing power from the aging xbox 360 and ps3 to create their best-looking lego game to date . hectic : for the most part , the game engine performs well - but on larger sections there can be some slowdown . plot sees doctor doom teaming up with loki to build a super-weapon from cosmic bricks , and it 's up to the marvel team to stop them . but where lego batman 2 dc super heroes held a lot of the playable characters back to the latter parts of the game , here you 're exposed to many playable heroes early on . from spiderman , thor , hulk and iron man to the fantastic four and x-men , it 's certainly an eclectic mix , but one that works surprisingly well . true to its roots : all of the characters are instantly recognisable . all stay true to their comic-book roots , and while some characters have abilities in common , every one has their own distinct animation and special ability . whereas spiderman can use his web to swing around and bind objects together , thor can use his lightening to charge devices . and so forth . these come in handy when solving the game 's numerous puzzles -- with certain characters ' abilities needed to complete each one . it takes two : co-operative mode makes a comeback and there is a wide variety of heroes to choose from . it 's a tried and tested formula , and one that tt has long used in their lego games . but even though there is a slight whiff of this design starting to become stale , the open-world second part of the game more than makes up for it . here you are given free range of manhattan , tasked with numerous side-missions -- such as checkpoint races - and unlocking new characters . it 's noticeably more populated and alive than in lego batman 2 , and it is backed up with mostly vibrant visuals . sadly , though , the camera can prove an annoyance -- especially when flying and playing through latter stages with a friend . characters can get wedged in the environment , too . thinking games : puzzles usually require a combination of multiple super hero powers to solve them . flaws aside , tt games have delivered another brilliant lego game . it may not be a radical change from the other outings -- and maybe it 's time to try something new -- but for now , it 's the best lego game yet . just marvel-ous . version tested : xbox 360 . lego marvel super heroes is out now for current-gen consoles . xbox one version has been delayed and will not be a launch title . ps4 version set for release on november 14 . follow us on twitter : @dailymailgames and on facebook : daily mail games .", "summary": " best-looking lego game to date ... even on current-gen consoles .   two games in one - story opens up to give you manhattan to explore .   packed full of trademark lego humour .   impressive city , more so than in lego batman 2 dc super heroes .   still some mild gameplay issues and overly-familiar level design .
