{"text": "bust-boosting surgery has never been more popular , with more than 11,000 boob job operations taking place in the uk alone each year . but not everyone wants to go under the knife , including some of the a-list clients who visit harley street medic dr neetu nirdosh . instead of scalpels and implants , they are opting for a new treatment which has been dubbed ` the botox boob job ' and uses injectables to plump up the cleavage . scroll down for video . new look : the ` botox boob job ' is said to boost the breasts by up to a cup size but only lasts for six months . ` the breastox - botox is fast becoming the must have pre-red carpet procedure for my celebrity clients , ' explains dr nirdosh . ` it is a knifeless instantaneous breast lift . this form of breast augmentation works best for those who are between a cup size a and c and is safer and quicker than regular surgery . ' the # 1,000 treatment involves injecting botox into the pectoral muscles which temporarily relaxes them , leaving the shoulder and surrounding chest muscles to take the strain . as a result , breasts are lifted and look higher and firmer , although given botox wears off , the effect lasts for a maximum of six months . ` there 's no downtime , no reported side effects , no scars and it is virtually painless , ' adds dr nirdosh . ` it takes less than 30 minutes and is the ideal treatment for women suffering from post-pregnancy droopy boobs , ageing , sagging breasts or a wrinkly bust line as a result of sun damage . popular : botox is the most popular injectable in use in the uk and accounts for 45,464 treatments a year . risky : breast enhancement is n't without its risks as the recent pip implant scandal demonstrated . ` it is also good if you want a bit of extra support so you can go braless as many of my red carpet clients do . ' traditional breast enhancement involves having a cut made either beneath the breasts or in the armpits and inserting a silicone implant between the breast tissue and the chest muscle . operations cost between # 3,500 and # 5,000 and , according to the nhs , complications can include infection , scarring and loss of sensation in the nipple . nevertheless , according to figures produced by the british association of aesthetic surgeons -lsb- baaps -rsb- , they remain one of the most popular cosmetic surgeries . but thanks to scandals such as the pip implant saga , which saw women fitted with enhancements made with industrial , rather than medical , grade silicone , many are turning to ` safer ' injectables such as botox . although macrolane , a filler marketed as a ` lunchtime boob jab ' was withdrawn from sale two years ago following claims that 25 per cent of patients suffered complications after the treatment , others have proved considerably less problematic . among them is botox , which , according to the international society of aesthetic plastic surgeons -lsb- isaps -rsb- , is the most popular non-surgical cosmetic treatment in the world . in total , say isaps , 45,464 botox injections were carried out by qualified practitioners on british women last year .", "summary": " the ` botox boob job ' involves having botox injected into pectoral muscles .   relaxing effect forces the shoulder and chest muscles to take the strain .   as a result , breasts look perkier , higher and up to a cup size larger .   dr neetu nirdosh says it is becoming increasingly popular with celebrities .   treatment costs # 1,000 and lasts for six months but avoids scarring .
