{"text": "a british team has arrived in antarctica to begin a search for life in a lake that has lain buried under nearly 10,000 ft of ice for up to a half a million years . scientists from the british antarctic survey are preparing to bore down to the subglacial lake ellsworth , deep beneath the west antarctic ice sheet , to collect samples of water and sediment . toiling under the midnight sun , they will endure temperatures well below freezing in a quest to discover whether life can survive in one of the harshest environments on earth . the lake ellsworth drill site on the west antarctic ice sheet : four british scientists arrived at the site yesterday to finalise preparations for drilling down to a lake locked beneath nearly 10,000 ft of ice . should they find any organisms living in the icy depths , it could offer tantalising clues as to how life might look if it exists elsewhere in the solar system , such as in the ice-covered oceans of jupiter 's moon europa . the ambitious search comes after a u.s. team last week announced that they had discovered another lake locked for 3,000 years beneath 65ft of antarctic glacier was teeming with living organisms . but the lake ellsworth mission will drill far deeper , into a far more extreme environment , which scientists believe has been isolated for at least 100,000 years - and probably much longer . mike bentley , a geologist on the team . at durham university , told the guardian : ` extreme environments tell you . what constraints there are on life . ` if . we find a particular set of environments where life ca n't exist , that . creates some bookends : it tells you about the limits of life . ' for queen and country : the mission is the most ambitious attempt yet to use hot water drilling to penetrate deep beneath the glaciers which coat our planets southernmost continent . one of more than 400 subglacial lakes . in antarctica , ellsworth is equivalent in size to the uk 's lake . windermere , measuring 7.5 miles long by 1.8 miles wide , and nearly 500ft . deep . completely cut off . from any light from the sun , any life lurking beneath its waters must . endure complete darkness , intense pressure and subzero temperatures . it . is only geothermal heat from the earth 's core and the intense pressure . exerted by the weight of the ice above that has kept it liquid . four . scientists arrived at the camp above the lake yesterday , where they . joined a team of engineers who have spent the past month preparing the . equipment that will be used to penetrate the icy crust . this week they will finalise the preparations for the three-day drilling hot water drilling operation set to begin december 12 . technology : the bas team will melt their way into the lake using a 2 mile-long hose tipped with a brass nozzle that sprays sterile water heated to 90c at a pressure of 2,000 lbs per square inch . under pressure : they will first bore down to . 1,000 ft , then stop to create a cavity , then drill a second hole all the way down to the lake . the . cavity will stop geysers of pressurised water from erupting on the surface . lake ellsworth is one of 200 subglacial lakes in the antarctic : equivalent in size to the uk 's lake windermere , it measures 7.5 miles long by 1.8 miles wide , and is nearly 500ft deep . it has spent the best part of three millennia locked under a 20m block of ice and is six times saltier than sea . and at 13 Â°c below zero , lake vida in east antarctica is one of the coldest aquatic environments on the planet . yet despite posing some of the most hostile conditions on earth , the lake is teeming with life . scientists drilling into the lake have found abundant and diverse bacteria - potentially giving insight into how life might exist on other planets , the journal nature reported . ` lake vida is a model of what happens when you try to freeze a lake solid , and this is the same fate that any lakes on mars would have gone through as the planet turned colder from a watery past , ' said peter doran of the university of illinois , chicago . ` any martian water bodies that did form would have gone through this vida stage before freezing solid , entombing the evidence of the past ecosystem . ' doran and his colleagues have drilled into lake vida twice : once in 2005 and again in 2010 . lake vida was originally thought to be an ice block lake . however , in 1995 , ground penetrating radar surveys revealed a very salty liquid layer underlying a 20m ice cover . the bas team will melt their way into the lake using a 2 mile-long hose tipped with a brass nozzle that sprays sterile water heated to 90c at a pressure of 2,000 lbs per square inch . they will first bore down to 1,000 ft , then stop to create a cavity , then drill a second borehole from the surface down through the this cavity and all the way down to the lake . the cavity is what controls the pressure of the liquid being drawn from ellsworth , stopping a geyser of prehistoric water from bursting back up through the borehole and spilling out over the surface of the ice . once they reach the waters , they will have just 24 hours to sterilise the entrance to the hole with intense uv light and lower a probe into the lake to collect their samples before the hold refreezes again . chris hill , a british antarctic survey engineer who is heading the programme , spoke to the guardian by phone from his tent on the west antarctic ice sheet . ` it 's bloody cold , ' he said . the team will spent six weeks at the site , where temperatures , according to the bas , are -25 c , with winds of 20 knots . for much of that time they will work around the clock . ` once we 've started drilling we ca n't stop , or the pipes will freeze and that 's that , ' mr hill said . ` we have to go to a 24-hour shift pattern for a week and a half to two weeks , and no matter what the weather does , we have to keep going . ' the location of lake ellsworth on the west antarctic ice sheet : it is just one of 400 subglacial lakes detected beneath the ice of the frozen southern continent .", "summary": " any finds could offer tantalising clues about potential life elsewhere in the solar system , such as on jupiter 's moon europa .   mission comes after u.s. team reports another , shallower subglacial lake found teeming with bacterial organisms .
