{"text": "four alleged members of rival gangs in the california prison system launched a hunger strike from solitary confinement that at one point in 2013 comprised 32,000 inmates - black , white and latino - from 33 prisons , it has been revealed . the coordinated 59-day hunger-strike by opposing , racially aligned gangs resulted in a second legislative hearing into shu conditions in sacramento in february during which the california department of corrections and rehabilitation unveiled a package of new regulations . from the pelican bay state prison 's security housing unit -lrb- shu -rrb- , todd ashker , allegedly a senior member of the aryan brotherhood -lrb- an affiliation he denies -rrb- , sitawa jamaa , alleged minister of education for the black guerilla family , arturo castellanos , allegedly a leader in the mexican mafia and antonio guillen , allegely one of three generals of nuestra familia spent years shouting through cell walls to form a political alliance and organize the strike . unlikely allies : todd ashkar -lrb- left -rrb- an alleged member of the aryan brotherhood and sitawa jamaa -lrb- right -rrb- , allegedly a member of the black guerilla family . hispanic gangs : arturo castellanos -lrb- left -rrb- , allegedly a member of the mexican mafia , and antonio guillen -lrb- right -rrb- , an alleged leader of nuestra familia . the strikers ' grievances centered on the solitary confinement policy that some experts consider the most oppressive in the country . the california prison system dictates that a confirmed gang member may be kept in the shu indefinitely , with a review only once every six years - a policy more extreme than that for prisoners who kill another prisoner or guard . some inmates have lived at the pelican bay shu , where they are locked up 22 hours per day in seven by 10 cells , are not allowed phone calls and can not have face-to-face contact with other humans , for four decades , reports the mint press news . the strict isolation policy is not devised as a punishment , but rather functions to isolate dangerous gang members from the rest of the prison population , curbing gang activity . following a reorganization of the shu to separate members of the same gangs in 2006 , the most influential leaders of each gang came to be housed in a ` pod ' together in a wing called the short corridor away from underlings who could be relied upon to do their bidding , reports new york magazine . behind bars : gang members sent to the shu could expect to languish for decades . solitary cell : the men spend most of their time in a tiny , austere cell . ashker , jamaa , castellanos and guillen conducted a years-long conversation through drain pipes and holes in perforated doors , via secret notes and messages through lawyers , in which they became allies for the same cause and called themselves the short corridor collective . inspired by readings about prison protester bobby sands and philosophical works by michel foucault and howard zinn , the prisoners formulated their plan for a statewide hunger strike . for ashker , the idea that they were all members of a single prisoner class and that racial segregation into gangs was encouraged by prisons to keep them divided resonated , reports new york magazine . the men sent letters to an activist group explaining the strike and the reasoning behind it , and asking their fellow prisoners to join them . letters to family and friends spread word of the action further . despite years without seeing another person , the influence of the men in their respective gangs was still potent . isolated : pelican bay state prison shu , in a lonely spot near the oregon coast , is home to 1,100 inmates . meals are delivered through a slot in the door and inmates have a court-mandated five hours of exercise per week in a concrete run . ` castellanos is , if not the most influential mexican mafia member , right there at the top . once you put his name on something with orders , the southern hispanics are going to do it , ' lieutenant jeremy frisk of pelican bay 's institutional gang investigations told new york magazine . a former nuestra familia member confirms his influence in the strike : ` it was chuco guillen , 100 per cent , ' he said . by the time the hunger strikers were 40 days into their self-imposed starvation , 69 remained . the strike was finally broken on its 59th day after jamaa convinced the others that a promise of a special hearing on conditions in the shu was a victory . the state had already won permission to force-feed any inmate whose action put them close to death , reports new york magazine . on september 5 2013 , the short corridor ` suspended ' its action . at the hearing in february , officials agreed that the shu needs to change . ` we all agree that it is far too easy to get in and too hard to get out , and the stays in this environment have been far too long , ' martin hoshino , an undersecretary of corrections , testified . new methods to validate gang activity have been devised and tom ammiano , the chair of the assembly 's committee on public safety , has introduced bill capping the shu confinement of a validated member or associate of a gang or security threat group at three years , reports mint press news .", "summary": " a hunger strike in california prisons took place last year .   it was organized by four alleged leaders from rival racially aligned gangs from the pelican bay state prison 's shu .   the men were in solitary confinement at the facility , which houses ` the worst of the worst '   the unlikely allies were protesting conditions in confinement , including that a gang member may be kept in isolation indefinitely , with a review only once every six years .   they spent years orchestrating the strike in snatched conversations , shouting through walls and down drainpipes and passing messages through lawyers .   they communicated their plan to other prisoners though letters to activist groups and friends and family members .   at its beginning , 30,000 prisoners took part in the strike .   by day 40 , 69 inmates remained on strike and the state won permission to force-feed them .   the strike ended on day 59 , when the inmates won a promise of a special hearing on conditions in the shu .
