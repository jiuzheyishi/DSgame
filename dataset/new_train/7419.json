{"text": "even now , mere mention of the place evokes fear , horror , shame and anger . the workhouse was the institution you ended up in when things really could n't get any worse . to enter one of the foreboding victorian buildings - where even the architecture , it seems , was designed to intimidate - was the ultimate dread . inmates -lrb- and what else to call them ? -rrb- may have been fed and clothed , but the conditions were often barbaric and the fate of those who entered ultimately tragic . uncovering secrets : felicity kendall looks at and old black and white photograph of her relatives . and a shocking number of our ancestors were among them . in the opening minutes of a new documentary , secrets from the workhouse , we learn that one in ten britons has a family connection to these places . more than 500 were built in the 50 years following the 1834 poor law amendment act , which made it compulsory for those seeking government relief from poverty to enter the workhouse . but the governments of the day did n't want to promote them as havens of shelter . instead , they made them as terrifying as possible . those entering had to relinquish all personal items - even clothes - and undertake backbreaking work such as breaking stones for ten hours a day , six days a week . men were separated from their wives ; children from their parents . quite how many of us have the workhouse etched somewhere on the family tree is brought home by the range of celebrities taking part in this harrowing programme , tracing their own ancestors ' steps into these hellholes . actress felicity kendal clearly had no idea what skeletons lay in her family closet , and when she delves into the past of her great-grandmother , mary liddell , she discovers a woman who ended up , shamed and ostracised by society , in the workhouse - not once but twice . endless toil : women in the refectory of saint pancras workhouse , 1895 . mary had married her husband john liddell in 1880 and bore him nine children . her tenth child , however , was the result of an illicit affair and - as was common at the time - mary was cast out of the family home and ended up in a cumbrian workhouse , where her son albert , felicity 's great-uncle , was born . she was , it emerges , branded a woman of ill-repute and low morals . pregnant adulterers like mary were forced to wear special uniforms with yellow and black stripes , designed to shame . with mounting horror , felicity discovers her great-grandmother bore not one but two illegitimate children - pretty much sealing her fate as a fallen woman . at one point , poring over the archives , she shakes her head in disbelief . ` this woman is extraordinary , ' she says . she manages a smile - delivered along with an expletive - before concluding , ` she 's a goer , is n't she ? ' later , discovering that one child dies and another is taken into care , she makes a poignant pilgrimage to an unmarked grave . ` it 's heartbreaking . ' novelist barbara taylor bradford is similarly upset , her features becoming more and more pinched as she discovers exactly what her mother freda would have gone through as a six-year-old child , brought to a workhouse by her own mother . freda never told barbara she 'd been there . it was a secret too terrible to tell even her own family . the multi-millionaire novelist only made the discovery when her biographer went searching for historical records . ` when i found out i burst into tears , ' she admits . ` my mother had been such a sweet person . i could n't imagine her in a workhouse . it begged the question ,  why ?  ' by the end - discovering why her mother never mentioned any of this awful past - she is weeping openly . then there 's actor brian cox , whose great-grandfather ended up in the scottish equivalent of the workhouse , the poorhouse . at one point brian looks as if he might punch the poor archivist charged with breaking the news of how brutally his family was treated by the authorities . ` b ****** s ! ' he declares , as the full horror of his family history is laid bare . his great-grandfather patrick mccann was an irish immigrant who set up home in glasgow with his wife in the late 1800s . they had eight children ; five did n't survive their early years . skeletons in the closet : presenter fern britton discovers both her great-great-great-grandfather and his son died in the workhouse . cox stands in front of the tenement where the family would have lived alongside 40 or 50 other people . so cramped were the conditions that each family had to share one bed . ` it just leaves you ... it 's really bad , ' he says , his voice faltering . brian 's journey to discover what became of patrick mccann makes for difficult viewing . ` unbearable ! ' he says as the pieces are put together . patrick first seeks sanctuary in a poorhouse in 1899 when his son samuel falls ill with bronchitis , but the stay is only a short one . records show he 's back in 1901 , desperately ill himself . he 's discharged again , but is back almost every year thereafter . for 14 years he boomerangs in and out of the poorhouse , at one point - despite medical records showing he 's a very ill man - being branded a ` malingerer ' , until in 1911 he 's declared insane . ` there 's this endless spiral into the abyss , until finally he goes nuts , ' says brian , incredulous . ` it was a harsh system , horrible . it 's an absolute outrage what they did to these people . ' presenter fern britton discovers her great-great-great-grandfather , a man who went by the wonderful name of friend carter , managed to avoid the workhouse until he was 91 years of age . his son jesse was n't so lucky , however . in 1879 jesse , then 23 , fell ill and ended up in a workhouse in kent . jesse did n't survive , but what happened to his body reduces fern to tears . if a family could n't afford to pay for a burial , the authorities had the right to hold onto it for medical research . it would have caused the family great anguish , fern learns , because of beliefs about the afterlife at the time . she is visibly distraught . ' i always thought of the victorians as great philanthropists , god-fearing and kind . yet if you were living in poverty at that time , you were penalised for it . ' friend carter also died in the dreaded workhouse , but somehow the family managed to scrape together the money to take his body back home for burial - a happy ending , of sorts , for fern , who greets the news with tears pouring down her cheeks . the grim days of the workhouse may now be consigned to history , but this show underlines how recent that history is - and how close in other ways too . ` one of my greatest fears has always been poverty , ' brian cox admits . ` now maybe i know why . you begin to realise it 's in the dna .
