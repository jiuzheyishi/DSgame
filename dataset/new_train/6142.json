{"text": "glenys stacey , chief executive of ofqual , said there are different views on whether the as-level qualification should be kept . sweeping reforms to school exams could lead to elite a-levels with a tougher grading scale so universities can identify the brightest pupils . the new-style tests would be given a different set of grades to enable tutors and employers to tell them apart from existing exams . the reforms would effectively create a two-tier system ; old-style a-levels and new versions with beefed-up content , a greater emphasis on essay-writing and a strict limit on exam resits . the move comes after the headmaster of a leading public school criticised current tests as ` mindless  satnav  a-levels ' that did little to inspire pupils and teachers . the new a-levels would be phased in subject by subject over four years , with traditional disciplines likely to be prioritised . by 2018 , all old-style a-levels would be scrapped . one of the biggest changes in the proposals , unveiled by exams watchdog ofqual yesterday , is an overhaul of the current six-point a * to e grading scale . gradual grade inflation has led some universities to complain they struggle to identify the brightest applicants from an increasingly well-qualified field . alternative grading systems could involve a mixture of both marks and grades , with students given percentages alongside an overall grade . however , ofqual admitted its shake-up would need to ensure there was no discrimination against candidates who had completed their a-levels under the old system . ofqual said : ` this consultation provides an opportunity to revisit the grading structure of a-levels . it may be that there are better ways to support university selection and secure appropriate differentiation . ' a spokesman for the watchdog added : ` we are asking whether there are enough points on the grading scale to offer appropriate differentiation . ` with some subjects being reformed before others , we are asking whether there should be a way to differentiate between new a-levels and those done the old way . would it be right to expect employers to check which year exams were taken ? should this be clear from the way that the exams are recorded ? ' as-levels could be scrapped under plans to reform exams . he added that the proposals aimed to ` increase the currency ' of a-levels and improve them ` so they are fit for purpose and held in high public regard ' . other reforms under consideration include strict rules on the number and mix of essays , multiple-choice questions and in-depth research a-levels should contain in order to stop teachers ` playing the system ' by choosing easy exams . universities -- instead of civil servants -- would decide the content of syllabuses and at least 20 would need to endorse each new qualification before it can be ` signed off ' . the future of as-levels -- which are taken after a year of sixth-form studies and contribute 50 per cent to the overall a-level grade -- is also in doubt . if a-levels are retained , the opportunities for resitting exams at a later date to inflate final grades would be slashed . january exam sittings would be axed and teenagers would be given just one chance to retake , the following summer . ofqual warned that ` students do not always treat exams seriously if they know they have the opportunity to resit ' . dr anthony seldon , master of wellington college in berkshire , said : ` the proposals are a step in the right direction , in that it would be a move away from the mindless  satnav  a-level towards a real test of students ' abilities and the exams would be more likely to inspire challenging and thoughtful teaching . ' however , unions warned against rushing the reforms . russell hobby , of the national association of head teachers , said : ` it needs to be said that the volume of change in schools at the moment is overwhelming . ` there is a serious risk that avoidable mistakes will slip in and valuable reforms will be implemented badly in the rush and turbulence .
