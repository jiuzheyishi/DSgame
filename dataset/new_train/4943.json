{"text": "it 's starting to feel like groundhog day for women in corporate america . another year , another story of zero growth for women when it comes to holding corporate board seats and executive office positions , according to a new report by catalyst , a nonprofit focused on women and business . for the eighth year in a row , the group found no significant change in the number of female members of corporate boards , with women holding 16.9 % of board seats in 2013 versus 16.6 % last year . and while there was big news earlier this week when mary barra was named gm 's new chief executive officer -- the first woman to head a major u.s. automaker -- there has been no uptick in the total number of female executive leaders for the fourth year in a row , according to catalyst . last year , women had 14.3 % of executive officer positions , and this year the percentage is nearly the same , 14.6 % .  i would look at the numbers and say , for those companies who are not making the advancement of women to leadership a priority , they should really be embarrassed ,  said deborah gillis , catalyst 's chief operating officer , who will take over as president and chief executive officer in january .  there is absolutely no excuse in 2013 to continue to have women underrepresented to this degree in the leadership of fortune 500 companies .  consider twitter , where women were n't just underrepresented on the company 's board -- they did n't exist . that is , until earlier this month when the company , after criticism of its all-male board , named its first female board member : marjorie scardino , the former chief executive officer of a london-based education and media conglomerate . why no change for women at the top ? the big question is : why so little movement for women ? why -- at a time when women make up half the labor force , when there has been plenty of research on how a diverse board and leadership team of men and women improves a company 's bottom line and when women have been thinking more about  leaning in  through marriage and motherhood -- are we finding absolutely no change for women at the top ? tom falk is chairman and chief executive officer of kimberly-clark corp. , one of the 20 % of companies where women hold one-quarter or more of executive officer positions . in fact , at kimberly-clark , four out of 10 executive officers are women and 25 % of the board 's seats are held by women . in his view , the issue is n't about equity or fairness , but attracting the best talent , which benefits a company 's bottom line .  malcolm gladwell tells a very simple analogy ,  said falk , a catalyst board member , during a phone interview .  if you and i were going to pick an all-star team and we had a room with a hundred people in it and you got to pick your share of the team from the whole hundred people and i only got to pick from 50 people on the right side of the room , who would have a better team ? you would ,  he said .  for some reason , i think lots of management teams are n't seeing it that way . they 're picking the best athlete for a role , but they are not really insisting on a diverse slate and looking broadly to make sure they 've got talent from all the best pools that are available to them ,  said falk , a 30-year company veteran . what stands in the way of women . charlotte laurent-ottomane is executive director of the thirty percent coalition , a national advocacy organization focused on getting 30 % of board seats in the united states to be held by women by the end of 2015 . one big stumbling block for women , she said , is the length of term limits on boards , which , on average , are about 10 years .  if you are not renewing your board , regardless of who your candidates are , except for every 10 to 20 years , then you are obviously not going to bring any new candidates in .  laurent-ottomane also said the composition of many boards is a problem :  if you take a board -lrb- where -rrb- the leadership is only considering sitting or former ceos of their industry , which i think most corporate governance experts would agree ... is not a healthy approach ... obviously , you are not going to get women because it goes all the way down the food chain .  part of the challenge , too , is convincing male leaders there 's not a limited supply of strong female candidates . men and women see different reasons for why there are n't more women on corporate boards , according to a survey of more than 1,000 board members from around the world in 2010 , 2011 and 2012 by harvard business school professor boris groysberg and researcher deborah bell .  when it came to trying to understand ... why we are not making as much progress having more women on boards , you had male board directors who basically said , ` you know what , there 's not enough supply , '  said groysberg , who created a class at harvard business school focusing on ways to get more women on corporate boards .  then you have another side -- you have female boards of directors who are basically saying it has nothing to do with supply . what 's happening is that it 's impossible to get on boards . so you have two very different explanations ,  he said . falk , the ceo , shared a story from an executive many years ago who wanted to hire a female sales rep on his team .  his group that was doing the hiring came back and said , ` you know what , we 've looked and looked and we just ca n't find good female sales reps. can we just hire from our usual sources ? '   he said , ` well , i 'll tell you what : i want to first interview all the females that you 've rejected . ' so guess what ? they went out and found some female sales reps.  what works to add female leaders . while the story for women in corporate america has n't changed much over the last several years , there 's a completely different narrative for women in many other countries .  the bottom line is countries around the world are paying attention ,  said gillis of catalyst .  the key is , they 're saying this is a priority and we need to act now .  in australia , the country launched a  male champion of change initiative ,  which , among other measures , includes having companies publicly disclose their gender diversity targets . since then , women 's share of executive officer positions jumped from 8.3 % in 2009 to 16.6 % in 2013 , gillis said . in england , after a call for companies to voluntarily increase targets for the number of women in leadership , women 's representation in the ftse 100 index or the  footsie  -- the 100 companies listed on the london stock exchange -- jumped to almost 19 % from 12.5 % in 2011 , according to catalyst . some european countries , like norway , have gone further , mandating controversial quotas , requiring a certain number of seats of every company 's board be filled by women . laurent-ottomane of the thirty percent coalition likes much of what other countries are doing , but said she believes quotas would n't be effective in the united states .  quotas basically force companies to bring in candidates just to achieve -lrb- a -rrb- goal , and i 'm not sure that 's necessarily the most healthy way to put a board together ,  she said . the key , laurent-ottomane said , is getting the commitment and engagement of corporate leaders themselves .  if corporate leaders engage and work together and try to determine tactically how we do this , i think that we will be successful ,  she said . putting diversity on the agenda . falk , who has been leading kimberly-clark for 10 years , said he probably did n't put enough emphasis on the issue of advancement for women early in his tenure as ceo .  i had women on my team . i was supporting the diversity , but it was n't enough on my leadership agenda . i was n't pushing hard enough on it so my board pushed me to say , ` hey , you 've been going sideways for a couple of years on this . what are you going to do to get it on your agenda ? '  groysberg 's new class at harvard focuses on what women can do to build their careers , what organizations can do to create more inclusive cultures and what governments can do to help . for many reasons , he sees a personal stake in the future .  i have four children , two are girls and they 're pretty young ,  he said .  i am going to do everything in my power to make sure that i helped to build companies in 10 years that will be much , much more receptive to my daughters than the companies that i know exist in 2013 .  follow kelly wallace on twitter and like cnn living on facebook .", "summary": " eighth consecutive year of no growth in female corporate board seats , new report says .   no change in number of women executive officers , nonprofit catalyst report finds .   one ceo says companies should focus on finding the best talent , including women .   harvard survey : some male board directors think there are n't enough female candidates .
