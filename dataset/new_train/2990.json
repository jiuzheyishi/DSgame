{"text": "newtown , connecticut the center of newtown could n't be more decked out for the holidays . it seems like there are ribbons and wreaths for every lamppost and door . lights sparkle from trees , and a big wood sign calls residents to the local firehouse to pick up even more holiday sprigs . that same firehouse is where parents ran in panic after receiving robocalls and texts about a shooting friday at sandy hook elementary school up the street . now , the high spirits of the holidays have been darkened . signs in storefronts have stopped declaring holiday cheer and are calling instead for prayer and mourning . the firehouse is ringed by first responders greeting members of the community coming to drop flowers and notes . a sign pointing to the entrance of the local grade school now marks the scene of a massacre of young children . a day that started like any other . since the shooting , tears fall easily in this town , especially after police released the sober list of names of the dead . it was striking as much for the birth dates as for the length . the column  dob  listed 20 born in the years 2005 and 2006 . then six names of female educators young and middle-aged . the 7th birthday of a little girl named josephine gay happened last week . another named charlotte bacon would have turned 7 in february . remembering the victims .  i do n't think there are words ,  said a woman as she broke down in tears when she came to leave flowers for the dead . her daughter also went to the elementary school . she had listened to the robocall about the shooter , feeling anything but calm . like a lot of mothers in the area , she had been swept by panic wondering which school had an unfolding crime and whether her child might be among those injured or killed . another woman , miriam espinoza , fell to the grass and wept when she saw the flowers around the elementary school sign post . she clutched her third-grader , recounting her later relief as she discovered her child was not among the victims .  but those other mamas ,  she said in spanish ,  how did they go forward ?  it was as if an entire town suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder . no one was left unmarked since those harrowing minutes friday of sorting out who had and had not survived , and the many hours since of figuring out how close danger had touched their lives . was their child ok ? what about their neighbor 's child or the teacher who once taught their teen ? laura phelps and husband nick have a first and third-grader at the school . they rushed to sandy hook elementary to see if their children were among the injured or dead .  when we got our children and i saw my son 's teacher , they were like ghosts , but they were incredibly composed ; they were calm ; they had their sheets with them checking off , making sure each child went with their parent ,  she said .  they did everything possible to keep our kids safe , and i wish i had known when i looked at their faces just to say thank you because i have my children .  teacher : ' i wanted to be the last thing they heard , not the gunfire ' as mourners placed flowers for the dead , their friends could barely put together words . alexander galinsky walked with his head dipped as he thought of a friend who lost a son .  last night we felt something unusual because they did n't respond on the phone calls , messages ,  he said of his friend .  last night they basically called us and -lrb- there were -rrb- just a few words . -lrb- their son is -rrb- not with us anymore .  this family had come from england two years ago but quickly fit into a tightly knit community . galinsky said he began considering them close friends almost overnight .  we can not comprehend with our minds and our hearts ,  he said . some parents ' voices still rattled as they uttered that awful word  lockdown ,  something children practice with their teachers . it is a modern addition to a fall season of fire drills and other safety lessons for the littlest of schoolchildren . but the word shocked adults when it took on real-life meaning . library clerk mary ann jacob fell into the arms of her husband as she recounted hearing crackling over the school 's public address system .  i thought they 'd left it on so i just called the office to tell them we could hear them ,  she said . a member of the office staff told her about the shooter so she and some other staff hustled the kids into a storage closet .  we practice these lockdowns ; we have to have several by a certain date ,  she said . she handed out pieces of paper and crayons to the cluster of 6-year-olds to keep them quiet . latest developments . jacob said the door was kept locked while the principal and other staff were in the halls fighting off an attack . they were so scared of what was unfolding that they did n't even open the door for police when they finally came knocking .  i made him show his badge ,  she said . the town 's initial trauma has turned to mourning as churches opened their doors for counseling and services , and a vigil for one teacher drew hundreds . on sunday , there were even more services as well as a planned visit by president barack obama , all as the investigation unfolds into how a day that began with promises of some first-graders building gingerbread houses after school had ended this way . one woman who came with flowers said she was there because she did n't know what else to do . her friend could only offer this response :  i think it 's coming to these memorials , i think it 's being close from one family to another . and just being there . you know just hugs ; i do n't think there are any words .  how you can help .", "summary": " signs of holiday cheer replaced with calls for prayer and mourning .   initial trauma turns to grief as newtown families come together .   parents begin to face the new reality in newtown , connecticut .
