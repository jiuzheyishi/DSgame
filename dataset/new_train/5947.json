{"text": "if you are looking for a way to raise more money for charity , science has a simple answer : go blonde . donors to charities give nearly a quarter more if they are approached by a blonde fundraiser than a brunette , a study claims . but be careful which families you pick . the same research shows that blondes receive significantly lower donations at non-caucasian households . money spinner : blonde hair can increase the amount of donations a woman raising money for charity can solicit by as much as 23 per cent , a study claims . researchers from the university of tennessee , knoxville conducted a study to investigate the effect of hair colour on the generosity of those solicited for charitable donations . ` this study examines how a cosmetic attribute - hair colour - impacts productivity in a door-to-door fund-raising experiment , ' wrote michael price , assistant professor of economics , in the study published in economics letters . taking into account previous studies which showed how attractiveness affected earnings , professor price investigated whether similar returns are correlated with hair colour . he found that blonde women gained much more from their perceived good looks , but that this was only the case when they visited caucasian households - with non-caucasian households apparently unaffected by good looking blondes . ` the returns to physical appearance are approximately 71.6 to 76.0 per cent greater for a blonde female than a brunette -lrb- minority -rrb- counterpart , ' professor price wrote . ` interestingly , the returns to beauty for blonde females are driven entirely by caucasian households . in fact , blondes receive significantly lower donations at non-caucasian households . ` yet there is no discernible difference across household types for both brunette and minority females . ' unaffected : the study also showed that the extra . fundraising effect of blonde hair was lost when blonde volunteers . visited non-caucasians - but that brunettes and ethnic minority . volunteers still received as much . women charged with murder who plead self defence are more likely to be perceived as guilty if have ` thick lips ' and ` smooth and harmonious facial features ' , says a study . the findings made by a team from the university of grenada , spain , contradict the generally held stereotype that beauty deflects criminal responsibility . they found that in the case of a woman claiming self defence in the killing of an abusive husband , police officers were more likely to regard as innocent defendants who were described as unattractive . the findings also showed that women perceived as more independent and in charge of their lives were also more likely to be seen as guilty of murder . legal processes are ideally conducted without bias , but in reality biases influence all human judgements and looking at how these prejudices shape behaviour should help to minimise their effect . in the past , social psychologists had widely accepted the contention that beautiful people are less likely to be regarded as criminally responsible . the study looked at the amounts of money people living in pitt county , north carolina , were willing to contribute to the center for natural hazards mitigation research at east carolina university . professor price enlisted 44 volunteers to visit 1,755 potential donor households , 522 of which actually contributed money to the cause . however , for the purposes of the study , the research was restricted to 955 households who were approached by 23 female volunteers . professor price and his team took digital photos of each of these female volunteers , divided them into blondes , brunettes and minorities , and asked undergraduate students to rate their attractiveness . they found that households were around 13 per cent more likely to contribute when approached by an attractive female . however , keeping beauty a constant , findings showed that households were 23 per cent more likely to make a donation when visited by a blonde femail than a brunette who was judged just as attractive . however , when blondes visited minority households , findings showed the effects of their attractiveness was muted , with the effect of increasing the beauty of the blonde visitor 509.7 per cent lower than that of a brunette . 'em pirical results suggest that returns to physical appearance are , on average , greater for blonde females but depend critically on characteristics of the potential donor , ' professor price concluded .", "summary": " blondes found to raise 23 per cent more than equally attractive brunettes .   however the ` blonde effect ' is entirely driven by caucasian donors .   blondes found to receive significantly less from minority households .
