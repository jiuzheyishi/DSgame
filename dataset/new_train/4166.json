{"text": "freed from prison , former ukrainian prime minister yulia tymoshenko returned saturday to the battleground capital the same day the country 's president said he left kiev because of a  coup .  tymoshenko 's release was the latest in a day of dramatic , fast-paced developments that saw parliament vote to remove president viktor yanukovych from office and call for new elections .  today , ukraine has finished with this terrible dictator , mr. yanukovych ,  tymoshenko told a cheering crowd of thousands in kiev 's independence square , the scene of deadly demonstrations . just hours after her release from a prison hospital , tymoshenko called for justice for protesters killed in demonstrations sparked by the president 's decision to scrap a trade deal with the european union in favor of one with russia .  you were able to change ukraine , and you can do everything ,  she told the crowd .  everyone has a right to take part in building a european , independent state .  but yanukovych took to television airwaves , saying he had been forced to leave kiev because of  vandalism , crime and a coup .   i do n't plan to leave the country . i do n't plan to resign . i am the legitimate president ,  he said in an interview from kharkiv , a pro-russian stronghold near ukraine 's border with that nation .  ... what i am going to do next is to protect my country from the split , to stop the bloodshed . i do n't know how to do it yet . i am in kharkiv and i do n't know what i am going to do next .  he did not address reports that he attempted to leave the country by airplane . according to the head of ukraine 's border guard service , sergei astakov , yanukovych and his entourage attempted to board a charter flight without proper documentation in the eastern city of donetsk . he was on the tarmac when he was turned back by security forces , astakov told cnn , confirming an account he gave to ukraine 's interfax news agency . in that account , astakov said border security had approached the plane to check paperwork , and an armed group of people on the plane attempted to offer money to the inspectors to allow the flight to take off . when the inspectors refused the money , yanukovych and others in his entourage exited the plane and got into two vehicles that drove up on the tarmac , astakov is quoted as saying . ukraine 's dismissed interior minister , vitaliy zakharchenko , also was refused exit from the country in a similar incident at the same airport , astakov said . the events of the day raise questions about just who is in control in ukraine , with parliament voting to oust yanukovych and hold new elections on may 25 . the vote came just 24 hours after yanukovych signed a peace deal with the opposition intended to end days of bloody protests . ` people 's residence ' at the presidential residence in a kiev suburb , the president 's living quarters were vacant , his guards gone . government buildings , protest gatherings and the central city were devoid of police and security forces , who had opened fire on protesters this week , killing dozens . track how the crisis in ukraine unfolded . as a cnn crew drove to yanukovych 's residence , it passed checkpoints set up by protesters . when the crew arrived , the gatekeepers said they were not allowing the general public onto the grounds , but they let journalists enter . the civil servants asked that the reporters treat his home as a crime scene and referred to it as the  people 's residence .  but not everyone in ukraine was happy with the news . the country is ethnically split , with many ethnic russians living in the east . the rest comprises mostly ethnic ukrainians . in several cities , people have toppled statues of vladimir lenin , a founder of the soviet union . the communist empire had included ukraine until it gained independence in 1991 after the fall of the soviet union . in a sign of the deep divisions , government supporters took to the streets saturday night in kharkiv to protect a monument to lenin that anti-government protesters threatened to tear down . police in riot gear stood between the two sides , while others erected a temporary fence around the monument . freeing tymoshenko . in the verkhovna rada , ukraine 's parliament , lawmakers passed a resolution to free tymoshenko , a hero of the country 's 2004 revolution that forced the questionable results of a presidential election won by yanukovych to be thrown out . tymoshenko served as prime minister from 2007 to 2010 , and was forced out of office after losing an election to yanukovych . she was sentenced in 2011 to seven years in prison after being convicted of abuse of authority over a natural gas deal negotiated with russia in 2009 . the case against her was widely considered to have been politically motivated , and the united states and other western nations called her  a political prisoner .  in 2012 , after she was allegedly beaten unconscious by guards , she went on a hunger strike to draw attention to  violence and lack of rights  in her country . in washington , white house press secretary jay carney said u.s. officials were closely monitoring developments .  we have consistently advocated a de-escalation of violence , constitutional change , a coalition government , and early elections , and today 's developments could move us closer to that goal ,  he said in a statement . russia 's ambassador to the united nations , vitaly churkin , condemned what he called western attempts to influence the outcome of the tumult in ukraine .  either they do n't understand the consequences of what they 're doing , or they 're engaged in a very provocative game of destabilizing ukraine and therefore eastern europe ,  churkin said in a post on his official twitter account . a day earlier , churkin accused the opposition of wanting to take power by force .  if those so-called democratic opposition leaders come to power on the shoulders of thugs that will not produce democracy in ukraine ,  he said . by saturday , a tidal wave of political change appeared to be engulfing ukraine with key yanukovych allies leaving office , and the presidential duties being handed off until a new cabinet has been selected . during the parliamentary session , resignations were announced for the speaker and another leading presidential ally . hours later , parliament elected a new speaker , a rival to yanukovych , and gave him the duty of coordinating the executive office until a new cabinet is in place . another opposition parliamentarian received the duties of acting interior minister . the verkhovna rada sacked yanukovych 's prosecutor general . discord 's roots . the unrest began in november , when yanukovych scrapped a european union trade deal and turned toward russia . russia , which has offered to lend money to cash-strapped ukraine in a deal worth billions of dollars and to lower its gas prices , has pressured yanukovych to crack down on demonstrators . western leaders , who have offered ukraine a long-term aid package requiring economic modernization , urged him to show restraint , open the government to the opposition and let the democratic process work out deep-seated political differences . but the fight was also about corruption and control . the opposition called yanukovych heavy-handed , with protesters saying they would n't leave independence square until he resigned . tensions boiled over tuesday , when security forces charged into a kiev crowd with stun grenades , nightsticks and armored personnel carriers . the violence escalated , leaving dozens -- protesters and police alike -- dead . explainer : what and who are behind ukraine 's political crisis ? ireport
