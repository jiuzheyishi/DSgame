{"text": "a pharmacy graduate from massachusetts who sympathized with al-qaeda , and traveled to yemen in the hopes of linking up with the terrorist group , was sentenced thursday to 17 1/2 years in federal prison , court officials said . tarek mehanna , 29 , was found guilty in december of conspiring to help al qaeda , conspiring to commit murder in a foreign country and making false statements .  this is one of the most significant terror-related cases ever brought ,  said boston college law professor george brown .  prosecutions like this push the envelope in terms of how far the government can go after an individual 's conduct prior to committing any terrorist act .  the government was a big winner today .  mehanna traveled to yemen in 2004 to receive training to kill american soldiers and support terrorism at home . but he never found a training camp , and it remains unclear if he ever made contact with a terrorist group . after returning to the united states , mehanna posted al qaeda recruitment videos and documents on the internet , and was convicted of providing material support to terrorists though it 's again not clear if he ever actually made contact with the group . prosecutors say mehanna had been in touch with a man named daniel joseph maldonado , who headed to the horn of africa to receive jihadist training . maldonado pleaded guilty in 2007 to traveling to somalia to fight in a  jihad  against the transitional government there .  you might call -lrb- mehanna -rrb- a terrorist wannabe ,  said brown , who noted that thursday 's sentencing reflected an apparent compromise .  i think the judge wanted to be cautious and distinguish this kind of conduct from the more fundamental -lrb- and traditional descriptions of -rrb- terrorist acts ,  brown said . federal prosecutors had asked for 25 years , and mehanna could have faced life in prison . the case has been a focus of legal experts , who debated the extent of free speech protection and how and when authorities can move against someone believed to be engaged pre-terror-related activity . mehanna 's lawyers had argued that in collecting and distributing jihadist propaganda upon his return to the u.s. , he was exercising his first amendment rights . some of the material he translated , they say , involved mujahedeen fighting the soviet occupation of afghanistan more than two decades ago . but prosecutors instead argued that law enforcement has the responsibility to both head off and deter potential terrorist threats .  there is a greater value in using this case to achieve the ends of general deterrence than in terrorism cases involving isolated or short-lived activities ,  they said in a statement .  that is because mehanna 's actions are the kind that most individuals who are radicalized in america are likely to contemplate replicating -- traveling overseas to get terrorism experience , and using the internet to connect with and support other terrorists .  mehanna 's supporters , meanwhile , have pledged their backing online , setting up a website in his defense . u.s. district judge george a. o'toole also handed mehanna seven years of supervised release as a part of the closely watched decision thursday . hailing from a boston suburb , mehanna earned a doctorate at the massachusetts college of pharmacy and health sciences , where his father worked as a professor .", "summary": " tarek mehanna , 29 , was found guilty of conspiring to help al qaeda , other charges .   he sought training in yemen , but it 's not clear if he ever made contact with a terror group .   experts question implications of case ; lawyers : mehanna was exercising free speech rights .
