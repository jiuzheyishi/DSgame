{"text": "a worker operating a machine in a family workshop in china accidentally cut off his hand -- which doctors were able to save by grafting it onto his lower calf . the worker , xie wei , said he was initially unsure if his right hand could be saved , but he thought it was worth a try . the hand went without a blood supply for many hours while xie searched for a hospital that could perform such a surgery . xie said that he went to local hospitals near the factory first , but he said they told him they  did not have the skills to help .  eventually he found a hospital about two hours away where doctors believed they could do it . xie kept his hand in a plastic bag at first , then stored it in a cooler of ice . in total , it took about seven hours to get to a doctor who could help . the doctor , dr. tang juyu , is a specialist in difficult tissue and wound repair cases . before xie went into the operation , tang told him he was optimistic and predicted he would regain the use of his hand , according to xie . tang decided the best way to save the hand was to attach it to xie 's calf where there was a good blood supply . the hand would need to stay there until xie 's arm could fully heal . tang believes there have been about 20 such cases in all of china and all of them have been successful . there is no data , as only case studies have been performed . tang said in a similar operation in 2004 , he grafted a hand onto a patient 's belly . that operation was a success . when xie woke up from the operation he said he was surprised to find his hand on his calf . he says his first reaction at the time was to think it was  unbelievable  and  weird .  the hand itself felt warm , he said , but it was numb since no nerves were connected and only blood vessels were attached . his leg felt no different , he said , but was  heavier than usual .  after about a month his arm was better healed , and he had another surgery where his hand was reattached . tang says this second stage of the operation is actually more challenging , but everything went smoothly . xie has recovered without complications and has been discharged . he is currently resting at home . he said he can twist his wrist to a certain degree , but does n't have full movement with his fingers , at least not yet . doctors told him a full recovery for the nerves in his hand should take about six months . xie said he is n't sure what his future may bring . today he is concentrating on recovering fully . the factory did pay for his operation , which cost about 300,000 chinese yuan , or about $ 49,400 . most of all , xie said , he is thankful to doctors for  living up to their promise  that they would be able to reattach his hand and make it functional again . cnn 's april ma and susan wang in beijing contributed to this report .", "summary": " man cut off hand at work and searched for a surgeon for 7 hours .   the surgeon attached it to his calf where there was a good blood supply .   there have been about 20 such successful operations in all of china .
