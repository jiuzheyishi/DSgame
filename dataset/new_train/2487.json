{"text": "it happens every so often : a military sexual assault scandal hits the headlines . most recently , an air force general decided to pardon an officer convicted of rape . then came revelations that not one but two of the service members that the military assigned to prevent sex abuse are under investigation for perpetrating it . and in light of a new pentagon report estimating the number of military sexual assaults at 26,000 a year -- about half of them against men -- this time around , even many in the military community agree there is a problem that wo n't go away and ca n't be ignored . congress is reacting , as it often does to headlines , by proposing reforms . but the current crop of ideas misses the mark . sergeant trained to protect victims faces sexual assault allegations . the bills primarily propose changes to a commander 's authority to start or control cases in the military criminal justice system . but courts martial , with their due process and proof beyond a reasonable doubt , will always be too rare to make a difference . what changed the face of civilian employment was a civil legal approach -- sexual harassment law -- that made it cost money when employees are assaulted . this approach should n't be sidelined in addressing the military sexual assault problem . the civil legal system reaches people who probably wo n't see a criminal prosecution . it reaches people such as joseph oncale , who was sexually assaulted by several co-workers on an offshore oil rig in the gulf of mexico . it reaches people such as mechelle vinson , who was 19 when she started work at a bank and the manager demanded that she sleep with him . the civil legal solution gives voice to workers who are not that different from the military members who face a command gone wrong : people working long hours , with few options , sometimes living at work , sometimes immigrants with nowhere else to go . the civil system balances workers ' needs against legitimate business concerns -- to give managers authority -- by making the employer pay if managers abuse that authority . the employer has an economic incentive to make sure that does n't happen . after officer charged in sex assault , military faces questions . this law changed what people thought was right . a friend told me that in the 1960s , a teacher told her she needed to sleep with him to pass . she said :  we just called that life .  now , in the civilian world , it 's called sexual harassment , and it 's illegal . the military has n't had the benefit of that change . civilian judges -lrb- not congress , and not the military -rrb- made up special military immunities , loosely called the feres doctrine , to block it . it 's time to overrule them . the civil legal approach can nip problems in the bud . it can stop a predator who is testing the waters or change a command environment that has lost sight of the need to treat all of its personnel professionally . if service members had the same rights as other employees to bring civil lawsuits , victims would have direct power to challenge abuses of authority . they would not have to wait for government officials to take up their case , and they might not have to wait until something as horrific as a criminal rape happened to them . military rape victims : stop blaming us . but does n't sexual harassment mean policing petty slights and awkward jokes ? that 's a myth . even in the civilian workplace , to win you have to show behavior that is severe or pervasive to the objective observer -- something so serious or so frequent that it significantly alters working conditions . the military is not the civilian workplace , and its unique needs have to be considered carefully in any reform , whether criminal or civil . civil actions are , after all , potentially less disruptive than outside prosecutors and anonymous tips . what happens next should come from a partnership between the uniformed services and civilian experts . but it should look more broadly at solutions that go beyond the latest scandal . of course , some people think it would be unfair to make the military change . boys will be boys , the thinking goes . when i joined the military , many of my contemporaries cringed , fearing the worst , but they were wrong : the men i served with met the highest standards of professionalism . to expect anything less is to undersell our men , and women , in uniform . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of maia goodell .", "summary": " recently , two military sexual assault scandals hit the headlines .   maia goodell : congress should look beyond the military criminal justice system .   she says the military should use civil legal solution on sexual assault cases .   goodell : if service members can file civil lawsuits , victims can directly challenge abuser .
