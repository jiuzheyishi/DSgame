{"text": "roy hodgson has been taken to task by some psycho-babble fitness guru for failing to understand that raheem sterling , at coming up to 20 , needs more rest between football games than stars just a few months older than he is . what nonsense . the england manager 's only real mistake was sending on sterling as a second half substitute in estonia and thereby giving a cap to a player who had announced himself too tired to give his all for his country . raheem sterling -lrb- right -rrb- told england boss roy hodgson that he was too tired to start against estonia . hodgson started sterling -lrb- second right -rrb- on the bench for england 's 1-0 euro 2016 qualifying win in estonia . if sterling was being that precious he ought not to have been granted an honour which should be deemed priceless . the trolling to which this young man has been subjected on the internet has been unpleasant , unnecessary and in some cases downright sick . however , he did need reminding that it is a privilege to pull on the england shirt and that great players do not pick and choose their international appearances . sterling -lrb- centre -rrb- came on as a second half substitute for jordan henderson against estonia in tallinn . of the players england used against estonia , only gary cahill has played more minutes this season than raheem sterling ... gary cahill 1164 minutes played . raheem sterling 1079 mins . jack wilshere 1064 mins . jordan henderson 1035 mins . calum chambers 995 mins . joe hart 990 mins . leighton baines 990 mins . phil jagielka 919 mins . danny welbeck 836 mins . wayne rooney 758 mins . fabian delph 741 mins . adam lallana 538 mins . paul scholes , a surprisingly outspoken commentator after spending his distinguished playing career saying next to nothing , performed that service by confirming that he would never have failed to turn out for england unless he was really sick or injured . pele 's record talks louder than words . at the age of 17 he shook off the injurious effects of an arduous club season with santos to lead brazil to 1958 world cup glory in sweden with six goals in four matches , including a hat-trick in the semi and a brace in the final . he then collapsed with exhaustion at the final whistle but the effects of his exertions did not prevent him going on to score more than a thousand goals in a career overflowing with honours , including more world cups . but then not even the greatest footballer of all time was pampered in those days . and it is difficult to resist the conclusion that it is the money which spoils today 's young players . if our premier league princelings were not banking hundreds of thousands of pounds a week would any of them even consider pulling out of an england match ? paul scholes -lrb- centre -rrb- , training here in his man united days , claimed rest days should be for older players . pele collapsed with exhaustion at the end of the 1958 world cup final after scoring a brace for brazil . pele , aged just 17 , scored six goals in four matches at the world cup following a gruelling season with santos . not , i would suggest , if they still needed international fame to cement their fortune . also - and never mind that it risks abuse from the ` twitterers ' for saying this -- it is worth drawing to master sterling 's attention that younger men than he fight and die for this country . the war-zone is no place for feeling a mite too tired for action -- and the rewards are nothing like as enormous . with sterling volunteering for england duty in the under-21 european championships next year , it does seem he has got the message . so when hodgson bumps into brendan rodgers at qpr this very sunday , i trust he will not be making any apologies . liverpool 's manager is never slow to make excuses for his players . liverpool boss brendan rodgers -lrb- left -rrb- is set to meet hodgson at loftus road on sunday for the clash with qpr . like so many , he puts the interests of his club first . he can hardly be blamed for doing so , especially in this case where there are unsettling suggestions that sterling may already be fidgeting for a move elsewhere . but that does not mean that rodgers paints the full picture . sterling is a precocious talent and i for one will be disappointed if he does not develop into a vibrant force for both liverpool and england . yes , he may need nurturing to some extent -- but not over-protecting . since england could pretty well qualify for euro 2016 even if they failed to turn up for the rest of their group matches , there was no need to send him on in the second half last sunday . better to have sent him home to bed . sterling returned to liverpool 's melwood training ground on tuesday ahead of the premier league 's return . as wayne rooney closes in on sir bobby charlton 's record of 49 england goals , there are many who would begrudge him usurping such a legend of the beautiful game . so it is worth putting on record that charlton is not one them . as a director of manchester united , sir bobby is a frequent and inspirational visitor to the old trafford dressing room and has struck up a warm relationship with rooney . wayne rooney closed in on sir bobby charlton 's scoring record of 49 england goals by netting against estonia . charlton , pictured with rooney in 2010 , has struck up a warm relationship with the manchester united striker . 1 -rrb- sir bobby charlton - 49 goals -lrb- 106 caps -rrb- . 2 -rrb- gary lineker - 48 -lrb- 80 caps -rrb- . -lrb- own goals - 47 -rrb- . 3 -rrb- jimmy greaves - 44 -lrb- 57 caps -rrb- . 4 -rrb- wayne rooney - 43 -lrb- 99 caps -rrb- . 5 -rrb- michael owen - 40 -lrb- 89 caps -rrb- . 6 -rrb- naf lofthouse - 30 -lrb- 33 caps -rrb- . = 6 -rrb- alan shearer - 30 -lrb- 63 caps -rrb- . = 6 -rrb- tom finney - 30 -lrb- 76 caps -rrb- . 9 -rrb- vivian woodward - 29 -lrb- 23 caps -rrb- . = 9 -rrb- frank lampard - 29 -lrb- 106 caps -rrb- . sunday 's penalty in estonia brought rooney to within six goals of that magic number and charlton will be applauding if he closes the gap still further when england meet slovenia at wembley on november 15 . and why not ? memory may insist that jimmy greaves and gary lineker -- who are also in the throes of being overtaken - were sharper goalscorers but there should be no denying the magnitude of rooney 's impending achievement . not that he should count those chickens yet . as lineker discovered when he missed the penalty from which he should have equalled charlton 's record , there can be many a slip between opportunity and delivery . nor do statistics alone assert who is the greater . the circumstances in which those goals are scored brings its own perspective . not until his third tournament did rooney score his so-far solitary goal at the world cup finals -- that mere consolation tap-in during defeat by uruguay this summer . jimmy greaves and gary lineker are third and second respectively in the list of england 's all-time goalscorers . rooney celebrates after scoring his so-far solitary goal at a world cup - against uruguay during the summer . bobby charlton shoots and scores against portugal in england 's 2-1 semi-final victory at wembley in 1966 . charlton celebrates and runs with arms upraised as england progressed to the 1966 world cup final . charlton scored three in england 's winning of the 1966 world cup , two of them against portugal in the semi-final . his england record is one of the longest-standing in world sport -- at 44 years and five months , so far . given today 's context of so many more matches against tiny football countries -- some of which used to be but corners of the giant russia against whom charlton played -- rooney will have to score plenty more than 50 if his record and stature are to stand the test of him . but like sir bobby , we wish him well . video sterling rest row rumbles on .", "summary": " raheem sterling started england 's euro qualifier with estonia on the bench after complaining he was too tired .   roy hodgson 's only mistake was putting sterling on as a substitute .   if liverpool wideman was so tired he should not have been given a cap .   pele , aged just 17 years old , collapsed with exhaustion as brazil won the world cup in 1958 .
