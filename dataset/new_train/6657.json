{"text": "a lack of empathy is a common trait among psychopaths , but the complex nature of the emotion has baffled scientists for years . now , researchers from brazil have not only mapped the areas of the brain affected when we experience feelings of empathy - they 've also found a way to increase it . using a combination of brain scans and emotional feedback techniques , they were able to help participants focus on , and develop , feelings of affection and tenderness . researchers from brazil have mapped the areas of the brain affected when we experience feelings of empathy , pictured . using these patterns , and a combination of brain scans and emotional feedback techniques , they were able to help participants develop feelings of affection and tenderness . it is the first time empathetic feelings across the whole brain have been identified using scans . previous studies have only focused on single brain regions related to specific emotions . the voigt-kampff machine was originally referenced in philip k dick 's novel do androids dream of electric sheep ? . it later appeared , known as the voight-kampff machine , in the 1982 screen adpatation of the book , called blade runner . the voight-kampff is a fictional polygraph-style machine used in the book and film to determine if someone is human , or an android replicant . it measures reactions , including respiration , heart rate and eye movement , in response to emotionally provocative questions . it is an advanced form of lie detector that measures contractions of the iris muscle and the presence of invisible airborne particles emitted from the body . the machine is often called an empathy-detector because feelings of empathy separate humans from androids . in ridley scott 's 1982 film blade runner , based on philip k. dick 's science fiction book do androids dream of electric sheep ? ' , a similar empathy-detection device were used to measure tenderness or affection felt towards others . called the voight-kampff machine , it was used to distinguish humans from replicants , or androids . to map empathetic feelings , the brazilian team began by scanning the brains of 25 participants while asking them emotionally-charged questions . each participant was asked to identify a memory that was important to them , in which they felt feelings of empathy . they were also asked to think of a time they felt proud , and to have ` neutral ' thoughts without any emotion . professor jorge moll , from the d'or institute for research and education in rio de janeiro , then used computer software to identify patterns in the brain activity linked to each of these emotions . in the 1982 film blade runner , based on philip k. dick 's book do androids dream of electric sheep ? ' , a similar empathy-detection device was used to measure tenderness or affection felt towards others . called the voight-kampff machine , pictured with harrison ford as rick deckard , it is used to distinguish humans from replicants . empathy is the ability to understand or imagine the depth of another person 's feelings . it differs from sympathy , which implies pity but felt without considering the other person 's feelings . empathy comes from the german term einf√ºhlung , meaning to ` feel . as one with ' . it implies feeling with a person , rather than feeling sorry for a person . once the software was trained to pick up on these patterns , the volunteers were asked to control and hold these thoughts and feelings . during tests , each participant was shown a blurry image . moll then gave each person feedback about how strong their emotion was , based on the real-time brain scans and activity . the more successfully each participant held and developed their feelings of empathy , the clearer the image became . the people who were given feedback on their brain patterns were able to strengthen them , moll 's team reports in the public library of science journal plos one . ` this demonstrates that humans can voluntarily enhance brain signatures of tenderness and affection , unlocking new possibilities for promoting prosocial emotions and countering antisocial behavior , ' they wrote . moll stressed that the technique needs further work before it can be used to help people with personality disorders and developmental conditions , such as autism . a follow-up experiment will also look at how the brains of psychopaths differ .", "summary": " brazilian researchers mapped the brains of 25 participants .   they used brain scanners to detect patterns of activity created by empathy .   it is the first time the complex emotions of the feeling have been plotted .   once they 'd established a pattern , they asked people to hold the emotion .   scans revealed it is possible to teach your brain to be more altruistic .
