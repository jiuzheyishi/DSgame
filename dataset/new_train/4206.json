{"text": "washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- mitt romney told an audience of republican donors in new york on friday that he is seriously considering a third presidential bid .  mitt told the group of 30 or so guys that were there that he is considering a run for the white house and that they could go tell their friends ,  a source in the room told cnn . the wall street journal first reported the comments . though his loyalists and supportive donors have floated his name as a potential candidate for the better part of a year , romney himself has been more reticent about mounting another white house bid after his 2008 and 2012 losses . but romney 's outlook has changed in recent weeks , according to people who have spoken with him recently , and he seems to be more serious than ever before . romney has kept in close touch with his donors , many of whom have become close friends over two presidential cycles , according to one source close to romney who was not at the meeting in new york but is familiar with his thinking . romney hosts an annual retreat each year in park city for policy discussions -- and used the two most recent gatherings in 2013 and 2014 to introduce them to potential 2016 presidential candidates including rand paul and chris christie . -lrb- jeb bush was invited to speak last summer , but could not attend because of previous commitments , including his father 's birthday -rrb- . many of romney 's new york donors , who are in frequent touch with him , had suggested a lunch or get-together when romney was in new york , which resulted in the meeting with donors on friday as he was on his way back from charlie baker 's swearing in as the new governor of massachusetts , this person said . former aides to romney have said that his thinking about the race has evolved over several months , particularly after he had time to reflect on being back on the campaign trail for the midterm races . as former florida gov. jeb bush has moved toward a bid , many donors had pressed him for a signal about his level of interest .  he had not closed his mind on this , and today was the day that he decided to share that with the group of people he was with ,  the source familiar with romney 's thinking said .  his conviction that the country is on the wrong track is very strong . he 's very concerned with america 's role in the world . nothing has changed on that .  as far as re-entering the field for the republican nomination , the source said ,  he knows he would have to earn it , he knows no one is handed the nomination , but he 's giving it some thought ... his head has n't changed , i think he was just formalizing it a little bit ,  at the friday meeting , the source said , to let donors know he was considering a bid more seriously . romney 's comments come in the wake of jeb bush 's stepped-up political activity . bush , romney and new jersey gov. chris christie -- all favorites of the republican establishment and new york donor community -- would presumably draw from the same pool of financial backers .  i think he is serious ,  said the person at the new york meeting .  one of the first things he said he said was , ` people ask me , do you want to be president ? well , yes , i did run twice .  romney said that his wife , ann , is  very encouraging  about 2016 , the source said , but his sons are split about the idea , the source who was in the room said . the source familiar with romney 's thinking also said ann is  supportive of it  if that 's what romney wants .  i do n't think he would have come to this without talking to his family .  at the heart of this , this source adds , is that  the state of the country has n't settled for him . he wo n't be happy sitting on the sidelines .  the former massachusetts governor told the crowd that a potential campaign would  have to have a positive message .  he also said , somewhat obviously , that he  would run a different campaign from what he 's run in the past .  romney entertained questions about the rest of the potential 2016 field but had only positive things to say about his would-be rivals , the source said . the news comes after a week chock-full of high-profile potential republican presidential candidates taking the first steps toward announcing their candidacy for the 2016 election . former florida gov. jeb bush launched a leadership pac this week , just days after resigning his position on various corporate and nonprofite boards . and former gop presidential contender mike huckabee quit his show on fox news last week to give 2016 some serious consideration . and cnn reported wednesday that wisconsin gov. scott walker is assembling a team for a potential 2016 presidential bid . the revelation of romney 's overtures to top gop donors is yet another addition to the long-term game of footsy romney has played with the media and other republicans who would like to know whether romney is in or out -- though it 's certainly the most definitive and serious indication that romney might actually launch a third presidential bid . romney was rumored to be through with his presidential ambitions after a grueling 2012 run , but this summer he made several head nods that he was considering . romney told the washington post this summer that  we 'll have to see what happens  and said in another interview that the chances were very slim -- but conceded there was nonetheless always a chance .  we never say never ,  ann romney said on cnn 's  new day  this summer . gloria borger contributed to this report .", "summary": " mitt romney told donors friday that he 's considering a third presidential bid in 2016 .   his comments come in the wake of jeb bush 's stepped-up political activity .
