{"text": "anchorage , alaska alaska gov. sarah palin 's hometown required women to pay for their own rape examinations while she was mayor , a practice her police chief fought to keep as late as 2000 . a former alaskan lawmaker says it seems unlikely that gov. sarah palin was unaware of wasilla 's policy . former state rep. eric croft , a democrat , sponsored a state law requiring cities to provide the examinations free of charge to victims . he said the only ongoing resistance he met was from wasilla , where palin was mayor from 1996 to 2002 .  it was one of those things everyone could agree on except wasilla ,  croft told cnn .  we could n't convince the chief of police to stop charging them .  alaska 's legislature in 2000 banned the practice of charging women for rape exam kits -- which experts said could cost up to $ 1,000 . palin , the republican nominee for vice president , often talks about her experience running wasilla , population approximately 7,000 , and that has prompted close scrutiny of her record there . wasilla 's practice of charging victims for their rape exams while she was mayor has gotten wide circulation on the internet and in the mainstream media . watch cnn 's jessica yellin check the facts in wasilla  some supporters of palin say they believe she had no knowledge of the practice . but critics call it  outrageous  and question palin 's commitment to helping women who are the victims of violence . for years , alaska has had the worst record of any state in rape and in murder of women by men . the rape rate in alaska is 2.5 times the national average . interviews and a review of records turned up no evidence that palin knew that rape victims were being charged in her town . but croft , the former state representative who sponsored the law changing the practice , says it seems unlikely palin was not aware of the issue .  i find it hard to believe that for six months a small town , a police chief , would lead the fight against a statewide piece of legislation receiving unanimous support and the mayor not know about it ,  croft said . during the time palin was mayor of wasilla , her city was not the only one in alaska charging rape victims . experts testified before the legislature that in a handful of small cities across alaska , law enforcement agencies were charging victims or their insurance  more than sporadically .  one woman who wrote in support of the legislation says she was charged for her rape exam by a police department in the city of juneau , which is hundreds of miles from wasilla . but wasilla stood out . tara henry , a forensic nurse who has been treating rape victims across alaska for the last 12 years , told cnn that opposition to croft 's bill from wasilla police chief charlie fannon was memorable .  several municipal law enforcement agencies in the state did have trouble budgeting and paying for the evidence collection for sexual assault victims ,  henry said .  what i recall is that the chief of police in the wasilla police department seemed to be the most vocal about how it was going to affect their budget .  croft has a similar memory . he said victims ' advocates suggested he introduce legislation as a way to shame cities into changing their practice , and wasilla resisted .  i remember they had continued opposition ,  croft said .  it was eight years ago now , but they were sort of unrepentant that they thought the taxpayers should n't have to pay for that .  he does not recall discussing the issue with then-mayor palin . the bill , hb270 , was before the legislature for six months . in testimony , one expert called the practice of billing the victim  incomprehensible .  others compared it to  dust -lsb- ing -rsb- for fingerprints  after a burglary , only  the victim 's body is the crime scene .  during a rape exam , the victim removes her clothing and a medical professional gathers dna evidence from her body . there is also a medical component to assess her injuries . that component has led some law enforcement agencies to balk at paying . henry , the forensic nurse , said charging victims  retraumatizes them .   asking them to pay for something law enforcement needs in order to investigate their case , it 's almost like blaming them for getting sexually assaulted ,  she said . the alaska legislature agreed . the bill passed unanimously with the support of the alaska department of public safety , the alaska peace officers association and more than two dozen co-sponsors . after it became law , wasilla 's police chief told the local paper , the frontiersman , that it would cost the city $ 5,000 to $ 14,000 a year -- money that he 'd have to find .  in the past , we 've charged the cost of the exams to the victim 's insurance company when possible ,  fannon was quoted as saying .  i just do n't want to see any more burden on the taxpayer .  he suggested the criminals should pay as restitution if and when they 're convicted . repeated attempts to reach fannon for comment were unsuccessful . judy patrick , who was palin 's deputy mayor and friend , blames the state .  the bigger picture of what was going on at the time was that the state was trying to cut their own budget , and one of the things that they were doing was passing on costs to cities , and that was one of the many things that they were passing on , the cost to the city ,  said patrick , who recalls enormous pressure to keep the city 's budget down . but the state was never responsible for paying the costs of local investigations . patrick was also a member of wasilla city council , and she does n't recall the issue coming before council members , nor does she remember discussing the issue with palin . she does recall palin going through the budget in detail . she said palin would review each department 's budget line by line and send it back to department heads with her changes .  sarah is a fiscal conservative , and so she had seen that the city was heading in a direction of bigger projects , costing taxpayers more money , and she was determined to change that ,  patrick said . before palin came to city hall , the wasilla police department paid for rape kits out of a fund for miscellaneous costs , according to the police chief who preceded fannon and was fired by palin . that budget line was cut by more than half during palin 's tenure , but it did not specifically mention rape exams . in a statement , jill hazelbaker , communications director for sen. john mccain 's presidential campaign , said that  to imply that gov. palin is or has ever been an advocate of charging victims for evidence gathering kits is an utter distortion of reality .   as her record shows , gov. palin is committed to supporting victims and bringing violent criminals to justice ,  hazelbaker said .  she does not , nor has she ever believed that rape victims should have to pay for an evidence gathering test .  those who fought the policy are unconvinced .  it 's incomprehensible to me that this could be a rogue police chief and not a policy decision . it lasted too long and it was too high-profile ,  croft said . the rape kit charges have become an issue among palin critics who say as governor she has not done enough to combat alaska 's epidemic problem of violence against women . they point to a small funding increase for domestic violence shelters at a time when alaska has a multibillion-dollar budget surplus . victims ' advocates say that services are lacking and that palin cut funding for a number of programs that treat female victims of violence . in the past week , alaska 's challenges with sexual assault have been in the spotlight again -- in connection with an ongoing inquiry into whether palin abused her power by firing the head of alaska 's department of public safety . palin 's office released e-mails showing that one area of disagreement between her and department of public safety commissioner walt monegan was his lobbying in washington for $ 30 million to fund a new program of sexual assault response teams . the mccain-palin campaign insists that fighting domestic violence and sexual assault are priorities for palin . and they say she has been looking at other programs to support . as governor , palin approved a funding increase for domestic violence shelters -- $ 266,200 over two years . and she reauthorized a council on domestic violence and sexual assault .", "summary": " while sarah palin was mayor , wasilla charged victims for their rape exams .   interviews , review of records show no evidence palin knew victims were charged .   former state representative says it seems unlikely palin was not aware of issue .
