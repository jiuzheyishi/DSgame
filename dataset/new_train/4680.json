{"text": "u.s. president barack obama on tuesday hailed the achievements of the nuclear security summit here , including some countries ' agreements to give their highly enriched uranium to the united states for degrading .  we 've seen such steps as belgium and italy completing the removal of their excess supplies of highly enriched uranium and plutonium so that those supplied can be eliminated ,  he said at a joint news conference with mark rutte , the prime minister of the netherlands . and dozens of other nations have agreed to take steps to improve nuclear security in their own countries and to support global efforts , the u.s. president said .  so what 's been valuable about this summit is that it has not just been talk , it 's been action .  hours after obama landed monday in the netherlands for the summit , the white house announced a deal to dispose of huge quantities of nuclear material from japan . obama credited the heads of state who participated in the effort ,  as well as the extraordinary work of foreign ministers and sherpas and others who have helped to move this process forward .  the united states is doing its part , too , by installing more radiation detection equipment at ports and other transit sites to thwart would-be smugglers of nuclear materials ; by developing guidelines to strengthen cybersecurity at nuclear power plants ; and by pursuing production of an isotope used in medicine that does not require weapons-usable materials , he said . but more work is to be done  to fully secure all nuclear and radiological material ... so that it can no longer pose a risk to our citizens ,  he added .  given the catastrophic consequences of even a single attack , we can not be complacent .  he noted that ukraine agreed at the first such summit , in 2010 , to remove its highly enriched uranium from its nuclear fuel sites .  had that not happened , those dangerous nuclear materials would still be there now , and the difficult situation we are dealing with in ukraine today would involve yet another level of concern .  before the next such summit , to be held in 2016 in chicago ,  we have to set very clearly what are the actionable items that we 've already identified that we know can get done if we have the political will to do them , and let 's go ahead and get them done ,  he said . tuesday 's session marked the third such gathering of world leaders since obama helped launched the initiative in 2009 . according to a report issued last year by the center for nonproliferation studies , the united states will spend at least $ 179 billion over the nine fiscal years of 2010-2018 on its nuclear arsenal .", "summary": "  it has not just been talk , it has been action ,  obama says of the nuclear summit .   obama : the u.s. is doing its part , too , with installation of more radiation detection equipment .   ukraine gave up its highly enriched uranium in 2010 .
