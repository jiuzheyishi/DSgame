{"text": "updated : . 08:19 est , 18 january 2012 . an eton-educated aristocrat who admitted having sex with a schoolgirl within days of her 16th birthday walked smiling from court yesterday after he was cleared of rape . the honourable james murray , 42 , second son of the earl of mansfield , thanked his family for their ` unstinting support ' as the tawdry details of his relationship with the troubled foster child were detailed in court . the girl had claimed that , during one of her many visits to murray 's flat , he must have spiked her ribena . she woke to find her tracksuit trousers tugged down to her knees and him naked beside her . relief : james murray , 42 , leaves oxford crown court after being cleared of raping a 16-year-old girl . but murray maintained that she had agreed to sex up to six times and only later ` cried rape ' after he told her a condom had split and she should take the morning-after pill . far from him grooming her for sex , he insisted , she had groomed him . after a week-long trial at oxford crown court , the jury took only 57 minutes to find him not guilty . his brother alexander , viscount stormont and sister lady georgina bullough , who supported him during the trial , exchanged relieved smiles . outside court murray thanked the jury , his legal team and his family . ` this has been the most difficult 18 months for me , but more particularly for my family who had to endure the brunt of the uncertainty , detail of the allegation and the obvious interest in the case , ' he said . the court heard that murray had met . the youngster , who would habitually play truant and had run away from . home , when she was 15 . at the time , despite his family 's great wealth -- . his father is worth # 60million -- he was leading a solitary existence . working as a self-employed it consultant from his home in a ground-floor . flat in a down-at-heel oxford suburb . his family maintained in court that despite his age , murray was ` na√Øve ' and emotionally immature . support : mr murray leaves the court building with his sister lady georgina dorothea mary murray , who had given evidence at his trial . viscount stormont , 55 , said : ` the family were always confident that jamie was not guilty of this alleged offence . ' despite the not guilty verdict , however , grave damage has been done to one of britain 's most distinguished families.murray grew up in historic scone palace , within a 27,000-acre perthshire estate with polo grounds , a racecourse and extensive shooting and fishing rights on the tay . for many years it housed the stone of scone , which was used for centuries in the coronation of scottish kings . prince charles was a frequent visitor and baroness thatcher is a friend of murray 's 81-year-old father and his wife pamela , countess of mansfield , 76 . the earl was a minister of state in the scottish and northern ireland offices during the thatcher years . today , the running of the palace is left to viscount stormont , while lady georgina , 44 , is a deputy lieutenant of perth . as for their brother ... well , he was . once placed third in a newspaper poll of scotland 's 100 most eligible . men . but behind his glamorous image , chronicled in society magazines and . newspaper diary columns back in the nineties , he was always the black . sheep of the family . this is exemplified by an incident . when he was about 16 and lady thatcher , or mrs thatcher as she was then , . called on the earl and countess . troubled : the flat in oxford where the girl , who is now 17 , used to visit james murray with her friends to drink , smoke and play music . privilege : historic scone palace , perthshire , scotland , where james murray grew up . murray was banished from the house , it seems , and made to sit in a police van outside for the duration of the prime minister 's visit . the reason , apparently , was revealed by a police officer who ` stood guard ' over him that day : ` nothing was expressly said , but we got the distinct impression that he could not be trusted to behave in company . ' after leaving school with few qualifications , he spent a number of years travelling and , at one time or another , was a sheep farmer and lumberjack in australia . his bizarre early employment record since then is listed on his facebook page and includes : cleansing operative -lrb- scotland -rrb- , ` financial persuader ' -lrb- london -rrb- , ` alcohol marketing ' -lrb- also london -rrb- . along the way , it emerged in court , he picked up two convictions for drug possession and one for drink driving . the earl thanked his parents , lord and lady mansfield for their support during the trial . convictions aside , it was a lifestyle unlikely to have impressed his father , a barrister , who has encouraged his children to ` make their own way ' in life . that is perhaps why , aged 30 , murray enrolled on a computer course at oxford brookes university , formerly oxford polytechnic . shortly afterwards , he set himself up as a freelance computer engineer in the city . his most recent address was a new rented two-bedroom flat in the suburbs , splitting his time between oxford and perth . although he is not the eldest son , he has few financial worries . he is listed as a director -lrb- with his siblings -rrb- of a family-owned property company , which according to the latest accounts , has funds of # 2.6 million and cash reserves of # 1.7 million . and he conforms to an all too familiar stereotype . ` i think he could quite fairly be described as a bit of a  hooray henry  , ' says someone who bumped into him at a party back in perth recently . ` he was loud and lairy -- living it up and going around with a bottle of champagne . i saw him pointing to a photographer and saying ,  you there ! take my picture !  . ' in oxford , murray would casually drop his gilded background into the conversation , once telling a neighbour that he had to go back to ` the palace ' in scotland as ` prince charles was coming to visit ' . ` we thought ,  goodness , he must be posh  , ' recalled a woman who lived in the same block . ` he then showed me a photograph of his  house  . he said he really did live there and they had loads of servants . ' shortly after murray 's arrest , youngsters went on the rampage in the block where he lived , breaking windows , throwing paint over his car and spraying graffiti . he was asked to leave by the managing agents who discovered he had given a key to the teenage girl he was accused of assaulting . for the past year , he has been living with his sister at her turreted mansion not far from scone palace . a sign at the end of the driveway warns visitors : ` keep off the grass and dead slow . children , dogs , hens , bikes , helicopters ' .", "summary": " jury took less than an hour to clear the hon james murray , 42 .   he took troubled youngster on walks to park to see hedgehogs .   he spent his childhood growing up on country estate in scotland .
