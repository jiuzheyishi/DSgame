{"text": "officials are concerned that the black market for marijuana in colorado is undiminished following a series of violent incidents during illegal transactions of the drug . as the country 's first state to legalize marijuana , colorado is being closely observed to determine the effect of legalization on marijuana-related crime . under colorado law , it is legal to possess up to one ounce of marijuana , but authorities fear the measures could embolden illegal dealers and buyers , who believe they can escape prosecution . drug-related death : this photo provided by lafayette colorado police dept shows nathaniel tallman , 25 , who was shot dead trying to sell marijuana the old-fashioned , illegal way . while no one expected the state 's . first-in-the-nation recreational sales would eliminate the need for . dangerous underground sales overnight , the violence has raised concerns . among police , prosecutors and pot advocates that a black market for . marijuana is alive and well in colorado . a 25-year-old is shot dead trying to sell . marijuana the old-fashioned , illegal way . two men from texas set up a . warehouse to grow more than they would ever need . and three people . buying pot in a grocery store parking lot are robbed at gunpoint . ` it . has done nothing more than enhance the opportunity for the black . market , ' said lieutenant mark comte of the colorado springs police vice and . narcotics unit . ` if you can get it tax-free on the corner , you 're going . to get it on the corner . ' marijuana crime : daniel ortiz , along with russell britton and moises mendez was charged with felony first-degree murder , robbery and aggravated motor-vehicle theft in the death of 25-year-old nathaniel tallman . it 's difficult to measure whether there . has been an increase in pot-related crimes beyond anecdotal reports . because no one at either the federal or state levels is keeping track of . the numbers of killings , robberies and other crimes linked directly to . marijuana . pot advocates say . the state is in a transition period , and while pot-related crimes will . continue , they will begin to decline as more stores open and prices of . legal marijuana decline . ` it 's . just a transition period , ' activist brian vicente said . ` marijuana was . illegal for the last 80 years in our state , and there are some remnants . of that still around . certainly , much like alcohol , over time these . underground dealers will fade away . ' sales are due to begin in june in washington , where authorities will be watching for similar cases . ` there 's . going to be a black market here , ' said commander pat slack of the snohomish . regional drug/gang task force , which covers an area outside seattle . ` there will be drug rip-offs and drug debts that have n't been paid . all . of that is going to stay . ' suspect : tallman was allegedly on his way to meet russell britton -lrb- pictured -rrb- to ` conduct a marijuana transaction ' at 7 pm january 21 . his body was discovered two months later . under . colorado 's voter-approved law , it is legal to possess up to an ounce of . marijuana . authorities are concerned that means illegal dealers and . buyers believe they can avoid prosecution . these dealers and their . customers also tend to be targets , if robbers know they are flush with . cash . arapahoe county , . outside denver , has seen ' a growing number of drug rips and outright . burglaries and robberies of people who have large amounts of marijuana . or cash on them , ' said district attorney george brauchler . his . district has seen at least three homicides linked to pot in recent . months and a rising number of robberies and home invasions . among . them was a february case in which a 17-year-old boy said he . accidentally shot and killed his girlfriend while robbing a man who had . come to purchase weed . elsewhere , . prosecutors say , nathaniel tallman , 25 , was killed during a january . drug deal when he was robbed and shot , and his body dumped in wyoming . the next month , a dealer mugged three people who were trying to buy marijuana from him in a denver grocery store parking lot . such . deals are the exception , said vicente . the ` average customer ' prefers . to buy in a well-lit , regulated store , he said , citing the roughly $ 2 . million colorado made in marijuana taxes in january alone . whether dangerous or not , it can still be cheaper to buy pot from a drug dealer . voters . who approved recreational sales in colorado also agreed to a 12.9 . per cent state sales tax and a 15 per cent excise tax on it . local . jurisdictions can also add their own taxes . medical marijuana is taxed , . too , but at a much lower rate - a 2.9 per cent sales tax . those . taxes mean an ounce of pot can go for $ 400 or more at a . state-sanctioned store , depending on quality and potency . an ounce on . the street can run between $ 200 and $ 280 , depending on how much a dealer . wants to profit , comte said . underground dealers also are not burdened by complex regulations and licenses . ` those . barriers to entry already create the potential for the black market , . and then you add these taxes on top of it , and it makes it impossible to . get rid of , ' said denver attorney robert corry , who helped write the . pot legalization measure but opposed the taxes . corry , who has long represented marijuana dealers facing criminal charges , said his clientele has hardly diminished . comte 's . unit recently searched a warehouse where two men from texas were . growing ` so much more than they could ever need , ' he said . detectives . charged them with possession of pot with intent to distribute . drug deal gone bad : moise mendez , along with russell britton and daniel ortiz are charged with felony first-degree murder , robbery and aggravated motor-vehicle theft in the death of 25-year-old nathaniel tallman . if . some colorado drug dealers have lost business to legal retailers , some . also have made up for it by transporting weed to other states . a . lakewood man was arrested in march after postal inspectors intercepted a . package he was mailing containing a pound of pot . drug task force . officers who later searched his home found scores of gallon-sized bags . of marijuana and 76 plants . marijuana . cases can be hard to prosecute and are not cost-effective , so police . often prefer to focus attention on drugs like heroin and . methamphetamine , comte said . one . result , he said , is the feeling among illegal dealers that because . retail sales are legal , authorities are looking the other way . mark . kleiman , a public policy professor at the university of california , los . angeles , who is helping washington set up its legal marijuana industry , . said the black market 's survival has less to do with taxes than with a . shortage of legal stores . colorado has more than 160 state-licensed stores , but they remain concentrated in the denver area . many towns do n't have any . ` when . there are more stores and more products in the stores and prices settle . down , then we 'll see , ' kleiman said .
