blue colours which decorate this vast country from the bunting in the streets to the paint on the faces of children . on friday night , there was progress into the last four , thanks to an early strike by thiago silva and a delicious free-kick by david luiz , but there was very little order in evidence , at least not on the pitch . the game was a frantic spectacle where hearts ruled heads ,

being . colombia have added rhythm and flair to this tournament but could not overcome the collective will inside fortaleza 's castelao stadium , a collective will which at times , it has to be said , seemed to include the officials . before the game , colombian fans suspected they would not be allowed to win ; a feeling reinforced when they had a goal by mario yepes controversially ruled out for offside when 1-0 down . no-one was off when yepes shot , but there was a marginal call earlier in the sequence which unfolded from a free-kick . referee carlos velasco carballo could not avoid awarding them a penalty , however , when julio cesar completely wiped-out substitute carlos bacca and james rodriguez scored , his sixth of the world cup . it made for a tense finish . brazil clung on , although not without collateral damage . silva is out of the semi-final against germany after a yellow card and neymar was carried off late in the game after falling awkwardly . as it is , colombia 's 23-year winless run against their neighbours goes on , and so does brazil 's samba beat . scolari 's players collapsed at the final whistle and raised their hands to the sky . they must be on the brink of nervous exhaustion but into the semi-finals they go . that it should be silva who struck first was a sweet twist in the narrative of the campaign . he caught carlos sanchez napping at the back post to turn in with his left knee a corner won and delivered by neymar . less than seven minutes were gone and brazil had the nerve-settler of an early lead but , just as they in the previous round against chile , they were unable to make it count . nerves would still be in shreds by the final whistle . making a point : david luiz and dani alves console a tearful james rodriguez at the full-time whistle . commiserations : david luiz puts his arm around rodriguez as marcelo also consoles the colombia wideman . disallowed : mario yepes put the ball in the net for colombia but the strike was ruled out by the referee . not impressed : mario yepes and fellow colombia defender pablo armero scream at the referee 's decision . tough tackler : fernandinho and fellow midfielder fredy guarin both slide to challenge for the ball . high foot : fernandinho attempts to rob the ball from the boot of colombia 's james rodriguez . late : james rodriguez goes flying following fernandinho 's challenge but the brazilian protests his innocence . still , after a week of questions , it was impossible not to share silva 's relief . off he ran to the opposite corner flag , beating his chest , soon to be mobbed by delirious team-mates as the roof lifted off the castelao , freed by a rapid response to a week of debate in brazil , when some claimed he should be stripped of the captaincy . emotions had got the better of him in against chile and his ability to focus was questioned but here his mind was clear . he intercepted a cross and twice hurled his body in the line of shots from juan cuadrado . when rodriguez slipped fernandinho and colombia threatened to swamp brazil in the first half , who was on the edge of the penalty area , winning back the ball ? it was the captain . silva was superb . as was fernandinho . colombia 's greatest threat came from rodriguez , drifting into spaces behind teofilo gutierrez and brazil were without luiz gustavo , who was banned . agony : neymar screams in pain on the floor after being fouled deep into the second-half . up and over : the colombia wall jumps in an attempt to stop neymar 's free-kick for brazil . head over heels : neymar fails in his attempt to stop the ball from going out of play with his head . painful : neymar reacts after being challenged by colombia midfielder carlos sanchez . eyes wide shut : brazil playmaker oscar looks on as victor ibarbo climbs highest to head the ball on . calm down , lads ! spanish referee carlos velasco carballo intervenes to stop an argument from ensuing . aerial duel : goalscorer thiago silva gets the better of colombia frontman victor ibarbo in the air . on the march : colombia frontman james rodriguez marauds forward as three brazilians watch on . fernandinho started well , winning the ball and passing it well , both long and short . it was the manchester city midfielder who unzipped colombia and released neymar to win the corner for the first goal . he did n't always have rodriguez under control , although that is no disgrace . few people in this tournament have contained him . fernandinho did it well , and he was making crucial tackles deep in stoppage time . at times , referee caballo was too lenient . rodriguez was targeted , and then booked when he made his first foul , one which led the free-kick scored by luiz from 30 yards . jose pekerman 's side leave with credit . they refused to roll over after their early setback in a suffocating atmosphere with the game locked in a frantic tempo , pinging back and forth like table-tennis . a break by luiz summed everything up . charging up-field the over-lapping centre-half seemed set on a slalom wonder-goal , only to lose the ball to christian zapata and hurtle back in pursuit of the full-back , head back , hair trailing , until he had landed a little physical contact after the ball had moved on . the crowd cheered but and the colombia bench leapt to their feet in fury but the breathless game had moved on . luiz is incredibly popular and will probably be captain on tuesday in silva 's absence , but he flexes between pure majesty and total liability . where he goes , chaos usually follows , but what a free-kick he fired into the top corner to settle the game . hanging on : colombia defender mario yepes puts his arms around brazil frontman fred in the area . bend it like rodriguez : the colombia winger curls a free-kick towards goal but neymar jumps in the way to block . tussle : brazil frontman hulk and colombia wideman juan cuadrado do battle for the ball out wide . strong : brazil defender david luiz charges past colombia centre back mario yepes . hanging in the air : neymar brings the ball down under control during the first-half of friday 's clash . talking tactics : david luiz whispers behind his hand to former chelsea team-mate oscar . thumbs up : brazil boss luiz felipe scolari acknowledges one of his players from the touchline .", "summary": " brazil progress to the semi-finals of the world cup with 2-1 victory over south american rivals colombia .   thiago silva opened the scoring for host nation before david luiz netted stunning free-kick .   star man neymar
