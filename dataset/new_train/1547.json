{"text": "trying on a firefighter 's helmet , allowing a young boy to hug his leg during a mass and phoning up his followers for a chat are just a few of the ways pope francis has attracted headlines in the last few months . and after years of negative press , the catholic church is basking in the ` francis effect ' which has been credited with a 20 per cent rise in congregations in britain , and similar boosts around the world . but who is the pr guru working quietly behind the scenes to help push pope francis forward and leading the church out of one of its darkest spells following a slew of recent scandals ? his name is greg burke and he is a senior media advisor to the vatican . drive : greg burke , the advisor for the communication of the vatican secretariat of state is the man behind the vatican 's pr machine . the vatican , stung by communications blunders and mired in a leaks scandal , hired the american journalist in june 2012 from fox news to help improve its relations with the media . mr burke , 53 , a native of st louis , missouri , had been working for fox for 10 years . before that he worked for time magazine in rome for 10 years . he worked as a stringer for news agency reuters in rome early in his career and has also written several books , one about an italian soccer team . in his previous jobs , he covered the illness and death of pope john paul ii , the election of pope benedict xvi , the pedophile scandal , the vatileaks saga , and the crackdown on american nuns , reported the daily beast . media savvy : one of the more amusing tweets mr burke wrote on his twitter page . modern age : mr burke regularly tweets and is credited with encouraging the pope to join twitter . ' a scandal is a scandal , and i 've . reported on them all , ' he says . ` it all had to be told , as much as . things are true , it 's good they 've come out . ' he grew up in a catholic family with five brothers and sisters . he became a member of the controversial catholic group opus dei when he was 18 and is a ` numerary ' in the movement , a celibate layman . his papal politics may have developed since his earlier days when shortly before pope benedict was selected he reasoned that he was not in the running , reported vice . ` he 's considered too conservative , ' mr burke explained , noting that the former pope was called ` the ` panzer cardinal ' because he took so many hits for the pope . burke 's role - a revolution in the . vatican 's communications structure - is similar to that of . communications advisers in the white house . he . reports directly to the vatican 's deputy secretary of state , archbishop . angelo becciu , the third-ranking person in the vatican hierarchy . this . week pope francis i took the time after his weekly papal audience in . st. peter 's square to bless a severely disfigured man . the pope has . attracted headlines in the last few months . trying on a firefighter 's helmet , allowing a young boy to hug his leg during a mass and phoning up his followers are just a few of the ways pope francis has attracted headlines in the last few months . seen it all before : the teenage pilgrims show pope francis their technology - but it appears he is well in tune with modern life . although he can now be credited with helping to build pope francis 's popular image , it seems mr burke was not initially keen when he was first called about the position when he was dining out for his father 's 90th birthday . ' i told them no twice but the more i thought about it the more it seemed like the right thing to do . i ca n't imagine a more exciting challenge for me at this time , ' mr burke told reuters . he accepted the role at a troubling time for the catholic church - the vatican had been bedeviled by communications blunders ever since pope benedict xvi 's 2005 election , and was dealing with a scandal over vatican documents that were leaked to italian journalists . mr burke is the only person in the vatican 's communications structure with vast print and television experience from outside the sometimes insular world of catholic media . ` i 've had a lot of diverse media experience that i hope i can put to use for the church that i love , ' mr burke said at the time . when mr burke was appointed fr john wauck , a professor at the pontifical university of the holy cross in rome told the catholic herald : . ` he 's a lay person , from the professional world , who understands how . theologians think and shares their faith ... he 's well respected and . genuinely liked by the journalists in rome . ' ` he 's . an english-language media professional who knows italy -- the language , . the culture , the mindset -- and the vatican inside out . this is important because many of the vatican 's difficulties with . the media stem from things getting lost in translation . greg can help . prevent that . ' mr burke has also guided the vatican through the modern digital age - the pope benedict started tweeting a few months after he joined . mr burke is known for his american sense of humour .

' mr burke is on twitter where he often posts humorous photos and tweets . one of them included a photo of popstar jennifer lopez in italy alongside the caption : ` was @jlo on a shopping spree for rosaries in rome ? ' another post shows a photo of a convertible red ferarri alongside the caption : ` parked just outside #vatican , but safe to say it 's not a new car for #popefrancis . ' mr burke has also guided the vatican through the modern digital age - the pope started tweeting a few months after he joined . at the time mr burke said the twitter handle @pontifex is appropriate for a number of reasons . ` the handle is a good one . it means  pope  and it also means  bridge builder  , ' he said . ` the pope wants to reach out to everyone . shrewd : the vatican , stung by communications blunders and mired in a leaks scandal , hired the american journalist in june 2012 from fox news to help improve its relations with the media . ` we are going to get a spiritual message . the pope is not going to be walking around with a blackberry or an ipad and no one is going to be putting words into the pope 's mouth . ` he will tweet what he wants to tweet , ' mr burke said . pope john paul ii 's longtime spokesman , joaquin navarro-valls , was also a member of opus dei . last year mr burke said he did n't know what , if any , role his membership in opus dei played in getting his role . opus is greatly in favor in the vatican these days , particularly as other new religious movements such as the legion of christ have lost credibility with their own problems . ` i 'm an old-fashioned midwestern catholic whose mother went to mass every day , ' burke said last year . ` am i being hired because i 'm in opus dei ? ' he asked . ` it might come into play . ' founded in 1928 , opus dei is part of the catholic church and has 500 members across britain . the stated mission of the organisation - which means ` god 's work ' - is to spread the christian message and help people embrace catholicism in their everyday work . but it has attracted controversy over its practices including self-flagellation and radical teachings that homosexual sex is a sin . critics have also accused the organisation of brainwashing and being run like a cult . the ultra-conservative catholic group became famous worldwide after its sinister portrayal in the bestselling novel and blockbuster , the da vinci code . the film , starring tom hanks , is based on the dan brown novel which described opus dei as a murderous , power-hungry sect .", "summary": " greg burke , 53 , is a senior media advisor to the vatican .   used to work for fox news and was hired by the vatican in june 2012 .   born in missouri he is a member of the controversial opus dei .   pope joined twitter a few months after he took up new role .
