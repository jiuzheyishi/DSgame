{"text": "families are going hungry while supermarkets are paid public money to turn tonnes of surplus food in biofuel , a new report has revealed . only two per cent of the estimated 400,000 tonnes of extra food produced by shops and restaurants each year is sent to charities , according to a government inquiry . the other 98 % is either dumped in landfill or turned into biogas using government subsidies of up to # 70 per tonne . an inquiry has found too much edible food is being sent to landfill or biofuel plants rather than given to charity . the parliamentary inquiry into hunger and food poverty was told millions of pounds of public money is subsidising ` anaerobic digestion plants ' which convert food into biogas , while charities miss out . labour mp frank field , who co-chaired the inquiry , has criticised the use of taxpayer 's cash to destroy edible food , branding the scheme ` madness on stilts ' . his inquiry 's report stated : ` the food industry should set itself a target of reducing the amount of surplus food disposed of in landfill , and turned into compost or energy , by 100,000 tonnes each year by the end of the next parliament . ` this should be achieved by preventing waste in retail and supply chains , and by redistributing surplus food through the voluntary sector . ' currently , an estimated 3.4 million tonnes of food is wasted every year by the food industry in the uk , before it reaches shops or restaurants . at least 10 % of that waste is fit for human consumption , enough for 800 million meals . tesco revealed last year that 68 per cent of its bagged salads , 48 per cent of its bakery goods and 24 per cent of its grapes go to waste . british households also throw away around 4.2 million tonnes of food a year . since 2003 , the cost of food has increased at a greater rate than earnings , with the cost of a weekly shop increasing by 46 % , while the average wage went up by only 27.9 % . fareshare , an organisation that resdistributes food to charities , says it has to charge supermarkets around # 100 a tonne for food that is given to them to cover storage and transport costs . meanwhile , biogas companies were handed nearly # 30million in subsidies from the department of energy and climate change . fareshare director mark varney told the times : ` i 'm up against that economic obstacle when i talk to the food industry and they say ;  well , actually , we have got an arrangement with this operator who comes and picks up the food  . ' mr field has now called for the system to be changed to make given food to charity the cheapest option for the food industry . he said : ` we 're calling for a real focus on the millions of tonnes of surplus food that goes to waste each year in the food retail sector . our proposals would save charities money , put downward pressure on food prices and provide healthier options to families relying on voluntary support . ' the inquiry found doubling the number of food given to charities could save . them around # 160million over the next parliamentary term . around . 1.6 million tonnes of food waste is used in britain 's 82 biogas plants . every year as part of the government 's commitment to get at least 15 % of . its energy from renewable sources by 2020 . but the agency helping to set up the plants has admitted some of the food used is edible . food charity fareshare says that , when it comes to asking supermarkets to hand over their surplus food , it is struggling to compete with government-subsidised biogas producers . tesco has revealed that in the first six months of 2013 it generated 30,000 tonnes of food waste , of which 21 per cent was fruit and vegetables . the supermarket donates around 2,300 tonnes of food to charity , much of which is past its sell-by date but still deemed safe . last month , a survey of executives of all major supermarket chains revealed top bosses ignore use-by and sell-by dates on their own food , with one manager branding the dates ` ridiculous ' . waitrose announced earlier this week that it would start selling ` blemished ' fruit and veg after strict eu rules on misshapen produce were relaxed . coffee chain pret a manger is one of many companies who do give large amounts of food to charity . the company has a fleet of vans that deliver over 12,000 fresh meals to numerous shelters for the homeless every week , with other charities collecting directly from cafes at the end of the day . in total , the company estimates it donates around 2.5 million products to uk homeless charities every year , which it says prevents up to 250 tonnes of food from ending up in landfill . however , some of the shops have no regular collection , meaning the company is appealing for more charities to come forward . any organisations interested should ring 020 7932 5425 for more details . meanwhile , asda has signed a deal with fareshare that sees food from the supermarket 's depots delivered to around 900 charities in the uk . the supermarket says it hands over enough food for more than 8million meals a year , saving the charity # 4.5 million . last year , the asda foundation also donated # 100,000 to fareshare to increase their depot space and buy new vans .", "summary": " supermarkets sending 100,000 tonnes of surplus food to be turned into fuel .   but at least 10 per cent of that is edible and could be handed to charity .   biofuel producers offer cheaper alternative due to government subsidies .   government inquiry slams the amount of food by-passing food banks .   mp frank field calls for changes to system to help support charities .
