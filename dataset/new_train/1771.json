{"text": "thomas muller is on his way to ` mullering ' gerd muller and miroslav klose to become germany 's greatest ever striker . if muller nets against france on friday he will become only the third player in world cup history to hit five goals at two world cups . it has previously been done by peru 's teofilo cubillas in 1970 and 1978 and klose in 2002 and 2006 . high flyer : thomas muller fails with a spectacular bicycle kick in germany 's 1-0 win over usa . heading to the top ? miroslav klose need just one goal to become the outright leading world cup scorer . leading the way : gerd muller -lrb- centre -rrb- scores for west germany against australia at the 1974 world cup . indeed , at 24 , muller has possibly two world cups left in him so could usurp klose , who needs one goal to move clear of brazil 's ronaldo as the most prolific world cup finals scorer with 16 goals . it will take a lot for the modern muller to beat gerd ` der bomber ' muller 's achievement of 10 goals at the 1970 finals . he added four in 1974 . like gerd , thomas plays for bayern munich having come through the ranks and is not for sale . james rodriguez was rejected by former manchester united boss sir alex ferguson four years ago when he first started to emerge as a force in argentina . united 's south american scouts identified ` james ' as a future star but in the end fergie opted for javier hernandez and bebe instead . fancy feet : colombia 's james rodriguez is wanted by a host of clubs after an impressive world cup . so rodriguez moved from argentinian club banfield to porto in portugal before moving on to monaco . he has been linked to a # 40million move to united but , with injured fellow countryman radamel falcao being lined up by real madrid , he is set to stay for at least another season in france . manchester united allowed paul pogba to leave their academy and join juventus after a wage dispute and wo n't pay the # 60m being quoted to bring him back . chelsea are still considering a move for the 21-year-old frenchman . but he is more likely to move to real madrid when zinedine zidane eventually takes over as boss - which may happen next year after he spends a year as boss of real 's feeder club castilla . middle man : paul pogba -lrb- centre -rrb- has impressed in central midfield for france at the world cup . that is if paris st germain do n't push out the boat this summer to sign pogba , who is known by his french team-mates as la pioche - ` the pickaxe ' . if brazil are to beat columbia on friday , then keeper julio cesar is likely to be as much their hero as neymar . it seems incredible that at the start of last season cesar could n't get a game in the championship for qpr . indeed he often did n't make the bench behind much ridiculed former england keeper rob green . hero : julio cesar saves alexis sanchez 's penalty in brazil 's win over chile in the last 16 . but it was n't because harry redknapp did n't rate him , it was just about getting him off the books given his # 90,000-a-week salary . cesar is still technically a qpr player and the club are still paying around half his wages while he is on loan at mls club toronto . he could return to qpr next season but the club hope his displays at this world cup will convince somebody to buy him . one to watch : . it seemed when france axed samir nasri and then frank ribery was injured they would lack flair from the midfield or the flanks . but mathieu valbuena - be honest how many had heard of him before ? - has come to the fore and france have flourished with goals . creative spark : mathieu valbuena has been the driving force for france going forward . he has the been the main creative force of the team - and according to fifa stats has teed up eleven chances . i-say : . german boss joachim low has said england will never win the world cup again . he may have a point but may well have led the fa to a solution . who is the man who re-invented the german national team , helped low on his way , then went over to the usa and turned their national team into a serious force ? jurgen klinsman . a german as england boss . warum nichts ? word cup moment : . tim howard , according to the stat men , made 15 ` saves ' for the usa against belgium - apparently a world cup record since such things were first logged in 1966 . the great wall of america : tim howard pulled off a record number of saves for the us against belgium . whichever way you want to look at it , howard produced the best all-round keeper display at the finals . but gordon bank 's save from pele 's header in 1970 surely remains the greatest single save . world cup bet . brazil and germany are odds-on favourites to progress but the odds could be turned on their head . neymar insists he has the shoulders to carry the weight of the nation , but carrying the brazil forward line - which he has done brilliantly so far - could well prove too much against this talented and spirited columbia side . and in james rodriguez , columbia have a player who can unlock a well-drilled brazil defence . a 1-1 draw at 90 minutes is 6-1 . columbia can then go on to win on penalties . france versus germany , meanwhile , has the making of a modern classic . so stick your neck out and trust karim benzema to keep on scoring . a 3-2 france win in 90 minutes is 45-1 . odds from coral .", "summary": " if muller scores against france he will become the third player after klose and teofilo cubillas to score five goals at two world cups .   klose needs one goal to become outright all-time leading world cup scorer .   manchester united target james rodriguez may stay at monaco this summer .   real madrid lining up bid for colombia striker radamel falcao .   is jurgen klinsmann the man to rebuild england ?
