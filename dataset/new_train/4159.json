{"text": "news that the united states is considering a military strike on syria in response to the bashar al-assad regime 's suspected use of chemical weapons suggests we could soon see an american bombing campaign on the war-torn country . the atrocities that took place in syria recently , such as those that have been taking place there for almost two years , are deplorable and inhuman . before bombing syria over the regime 's latest crimes , however , we should stand back and ask ,  and then what ?  bergen : for u.s. , syria is truly a problem from hell . a brief bombing campaign in syria might make the united states and its allies feel like they are doing something , but it will prove nothing . we have already abstained from getting involved in the civil war for two years and have chosen not to respond to evidence -lrb- albeit less clear -rrb- of another chemical attack this year . we have already concluded that as terrible as the civil war is , it can not be our war . the bombing will not change this -- and then what ? both sides in syria are bad . one side is a brutal dictator , and the other includes islamists and terrorists who are dangerous already and who would be brutal in power if given the chance . we will not spend the time , money and blood to create a desirable side in syria . there is no victory to be had there . syria is not the greatest threat in the middle east to u.s. or world security . the iranian regime is working every day to get a nuclear weapon . it poses a direct threat to israel 's survival and a long-term threat to america . the conflicts in syria , egypt and libya are small threats compared with the disaster that could ensue and the lives that would be endangered if iran succeeds in its drive for nuclear weapons . we should focus more on the truly big threat ahead of the headlines of the day -- or we will be reading much worse headlines in the future . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of newt gingrich .", "summary": " u.s. is considering a military strike on syria in response to chemical weapons attack .   newt gingrich : the atrocities are deplorable , but there is no desirable side in syria .   as terrible as this civil war is , it can not be our war , gingrich says .   gingrich : a much more serious threat to u.s. interests is possibility of iran nuclear bomb .
