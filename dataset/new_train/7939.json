{"text": "anger : ukip leader nigel farage condemned ` another appalling case of . discrimination ' after a member was prevented from volunteering as a . mentor for young adults by leading children 's charity barnardo 's . a row over two ukip members having their foster children removed took a new twist last night when another woman claimed she had been barred from looking after children because she was a party candidate . nigel farage , ukip leader , condemned ` another appalling case of discrimination ' after former district nurse anne murgatroyd said she had been prevented from volunteering as a mentor for young adults by leading children 's charity barnardo 's . ms murgatroyd , a mother of three , claims she told the charity of her political affiliation and was told it would ` not be appropriate ' for her to perform the role , which involves supporting children coming out of the care system , because ukip ` opposes multi-culturalism ' . the charity said there were other reasons for ms murgatroyd 's rejection but refused to disclose further details . the claim came as two investigations were launched into a council 's ` indefensible ' decision to remove three vulnerable children from their foster parents because of their support for ukip . social workers at rotherham borough council claimed the married couple 's affiliation with ukip meant they supported ` racist ' policies which made them unsuitable carers for the non-british children and there were concerns for their ` cultural and ethical needs ' . but amid widespread condemnation of their actions yesterday , the labour-run council began an internal review , and education secretary michael gove announced his own investigation . last night , mr farage said he had ` no reason ' to doubt ms murgatroyd 's story . he said : ` i met this lady at our party conference . we knew about this story at the time but she chose not to publicise it . she has now decided to make it known , really in support of the couple in rotherham . because of all that , i believe her story is genuine . ' separately , ukip officials said ms murgatroyd informed them of her problems with barnardo 's several months ago . the latest claim emerged in a series of posts ms murgatroyd , who stood as a ukip candidate for leeds city council in may 's elections , made on twitter . response : the charity said there were other reasons for ms murgatroyd 's rejection but refused to disclose further details . she wrote : ` barnardo 's would not allow me to be a volunteer befriender of young people leaving care when i told them i was standing for ukip . . . barnardo 's rationale for this was that  ukip opposes multi-culturalism  . ' responding to a mail on sunday reporter , she wrote : ` i 'd almost gone through their process and been accepted when i told them i 'd be standing for ukip in locals . . . they checked with managers , discussed it , could n't accept me due to issue of multi-culturalism . ` their rationale was that because ukip opposes multi-culturalism it would not be appropriate for me to mentor young people coming out of the care system . my argument was that , yes , i do oppose forced marriage and female genital mutilation and family killings but that does not make me unsuitable to befriend young people . ' anne murgatroyd said the charity told her it would . ` not be appropriate ' for her to perform the role . barnardo 's denied ` blanket banning ' any applicant . it said : ` the needs of the child must be paramount when making any decision about matching them with carers and the most important thing is to provide a loving and supportive environment . people from all backgrounds work and volunteer for barnardo 's but there are many factors to take into consideration when assessing suitability to work with children or young people . cultural context is relevant , but so are family background , health , and any previous experience . ' the foster couple in rotherham at the centre of a separate storm claimed howard woolfenden , the council 's former director of safeguarding children and families , had taken the decision to separate them from the children in their care without prior discussion . they also denied claims their membership of ukip affected their treatment of the children . the wife said : ` we were actively encouraging these children to speak their own language and to teach us their language . we enjoyed singing one of their folk songs in their native language . ` these children have now been placed with families who are also white british . how are these people going to meet the cultural needs of these children ? ' the equality and human rights commission said the decision may have breached the parents ' right to freedom of political opinion . mr woolfenden was not available for comment . in a statement , rotherham council announced an immediate investigation and said : ` membership of a political party should not stop someone fostering children . ' labour leader ed miliband called for an urgent probe . by michael gove , education secretary . appeal : education secretary michael gove wants more parents from every background to come forward to adopt . i know how important it is to ensure you choose the right family to look after a child who has been in care . because i was a child in care . and i was brought up by the right family . because i was adopted . my mum and dad did an amazing job , providing me with love and security , enabling me to enjoy wonderful opportunities . i can never adequately repay them . but one of the ways in which i 'm trying is my work to reform our care system . as education secretary i 'm responsible for government policy on child protection , children in care , adoption and fostering . just last week i laid out how big a job we face to get things right . if we needed any reminder of what we 're up against then yesterday 's reports from rotherham powerfully demonstrate just how much change is needed , because children still do n't come first . for years now , child protection has been crippled by politically correct attitudes that put the interests and ideologies of adults ahead of the needs of children . on the one hand , we leave children with abusive and neglectful parents for too long , as the case of ` baby p ' peter connelly exemplifies . on the other hand , we do n't welcome and support people who want to adopt or foster effectively enough . so neglected children are not rescued sufficiently early or placed in loving homes sufficiently quickly . a particular problem has been the way in which rules on ethnicity , race and culture have been applied . when it comes to adoption the perfect has been the enemy of the good . social workers have put the need to find a perfect ethnic or cultural ` match ' for children in care ahead of the pressing need to find those children a loving home . so children from black and minority ethnic backgrounds spend longer in care , and get adopted later , than others . we know that the earlier a child is adopted the better , so these pc attitudes , allegedly designed to help children , only end up harming them . and that is why the decision by rotherham council to take a child away from loving and successful foster parents for ` cultural ' reasons -- because they were members of ukip -- is so especially harmful . it sends a signal to those who want to foster or adopt that they 're not wanted if their attitudes fall outside a tightly circumscribed and politically approved set of views . that 's offensive to any idea of a genuinely liberal society and a tragedy at a time when we need more parents to foster and adopt . and it 's why we are changing the law to stop ethnic and cultural considerations being put ahead of a child 's need for early adoption . i want more parents from every background -- gay or straight , black or white , left or right -- to come forward to adopt because there are so many children whose lives will be transformed immeasurably for the better if they are enfolded in the loving arms of kind parents . it is also an immensely rewarding choice to make . adoption means taking a child not just into your home but into your heart . it is a relationship which is -- in every sense -- for good . and there is no more generous gift you can give a damaged , neglected or abused child than a fresh start . to view mr gove 's speech on child protection click here .", "summary": " district nurse said charity told her it would ` not be appropriate '   new scandal follows revelation of ukip parents banned from fostering .
