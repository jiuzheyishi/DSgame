{"text": "google is set to track the world 's warships and make the data available to billions of internet users , raising concerns over the security of the american naval fleet . the search engine plans to offer the coordinates and identity of virtually all vessels at sea on google maps after spending around $ 3million on satellite technology . the company continues to consult with the u.s. navy over the plans , as well as with the defence departments of countries around the world . google has claimed that it is better placed to track the military boats than most governments . ship-shape : google will soon be able to show the location of every vessel at sea and maps of the ocean floor . michael jones , who is chief technology advocate at google ventures , told aol : ' i watch them and they ca n't see themselves . it angers me as a citizen that i can do this and the entire dod ca n't . ' google is not the first to track ships at sea , but claims to have improved on previous technology . all large vessels are fitted with the maritime automatic identification system -lrb- ais -rrb- - a series of transponders that transmit the boat 's position to avoid collisions when it is dark or there is bad weather . at the moment ais can detect boats 20 mile away from each other - however , there are ongoing attempts to improve the distance and accuracy . by comparison , from space the google satellites can detect ships anywhere . the web power has already used its technology to track trawlers fishing illegally in foreign waters and passed the information on to governments . despite fears over a risk to defence ships , the vessels can go incognito by simply turning off their transmitter so military operations were unlikely to threatened . all at sea : internet users will be able to locate the coordinates and identity of the u.s. navy 's fleet via a simple google search . detractors of google 's plan to map the waters said the technology could be used by terrorists or pirates to attack ships . however one military source responded : ` it 's not the ships you can see , but the ships you ca n't see that matter . ' google 's plan to map the ocean floor over the next five years could reveal the resting place of spy satellites and send hostile foreign enemies on the hunt for ` sunken treasure ' . it 's not the ships you can see , but the ships you ca n't see that matter . military source . google maps was launched in 2005 , providing aerial or satellite images for most populated areas across the world . the service has often been controversial . iran threatened to sue the company yesterday over dropping the name of the persian gulf on google maps . the threat came after it left the body of water between iran and the arabian peninsula nameless on its online map service . foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast said that if google does not restore the name of the persian gulf , it will face ` serious damages ' . into the deep : google has said its capabilities of tracking naval vessels outstrips defense departments . google reacted to the comments , saying that its maps service had never labelled the persian gulf . when asked by mailonline if google planned to include the title in the wake of iranian threats , a spokesman said there were no plans to include the title on any amended map . a separate company insider told mail online that it was ` definitely not ' a political decision not to have persian gulf on google maps , and iran 's assertion that google had had the label removed was ` simply wrong ' . iranians are highly sensitive about the name of the body of water , which has historically and internationally been known as the persian gulf . some arab states insist on calling it the arabian gulf . the issue has stirred up tensions between iranians and arabs .", "summary": " search engine has plans to map the entire ocean floor over next five years .   google has spent $ 3million on satellite technology and claims it is better at tracking ships than most governments .
