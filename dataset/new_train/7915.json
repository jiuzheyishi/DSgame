{"text": "koo stark arrived at isleworth crown court today armed with a # 40,000 painting she was accused of stealing from her former partner . koo stark described yesterday how being locked in a police ` cage ' after she was accused of theft had been her ` worst nightmare ' . prince andrew 's former girlfriend was speaking after she handed back a # 40,000 painting she was accused of snatching from warren walker . she had been due to stand trial for allegedly taking the artwork from the home of mr walker , the father of her 16-year-old daughter tatiana . but a dramatic last-minute deal between lawyers saw the 57-year-old actress-turned-photographer cleared when she agreed to return the 17th century oil painting . her defence lawyer also said the expensive nature of the case had given rise to the ` very real risk ' that miss stark would be left homeless and unable to provide a home for her daughter . miss stark , who was accused under her real name kathleen , had arrived at court yesterday with the painting wrapped in a green blanket and bubble wrap . it was carried in a canvas shopping bag by her solicitor jules azzopardi who told security officials at isleworth crown court : ` be careful , it 's very expensive . ' the 12in square artwork by the dutch master anthonie van borssom was then examined by lawyers representing mr walker in a consultation room next to the court . a photograph of the moonlit coastal landscape -- which was still in its frame -- was then sent by text message to mr walker , who verified it was the one he claimed was his . once the handover was confirmed , prosecutors offered no evidence against miss stark and his honour judge andrew mcdowall recorded a formal ` not guilty ' verdict . miss stark had claimed she believed the painting belonged to her when she took it from mr walker 's home in kensington park gardens , london on july 21 last year . but she became embroiled in a bitter legal dispute with mr walker , an american financier who had left her ten days before their 1997 wedding while she was heavily pregnant . american-born miss stark yesterday said the ` painful episode ' , which included being locked in a police cell , was beyond her ` worst nightmare ' . in a statement she said : ` i have been cleared of a charge that should never have been brought against me . i leave court with my liberty and my good name , but it should never have come to this . i was a defendant charged with a serious crime . in my mind , i have been looking into a prison for the last ten months . ` i have travelled through the criminal courts , a stranger in a strange land . when i was arrested i was even put into a cage -- as they describe it at the police station . i have been vilified and put in the pillory . fortunately , common sense has prevailed and my former partner has relented . ' miss stark struck a deal with prosecutors to hand back the anthonie van borssom oil painting of a moonlit coastal landscape to court to avoid trial . miss stark was cleared of theft by a judge at isleworth crown court today after the prosecution offered no evidence . the trial was adjourned yesterday when the judge questioned if it was in the public interest . she added : ` if someone like me can be arrested , bruised and locked in a police cage , an experience i never dreamed would happen in my life , then it could happen to anyone . ' her relationship with mr . walker has been tempestuous since they separated in 1997 and she once threatened to sue him for ` emotional distress ' after he appealed for custody of their daughter . miss stark yesterday expressed hope that her dealings with mr walker might improve . however , in court edward henry , defending , claimed mr walker had ` sought to criminalise the mother of his child unjustly , disproportionally and inappropriately ' . ` today i have been cleared of a charge that should never have been brought against me . ' i leave court with my liberty and my good name but it should never have come to this . ' i was a defendant charged with a serious crime . in my mind , i have been looking into a prison for the last ten months . ' i have travelled through the criminal courts , a stranger in a strange land . ` when i was arrested i was even put into a cage - as they describe it at the police station . i have been vilified and put in the pillory . ` fortunately , common sense has prevailed and my former partner has relented . ` as yeats once said ,  young we loved each other and were ignorant  . ' i leave with the desire that from now on we will treat each other with respect and that any disputes we may have are dealt with in private and with dignity . ' he also said the case had given rise to the ` very real risk ' that his client would be left homeless and unable to provide a home for her daughter . defence counsel applied for costs to be donated to the bar pro bono fund which represented miss stark at court , but this was refused by the judge . judge mcdowall said : ` it is an unfortunate fact that for many years these parties have been locked in battle in the civil and family courts . ` at the end of the day , the fact of the matter is if your client had acted through the civil courts , it would have been dealt with there and if she had not gone to the property and taken away the painting , this would never have happened . ` if things had gone differently , we might have been here for days . ` it was better to resolve this matter without running the risk of private personal matters being ventilated in court . ' miss stark , who did not qualify for legal aid , later appealed for more support for the bar pro bono fund which had helped her through ` this painful episode ' . miss stark met the duke of york on a blind date during his leave from the royal navy and they began dating on his return from the falklands war in 1982 . she was later invited to balmoral to visit the royal family . the couple dated for 18 months before separating after it was revealed miss stark had appeared semi-naked in the soft porn film emily . warren walker 's solicitor richard harbord took the anthonie van borssom oil painting of a moonlit coastal landscape from court today . the legal dispute was over the ownership of an oil painting by dutch artist anthonie van borssom , who also painted a river scene by moonlight , pictured . the # 40,000 painting was wrapped in bubble wrap for its journey to court today . miss stark , pictured yesterday at court , agreed to return the artwork , which was examined by mr walker 's solicitors , to avoid trial .", "summary": " miss stark , 57 , returned the anthonie van borssom oil painting today .   the photographer was cleared of theft by a judge at isleworth crown court .   she was accused of stealing from warren walker , the father of her daughter .   miss stark quoted yeats in a statement read by solicitor after the hearing .   she quoted the poet to say : ` young we loved each other and were ignorant '   she said she had been : ' a stranger in a strange land ' of the courts system .
