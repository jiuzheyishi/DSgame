' some of his neighbours were shocked to hear he had returned to the family home . ` one , who did not want to be named , said : ` it 's quite scary . i ca n't believe he 's back living with the children . ` when you hear about what he did , its pretty worrying to know he is living here .

' the home where kate ellerbeck died to which her husband has returned after serving three years in jail . mr ellerbeck who was found guilty of manslaughter , killed his unfaithful wife during a violent row . mr mcadam , 50 , last night hit out at the legal system that has allowed mr ellerbeck to begin rebuilding his life after just four years behind bars , adding : ` he destroyed kate 's life , left two children without a mother and caused untold anguish to kate 's sister , family and myself . ` yet when i asked victim liaison questions about his release , i kept being told the probation service was trying to make his life as  normal as possible  now that he is out . i had hoped he would not be allowed back to the home where kate died . ' mr mcadam has been campaigning to change the law to make it harder for people sentenced for serious crimes to be released early . he said : ` because he 's served half of his sentence , he has no need to wear an electronic tag , or report regularly to police , all apparently because of this desire to let him lead a normal life . ' i will never be able to lead a normal life again and nor will other people involved in this case who knew and loved kate .
