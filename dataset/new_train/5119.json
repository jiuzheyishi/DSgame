{"text": "north korea has repaired flood damage at its nuclear test facility and could conduct a quick atomic explosion if it chose - and could trigger a detonation in as little as two weeks . but water streaming out of a test tunnel may cause problems at the site , analysis of recent satellite photos has found . leaders in washington and around the world are braced for the possibility that if punished for a successful long-range rocket launch on december 12 , that the un considers a cover for a banned ballistic missile test , north korea 's next step might be its third nuclear test . this satellite image taken nov. 19 , 2012 by digitalglobe shows the entrance area of the punggye-ri nuclear test facility in north korea , where experts suspect pyongyang will conduct its next detonation . analysts claim tyre tracks now run from the bypass road to the southern area support buildings , the new bridge appears to be wider than before and the tent cover has been raised with the snowfall . rocket and nuclear tests unnerve . washington and its allies because each new success puts north korean . scientists another step closer to perfecting a nuclear warhead small . enough to put on a missile that could hit the mainland united states . north korean leader kim jong-un , pictured . it is feared his next step might be a third nuclear test after a test facility was repaired . another nuclear test , which north korea 's foreign ministry hinted at on the day of the rocket launch , would fit a pattern . pyongyang conducted its first and second atomic explosions , in 2006 and 2009 , weeks after receiving un security council condemnation and sanctions for similar long-range rocket launches . north korea is thought to have enough plutonium for a handful of crude atomic bombs , and unveiled a uranium enrichment facility in 2010 , but it must continue to conduct tests to master the miniaturisation technology crucial for a true nuclear weapons program . ` with an additional nuclear test , north korea could advance their ability to eventually deploy a nuclear weapon on a long-range missile , ' said daryl kimball , executive director of the nongovernment arms control association . analysts caution that only so much can be determined from satellite imagery , and it 's very difficult to fully discern north korea 's plans . this is especially true for nuclear test preparations , which are often done deep within a mountain . north korea , for instance , took many by surprise when it launched its rocket this month only several days after announcing technical problems . although there 's no sign of an imminent nuclear test , u.s. and south korean officials worry that pyongyang could conduct one at any time . analysis of geoeye and digital globe satellite photos from december 13 and earlier , provided to the associated press by 38 north , the website for the u.s.-korea institute at johns hopkins school of advanced international studies , said scientists are ` determined to maintain a state of readiness ' at the punggye-ri nuclear test facility after repairing flood damage . this satellite image taken on december 2 shows the traffic flow pattern at the punggye-ri nuclear test facility in north korea . the 38 north analysis says the road is dark where movement has melted the snow , and the traffic appears limited to the bypass road , the tunnel entrance and the two southern area support buildings . the nuclear speculation comes as south korea 's conservative president-elect , park geun-hye , prepares to take office in february , and as young north korean leader kim jong un marks his one-year anniversary as supreme commander . kim has consolidated power since taking over after his father , kim jong il , died dec. 17 , 2011 , and the rocket launch is seen as a major internal political and popular boost for the 20-something leader . some analysts , however , question whether kim will risk international , and especially chinese , wrath and sure sanctions by quickly conducting a nuclear test . the election in south korea and barack obama 's re-election to a second term as us president could prompt north korea to try more diplomacy than military options , some believe . yong-seok , an analyst at the institute for peace affairs , a private think tank in seoul . ' i think we 'll see north korea more focused on economic revival than on nuclear testing next year . ' the 38 north analysis said the north ` may be able to trigger a detonation in as little as two weeks , once a political decision is made to move forward . ' but the report by jack liu , nick hansen and jeffrey lewis also said it was unclear whether water seepage from a tunnel entrance at the site was under control . water could hurt a nuclear device and the sensors needed to monitor a test . the analysis also identified what it called a previously unidentified structure that could be meant to protect sensitive equipment from bad weather . ` we do n't have a crystal ball that will tell us when the north will conduct its third nuclear test , ' said joel wit , a former u.s. state department official and now editor of 38 north . ` but events over the next few months , such as the u.n. reaction to pyongyang 's missile test and the north 's unfolding policy toward the new south korean government , may at least provide us with some clues . ' another unknown is how china , the north 's only major ally , would respond to calls for tighter sanctions . washington views more pressure from beijing as pivotal if diplomatic pressure is going to force change in pyongyang . even if beijing signs on to un punishment if the north conducts a test , there may be less hurt for pyongyang than washington wants . the impact of tougher sanctions would be ' a drop in the bucket compared with the tidal wave of china-north korean trade ' that has risen sharply since 2008 , even as inter-korean trade has remained flat , said john park , a korea expert at the massachusetts institute of technology . trade figures show north korea 's deepening dependence on china . pyongyang 's trade with beijing surged more than 60 percent last year , reaching $ 5.63 billion , according to south korea 's statistics korea . china accounted for 70 percent of north korea 's annual trade in 2011 , up from 57 percent in 2010 . north korea 's 2006 nuclear test had an estimated explosive yield of 1 kiloton . the los alamos national laboratory estimated in 2011 that the north 's test on may 25 , 2009 , which followed u.n. condemnation of an april long-range rocket launch , had a minimum yield of 5.7 kilotons . the atomic bomb that hit nagasaki at the end of world war ii was about 21 kilotons . both north korean tests used plutonium for fissile material . without at least one more successful plutonium test , it 's unlikely that pyongyang could have confidence in a miniaturized plutonium design , according to an august paper by frank pabian of los alamos and siegfried hecker of stanford university . north korea 's small plutonium stockpile is sufficient for four to eight bombs , they wrote , but it may be willing to sacrifice some if it can augment information from the previous tests . pabian and hecker predicted that pyongyang may simultaneously test both plutonium and highly enriched uranium devices . a uranium test would worry the international community even more , as it would confirm that north korea , which would need months to restart its shuttered plutonium reactor , has an alternative source of fissile material based on uranium enrichment . north korea unveiled a previously secret uranium enrichment plant in november 2010 . ` whether and when north korea conducts another nuclear test will depend on how high a political cost pyongyang is willing to bear , ' mr pabian and mr hecker wrote . another test would also undermine pyongyang 's assertion that its long-range rocket launches are for a peaceful space program and not what outsiders see as the development of ballistic missiles that could eventually deliver nuclear weapons . on the same day as this month 's rocket launch , an unidentified north korean foreign ministry spokesman told state media that a hostile u.s. response to a failed launch in april of this year had forced pyongyang ` to re-examine the nuclear issue as a whole . the statement was a clear threat to detonate a nuclear device ahead of any u.n. security council action , said baek seung-joo , an analyst at the state-run korea institute for defense analyses in seoul .", "summary": " discovery of repair comes from an analysis of satellite images .   world leaders fear that north korea 's may be plotting its third nuclear test .   country could trigger detonation in just two weeks .
