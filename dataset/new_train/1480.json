' by toby harnden . flight plan : president barack obama disembarks from marine one on the south lawn . his use of official vehicles for fundraising trips has caused concern . president barack obama has already held more than twice as many re-election fundraising events than president george w. bush did in his entire 2004 re-election campaign . according to mark knoller of cbs news , unofficial keeper of presidential statistics , obama has held 124 fundraisers - about one every three days - since he launched his re-election bid last april compared to the 57 bush held to raise cash for his re-election bid eight years ago . obama 's frenetic fundraising schedule had prompted the republican national committee -lrb- rnc -rrb- to lodge a formal complaint with the government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- about misuse of taxpayer money . the obama campaign dismissed the complaint as a ` stunt ' and the white house said that it would follow the same rules as previous administrations and refund the appropriate amounts . according to the pentagon , the boeing 747 that normally serves as air force one costs $ 179,750 an hour to operate . in the complaint , reince priebus , rnc chairman , wrote : ` throughout his administration , but particularly in recent weeks , president obama has been passing off campaign travel as ` official events , ' thereby allowing taxpayers , rather than his campaign , to pay for his re-election efforts . ' john boehner , speaker of the house of representatives , today demanded that barack obama ` pony up and reimburse the treasury ' for what he said were are campaign trips to battleground states dressed up as presidential travel . he accused the obama campaign of manufacturing a phony fight about student loans and then using air force one to hold what amounted to re-election rallies in swing states . ` frankly , i think this is beneath the dignity of the white house ... for the president to make a campaign issue about it and then travel to three battleground states , ' he said . ` this one does not pass the straight-face test . you know it , and i know it . it 's time for the obama campaign to pony up and reimburse the treasury . ' he added that ` the president keeps trying to invent these kind of fake fights because he does n't have a record ' and ` the emperor wears no clothes ' . priebus said that the obama campaign ` has been cheating the american taxpayer by using taxpayer dollars to fund their general election efforts ' and had ` held more campaign events in three-and-a-half years than any other president did in their full term ' . ` it 's time for the obama campaign to pony up and reimburse the treasury . ' john boehner , speaker of the house of representatives . he pointed to obama 's current trip to north carolina , colorado , and iowa , all key battleground states , to discuss extending lower interest rates on student loans as examples of this tax-payer funded campaign travel . ` one might imagine that if this were genuinely a government event he might have stopped in a non-battleground state like texas or vermont , ' his complaint said . priebus told reporters : ` this president and air force one seem to have a magic magnet that only seem to land in battleground states in this country . ' he added that a trip to florida a fortnight ago , when an official speech was added to a day 's programme of fundraising , was suspect . ` this speech was high on class warfare , slogans , and divisive campaign style rhetoric . it was low on substance that would benefit the populace at large .
