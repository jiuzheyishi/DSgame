{"text": "london , england when the economy gets tough , the tough come out fighting . for some businesses , that means bringing out a fighter brand -- a cut-price version of a flagship product , marketed under a new name , and intended to fight back against budget competitors .  jetstar  is a fighter brand that worked , beating the competition and creating a lasting , money-making brand . when it 's done right it can destroy cut-price competition , but done badly it can drive a business to the brink of bankruptcy . mark ritson , associate professor at melbourne business school , has written an article for the october issue of harvard business review discussing the benefits and pitfalls of launching a fighter brand . he says that over the next six months a number of new fighter brands are likely to appear in response to the recession .  fighter brands are very unusual but they are becoming increasingly common ,  he told cnn .  it 's high risk and high reward , and when it works it can have astonishing results .  ritson gives the example of intel , which launched its budget  celeron  chip in the late 1990s to in response to amd 's low-priced chips , which were threatening intel 's premium  pentium  brand . read more business features with  celeron ,  intel came up with a budget alternative to  pentium  for the lower end of the market and cemented its position as market leader . but intel 's success is the exception rather than the rule .  the majority of fighter brands not only have n't worked , but have gone on to do significant damage to the companies that launched them ,  said ritson . general motors ' -lrb- gm -rrb-  saturn ,  united airlines '  ted ,  and kodak 's  funtime  film range are all high-profile fighter brands that failed . despite the appeal of taking on the competition in a fist fight , launching a successful fighter brand is easier said than done .  the problem is that fighter brands are almost always a knee-jerk reaction to a problem and are not always well thought out ,  neil saunders , consulting director with verdict research , told cnn . ritson says one element in building a fighter brand is to avoid creating a low-price product that is so attractive that it steals customers who would otherwise be buying that company 's premium-brand product . on the other hand , if the fighter brand is too expensive or too low quality , it wo n't put up much of a fight against the opposition it 's designed to attack . another complication is that even the biggest companies do n't have the money and managerial time to distract themselves with a new brand at a time when they should be concentrating on their core products , and then there is the difficulty in operating at an unfamiliar low price level .  the airline industry is a prime example , where people have launched fighter brands to combat the budget airlines and have been notoriously unsuccessful ,  said saunders .  if it 's not your business model it 's not easy to operate , and it 's not usually these airlines ' business model .  united 's  ted ,  and delta air lines  song  were launched to combat budget carriers , but they were n't up to the challenge . in fact , ritson says those fighter brands contributed to united and delta 's bankruptcy . but with its budget  jetstar  airline , qantas managed to find the holy grail for fighter brands -- beating the competition and creating a lasting , money-making brand in its own right . so what was different about the qantas model ?  one thing was that qantas took a long , hard look at the numbers and decided if they could be profitable ,  said ritson .  one of the problems with fighter brands is that they are oriented towards destroying a competitor and because of that managers pay a lot less attention to the bottom line .  he gives the example of gm 's  saturn ,  a car designed to take on fuel-efficient , affordable japanese cars .  saturn  sold plenty of cars , at least at first , but its high operating costs meant it lost millions of dollars , playing a huge part in bankrupting gm . so given the huge risks involved , should companies even consider launching a fighter brand ?  only do it if you can win and it fits with your existing proposition ,  says saunders . ritson cautions ,  the minute you add a new brand to your portfolio it 's hundreds of thousands of hours of management time , and millions of dollars in development , advertising and distraction .  ask the question , ` do i need a fighter brand or is this a real seismic change in the market , which means i need to change my existing strategy with existing brands ? ' otherwise you will lose five years and $ 50 million .
