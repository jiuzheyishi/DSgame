' mr wardle added : ` the charity commission was also fully informed of the findings of the investigation and the outcome . rev flowers resigned from his -lrb- voluntary and unpaid -rrb- position as chairman of trustees before our own internal proceedings could be concluded . ' the charity 's income is generated via public sector grants and local contracts and a variety of small local and specialist scheme funds . in another development , it emerged that flowers was made chairman of governors of a yorkshire primary school after pornography was found on his council laptop . he was given the prestigious role at lidget green school , bradford , after he had resigned over the laptop incident in 2011 . the school said last night it had not been told by the council about the incident and had ` no reason to believe ' he had resigned for reasons other than those he had officially stated . this was that he had ` increasing and competing demands ' on his time . flowers , who has been ` suspended indefinitely ' from the methodist church , led the co-op bank for three years . earlier this week it was revealed that he used his co-op email account to hire a rent boy for sex . ciaron dodd said they met for depraved sessions in plush hotels -- in rooms paid for by the struggling co-op . it has also emerged that flowers was convicted of gross indecency in a public toilet with a man in 1981 , but he was forgiven by the methodist church . he admitted the offence at fareham magistrates ' court in hampshire , and was fined # 75 with # 35 legal costs . allegations : ciaron dodd , left , claims that he met flowers , right , in plush hotels paid for by the struggling co-op for depraved sex sessions . bradford council was under fire last night after apparently failing to inform labour party headquarters of the gay porn found on paul flowers ' work laptop . the former banking boss was allowed to continue with his high-profile role with the party even after resigning from the council in disgrace . flowers , 63 , was confronted by council officials in 2011 after it workers found the images while mending his computer . high profile : flowers -lrb- right -rrb- with lord mayor of bradford peter hill . he resigned immediately -- but the official reason given was that he was leaving for family reasons and because of his high-pressured job at co-op bank . last night , it emerged that senior executives at the council were aware of the incident , as was the then labour leader of the council . but no one thought it was appropriate to make public the real reasons behind his departure . flowers was even appointed as chairman of the governors at lidget green primary school , in bradford , after he had resigned as councillor . last night , there was anger among councillors who said the public had a right to know what flowers had done . councillor paul cromie said : ` this looks like a cover-up . when flowers resigned , there was a press release issued which said his workload was too heavy . ` if the council leader knew the real reason at the time , then he should have told labour hq . it would have been his duty . ' i also think the electorate had a right to know -- after all , they are the ones that elected him . ' the leader of the council when flowers resigned was ian greenwood , who lost his seat to a respect party candidate in may 2012 . before flowers left , he said : ` paul is a tremendously gifted and committed individual who has made a significant and lasting contribution to the community in great horton , to the council and to the labour group . ` i will be sad to see him go but i fully understand the reasoning behind paul 's decision . ' but despite his public praise , it now appears he knew about the porn -- and chose not to make it widely known . councillor david green , current leader of bradford council , said he did not know whether his predecessor had taken action . he said : ` i do n't know what happened at the time and i do n't know who was given information . if the labour party are saying that they were n't informed then i have no reason to disbelieve them . ' a council spokesman said it was not considered necessary to alert labour headquarters or the public because flowers had not broken the law -- just council rules . connections : flowers , pictured here -lrb- centre -rrb- at a downing street reception in 2010 , was once invited to ed miliband Â¿ s office for private talks . the spokesman said : ` it must be emphasised that this material was not illegal . in the light of the resignation no further investigations into how the material came to be on the computer were required . ` it was a potential breach of the council 's internal policy . ' a labour spokesman yesterday insisted ed miliband and other senior figures were not told why flowers had been forced to resign from bradford council , but did not deny that some mps and shadow ministers may have known . the spokesman said : ` the leader of the labour party did not know , the shadow cabinet did not know . no one who could reasonably be described as being in a position of leadership knew about this .
