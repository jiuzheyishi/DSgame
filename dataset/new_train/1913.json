{"text": "a mysterious explosion that rocked nicaragua on saturday night , creating a 39ft-wide -lrb- 12 metre -rrb- crater , appears to have been caused by a small meteorite . and authorities in the region believe the meteorite was in fact a shard of rock from the 2014 rc ` pitbull ' asteroid that soared past earth over the weekend . the impact , close to the country 's international airport , did not cause any known injuries , but the hit was powerful enough to be felt throughout the capital , according to reports . the explosion hit woodland in managua in nicaragua on saturday and created a crater measuring 39 feet -lrb- 12 metres -rrb- wide -lrb- pictured -rrb- . authorities in the region believe it was a shard of rock from the 2014 rc ` pitbull ' asteroid that soared past earth at a similar time to the impact . tests are now being carried out on the crater to learn more about how it was formed . ` we are convinced that this was a meteorite . we have seen the crater from the impact , ' said wilfredo strauss of the seismic institute . nasa estimates the 2014 rc asteroid to be approximately 65ft -lrb- 20 metres -rrb- wide - roughly the same size as a large house . this makes it similar in size to the chelyabinsk meteorite that exploded over russia 's ural mountains region in february 2013 . at the time of closest approach , asteroid 2014 rc was said to be one-tenth the distance from the centre of earth to the moon - or about 25,000 miles -lrb- 40,000 km -rrb- . the asteroid was reported as passing closest to earth at approximately 7.18 pm bst -lrb- 2.18 pm est -rrb- , as it travelled over new zealand . it did not hit earth , but its orbit will bring it back to our planet 's neighbourhood in the future . the asteroid 's future motion will be closely monitored , but no future threatening earth encounters have been identified , according to nasa . the nicaraguan authorities continued that the timing of the impact fits closely with the passing of the -lsb- ` pitbull ' -rsb- asteroid , which passed very close to earth on sunday . a meteorite was also spotted flying over spain on sunday evening , and astrophysicists are trying to determine if the two events are related . before the event , nasa estimated the asteroid to be approximately 65ft -lrb- 20 metres -rrb- wide - roughly the same size as a house . this makes it similar in size to the chelyabinsk meteorite that exploded over russia 's ural mountains region in february 2013 . at the time of its closest approach , asteroid 2014 rc was said to be one-tenth the distance from the centre of earth to the moon - or about 25,000 miles -lrb- 40,000 km -rrb- . the meteorite , which may have splintered from the asteroid , is said to have hurtled into a wooded area near the airport around midnight , and the hit was so large that it registered on the instruments strauss 's organisation uses to measure earthquakes . this is the incredible moment an asteroid the size of a house skimmed past the earth . the rock , known as 2014 rc or pitbull , made the unexpected close approach during the early hours of september 8 . before the event , nasa estimated the asteroid -lrb- nasa image , pictured -rrb- to be approximately 65ft -lrb- 20 metres -rrb- wide - roughly the same size as a large house . the asteroid was reported to have been closest to earth at approximately 7.18 pm bst -lrb- 2.18 pm est -rrb- , over new zealand . the meteorite appeared to have hurtled into a wooded area near the airport in the nicaraguan capital -lrb- pictured -rrb- at around midnight on saturday . the hit was so large , experts at the seismic institute said it registered on the instruments used to measure earthquakes . ` you can see two waves : first , a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth , and then another stronger one , which is the impact of the sound , ' mr strauss continued . government officials and experts visited the impact site on sunday . one of them , william martinez , said it was not yet clear if the meteorite burned up completely or if it had been blasted into the soil . ` you can see mirror-like spots on the sides of the crater from where the meteorite power-scraped the walls , ' martinez said . 2014 rc zipped passed a cluster of television and weather satellites around 22,000 miles from the earth 's surface at around 8pm uk time . nasa scientists said it would be difficult to spot the asteroid without using a telescope and that it is likely to be even closer to the moon . the whale-sized asteroid had a ` very close ' shave with earth . on sunday . this image shows the orbit of asteroid . 2014 rc around the sun . the asteroid is about 60ft -lrb- 20 metres -rrb- across in size . dr dan brown , an astronomy expert at nottingham trent university , told mailonline : ` the possible meteorite impact in nicaragua , linked with the asteroid 2014 rc which flew by earth last night , raises some interesting questions . ` although the impact occurred roughly 12 hours before the asteroid passed earth , that part of the planet was facing in the right direction for it to have been a fragment associated with it . ` if it was an unrelated object , however , then it further demonstrates how we do n't really monitor all the potentially dangerous rocks out there .

' local emergency services also received several calls about the meteorite from panicked people wondering if it might be a plane or a ufo on fire . it is believed that the suspected meteorite crashed in a remote location . trigo added that , given the size of the fireball , the suspected meteorite was almost certainly too large to have burnt up and therefore would have impacted somewhere -- adding : ` the question now is to find out where .
