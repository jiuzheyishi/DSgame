{"text": "critically ill babies could be diagnosed with genetic diseases in just days rather than weeks , thanks to a new rapid gene unravelling machine . doctors at children 's mercy hospital in kansas sequenced the entire genetic code of four gravely ill newborns and identified genetic diseases in three of them in just 50 hours . this was quick enough to help them . make vital treatment decisions . genetic sequencing involves analysing 3.2 billion chemical ` bases ' or ` letters ' that make up the human genetic code . four gravely ill newborns had their entire genetic code sequenced in 50 hours at children 's mercy hospital in kansas . 50 hours to diagnosis : how the process works . it can reveal dna variations that point to around 3,500 rare diseases . many of these conditions are fatal but around 500 have treatments available . up til now the process was viewed study author , dr stephen kingsmore : ` it is now feasible to decode an entire genome and provide interim results back to the physician in two days . ' the study tested two software programs developed at children 's mercy that were used in conjunction with a high-speed gene sequencer from illumina called hiseq 2500 , which can sequence an entire genome in about 25 hours . the company helped pay for the study and company researchers took part in it . next-generation gene sequencing machines have driven down the cost of whole genome sequencing , but making practical use of the data has been more challenging , largely because of the time it takes to analyse all of the data . dr stephen kingsmore led the study into the new ultra-fast genetic testing . as many as a third of babies admitted . to a neonatal intensive care unit in the united states have some form . of genetic disease . treatments are currently available for more than 500 . diseases , but identifying them quickly has been a problem . typically , . genetic testing on newborns using conventional methods takes four to . six weeks , long enough that the infant has either died or been sent . home . ` up until now , they have really had to practice medicine blindfolded , ' dr kingsmore said . dr . neil miller , director of informatics at children 's mercy , said the . software programs help doctors identify which genes to test , and analyze . the data quickly . one . of these programs , called ssaga , allows doctors to order this test based . on the child 's symptoms , without having to know in advance which genes . to test for . the . software only maps genes associated with the child 's symptoms . ssaga . does this for nearly 600 diseases , but the team is expanding this to . include all 3,500 known disease genes , miller told the briefing . the team developed a second software program called runes that helps determine which of the suspected genes was most likely to be the cause of the child 's illness . in the study , the team tested the system on four seriously ill babies whose conditions were suspected of having a genetic cause . one of the boys was found to have a heart defect that the team discovered is also shared by his six-year-old brother . the infant underwent heart surgery and has survived . while two of the other three babies were diagnosed with rare conditions they sadly all passed away . how the cost of decoding genomes has dramatically fallen since 2008 . dr carol saunders , who helped interpret the study results said the study could give parents more information . about the cause of their child 's illness and allow them to make . decisions about what kinds of treatments they wanted to pursue . the test is projected to cost # 8,300 -lrb- $ 13,500 -rrb- , but the team believes that may be worth it given the high cost of care in a neonatal intensive care unit , which runs roughly # 5,000 -lrb- $ 8,000 -rrb- per night . the next move is to broaden the test to include 100 or more babies to determine the benefits , costs and potential problems linked with the testing . because the illumina machine was not available in the united states , the team had to discount the time it took to ship the blood samples to britain , where the actual sequencing was done . but kingsmore said the hospital expects to receive its own hiseq 2500 machine next month . eventually , the hospital hopes to have its . testing validated , so the researchers can do genetic testing on newborns . in hospitals across the united states .", "summary": " doctors at children 's mercy hospital in kansas sequenced genetic code of four newborns .   super-quick genetic test reveals dna variations that point to around 3,500 rare diseases .   the test is projected to cost # 8,300 . doctors pointed out that intensive care units can cost # 5,000 a night to run .
