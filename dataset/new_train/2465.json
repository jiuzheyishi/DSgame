{"text": "the 911 call is accusatory . the woman flatly tells the dispatcher she just witnessed several police officers in east bakersfield , california , beat a man to death . the woman -- identified by the local newspaper as salina quair , 34 -- happened upon the scene as she left kern medical center , where the father of four would later die .  there 's a man laying on the floor , and your police officers beat the sh-t out of him and killed him ,  said quair , according to a tape of the 911 call obtained by cnn affiliate kero-tv .  i 'm right here on the corner of flower and palm right now and you have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight sheriffs . the guy was laying on the floor , and eight sheriffs ran up and started beating him up with sticks . the man is dead laying right here , right now ,  she continues . the sheriff 's office has named the seven deputies involved in the incident , including a sergeant , while the california highway patrol has yet to name its two officers who responded to the scene . the area is largely residential , packed with one-story homes and small apartment complexes . in addition to the hospital , east bakersfield high school and the county coroner 's office are within two blocks of the intersection where david sal silva died . the kern county sheriff 's office has said it will not comment until the investigation is complete , but a news release says the incident began may 7 just before midnight . a deputy responded to a call that a man , later identified as silva , 33 , was lying on the ground , possibly intoxicated . silva was  uncooperative ,  according to the sheriff 's office , even after a canine was deployed .  the suspect continued to actively resist the deputy and the k-9 . additional deputies arrived on scene , along with two chp officers who responded to assist . the suspect continued to resist and received baton strikes from the deputies attempting to take him into custody ,  according to the sheriff 's news release . after silva was restrained , police requested medical assistance for his injuries , the release said . he was having trouble breathing and was taken across the street to the hospital .  while being treated at kmc , the suspect was pronounced dead at about 12:44 a.m. ,  the news release said . several witnesses have painted a more brutal picture , saying that silva was crying for help and officers continued to beat him until he fell silent . others have said they captured the incident on their cell phones . two of those witnesses hired attorneys after police confiscated their phones , kero reported . in a news release tuesday , the kern county sheriff 's office said that youngblood has requested the fbi 's help in analyzing  two cell phones pursuant to a search warrant related to the ... death of david silva .  it was not immediately clear which phones these are or what  forensic analysis  is being done , though the office did say that bakersfield police saw one of the phones on video from the incident , but not the other one . youngblood also asked the fbi to conduct a  parallel  investigation into the incident .  i think it 's the right thing for the public , and i think it 's the right thing for this organization ,  the sheriff told reporters tuesday . the only video released thus far is from a security camera , and the quality is poor . it appears to show two men scuffling for about two minutes before another man arrives . the two men appear to repeatedly hit the third man as he 's on his knees and later lying on the ground . police cars arrive and officers gather around the man on the ground , but their actions are n't clear . the video is grainy , and the blur of light and shadows makes it difficult to determine what is happening . witnesses told cnn they were awakened by the incident . one witness , who asked not to be identified , described a chaotic scene .  he was asking for help . he was screaming with pain . he only got to ask for help like three times ,  he said .  those hits were brutal .  sheriff donnie youngblood promised a fair investigation into the incident .  i 'm waiting till this investigation is done so i can look at it objectively and decide whether we did something wrong , and if we did , i 'll stand up and tell you that we did . if we did n't , i 'll stand up and tell you that we did n't ,
