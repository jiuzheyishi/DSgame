{"text": "kevin boyle 's mother patti , pictured today at court , has called for the prime minister to ban websites which sell ` suicide kits ' a mother has called on the prime minister to ban websites which promote ways of committing suicide which she blames for her son 's death . kevin boyle , 26 , beat more than 1,500 competitors to become one of the original apprentices at jamie oliver 's fifteen restaurant where he cooked for prince charles and oprah winfrey . but the talented cook had a history of mental illness and was found dead about two miles from his home in coulsdon , south london , in january last year , three months after going missing . his badly decomposed body was found with two notes and what is believed to be a suicide kit that had been bought for # 44 from a foreign company on the internet . at his inquest at croydon coroner 's court yesterday , kevin 's mother patti , 55 , described the paraphernalia bought from the website as ` death in a bag ' . the website has since been closed but she asked the coroner to write to david cameron urging him to ban similar websites still selling ` encyclopaedias to end life ' . she told the inquest of her heartache when she realised that a brown paper jiffy bag that she took delivery of for her son contained the tools for his death . at the time she thought it had contained cooking equipment . sitting next to her husband tom , 65 , . she said : ' i believe there is sufficient evidence to suggest that on the . balance of probabilities kevin committed suicide . ` we have the email exchanges ordering the kit and arranging payment . budding chef : jamie oliver with kevin boyle at the restaurant in hoxton . ` thomas . took delivery of the kit , i saw the brown jiffy bag i believe contain . the kit addressed to kevin , that bore no postage details or delivery . identification , delivered by an unidentifiable courier . ` paraphernalia consistent with these items was retrieved by officers inspecting the site where kevin was discovered . ' the site kevin bought the kit from . promised painless ` deliverance ' and required no proof of terminal . illness or psychiatric assessment , just a photocopy of kevin 's passport . mrs . boyle asked the coroner to take the unusual step of writing to the . government to take action in what is known as a rule 43 letter because . she wanted to lower the number of suicides in the uk . she . said : ` currently assisted suicide websites have thousands of pages that . offer advice , instruction and the whole wherewithal , almost like an . encyclopaedia of methodologies to end life . ' a young person who is overwhelmed able to look back and say  i 've come that far and i 'm stronger for it . patti boyle has called on the government to ban websites which promote ways of committing suicide . ` what . we want and seek the coroner 's assistance with is to bring the problems . of these websites back to government because we believe that the . internet service providers should be held responsible for the material they have . displayed and they are penalised for it . ` we also want legislation that bans the uk-based sites . ' so-called suicide websites have been linked to dozens of deaths in britain over the last ten years . promoting suicide is already outlawed under the 1961 suicide act , but this has never been used to prosecute a website operator . happy memories : kevin -lrb- centre -rrb- with brother joseph and father tom . mrs . boyle told the inquest it was kevin 's ` dream come true ' to work for . jamie oliver and that the channel 4 chef had been a constant support for . the family . and she described how the fifteen restaurant had helped keep her troubled son alive . she . said : ` he wanted to be a chef from the age of four years old . when he . was selected for jamie oliver 's it was all his dreams come true . full of promise : kevin as a toddler . ` jamie oliver and his team and everybody at fifteen have been constant in their support for us as a family . ` fifteen is like a lighthouse in a place of darkness , it offers people hope . when you are part of the fifteen family they never let you go . ` because of fifteen i can happily say that as a family we had our son for ten years longer than we otherwise would have done . ' no cause of death could be given because kevin 's body was in such a badly decomposed state when it was found , and the coroner returned an open verdict . coroner dr roy palmer warned of the difficulties in taming the internet but said he would write to the prime minister to ask him to look at the issue . he said : ` at the moment the government has not yet found a way of controlling the internet but i can understand your concerns and i 'm proposing that i should write . ' i hope some good will come of it but the internet is a creature that has grown and grown out of control . i do n't l know what is to be done but one should keep trying i 'm sure . ` i 'm very , very sorry you lost kevin in such circumstances . we ca n't give you complete answers because of the time delay and state of the body . ` the likelihood is that he probably did take his own life but i have to be sure beyond reasonable doubt and i ca n't be .
