{"text": "billy connolly had a theory . there were too many nuclear weapons in the world , he said , and not enough people being smacked in the mouth . boxing , by its very nature , resolves that . a lot of people get smacked in the mouth in boxing . yet it is not just the explosive small-scale violence that chimes with connolly 's world view . what he was getting at , one presumes , is that many of the great conflicts and calamities of our age could have been solved by low level direct action a lot earlier . if a right-thinking person had put benito mussolini on his backside in 1919 , do the fascists march on rome in 1922 ? simple : forget the great conflicts and rivalries , one punch was all it took on saturday night for carl froch . champion : the cobra defended his ibf and wba world super-middleweight titles after beating george groves . a good right-hander , as thrown by carl froch at wembley on saturday night , realigns even the most fervent uprising . and that reassessment was unavoidable once it landed . suddenly , george groves sat beside his conqueror for ringside interviews , a reduced , subdued , some would say broken figure . words were redundant now . all the truth that was needed came in that right-hander . it told its own story : who was the champion , the better fighter , the winner and better man . froch left groves lying on the wembley canvas like a character from the cartoon family guy . he fell as peter griffin falls : leg trapped beneath his body , arms splayed awkwardly . the difference being that griffin is animated with limitless possibilities for the effects of misadventure , while groves ' physical disorder was appallingly real . it was the doubled leg that offered the clue . nobody in command of his senses stays like that . referee charlie fitch knew groves was gone and called the contest off , immediately . and ended all speculation . floored : the way groves was knocked out at wembley was similar to peter griffin from family guy -lrb- below -rrb- . please : groves pleaded with the referee to let the fight continue but it was far too late ... he 'd blown it . connolly , tongue-in-cheek , imagined a swift , sudden end to confrontation , and froch delivered it . around the ring , supporters of both men were shouting the odds , debating the points , calling the shots . some had groves ahead , like one of the judges , but a good right-hander renders all previous notation or nuance irrelevant . who won the sixth ? suddenly , it did not matter . connolly thought a good punch might prevent the nuclear option , but there was something of the red button about the way froch finished this fight , too . he modestly stated that he was not a knockout puncher -- and not in a sly way of putting groves down , either , although it no doubt provoked an inner wince from those with affection for the londoner -- but one can not imagine many in the super-middleweight division , and a fair few heavier , that would have remained upright after that . it was a thing of beauty . each replay met with louder and louder gasps and groans from those watching wembley 's big screens . it put one in mind of lennox lewis 's knockout of hasim rahman in 2001 , another brutal right that ended a rematch , and a conversation . that 's got ta hurt : froch 's punch was a thing of beauty , similar to lennox lewis ' on hasim rahman in 2001 . before the fight , opinion was divided about whether lewis had the heart , the will , the ability to regain his crown . lewis hushed that talk in four , rahman struggling to get up like a zoo animal hit with a tranquiliser dart . froch said he had delivered blows as devastating , but not as momentous . ` the history of the fight , the way people will look back on it in years to come , that was the punch that finished it off , ' he said . ` in that way , it was probably the best punch i 've landed in my life . it closed the show , and that 's what world-class fighters do . ` my legacy was definitely at stake . my career was over if i lost tonight . i would have retired . this was the biggest post-war fight in britain and i did n't want to be remembered as the loser of it . so this was one of the most satisfying nights of my life . i 've had the weight of the world on my shoulders , i 've had george groves in my ear for a year . ` he was on at me before the mikkel kessler fight in may 2013 . i have n't heard the end of it . i knew within 48 hours of the first fight that this rematch had to happen . ' no other athletes are confronted with legacy talk like boxers . tough : the pair had to conduct post-match interviews after , with froch admitting his legacy was at stake . legacy : sir alex ferguson was an exception of those who would have to face the questions froch does . typically , only men like sir alex ferguson , three decades at the old trafford coal face , field questions about their standing in the pantheon . the day tiger woods retires , or usain bolt , it will be considered , too . yet all boxers are required to assess . froch is an outstanding fighter , among the best of his generation , yet he still dreams of a major fight in las vegas . there are two boxers out there , andre ward and gennady golovkin of kazakhstan , who would stand a good chance of defeating him . ward , an american , has already done it . perhaps that is why froch is respected stateside , but not revered . nevertheless , the legacy questions came . maybe , on a night when more than 80,000 filled wembley -- and more seats could have been sold were the public prepared to have their view entirely compromised -- it simply felt like a consequential occasion . froch may yet fight julio cesar chavez jnr in vegas , but he is 36 now . his place in british boxing history is assured and he is mindful of timing his farewell . nobody wants to leave a loser . one more ? froch may face julio cesar chavez jnr -lrb- or others -rrb- , his place in british boxing history is already assured . the future is uncertain for groves , but in a darker way . he was damned with faint praise by froch , who spoke of him as a future champion , but only if he learned to operate within his limitations . he needs to target a weaker belt-holder , seemed to be the message . ` it 's about levels , ' froch said . ` he 's not quite got the toughness that you need at the top . i 've got ingredients that you ca n't teach . if i fight george groves 10 times i 'll beat him 10 times . he 's got to prove to me he can take more than one punch like that . he 's missing the final ingredient , the ability to stand up against the top guys . i 'm not a one-punch man . i 'm not mike tyson . i 'm a concussion puncher , but i flattened him tonight . ' another moment of reflection , and he made the baying , brawling , boiling vat of humanity that spilled over on british boxing 's biggest night , suddenly seem a distant hum . ` when did i do it ? ' froch mused . ` round eight ? that 's another four-and-a-half rounds , 13 minutes or so . that 's a long time to be in front of me with them little gloves on . ' a lonely place , the ring . maybe that 's why mankind worked so hard to invent those big bombs . the hand-to-hand stuff was just too horrible .", "summary": " froch retains ibf and wba titles in rematch against groves on saturday .   the cobra knocked the challenger out in eighth round with right hand .   he left groves laying on the floor like he was peter griffin from family guy .   the punch that settled it was a thing of beauty .   similar to lennox lewis ' on hasim ramhan in 2001 .   froch will go down in british boxing history , regardless of any more fights .
