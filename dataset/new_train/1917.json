{"text": "on the lawn of a hotel garden next to the mediterranean , the blackening bodies of 53 people lay decomposing . some had their hands bound together , and bloodstains and spent rifle cartridges on the grass indicated they had been summarily executed where they fell . it was a scene from hell , but perhaps most chilling was the realisation that these were not victims of muammar gaddafi 's brutality . horror : corpses in the hotel gardenon the shore of the mediterranean . rather they were , the evidence would suggest , victims of the ` good guys ' , the supposedly democratic new friends of the west who have been ushered into power by britain , france and the u.s. for the bloodbath was in gaddafi 's stronghold of sirte , and although the perpetrators are unknown , triumphalist graffiti on the walls of the hotel proclaimed the names of five misrata-based fighting groups . arguably , they suffered the greatest losses , and possibly fought the most intense battles , during the bloody siege of libya 's third-largest city when gaddafi threw everything he had at crushing the revolution there . few of the young misrata fighters would not have witnessed friends and comrades dying in agonising circumstances . was this , a massacre at the mahari hotel in gaddafi 's home town , their terrible revenge ? there are growing concerns about possible war crimes by rebel fighters who helped to oust gaddafi and now regard themselves as above the law . deserted : sirte - the last gaddafi stronghold to fall to the rebels - has become an eerie ghost town . eerie : as the house where gaddafi hid stands in the background , a man walks in another part of sirte , where residents are slowly starting to return . the new york-based human rights watch yesterday demanded an inquiry into the atrocity at the hotel , warning of a ` trend of killings , looting and other abuses ' by those who triumphed over gaddafi thanks only to the support of britain 's armed forces and those of our allies . sirte residents have placed most of the bodies at the mahari hotel in bags and have been taking them away for burial . they identified four of the dead as ezzidin al-hinsheri , allegedly a former gaddafi government official , a military officer named muftah dabroun , and two sirte residents , amar mahmoud saleh and muftah al-deley . the state of decomposition suggests the victims died at the same time , between october 14 and 19 , says human rights watch . gruesome : burnt out cars and bodies of gadaffi bodyguards litter the area outside the libyan coastal town of sirte close to the drainage sewer from which gadaffi was dragged alive . hotel from hell : the entrance to the mahari hotel in sirte , where at least 53 people were apparently executed . scruffy : another picture inside the ville where gadaffi hid shows an untidy basement with mattresses scattered everywhere . reduced to rubble : inside the villa where gadaffi hid , a wall is knocked through , while outside a nearby building remains battered with a burnt out car parked by its entrance . most of them apparently fled district two , the neighbourhood where gaddafi was hiding , and some had bandaged wounds , suggesting they had been patients in sirte 's hospital at some stage . in district two , it is as if a hurricane of bullets and shrapnel has ripped through the town , tearing chunks out of buildings -- and people . bodies lie in the courtyards of homes and hundreds of thousands of spent rifle cartridges carpet every street . even the trees are shredded . sirte -- the last gaddafi stronghold to fall to the rebels -- is an eerie ghost town , but a few residents have begun returning . they stare in disbelief at the ruins of their homes , many of which seem to have been looted by the rebels . sewer capture : a picture shows the drainage sewer from which gadaffi was dragged alive , before meeting his death soon after . person effects : used cups , including a liverpool fc mug , are among the items found inside the villa where gadaffi hid for two weeks . one resident fumed : ` this war is not over yet . this war has only just begun . ' but others are in a state of shock rather than anger . muftah hassan , a 26-year-old engineer , said : ` not everyone here supported gaddafi , and we had no choice that he came to hide here . ` our homes have been wiped out and our friends and family lie dead in the streets . there was no need for this . ' his friend mohammed bashir , 27 , added : ` look at this place , at the bodies . it is an act of vengeance . ' human rights watch 's emergencies director , peter bouckaert , last night urged the transitional authorities to ` take action to rein in these groups ' . n gaddafi is expected to be buried today in an unmarked grave at a secret location , according to a rebel spokesman .", "summary": " growing concerns over possible war crimes by rebel fighters .   53 people shot dead at mahari hotel in sirte , gadaffi 's last stronghold .
