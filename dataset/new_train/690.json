{"text": "updated : . 13:31 est , 8 january 2012 . as the world marks the 20th anniversary of the soviet union 's demise at the end of 1991 , the u.s.-russian effort to lock up nuclear weapons and avoid a doomsday scenario has been revealed . soviet nukes falling into the hands of rogue states or terrorists has , as far as is known , remained fiction , despite occasional doubts about whether the system was airtight . the vast nuclear arsenal , scattered among several newly independent nations , was secured because russian military officers acted with professionalism and honesty , moscow and washington shared clear priorities , and the u.s. taxpayer coughed up billions of dollars , former top officials who dealt with the soviet nuclear legacy say . destroyed missiles : a worker cuts a soviet-made aviation cruise missile x-22 , able to carry nuclear charge , on the military base ozerne in zhytomyr , ukraine , in 2002 , it was one of the first to be destroyed . there 's the russian scientist who perhaps went to work for iran 's nuclear program , an old claim that portable nuclear devices went astray , the seizures of smuggled fissile material in the 1990s . but difficult though it is to prove a nuclear negative , u.s. and russian officials insist in interviews with the associated press that the fears of the 1990s have not become a reality , even though the challenges of safeguarding soviet nukes were daunting at the time . ` twenty years on it 's pretty hard to believe that not a single nuclear weapon has shown up loose , ' said graham allison , who played a key role in the effort as an assistant secretary of defense under president bill clinton and now heads harvard 's belfer center for science and international affairs . a quick u.s.-sponsored deal had belarus , ukraine and kazakhstan handing all their nukes over to russia , and american cash helped safeguard the weapons at a time when the new governments could n't even afford to pay military wages on time . additional u.s. incentives offered jobs to disgruntled nuclear scientists from the former soviet union , many of whom were courted by nations like iran . there have been gnawing fears that a few soviet nukes still might have gone missing , but experts with inside knowledge say that if it were true the world would already know . ` if somebody or a terrorist group got hold of a nuclear weapon , they would probably use it as quickly as possible , ' said steven pifer , who served as u.s. ambassador to ukraine , held other senior state department posts and is now director of the brookings institution 's arms control initiative . a ukrainian army officer looks at the destroyed ss-24 missile silo near the town of pervomaisk in ukraine 's nikolayev region in 2001 . ` so the fact that you have n't seen a nuclear detonation ... reflects the fact that the nuclear weapons have been maintained in a secure way . ' that was no mean achievement given the enormous proliferation risks posed by the soviet breakup . the economic meltdown of the early 1990s forced many officers of the once-proud soviet army to moonlight as security guards or even cab drivers . and with the wars and ethnic clashes triggered by the soviet collapse came strong incentives to steal weapons for the black market . the immediate task for the russian military was to quickly remove thousands of battlefield weapons such as nuclear artillery shells and land mines from other soviet nations . these relatively compact arms posed the biggest proliferation risk and often were stored close to areas of conflict . ` the military officers who did the job were the unknown heroes , ' said alexander golts , a russian independent analyst . ` it 's hard to imagine what might have happened if the tactical nuclear weapons had remained on the territories of the states involved in military conflicts . ' a museum employee in the russian federal nuclear centre , pictured in 1997 , showing the first soviet nuclear bomb , that was tested for the first time in 1949 . the next goal , strongly backed by washington , was to remove strategic nuclear weapons from belarus , kazakhstan and ukraine . the first two agreed quickly , but ukraine , which had inherited enough of the soviet arsenal to be the world 's third largest nuclear power , balked at the plan , setting the stage for years of diplomatic battles . a war for custody of nukes ? ` all this was quite terrifying , ' said allison . pifer said that some ukrainian officials longed to keep them , but around 1992 concluded their country had neither the money nor the expertise to remain a nuclear power . also , the world 's worst nuclear disaster had happened in 1986 at chernobyl , in ukraine , and public opinion was n't keen on keeping nukes . still , ukraine bargained for years for compensation in tough talks that sometimes made even seasoned diplomats lose their temper . ` there was a lot of pressure , they threatened us with all kinds of economic sanctions , they wanted to get this issue over with fast , ' leonid kravchuk , ukraine 's then president , told the ap . ukraine insisted the u.s. provide hundreds of millions of dollars to pay for safeguarding and dismantling the arsenal . from russia it demanded nuclear fuel as compensation for the highly enriched uranium in the warheads . and it wanted security guarantees from all the nuclear powers . ` we did n't want to get naked for free , ' kravchuk said . the world 's worst nuclear disaster had happened in 1986 at chernobyl -lrb- pictured in 1998 -rrb- , in ukraine , and public opinion was n't keen on keeping nukes . tensions over which country military officers in ukraine should swear allegiance to -- russia or ukraine -- also stoked tensions . in february , 1992 an entire squadron of combat jets flew from ukraine to russia after their pilots refused to take the oath . ukraine eventually got the money and security guarantees it was seeking , but the russians had other obstacles to overcome . for instance , the economy was so bad that the military struggled to pay wages on time , and top brass were reduced to struggling to give the strategic nuclear forces personnel better rations , said maj.-gen . -lrb- ret . -rrb- vladimir dvorkin , a nuclear weapons expert in the russian defense ministry in the early 1990s . control over the security of nuclear weapons never slackened , dvorkin said . ` people realised their responsibility because they were fully aware of the dangers . ' nuclear arsenals surrendered by former soviet republics had to be safely transported long distances to centralized storage sites and secured . dismantling missiles , bombers and submarines as required by the 1991 start treaty with the u.s. also required huge funds . ` russia badly needed assistance , ' dvorkin said , and the u.s. responded quickly with the cooperative threat reduction program initiated by sens. sam nunn and richard lugar , which provided billions of dollars in equipment and know-how to help russia and its neighbours deal with the soviet nuclear legacy . former u.s. president bill clinton speaking in moscow in 1998 , clinton played a key role in the efforts between the u.s. and russia to protect the weapons . ` it seems to me that nunn-lugar was one of the smartest uses of defense dollars we ever made , ' pifer said . under the program , the u.s. provided reinforced rail cars to carry nuclear warheads , high-tech security systems for storage sites and dismantling mothballed nuclear subs . ` the program provided colossal support , ' dvorkin said . building on their cooperation in securing the soviet nuclear arsenals , moscow and washington moved later to reduce the number of nuclear weapons held by both sides , most recently with the new start deal signed by presidents barack obama and dmitry medvedev that took effect last year . but while dvorkin says the military in russia and other ex-soviet nations kept tight control over atomic weapons , numerous civilian agencies were far less diligent in keeping track of nuclear materials at their disposal . ` fissile materials at nuclear power plants were controlled by one agency , and research reactors were in the hands of another one , ' he said . oversight at civilian structures was less stringent than in the military , creating conditions for a steady string of thefts of radioactive materials in the early 1990s , which were later seized by police in germany and other european nations . ` there were such cases , but they did n't entail catastrophic consequences , ' dvorkin said , noting that the amounts of uranium and plutonium seized in germany and elsewhere were extremely small , each measuring just a few grams . russian president dmitry medvedev -lrb- left -rrb- and us president barack obama at a ceremony to sign a new russian-us -lrb- start -rrb- nuclear arms reduction treaty in prague in 2010 . another major worry for the west was that scientists with nuclear know-how would be hired by unfriendly forces . the u.s. responded quickly by setting up research centers that distributed grants to scientists ` so that they can do civilian research and do it in russia and avoid the temptations perhaps to go to countries such as north korea and iran , ' pifer said . ` thousands of scientists participated in this project in russia and ukraine , so we know of thousands of people who stayed behind , ' he said . ` whether we got everybody , i do n't know . ' iran was working actively to attract scientists from russia and other ex-soviet lands , and the international atomic energy agency in a report released in november said a foreign expert helped iran on some of its alleged weapons-related experiments by working on ways to set off a nuclear blast through a sophisticated multipoint explosives trigger . diplomats identified him as former soviet scientist vyacheslav danilenko , who worked in iran for several years . despite the assurances from russian and u.s. officials that no soviet nukes got lost in the chaos of the post-soviet years , allegations occasionally surfaced that some of the weapons went missing . gen. alexander lebed , who headed russia 's security council for several months in 1996 , made the most stunning of such claims in 1997 , saying the military lost track of dozens of suitcase-sized portable nuclear devices . lebed issued several contradictory statements about the number missing , and russian officials rejected his claim . dvorkin said lebed , who died in a helicopter crash in 2002 , did n't know what he was talking about . ` i personally know people who were counting the weapons at centralised depots , and they have confirmed that nothing was stolen , ' he said . ` they did the check after lebed 's statements and made sure that everything was in place .
