' but . the administrators ' report reveals that the owners had already suffered . a disastrous catalogue of setbacks since first drawing up their plans . in 2007 . they hired staff and took guest bookings for christmas 2010 after the builders said the hotel would be ready in time . michelin star : but the well-regarded restaurant was not enough to stop the company going into administration . in fact it was not fit to open until april 2011 , and even then , further ` snagging ' problems meant that only half of the rooms could be used . as a result the hotel lost # 1.4 million in its first trading year . in addition , westminster council 's lengthy makeover of leicester square meant that ` builders ' materials and site waste was regularly found outside of the premises , and at times the only view from the restaurant windows was that of the construction works . ' the restaurant was also unable to use its outdoor seating terrace . tough economic conditions , exacerbated . by the ` negative impact ' on restaurants caused by the olympics , pushed . the hotel into insolvency on 19 october , after the directors decided . they did not want to provide any extra funding . involved : sarah lucas , left , and peter doig , right , also invested in the venture before its failure . the hotel is now out of administration under its new ownership . it has remained open and traded profitably since october , with occupancy rates close to 90 per cent . however , a # 2.98 million shortfall at st john chinatown ltd means the original shareholders are unlikely to get their money back . they also included gallery owner sadie coles , ceramicist jane hamlyn , american painter elizabeth peyton , littlewoods heir and art collector james moores , and writer guy kennaway . trevor gulliver said they were being ` very supportive ' despite the probable loss of their investments . he added : ` they are all grown ups , no one put in millions or hundreds of thousands . ' the rest of the st john restaurant group was unaffected by the administration , he said . ` everyone is quietly working through what has been a very difficult process to protect jobs and suppliers . the restaurant is still cooking well and the hotel is busy . it has improved the streetscape and it will still be a happy and successful building in 10 , 20 , 30 years time . ' the new owner is loh lik peng , a singaporean hotelier who also owns a venue converted from bethnal green town hall . he bought st john hotel for an undisclosed sum .", "summary": " top artists invested in fergus henderson 's st john hotel in the west end .   won michelin star but went into administration in october .   premises remain open but celebrity investors are set to lose their money .
