{"text": "russia and other major powers agreed to back plans by un envoy kofi annan to end the bloodshed in syria by forming a national unity government . the interim cabinet that could include government and opposition members but would exclude those whose participation would undermine it , according to diplomats . annan 's proposal for a political transition aimed at ending the 16-month conflict in syria is one of the main topics that russia , the other four permanent security council members and key players in the middle east will discuss at a meeting in geneva on saturday , sources close to discussions said . one diplomat , speaking on condition of anonymity , summarized annan 's proposal , saying the syria conflict can only end when all sides see a peaceful way to a shared future . the potential breakthrough came as turkey moved military hardware to the border after one of its plains was shot down . scroll down for video . peace plan : measures put forward by un envoy kofi annan , left , to end the bloodshed in syria under president bashar assad have received backing from russia and other major powers . annan made clear it was ` vital that any settlement be irreversible , with clear transition steps in fixed timeline , ' he said . ` these include establishing a transitional national unity government to create a neutral backdrop for transition , ' the diplomat said in his summary of annan 's plan . ` it could comprise present government members , opposition and others , but would need to exclude those whose continued participation or presence would jeopardize the transition 's credibility , or harm prospects for reconciliation and stability . ' the diplomat added that the idea of excluding certain people was clearly referring to syrian president bashar al-assad , though annan 's proposal does not explicitly say assad could not serve in a national unity government . that gives russia the option of insisting that assad be allowed to stay in power . ` the russians signalled to annan that they accept his transition plan , ' he said . several western diplomats confirmed his remarks , adding that all five permanent veto-wielding u.n. security council members backed it . carnage : the battered building of ikhbariya tv station after it was attacked by gunmen in the town of drousha , about 20 kilometers -lrb- 14 miles -rrb- south of damascus yesterday . damage : a man clears through the wreckage of the building as world powers continue to negotiate an end to the violence that has ravaged the country . another diplomat said russia 's acceptance of annan 's proposal , which he circulated to the five permanent security council members this week , did not mean it has abandoned assad . ` i 'm very sceptical , ' he said . ' i do n't see the russians giving up on assad . ' the russian mission at the united nations was not available for comment . annan made acceptance of his guidelines for a political transition for syria a condition for organising saturday 's meeting , which will include the u.s. , britain , france , russia , china , turkey , iraq , kuwait and qatar . it will not include iran or saudi arabia . russia has repeatedly said its supports annan 's idea of creating a ` contact group ' of powerful nations and regional players with influence on the syrian government or the opposition to push for an end to the violence in syria . several diplomats said russia 's acceptance of annan 's proposal appeared to signal a shift in its stance on syria . but it was not immediately clear if moscow 's support for the idea of a national unity government in principle meant that it was now abandoning assad , a staunch ally and key russian arms purchaser . the u.s. , britain and france have said that assad is responsible for the violence , which the united nations estimates has killed at least 10,000 people , is no longer fit to govern . russia and china , however , reject what they describe as western calls for ` regime change . ' a syrian rebel runs with his rifle as other fighters take their positions behind a wall during a clashes with the syrian forcess , at saraqeb town , in the northern province of idlib , earlier this week . rebel fighters run for cover during the clashes which have continued this week . a transition government appeared to be a step closer to ending the chaos as russia backed un plans . russia has repeatedly said it is not insisting that assad must remain in power at all costs , but that any decision on whether or not he should step down should come from the syrian people , not from outside pressure or military intervention , as happened last year in libya . u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton will attend a meeting this weekend to discuss the situation in syria . saturday 's meeting , which russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton will attend , will have to agree on the details of the political transition and the mechanisms for implementing it , diplomats said . annan , a former u.n. secretary-general , also wants saturday 's meeting to revive his moribund six-point peace plan that has failed to end the fighting between assad 's forces and an increasingly militarized opposition . the conflict has escalated in recent weeks . annan said the aim of the one-day talks was to identify measures to secure full implementation of his stalled peace plan and security council resolutions , including an immediate halt to all violence . the support for annan 's plans came after a convoy of around 30 military vehicles , including trucks loaded with missile batteries , arrived in turkey 's coastal town of iskenderun and deployed near the syrian border 50 km -lrb- 30 miles -rrb- away , turkish agencies said . turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan , who has given shelter in the border area to rebels fighting syrian president bashar al-assad , announced after syrian air defences shot down a turkish warplane last friday he would step up security there . turkish television film showed the column moving off on wednesday , escorted by police cars , along a narrow highway leading out of the main port of turkey 's hatay province . it included rocket launchers on transporters , anti-aircraft artillery and military ambulances . erdogan said any military element moving towards the turkish border and deemed threatening would be declared a military target . the preponderance of air defence weapons in the convoy suggested turkey was preparing for any possible approach by syrian helicopters or warplanes . state-run anatolia news agency said armoured military vehicles were being transported to military installations in sanliurfa , in the middle of turkey 's border with syria and hatay , a panhandle province that juts down into syria . it said several military vehicles had travelled separately to a military garrison in the border town of reyhanli in hatay . there have been no details given of new rules of engagement issued to troops after the shooting down of the warplane which turkey says was in international air space . the hatay region is sheltering over 33,000 refugees as well as elements of the rebel free syrian army .", "summary": " thirty turkish military vehicles deploy 50km from syrian border .   world leaders to meet in geneva on saturday to discuss peace plans .
