{"text": "in the future astronauts on missions to distant worlds like mars will print some of the tools they need and , maybe one day , even their food . now an important first step to realising that dream has been achieved , as nasa has made the first 3d-printed object in space . using a printer installed on the iss earlier this month , the crew created a calibration object and will eventually use it to make useful items . scroll down for video explanation . astronauts on the iss have printed the first 3d object in space -lrb- shown -rrb- . they used a printer built by california-based company made in space . it was taken to the iss in september by spacex 's dragon capsule . the demonstration is an important step to having ` replicators ' on future missions . the device was created by california-based company made in space , who were contracted by nasa to design it for the iss . called the 3d printing in zero-g technology demonstration , it aims to show the ` additive manufacturing ' technique can make 3d printed parts and tools in space . the first object that has now been printed was a faceplate engraved with the names of nasa and made in space written on it . 3d printers allow objects of any shape to be created from just a digital file . they work in an extremely simple way , by building up a 3d object from layers of material . like a traditional inkjet printer , material , usually plastic , is laid down on a base . further layers are simply printed on top , gradually revealing a 3d object . the technology is used in a huge range of industries from construction to aerospace . many believe it could even lead to ` mini factories ' for living rooms . allowing consumers to print anything they want - from a bracelet to a . replacement part for a broken household appliance . the printer was installed on the station by astronaut butch wilmore , in the station 's microgravity science glovebox , which is used for conducting science and technology experiments . the printer used plastic to form the first of a series of calibration coupons . it works by heating a relatively low-temperature plastic filament to build parts layer by later in designs supplied to the machine . the printer left earth in september 2014 on spacex 's fourth commercial resupply mission . about 20 objects will be printed in the next few weeks , and early next year they will be brought back to earth by the dragon capsule for analysis . nasa will study the objects to see how zero-gravity conditions affect the printing process , although from these early tests there seems to be few inhibitions , if any . ` when the first human fashioned a tool from a rock , it could n't have been conceived that one day we 'd be replicating the same fundamental idea in space , ' aaron kemmer , ceo of made in space , said in a statement . the printer was installed on the station by astronaut butch wilmore , in the station 's microgravity science glovebox -lrb- shown -rrb- , which is used for conducting science and technology experiments . the printer used plastic to form the first of a series of calibration coupons . the device was created by california-based company made in space -lrb- shown on parabolic flight -rrb- , who were contracted by nasa to design it for the iss . called the 3d printing in zero-g technology demonstration , it aims to show the ` additive manufacturing ' technique can make 3d printed parts and tools in space . according to the company , the presence of a 3d printer on the iss will allow hardware designs to be made on earth and then digitally beamed to the space station . physical objects can then be made in a matter of hours . ` this printer is a critical first step for in-space manufacturing , ' said jason crusan , director of nasa 's advanced exploration systems division at nasa headquarters in washington . ` additive manufacturing with 3-d printers will allow space crews to be less reliant on supply missions from earth and lead to sustainable , self-reliant exploration missions where resupply is difficult and costly . ` the space station provides the optimal place to perfect this technology in microgravity . ' and niki wekheiser , nasa 's 3d printer project manager , added : ` the goal of the first phase of printing is to verify that the 3-d printing process works the same in microgravity as it does on the ground . ` once we confirm that the process works , we will move to the second phase of printing which focuses more on the design and utilisation of the parts we print , which will ultimately lead to establishing an on-demand machine shop in space .
