{"text": "locals in a small pennsylvania town freed an elusive bear from a jar after it had been stuck on the young bruin 's head for at least 11 days . using only a rope and a flashlight , four central pennsylvania residents removed the plastic jar from the bear 's head on thursday night after going on a wild chase in the dark , according to the associated press and the press enterprise of bloomsburg . area residents spotted the 100-pound brown bear -- or bruin -- on june 3 with a red jar on its head but game wardens failed to track him down . rescuers said the bear was attracted to the jar because it seemed to once contain cooking oil . stuck : a young bruin , or brown bear , got stuck in a jar in central pennsylvania for at least 11 days . here , a young grizzly walks on the shoulder of a road in alaska . rescuers : a member of the impromptu bear-wrangling team spotted the bear after leaving a bar at the jamison city hotel . one of the rescuers owns the bar and another works as a bartender there . ` he put his head in , and had a problem , ' said mike jurbala , 68 , one of the members of the spontaneous rescue team . ` he 'd have died in a couple more days . ' jurbala saw the bear as he was leaving the bar at the jamison city hotel in benton , pa. , and called jeff hubler , one of the game wardens who had been trying to capture the bear for several days with a lasso . hubler , a local employee of the state game comission , joined jurbala and two other residents in capturing the bear . along with morgan laskowski , 22 , the hotel 's bartender , and jody boyle , the bar 's owner , hubler and jurbala followed the bear in the darkness . ` you knew where he was because you could hear him banging into things , ' jurbala said . after the ragtag group cornered the bear in a backyard , the frightened bruin fell into the local resident 's pool a couple of times , according to a report by the press enterprise . after a while , the four wrangled the bear into a position where hubler could safely pull off the jar . ' i thought ,  no one is going to believe us ,  ' laskowski said . boyle , laskowski 's mother , added the bear was stronger than it looked : ` you 'd think the bear would be weak , because it had n't eaten or drunk for a week , but it was strong . sticky situation : bears like this immature wild grizzly at polychrome pass in denali national park , alaska , commonly get stuck in jars and other human trash . this is n't the first time a bear has gotten in a sticky situation with a jar . a tiny bear cub in alaska got its head stuck in a plastic jug in march 2012 . a hiker used an ice ax to cut through a plastic container that likely would have killed the 10-pound bear he found on deer mountain in ketchikan , alaska , according to the anchorage daily news . ` his future was pretty said and done , ' the hiker , michael schuler , said of the cub . ` he was n't going to move . he probably would have lain there until he died . ' in july 2010 , a team with the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission saved a six-month-old black bear cub in central florida from a clear plastic container . the team had to tranquilize the cub 's protective mother so they could save him , according to the new york daily news . ` although the story appears to have a happy ending , ' the commission said of the incident . ` it truly illustrates one of the worst things that can happen when wildlife gets into garbage . ' hubler , the central pennsylvanian game warden , made a note of saying people should keep lids on jars they toss .", "summary": " four pennsylvania residents wrangled the frightened young bear using only a rope and a flashlight .   the 100-pound bear fell into a resident 's backyard pool at least twice during the rescue .
