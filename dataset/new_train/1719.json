' i remember sitting up in the stand there watching a game and i enjoyed the chance to go and play there because it was my first experience of english football . ` it is always nice to score at places where you have been and you were not able to make it . it 's not that you have a particular point to prove , you always have a point to prove in football , but it is nice .
