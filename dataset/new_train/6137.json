{"text": "a top swedish skier was hit by a baby elk after it smashed through his window together with entrails when the car hit its pregnant mother as he drove in oestersund in northern sweden . jesper modin said : ' i had just come over a hill and the sun was shining directly in my eyes , i only saw the elk when it was a few metres away and it was standing right in the middle-of-the-road . ` it hit the front of the car and then smashed into the windscreen and then the body of the elk went tumbling over the roof . i was completely covered in glass and the elk 's innards . ' jesper modin 's car was badly damaged when an elk ran out in front of his car in oestersund , northern sweden . the heavily pregnant elk smashed the bonnet , windscreen and roof , losing its stomach contents during the impact . moments after the horrific smash , mr modin noticed the elk calf in the passenger 's seat , still attached to its mother by its umbilical cord . miraculously the calf was still alive despite the trauma of the impact . the 25-year-old said that there was so much blood he was convinced he had been badly cut somewhere and had rushed to check himself , but found only a small cut on his hand . the elk however was dead . he said that he had not wanted to look too closely at the bloody mess inside the car but when the pick-up truck arrived to remove the wreckage and remove the body , he said he needed to go inside the vehicle to get some documents from the glove compartment . he said : ' i was about to grab some things from my glove compartment but when i opened the car door , i was shocked to see the was a little baby elk laying there and it was alive . the umbilical cord was still attached . i was so shocked that i slammed the door again . ' i thought to myself , did i really see what i think i saw ? ' a friend of his arrived seconds later and he decided to check again realised it was an elk calf and it was alive . they realised that modin had n't noticed the calf in the immediate aftermath of the crash , which he attributed in part to being in shock and in part to the car 's interior being completely covered in guts and glass . when the mother elk collided with the car , her stomach contents had emptied into the car , including her unborn calf . he added : ` people do n't believe me when i tell them what happened , they think it 's the weirdest thing they 've ever heard . but i just show them the pictures . ' he called the police , who in turn called in a wildlife expert who decided that the calf would not survive without its mother and killed it . . mr modin added : ` it 's a tragedy of course , and i wish i could say the elk survived too . but i 'm just happy i 'm alive , and so grateful to all the people who helped . ' mr modin said that he wished the calf could have been saved but he was lucky to have been alive himself following the crash . mr modin said people do n't believe him about what happened , until he shows them the photographs .", "summary": " jesper modin was blinded by the sun seconds before the collision .   his car struck the pregnant elk which forced out the calf which shot through the windscreen .   despite the impact , the calf was still alive but was later put down .   mr modin said he was struck by the calf and its mother 's entrails as they entered the car .   warning : graphic photographs .
