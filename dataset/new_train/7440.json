{"text": "a woman claims that hypnosis revealed she shot dead a farmer who she believes raped her - nearly 40 years ago . janet holt , 64 , has been questioned by police over her claim that she had buried the memories of the killing until she went for therapy decades later . her business partner fred handford , then 56 , vanished in 1976 . despite a huge police search he was never found . janet holt claims hypnosis revealed that she shot and killed farmer fred handford after he raped her in 1976 . the body of fred handford , pictured on ball beard farm in 1968 , has never been found . for more than 30 years miss holt , who worked with him at ball beard farm in buxton , derbyshire , had no clue what happened to him . but she had repeated unexplained nightmares about mr handford and underwent therapy to see if there was something locked deep in her mind . miss holt said the recollection was terrifyingly clear - she shot fred after he twice raped her , then put his body in a wheelbarrow and buried him on their farm . police arrested and interviewed her in 2011 after she went to officers and told them where she believed she buried the body . but after extensive searches of the 50-acre farm , he was never found and she was released . the case remains open . miss holt said : ` there are no words that i can use to describe how i felt when i realised what i had done . ` then suddenly there it was , stored in my own memory for 34 years . i killed fred handford . i was stunned . ' i could n't believe i 'd killed someone , i never would have thought i was capable of such a thing . ' i knew exactly what i had to do so i handed myself in to the police . i believe he is there and that the police just have n't found him . ` obviously i do n't want to go to prison but justice would have to take its course . i want fred 's remains found . ' miss holt was 26 at the time of mr handford 's disappearance . she had worked on the farm since she was 14 and says he was like a father to her . janet holt , left , and fred handford , right , were business partners on ball beard farm in buxton , derbyshire , before his 1976 disappearance . miss holt believes she put mr handford 's dead body in a wheelbarrow and buried him on ball beard farm in buxton , derbyshire . one morning , she woke up to find that he was missing and she had no memory of the past four days . she said : ' i knew something was wrong when i saw my muddy wellington boots by my bed , as i would never have dragged all that mud through the house . ' i felt delirious and when i found out fred was missing i was beside myself wondering where he had gone . ` but never in my wildest dreams did i think i 'd have hurt him . i took my mother to the farm with me . fred was nowhere to be seen . ' i called his name and looked for him in the farmhouse . ` it was unlike fred to leave the farm apart from when he visited his sister . so , i called her and she said he was n't there . ` my mother and i waited a few hours for fred to return but after a while we became worried and we called the police . ' fred handford was like a father to janet holt , she said . janet holt had worked on the farm for 12 years before mr handford vanished in 1976 . mr handford was officially declared missing . miss holt was interviewed by police but released without charge . she said : ` those four blank days always bothered me but i never thought i had anything to do with fred 's disappearance . ` the nightmares i had were extremely vivid and utterly terrifying . it got to the point where they were causing me to be depressed . ' i never saw fred in the dreams but i often thought of him and wondered about what had happened to him . ' miss holt then heard of eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing , a form of psychotherapy called that is used to bring back memories and eliminate trauma . a 1976 report on the story in the manchester evening news detailed the hunt for mr handford , described as 5ft 10in , slim , with a scar on the right temple . neighbouring farmers told the paper that he never went anywhere without his horse and cart , dog and hat , which had been left behind . another newspaper report described how rescuers searched the nearby moorland for mr handford . she said : ' i went to a psychologist 's office . she talked me through the therapy , which involved me trying to relive the lost four days of my life and moving my eyes from side to side to stimulate the memories . ' miss holt said remembered everything after four hours of intense therapy . she said : ' i remembered that four days before his disappearance , fred had raped me twice . i had clear visions of the attack , and how i was preparing to leave the farm for good . ` for days i ignored fred and never went back to the farm . i did n't want to see him . ` but one afternoon after the attack i walked to the nearby stables to feed my ponies and found a note pinned to the door . janet holt has written the stranger in my life about her experiences . ` it read ,  i 'm sorry . please look after the animals  . ' i remembered clutching the note and panicking , thinking that fred may have killed himself because of the guilt of raping me . ` that night i was in such a state of upset and panic . i did n't know what to do with myself . ` the next morning i woke up and went to the farmhouse . ` when i got there fred was standing in the kitchen and laughing , saying ,  i knew that note would get you here  . ` he told me to sit down at the kitchen table , and he turned his back to me to put the kettle on . i was petrified thinking he was going to rape me again . ` out of the corner of my eye i saw fred 's shotgun propped up against the wall . ` fred was always telling me not to touch the gun because it was loaded . ` without thinking i grabbed hold of it . ' i took aim at fred whilst he still had his back to me and i shot him once in the back . ` it was the oddest feeling . i had mourned for my friend for more than 30 years without knowing that actually he was a rapist and i was a killer . ' i wished i had remembered at the time and confessed and got on with my life . ` the nightmares and uncertainty have been horrendous . ' miss holt has written a book - the stranger in my life - about her experiences . sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .", "summary": " janet holt , 64 , claims she killed farmer fred handford , then 56 , in 1976 .   decades on , she underwent intensive therapy which brought memories back .   she claims she shot and buried mr handford on ball beard farm in buxton .   extensive police searches have not found his body and case remains open .
