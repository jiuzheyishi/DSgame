{"text": "whenever you find yourself complaining of a cricked neck , aching back or noisy knees , do n't immediately blame your office chair or an over-enthusiastic zumba class -- it could be down to your clothes . tight trousers and pencil skirts can damage muscles and joints as much as high heels and heavy bags , leaving you in pain . here , chiropractor tim hutchful , from the british chiropractic association , highlights the worst wardrobe offenders . pencil skirt . the problem with straight sided , slim-fitted skirts is that they clamp your knees together , making it difficult to balance and bend . squatting to pick something up from a low drawer or shelf becomes difficult , too . ` the best way to crouch safely is to bend the knees , ' mr hutchful says . ` but , in a pencil skirt your movement is limited . over time the damage and strain can become cumulative -- you might not feel anything straight away , but if you wear tight skirts regularly , you could be setting yourself up for a pulled muscle or even disc problems . ' heavy necklace . the muscles , tendons and joints of the neck struggle to cope with the strain of balancing the 10 lb to 12 lb weight of the average head -lrb- equivalent to five bags of sugar -rrb- all day , so adding a heavy necklace can tip the balance . ` anything that pulls the neck forwards or backwards tips the head away from its point of neutral balance , ' says mr hutchful . ` this can create neck tension , pain and damage , and long-term could encourage a slouched posture with damaging consequences for the back . ' spanx . if it 's not too tight , and contains plenty of lycra , support underwear can have a surprisingly beneficial effect because it can act like the compression clothing that top athletes wear to improve performance by increasing blood and lymphatic flow . however , wedge yourself into something too constricting and you could be in trouble . not only will shapewear restrict breathing but , if it is tight enough to limit movement in the middle of your body , it will put abnormal loads on parts of your spine . ` if you restrict movement in one part of the spine , something has to compensate , ' he says . ` this can trigger pain and ultimately damage in the upper or lower back . ' high heels . wearing high heels too often can be bad for your feet and bad for your back . as well as triggering hammer toes and bunions , heels can cause the calf muscles to shorten , which can lead to circulation problems , knee damage and back pain . to minimise damage , keep high-heel time short -- wear trainers when walking to and from work and stick to a small heel when possible . also , alternate your shoe wardrobe , wearing different shoes -lrb- and heel heights -rrb- every day . halter neck top . a halter-neck bra , bikini , or tightly fitted top can pull the neck forwards particularly if the strap around your neck has to support a large or heavy bust . ` the strain on your neck will create muscle tension and can pull you in to a highly damaging form of posture called  anterior carriage  where the neck sticks forwards on the body , with the shoulders rounded and slumped , ' says mr hutchful . this is a common cause of neck , upper back and shoulder pain . ill-fitting bra . a large bust needs more support than can usually be offered by a pretty , lacy bra . ` the thin straps of a fashion bra can put too much pressure on the shoulders , ' says mr hutchful . try to find bras with thick straps for everyday use and wear racer-back sports bras whenever possible to spread the strain across your shoulders . oversized bag . we 've long known the danger of lugging a huge bag on one shoulder , but the victoria beckham-inspired trend for ` displaying ' your designer purchase in the crook of your forearm could not be worse . this one-sided weight-lifting can increase the risk of muscle strain and pain in the neck , shoulders and upper back -- and can even trigger tension headaches . carrying a large bag over your shoulder is no better , particularly if you always use the same shoulder . do n't overfill your bag -lrb- ` do you need a litre of water ? ' asks mr hutchful -rrb- , hold it by the handle , or over one shoulder , switching sides regularly . skinny jeans . jeans that grip tightly around the waist , hips , thighs and calves can make a normal walking action impossible . ` if you are n't able to take a bouncing stride , you lose the shock-absorbing qualities of a natural walk , ' says mr hutchful . ` this can create undue pressure in the joints . ' wearing a tight belt could exacerbate the problem , triggering leg pain . and do n't sit for long periods with your phone in your back pocket , the imbalance caused by having one buttock higher than the other could cause back and hip pain . for more information see chiropractic-uk . co.uk .", "summary": " if you have a bad neck , aching back or noisy knees it could be your clothes .   tight trousers and pencil skirts can damage muscles and joints .   high heels and heavy bags leave you in pain .   chiropractor tim hutchful highlights the worst wardrobe offenders .
