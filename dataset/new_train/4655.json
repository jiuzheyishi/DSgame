{"text": "the millennials are growing up , but they are not growing out of their liberalism . the generation born since 1981 is the age group most likely to vote democratic . the eldest of them are in their 30s now , and they continue to be much more liberal than previous-age cohorts at the same point in their lives . a big new survey by the pew research center seeks to understand why . its report carries political warnings for conservatives -- and some larger warnings for us all . the warning for conservatives is : millennial attachment to the democratic party is not a phase . millennials are far less likely to be religiously affiliated than their elders . they are more likely to have children outside marriage -lrb- 47 % of their children are born outside marriage , compared with only 35 % of generation x children in 1996 -rrb- . they are poorer than their predecessor generations at the same point in their life cycles . despite facing higher levels of unemployment and student loans , millennials stand out -- in pew 's phrase --  as the nation 's most stubborn economic optimists .  a majority expect that they will earn enough money in the future to live the lives they want . let 's hope their dreams come true . but looking at the demographic and economic statistics , that 's not the way to bet . what then ? here 's a generation detached from religious institutions and only weakly attached to the country : only 49 % of millennials describe themselves as patriotic , compared with 64 % of the next older cohort and 75 % of baby boomers . millennials are alienated . what will happen if they feel disappointed as well ? one prediction about their future is already coming true : the millennial generation will be a generation characterized by high levels of inter-ethnic political conflict . among the young as among the old , political preferences are cleaved by race and ethnicity . one obvious example : non-white millennials approve of president obama 's job performance by a 2-1 ratio . white millennials disapprove by almost the same margin . by a margin of 52 % to 39 % , white millennials prefer a smaller government that offers fewer services to a bigger government that offers more . non-white millennials say the opposite by a margin of 71 % to 21 % . these numbers show a racial gap about the same as among the older cohorts . however , since non-whites make up a bigger portion of the millennials than in older generations , their overwhelming preference for a more activist government will sway future elections even more than recent ones . good news for liberals ? maybe . but maybe not . since john f. kennedy 's clarion  ask not ,  liberals have tried to call americans to a politics of common purpose . the continuing sharp divide between the politics of the country 's dwindling white former majority and its emerging non-white new majority may portend that common purpose will recede even further out of reach than ever . a quality of millennials that leaps out from the survey is their deep mistrust of other people . in response to the question ,  generally speaking , would you say that most people can be trusted or that you ca n't be too careful in dealing with people ,  just 19 % of millennials say most people can be trusted , compared with 31 % of generation xers , 37 % of the silent generation and 40 % of boomers . pew hypothesizes that this low level of trust is a consequence of the economic vulnerability of the milllennial generation :  people who feel vulnerable or disadvantaged for whatever reason find it riskier to trust because they 're less well-fortified to deal with the consequences of misplaced trust .  yet there 's another -- and more ominous -- explanation lurking in the numbers . robert putnam of  bowling alone  fame has collected data showing that social trust declines as a community becomes more ethnically diverse .  the short run effect of being around people who are different from us is to make all of us uncertain -- to hunker down , to pull in , to trust everybody less . like a turtle in the presence of some feared threat , we pull in .  in other words , in a more diverse society , it 's not just those who feel vulnerable who trust less . in a more diverse society , everybody trusts less . the clarion call of common purpose begins to sound more like a warning alarm that your group is about to be used for the benefit of another . the accusation that the -lrb- non-white -rrb-  takers  are plundering the -lrb- white -rrb-  makers  has powered protest politics since 2009 . if anything , that accusation looks likely to increase in its political effect in the years ahead . as america has become more ethnically diverse , political leaders have insisted ever more persistently that this diversity is a source of strength . let 's hope that proves to be true . america will need that strength in a future that , by the number , seems likely to be more mutually suspicious , more alienated , more unequal and less united by patriotism .", "summary": " a pew report says millennials are most likely to vote democratic .   david frum : survey indicates that they are less trusting , patriotic , more alienated .   some say social trust declines as a community becomes more ethnically diverse .   frum : as u.s. becomes more ethnically diverse , will diversity be a source of strength ?
