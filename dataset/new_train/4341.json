{"text": "can graphic design help protect your privacy ? sang mun , a designer and former nsa contractor , thinks so . just months after edward snowden controversially lifted the lid on digital surveillance being conducted by the u.s. and other governments , the issue of online privacy is back in the spotlight . earlier this month facebook ceo mark zuckerberg expressed concern that users ' trust in internet companies had been damaged by the revelations . google 's eric schmidt also called for greater transparency from the u.s. government over surveillance . sang mun 's response was more direct -- the korean designer has created four new fonts called zxx that aim to disrupt the optical character recognition -lrb- ocr -rrb- systems used by google and others to analyze text . zxx type specimen video from sang mun on vimeo .  i decided to create a typeface that would be unreadable by text scanning software -lrb- whether used by a government agency or a lone hacker -rrb- ,  mun told cnn via email ,  misdirecting information or sometimes not giving any at all .  mun , who worked with the nsa during his time in the korean military , says that a number of global developments motivated him to act :  the news about the nsa secretly building the country 's biggest data center ; the house passing the controversial cyber intelligence sharing and protection act -lrb- cispa -rrb- ; the social network media accumulating abundant information on every individual 's life ; google announcing its work-in-progress glass project -- and the list goes on .   sometimes these ideas about privacy can feel large and abstract to the average person . i thought that addressing these issues through the design of a typeface -- a building block of language and communication -- would bring home the conversation to the average person ,  mun says . the four different fonts -- camo , false , noise and xed -- were developed through a rigorous process of drawing and testing , mun says :  the challenge was to make the ocr legible typeface illegible to computer vision , while keeping it readable to the human eye .  each font uses a different optical trick to make them difficult to scan : ` camo ' adds camouflage-like patterns over letters , ` noise ' overlays the letters with dots , ` xed ' puts a neat x across each character , and ` false ' uses a small letter beneath a larger ` false ' one . matthew green , research professor of computer science at johns hopkins university , says that of the four different fonts , ` false ' could be most promising , but that in his view camouflaged fonts are not terribly effective at protecting people 's privacy :  for standard optical character recognition that 's tuned to read traditional typefaces and handwriting , yes , i think -lrb- these fonts -rrb- will be confusing ... but if the nsa really wants to detect this data ? not really . the problem here is that the fonts do n't appear to be randomized , which means every time i type the letter ` a ' i 'll get the same letter . to an ocr program these letters are just shapes . the funny-looking a shape is no more difficult to detect than a real a shape .  ross anderson , professor in security engineering at the university of cambridge computer laboratory , shares green 's criticisms :  i do n't think any of this is more than privacy theater . the fonts could probably be broken .  mun concedes that the fonts ' actual effectiveness may be limited , but that he hopes they will alert people to the issue of digital surveillance :  zxx is a call to action , both practically and symbolically , to raise questions about privacy . intercepting and storing world citizens ' words and thoughts is simply a vulgar intrusion on our daily lives ... it 's our duty to call out crimes against democracy .  sang mun 's fonts are available for download here . ross anderson 's font can be found here .", "summary": " designer sang mun creates ` unhackable ' fonts .   the four fonts are designed to disrupt optical character recognition software .   experts suggest that to be effective such fonts would need to be used with encryption .
