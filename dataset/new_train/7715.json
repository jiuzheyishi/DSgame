{"text": "concerned : mr milburn , the government Â¿ s independent reviewer on social mobility , accused medicine and other professions of failing to attract disadvantaged students . youngsters from poorer backgrounds should be given plum jobs in the professions over those who went to private schools , the government 's social mobility tsar said yesterday . former labour cabinet minister alan milburn also suggested that companies recruiting for such roles should be made to publish audits of where their employees went to school . this would shame them into offering the jobs to those who went to state schools . mr milburn said the professions were still a ` closed shop ' dominated by the elite classes . ` kids from disadvantaged backgrounds ... with no family history in a profession , should get a fair crack of the whip , ' he said . ` if you have been a child from a really good school in a disadvantaged area , from a family with no history of university education , -lsb- who -rsb- managed to get two as and a b , you have worked pretty hard for it . i am not saying if you have gone to eton and you get three a * s you have not had to work hard , but there is a difference . ' however , senior tory mp david davis said the decline in social mobility and employment prospects for poorer youngsters was at least partly due to the widening gulf between the quality of education at state and independent schools . he said the last labour government , of which mr milburn was a leading member , had a ` lot to answer for ' with respect to that division . must try harder : mr milburn says the medical . profession has failed to make any great galvanising effort to open up . doors to disadvantaged students . mr davis added : ` there is a strong link between the demolition of grammar schools and the decline in social mobility . only one in five children regardless of their background were able to go to grammar schools but that is better than nothing . ' with an extra 1.2 million white collar roles expected to be created in the next decade , mr milburn insisted no one should be ` thrown out of a job ' to accommodate disadvantaged candidates . but he added that those from privileged backgrounds had to remember ` there are no guarantees in life ' . he said social background audits could work because ` rather like a race and gender issue , when you find a spotlight in that way and you have the data available , people will be pretty horrified by what they see ' . david davis said the decline was due to the widening gap between state and social mobility . managers would ask their staff what sort of school they went to , what their parents ' background was and whether they received benefits or free school meals . mr milburn warned in a report , fair access to professional careers , that the next generation of young professionals was becoming a ` mirror image ' of the privileged elite that had gone before . the report showed that 41 per cent of law undergraduates , 57 per cent of medical students and 49 per cent of journalism students came from ` the highest socio-economic groups ' . mr milburn said : ` this is social engineering on a grand scale . the senior ranks of our professions are a closed shop . if social mobility is to become anything other than a pipe dream , they will have to open up . ' the report also found that children who attend the best schools were overwhelmingly most likely to get into top universities , which puts them at the front of the queue for plum jobs . mr milburn , the independent reviewer on social mobility , said some middle-class graduates were also locked out of the job market and internships because their families did not have ` the right connections ' . he dismissed suggestions that the decline of grammar schools under his government had made social mobility worse , saying that they only helped ` a few ' pupils .", "summary": " alan milburn says firms would be shamed into giving roles to those from state schools .
