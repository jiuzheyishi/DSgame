' panstarrs has already been visible to observers in the southern hemisphere for some weeks , but appeared in northern skies for the first time in the past few days . yesterday mailonline published pictures of the comet blazing a trail through the skies over las vegas and southern california and , in coming weeks , observers at ever higher latitudes will have a chance to see it . currently a mere 93million miles away , it is now heading away from our solar system and is not expect to return for another 100,000 years . however , it will be visible in the northern hemisphere for the next few weeks , just after sunset in the west . just dropping by : currently a mere 93million miles away , the comet is now heading away from our solar system and is not expect to return for another 100,000 years . to find panstarrs in uk skies , stargazers will need a clear sky , ideally be away from the lights of towns and cities and have a good western horizon , according to the royal astronomical society . after sunset the comet will appear as a misty patch not far from the crescent moon , low down in the western sky . searching for panstarrs through binoculars is recommended , and it will help to see the tails which should be pointing upwards from the horizon . it will be visible for the next couple of weeks , but as the nights pass the comet will move away from the sun and fade and light from the moon will interfere more . panstarrs ' name is an acronym for the . hawaiian telescope used to spot it two years ago - the panoramic survey . telescope and rapid response system . the . volcano-top telescope is on constant prowl for dangerous asteroids and . comets that might be headed our way . - and in recent months there have . been several . like other . comets of its type , panstarrs is thought to have originated in the oort . cloud , a vast region containing millions of comets located more than two . light years from the sun . panstarrs . travelled in towards the inner solar system for millions of years , . dormant for most of this time as a small nucleus made up of rock and . ices . when comets approach . the sun , these ices heat up , eventually turning to gases that jet out . into space together with dusty material to form a head or coma around . the cometary nucleus . particles . from the sun -lrb- the so-called solar wind -rrb- blow the gases back in a . straight tail , whilst sunlight exerts a pressure on the dust particles . to create a curved tail . spot the comet : to find it in uk skies , stargazers will need a clear sky , ideally be away from the lights of towns and cities and have a good western horizon , according to the royal astronomical society . to . find it in uk skies , stargazers will need a clear sky , ideally be away . from the lights of towns and cities and have a good western horizon , . according to the royal astronomical society . ` after sunset the comet will be low . down in the west and appear as a misty patch not far from the crescent . moon , ' an ras spokesman said . ` using binoculars will make it easier to find and will certainly help identify the tails which should point up from the horizon . ` as the days pass , the comet will move away from the sun and fade and light from the moon will interfere more . ` at the same time however , panstarrs will be higher up , will be visible later in the night and so be seen in a darker sky . ` after . its brief period of visibility , the comet will travel back out towards . the depths of space where it will be only be detected by large . telescopes .
