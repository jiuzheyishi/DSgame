{"text": "mystery has surrounded the death of yuri gagarin , the first man to journey into space . yuri gagarin made history in 1961 when , aged just 27 , he became the first man to journey into space . his single earth orbit on april 12 lasted 108 minutes and was one of the soviet union 's most enduring cold war victories . seven years later , the russian cosmonaut was killed in a crash during a training flight - an event that has been shrouded in mystery ever since . among the conspiracy theories were that he was murdered on the orders of soviet leader leonid brezhnev for an unspecified offence or disloyalty to the party ; gagarin had committed suicide ; or that the plane had actually hit a ufo . kremlin archives declassified in early 2011 concluded that his mig jet had swerved to avoid a weather balloon , causing the plane to go into a tailspin and hit the ground , killing him instantly . but after 40 years of secrecy , the real cause of gagarin 's death can be revealed , courtesy of fellow cosmonaut aleksey leonov . leonov , who was the first man to make a spacewalk , in 1965 , had been part of an official committee set up to investigate the accident . more importantly , he had been there on that fateful day in march . and now , following the release of a . newly declassified report - which leonov has been allowed to make public - . the 79-year-old can finally reveal the actual chain of events ; something . he has wanted to do for 20 years . seen here in 1963 are yuri gagarin -lrb- centre -rrb- with soviet communist party first secretary nikita khrushchev . five years later , the russian cosmonaut died in a crash during a training flight . aleksey leonov , who was the first man to make a . spacewalk , in 1965 -lrb- pictured -rrb- , had been part of an official committee set up to . investigate the accident . more importantly , he had been there on that . fateful day in march when gagarin 's mig went into a tailspin after apparently hitting a weather balloon , and crashed to the ground . ` that -lsb- original -rsb- conclusion is believable to a civilian , not to a professional - but in fact , everything went down differently , ' leonov told russia today . he explained that an unauthorised su-15 fighter jet was flying dangerously close to gagarin 's aircraft . leonov said : ` in this case , the pilot did n't follow the book , descending to an altitude of 450 metres . ' i know this because i was there ; i heard the sound and talked to witnesses . ` while afterburning , the aircraft reduced its echelon -lsb- plane formation -rsb- at a distance of 10-15 metres in the clouds , passing close to gagarin , turning his plane and thus sending it into a tailspin -- a deep spiral , to be precise -- at a speed of 750 kilometres per hour , ' he told the russian website . leonov was well-placed to give such testimony . he had overseen parachute jump training at chkavlovsky airfield , northeast of moscow - from where gagarin had set out . at this point in his career , gagarin was deputy training director of the cosmonaut training centre and was starting out as a fighter pilot again -lrb- as he had been in 1960 -rrb- . after being allowed to make public his remarks after a newly declassified report was released , leonov revealed that an unauthorised su-15 fighter jet -lrb- file picture , above -rrb- was flying dangerously close to gagarin 's aircraft . it was this that caused his plane to go into a spin and crash . above , a statue of gagarin outside the british council 's headquarters in central london . major yuri gagarin at a reception at earls court for the soviet trade exhibition . due to bad weather , leonov had been awaiting official confirmation that exercises would be cancelled that day , march 27 . he then heard a supersonic sound followed by an explosion seconds later . reports of the calamity , near the village of novoselovo , soon filtered back to the base . leonov formed part of the state commission investigating the accident - and after finally gaining access to it , he discovered a litany of distorted facts . even though his comments had his name attached , they had been written by someone else . ` marked here was a sonic spike , a blast , followed by one-and-a-half or two seconds of supersonic noise ... so , when i looked at the copy , i suddenly noticed that it stated this noise interval to be 15 to 20 seconds long instead of the two seconds that i had reported . ` that suggested that the two jets must have been no less than 50km apart , ' he told rt. . leonov knew that gagarin 's jet had plunged for 55 seconds at a speed of 750km , and made his own calculations . ` we used a computer to figure out a trajectory that would relate to this interval of 55 seconds . and it turned out to be a deep spiral . now , a jet can sink into a deep spiral if a larger , heavier aircraft passes by too close and flips it over with its backwash . ` and that is exactly what happened to gagarin . that trajectory was the only one that corresponded with all our input parameters . ' however , there remains one further question - who was the other pilot ? the man responsible for the death of gagarin is still alive , aged 80 , and in poor health . but as part of the deal of him going public , leonov has been sworn to secrecy , and has promised never to reveal his identity . yuri gagarin as a student at saratov industrial college in 1955 . the 19 candidates selected for the vostok-1 flight were all test pilots , unafraid of speed , and slight enough in build to fit into the tiny 2m-wide -lrb- 6ft -rrb- capsule . the soviet-era charm of gagarin 's humble roots may have favored him over others , including his backup gherman titov . born in the village of klushino , some 150km -lrb- 95 miles -rrb- west of moscow , gagarin 's father was a carpenter and his mother a milkmaid . the family was forced to live in a tiny mud hut when the village was burned down during the german occupation in world war two . ` yura -lrb- gagarin -rrb- was a very quick learner . he assimilated everything new . his mind was stellar , ' veteran soviet space journalist vladimir gubarev said . gagarin sung soviet hymns during the last checks , strapped atop the 30m-high -lrb- 98 ft -rrb- rocket that would blast him into space from the long-secret baikonur cosmodrome on the kazakh steppe . ` poyekhali ! -lrb- let 's go ! -rrb- , ' he cried , in a phrase that has become synonymous with gagarin in russia . ` the most emotional moment was when we heard he was walking and waving ; his arms and legs were whole . ` we understood in one sigh that our five to six years of hard work had paid off and we had achieved something huge , ' veteran cosmonaut georgy grechko said . the united states responded 10 months later , when john glenn made the first u.s. orbital flight . the vostok 1 capsule and the spacesuit worn by yuri gagarin .", "summary": " original report : ` his mig hit weather balloon , went into tailspin and crashed '   eye witness aleksey leonov , first man to walk in space , reveals truth .   leonov was part of soviet probe into 34-year-old gagarin 's death .   another plane was involved - at a much closer proximity to that suggested by the kremlin - but pilot responsible , who is still alive , is granted anonymity .
