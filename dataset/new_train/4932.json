{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- income inequality is like the weather : everyone talks about it , but no one does much about it . now comes president obama in his state of the union address , hoping to do more than just talk about it . the president tackles this perennial conundrum by proposing that the tax code be changed in two very distinct directions : 1 -rrb- provide extra money to low - and middle-income families in the form of tax credits for children and working couples . 2 -rrb- raise taxes on upper-income taxpayers , especially the fabled  one percent  through various cutbacks and increased restrictions on savings . it is certainly easy to dismiss his suggestions given the makeup of the new congress , which is controlled by republicans , but stranger concoctions have been enacted when major tax overhauls are undertaken . so what does the president suggest ? first , he wants to triple child care tax credits for children under age 5 , thereby supercharging an existing provision that republicans and conservatives have generally championed to make the tax system more  family-friendly .  second , he proposes a $ 500 tax credit for married couples when both spouses are employed , an idea that essentially replicates a provision that was enacted during president ronald reagan 's first year . the majority party in congress may not be particularly enthralled with president obama 's caveat that this credit phase out when a family 's annual income reaches $ 120,000 , but such parameters can be negotiated as legislation gets developed . the tax changes on upper-income taxpayers are more likely to generate partisan resistance . as a general matter , republicans want to lower or even eliminate taxes on capital gains , and this position has been party dogma since the first bush administration . in contrast , president obama proposes to raise taxes on capital gains received by married couples with incomes exceeding $ 500,000 per year . that income level may be above most people 's conception of  middle class ,  but it is far below what it takes to be a  one-percenter .  nevertheless , if one wants to address anomalies like warren buffett and mitt romney paying lower effective tax rates than their employees , then raising tax rates on capital gains is a necessity . but president obama goes much further and attacks the so-called  step-up in basis  rule -- which the white house calls the  trust fund loophole  -- that allows gains on inherited property to go untaxed , regardless of amount . targeting this longstanding tax rule takes aim not at those who have worked hard to create businesses and build wealth , but at those whose pathway to riches was having the right relatives . obama 's proposal , in other words , seeks to reduce wealth disparities without disincentivizing the job creators among us . along these lines , he also proposes that no tax be due on inherited family-operated businesses until they are sold . that said , this proposal is no slam dunk . as recent battles over the estate tax have demonstrated , americans do not particularly like the federal government claiming to level the proverbial playing field by confiscating family wealth . surveys repeatedly show that resentment of the rich is simply not as strong as some politicians seem to believe . in any case , the  step-up in basis  rule was effectively repealed in 1976 , but congress then responded to the ensuing backlash by reversing this repeal retroactively . nearly two decades later , an effort very similar to president obama 's proposal was put forth during president clinton 's first few months in office , but the response then was also swift and negative . will this time be different ? perhaps the sense among some citizens that the system is  rigged  will produce a different result this year , but income inequality is fundamentally not a problem that is exclusively or even primarily about taxation . causes range from globalization and unfair trade agreements to falling educational achievement and the decline of private sector labor unions , among others . tweaking the tax code , even in the substantial and perhaps radical ways that president obama is due to propose on tuesday , can go only so far in addressing this issue . on the other hand , the u.s. tax code is one part of the puzzle that the federal government can control and do something about in fairly short order . tackling tax reform more broadly could be a pathway to bipartisan cooperation that creates a genuine achievement for both president obama and the new congress . in that context , repealing the  step-up in basis  rule and perhaps equalizing tax rates on capital gains and regular income would go a long way to simplifying tax planning and return preparation while allowing the market to allocate capital without the often nonsensical preferences embedded in the current tax code . that is certainly a worthy project . but it is a very different focus than trying to ameliorate income inequality . regarding the latter , even if president obama 's tax proposals are enacted exactly as he set out , they may not do much about income inequality in the united states , but they at least do more than just talk about it .", "summary": " richard kaplan says tax law changes can reduce inequality to a degree .   he says obama 's effort to end  trust-fund loophole  is a tough sell .   tax reform could be path to bipartisan cooperation , genuine achievement for president and congress .
