{"text": "prince william , seen here with a black rhino , was struck by the rhinos ' plight on his gap year . the duke of cambridge has called for a halt to the killing of rhinos for their horns as experts warn that africa is facing the worst poaching crisis in decades . the lewa wildlife conservancy in kenya , where william proposed to kate middleton in 2010 , reported five slaughtered rhinos in a fortnight last month - and says that the lucrative poaching trade poses a ` grave threat ' to the already endangered species . a st james 's palace spokesman said : ` the duke is concerned that action must be taken now to stem the tide before it is too late and these magnificent creatures become lost to the wild forever . ` species conservation is something the duke feels passionate about . he has been keeping a close eye on the poaching crisis , particularly involving africa 's rhinoceros and elephants , and is alarmed by the increase in the numbers being killed . ' the most recent spate of killings occurred at lewa , a 62,000-acre sanctuary where the duke spent part of his gap year . they reported the shootings of five black rhinos in december , and says thieves got away with two sets of horns . rhino horns are highly prized for perceived medicinal benefits , and used against a variety of complaints including cancer and hangovers . it is particularly popular in the far east , where it can sell for around # 20,000 a pound , making it more valuable than gold . a kenyan can sell a single rhino horn for the equivalent of a year 's salary , which makes it an attractive proposition for would-be hunters in the country . ivory from elephants ' tusks is also prized . as a result , the poachers are becoming more and more sophisticated , despite the animal sanctuaries ' best efforts . lewa , which is home to 126 white and black rhinos , was founded in 1995 and had not lost a rhino to poachers until 2009 , when a female was gunned down near the border with ngare ndare forest . since then , a total of 11 have been slaughtered by poachers . a lewa spokeswoman said : ' 2012 was our blackest year . the severity and frequency of these attacks is a clear indication of the level of threat that lewa 's rhinos face , the highest in history . britain 's prince william , duke of cambridge , feeds a 5-year-old black rhino called zawadi as he visits port lympne wild animal park . ` the poacher is no longer a long gunman with a mask ; the hefty price paid for african rhino horn has attracted international organised crime syndicates that are eager to cash in at the expense of an entire species . ` poachers have become increasingly sophisticated , using the latest gadgets and intelligence to spot and kill rhinos . ' lewa is one of the best protected sanctuaries in africa , with 150 wildlife rangers , many of them armed , patrolling the vast reserve 24 hours a day . mike watson , the sanctuary 's chief executive , said security was being stepped up in the wake of the attacks . slaughtered : rhinos are killed , usually shot , by poachers who can sell their horns for the equivalent of several months ' salary . he said : ` lewa is now more than ever determined to counter these threats by increasing our security and monitoring efforts . ' a world wildlife fund rhino expert said the poachers would wipe out the endangered species if they were not stopped . they said at least 593 rhinos were slaughtered in africa last year . dr joseph okori , wwf 's rhino programme leader , said : ` the rhino faces extinction within 10 years if we do not reverse this trend . ` villagers are at the bottom of the chain and can earn several months ' income through two or three days ' poaching . ` huge amounts of money are in circulation . ' wwf-uk 's drew mcvey said : ` since 2010 , there have been successive record highs in the numbers of rhinos being poached each year . ` we need urgent action to tackle this trade , with governments working together to address the problem globally , as it wo n't be solved by any one country on its own . ' charlie mayhew , chief executive of tusk trust , which the duke of cambridge became a patron of following his visits to lewa , said : ` there are real alarm bells ringing . ` it is kenya 's economic assets that are also being hit , not just the animals . ' the wwf estimates that there are currently around 4,838 black rhinos , most of them in south africa , namibia , zimbabwe and kenya . fifty years ago , there were 70,000 .", "summary": " kenyan sanctuary where he proposed to kate middleton reports record number of killings .   prince says action must be taken to halt poachers ` now , before it is too late ' "}
