{"text": "as prosecutors outlined more evidence in their murder case against fallen nfl star aaron hernandez -- and asked the court for more time -- his former coach said wednesday he felt  personally hurt and disappointed  by the case .  i and other members of the organization were shocked and disappointed in what he had learned ,  new england patriots coach bill belichick told reporters in his first public comments since odin lloyd 's killing early on june 17 and hernandez 's arrest nine days later .  having someone in your organization that 's involved in a murder investigation is a terrible thing .  authorities have said hernandez , 23 , and two other men picked lloyd up from his boston apartment shortly after midnight last month . surveillance cameras showed the car at an industrial park near hernandez 's north attleborough , massachusetts , home . lloyd 's body was found in the north attleborough industrial park later that day . authorities have accused hernandez of orchestrating the shooting death of lloyd , the 27-year-old boyfriend of hernandez 's fiancÃ © e 's sister . the former standout nfl tight end has pleaded not guilty to murder . legal woes mount for former patriots tight end . as has long been his custom on football and other matters , belichick was guarded in his comments wednesday to the press , saying repeatedly that he could not comment on  people involved in the judicial process .  the three-time super bowl-winning head coach did say that -- even though he was outside the united states when the story broke -- he , team owner robert kraft and other patriot officials  acted swiftly and decisively .  the nfl team released hernandez , who had been one of its top offensive players , shortly after his arrest but before he was charged in court with murder . belichick took pains to say that hernandez 's alleged actions , as outlined by prosecutors , do  not in any way represent the way that the new england patriots want to do things .  the team continually evaluates its players -- from their on-field performance to their maturity and personal history off the field -- the coach said , before adding ,  we 'll work to do a better job of it as we go forward .   personally , i 'm challenged by decisions that affect the team on a daily basis , and i 'm not perfect on that , either ,  belichick said .  but i always try to do what i think is best for the football team .  hernandez jersey exchange draws 1,200 plus . the coach spoke the same day hernandez appeared in attleboro district court , wearing a dark blazer , a white button-down shirt and handcuffs over his tattooed wrists . he stood on one corner of the courtroom , flanked by a bailiff , for what was supposed to be a probable cause hearing in his case . but bristol county prosecutor william mccauley asked the judge to delay the hearing 30 days -- and keep hernandez incarcerated in the meantime -- so that a grand jury could have more time to consider the case . the grand jury that was impaneled when the investigation began stopped its work at the end of june , mccauley explained . after a two-week break , a new grand jury is now convened to hear  every case in bristol county  -- including that of hernandez , having heard from  approximately two dozen witnesses  -- said the prosecutor .  we have done everything in our power to present it as expeditiously as possible ,  mccauley said .  requesting a further date based on the inability to have enough time before the grand jury , i think , is warranted .  a judge had ordered hernandez held without bail soon after he was charged with murder . since then , the prosecutor said , more evidence has been gathered implicating the ex-nfl player . this includes boxes of ammunition found in an apartment of hernandez , and with his fingerprints on them , that is  consistent with the caliber that was recovered at the homicide scene ,  according to mccauley . also , a magazine clip was found in one of hernandez 's vehicles for a glock .45 , the type of gun that authorities believe was used to kill lloyd . the alleged murder weapon itself has not been recovered .  there continues to be additional evidence ,  mccauley said . james sultan , hernandez 's attorney , argued strongly wednesday against delaying the probable cause hearing . prosecutors  made it sound like a slam-dunk case  against hernandez soon after he was arrested and placed in solitary confinement in a southern massachusetts jail , sultan said .  now , four weeks later , the first assistant district attorney is not even ready to show this court that it can meet the probable cause standard to hold mr. hernandez ,  the defense attorney said .  -lrb- the prosecution -rrb- is not entitled to proceed on whatever pace it might choose .  judge daniel o'shea ended up siding with the prosecution , delaying hernandez 's probable cause hearing until 2 p.m. on august 22 .  i do recognize that four weeks is a long time for somebody being held in custody ,  the judge said .  but the charge is , amongst others , a murder charge .  the other two men who were allegedly in the car with hernandez around the time of lloyd 's death are behind bars as well . one of them , ernest wallace , has been charged with accessory after the fact to murder and has pleaded not guilty . the other , carlos ortiz , has pleaded not guilty to a weapons charge . meanwhile , prosecutors also are trying to convince a grand jury that hernandez is connected to the july 2012 slayings of two men in boston 's south end , a law enforcement source close to the investigation told cnn on wednesday . the grand jury looking into the slayings has been meeting for at least two weeks , according to the source . giants linebacker arrested with knife in luggage , police say . cnn 's jason hanna and darius walker contributed to this report .", "summary": " new : bill belichick says he felt  personally hurt  by aaron hernandez 's
