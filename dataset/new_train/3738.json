{"text": "food firms have been warned about the presence of a cancer-risk chemical in everyday products ranging from crisps and chips to instant coffee and ginger biscuits . a biscuit designed for babies and toddlers has also been caught up in the alert . experts are even warning families to only lightly toast their bread at home , as the chemical , called acrylamide , is more likely to form the longer and darker foods cook . a study by the food standards agency has identified 13 products containing raised levels of the chemical . in each case , officials at the local council where the supplier is based have been told to notify them . study : the food standards agency has identified 13 products containing raised levels of the chemical acrylamide . acrylamide , which is still being investigated by scientists , is a cooking by-product associated with frying , baking , roasting or toasting foods at very high temperatures , usually greater than 120c . the fsa insists its findings raise no immediate risk to the public and there is no need for people to change their diet . however , it is putting pressure on all food companies to reduce acrylamide levels because long-term consumption could increase the risk of cancer . its official advice is also that families should ensure bread and chips they eat are only toasted or baked to the ` lightest colour possible ' . the fsa said its study of levels of acrylamide and furan -- another cancer-risk chemical -- is used to identify which firms need to take action . acrylamide is formed by a reaction between natural components in food as it cooks . in reality it has probably been in the diet for as long as man has fried , roasted or toasted food . manufacturers including heinz and mcvitie 's have already responded by changing their recipes . warned : food firms have been cautioned that everyday products such as crisps , biscuits and instant coffee could contain the cancer-risk chemical acrylamide . but others , including nestle , makers of nescafe , say it is impossible to do so without harming the flavour and quality of their products . it added : ` there is currently no scientific evidence to suggest any particular product has any negative impact on health in the context of acrylamide exposure . ' the fsa is required by the eu and the european food safety authority to carry out the annual tests . it looked at 248 samples , from chips sold by fast-food outlets to supermarket own-label and big brand ranges . in 13 cases levels were above the ` indicative value ' -- a trigger point to tell the firm it should examine its production process . at risk : the fsa has warned food firms that everyday products such as instant coffee could contain the cancer chemical acrylamide . european watchdogs have been putting pressure on food manufacturers to reduce acrylamide for almost a decade . in 2002 swedish studies revealed high levels formed during the frying or baking of potato or cereal products . the fsa said : ` this raised worldwide public concern because studies in laboratory animals suggest acrylamide has the potential to cause cancer in humans by interacting with the dna in cells . ` the agency believes exposure to such chemicals should be as low as reasonably practicable . ' the latest survey found ` an upward trend ' in acrylamide levels in processed cereal-based baby foods , excluding rusks . importantly however , the fsa said this did not mean parents should stop giving these products to youngsters . the food and drink federation , which represents manufacturers , said members are ` ensuring levels are as low as reasonably achievable ' . heinz changed its banana biscotti recipe this year to reduce acrylamide to trace levels . united biscuits , which makes mcvitie 's gingernuts , said it has cut acrylamide by 70 per cent . the firm also pledged to cut levels in its mccoy 's crisps .", "summary": " acrylamide also likely to form in burned toast .   found in products from a number of top firms including heinz and nescafe .
