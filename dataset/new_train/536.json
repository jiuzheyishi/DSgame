{"text": "an experienced midwife whose ` catastrophic mistakes ' led to the death of a baby boy has told an inquest : ' i will regret what happened for the rest of my life . ' julie richards was speaking after a coroner heard how ` gross failure ' at an nhs hospital caused noah tyler to be starved of oxygen , a condition from which he never recovered . the inquest heard that noah died aged 10 months because of errors made during his birth at the university hospital of wales in cardiff . neglected : noah tyler died because of ` gross failure ' at the university hospital of wales in cardiff , a coroner ruled . problems during the birth also put the life of noah 's mother , colleen tyler , 31 , in danger , the inquest in cardiff was told . mrs tyler and her husband hywel are suing the hospital for negligence . mrs richards , who had 13 years ' experience of delivering babies , admitted to making ` catastrophic mistakes ' by failing to take action when noah 's heart rate was dangerously high . ` with hindsight i would have acted differently , ' she said . ' i do n't know if i looked at the heart scan properly . ` if i had i would have sent her -lrb- colleen -rrb- immediately upstairs to see specialist doctors . ` the raised heart level could have meant foetal distress but it could have been because the mother was in discomfort . ' i chose the more innocent option . ' ` catastrophic mistakes ' : midwife julie richards told the hearing she would regret what happened for the rest of her life . she added : ' i will regret what happened for the rest of my life . ' noah was born in the hospital 's maternity unit in february last year . mrs richards , who no longer works as a midwife , said : ' i thought colleen was pushing so well and the baby was imminent . ` her blood pressure was extremely high and i was very concerned with the reading . ' i was wrapped up in the delivery of the baby - i did n't think we needed to call the specialist neo-natal team . ` when he was born i did n't expect him to be in the condition he was in . ` he was as bad as a baby could be . he was pale and his heart rate was less than 60 and we took him away to be resuscitated . ' earlier mrs tyler sobbed as she told the inquest how she was ` tortured ' by the memory of baby noah 's birth . she said : ' i asked if i needed to push but the midwife told me if i needed to push i would not need to ask . ` she said i would just know but i was totally confused by this . i did n't know whether i should push or not . ` after three hours they took me out of the birthing pool and put me into a bed . ' i kept asking for an epidural but they did n't give me one . ' i asked if i needed a doctor but they told me there was no need to get the doctors involved because they would just cut me . ` in the end i told them they should do what they needed to to get my baby out . ' mrs tyler told the hearing that she knew instantly that something was wrong . ' i was told i would hear him cry when they got him out but i did n't hear anything , ' she said . tragic : noah tyler died aged 10 months after being deprived of oxygen when he was born . ` he was very white , not how i expected him to look . ` no one said anything and i was left feeling confused . i was in a state of shock - i thought :  this can not be happening  . ' i expected to be holding my baby by then but he was n't there . ' i knew from the doctor 's face that something terrible had happened . ' noah was taken to an incubator where he was put on a cooling mat in an attempt to prevent his brain being damaged permanently . mrs tyler , who is heavily pregnant , said : ` nothing could prepare me for what i saw , that little thing lying in the incubator with loads of tubes going into him . parental love : problems during noah 's birth also put the life of his mother , colleen , in danger , the hearing was told . ' i keep replaying the birth in my head and torturing myself . what if i could have done anything different to save noah ? ` the thoughts just go on and on . ' mrs tyler told how she later saw the midwife on the ward . she said : ' i thanked her for doing everything she could to save noah which i believed was the truth at the time . ` she did n't say anything and looked very awkward . ' specialists at the hospital treated noah for months , but he showed little progress and he was moved to a children 's hospice . he died two days before christmas last year . pathologist alistair lammy told the inquest : ` noah 's brain had been irreversibly damaged due to lack of blood and oxygen around or during birth . ' cardiff coroner mary hassell said : ' i am very , very concerned with the circumstances surrounding noah 's death . ` what struck me very forcibly was that we might today be dealing with two deaths rather than one . ' miss hassell recorded a narrative verdict saying noah of natural causes ` contributed to by neglect ' . she said : ` noah and his mother suffered gross failure of basic medical attention . there were failures . ' speaking outside court , mr tyler said : ` it is because of the failings of one person that my boy is n't here any more and there 's no reason why he should n't be . ` we know it 's a good unit and the experience we 've had with our new little boy proves they do know what they 're doing . ` when the coroner said this could have been an inquest around two deaths it hit me like a ton of bricks to think i could be here on my own not with my wife or our new little boy . ' the family 's solicitor , stuart bramley , said : ` we have heard about changes being made as a result . ` colleen and hywel tyler hope that these changes will prevent other parents from having to live through the same nightmare . ' cardiff and vale university health board has admitted that the level of care to mrs tyler and noah fell below the acceptable standard . legal action : mr and mrs tyler , who are expecting another child , are suing the hospital for negligence .", "summary": " noah tyler died 10 months after blunders were made during his birth at the university hospital of wales in cardiff .   experienced midwife julie richards tells inquest : ' i will regret what happened for the rest of my life '   cardiff coroner finds neglect contributed to noah 's death and says the hospital 's failures meant that the boy 's mother could have died , too .   noah 's parents , collen and hywel tyler , are suing the hospital for negligence .
