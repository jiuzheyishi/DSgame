{"text": "i was a young man fresh out of police college when i suddenly found myself stepping over fingers , arms , legs and other body parts . we suspected that the deceased may have been affiliated with the umkhonto we sizwe , the militant arm of the african national congress . it was a beautiful spring evening in johannesburg , south africa , but the stench of death and destruction was once again hovering over the nation . we suspected that this man accidentally blew himself apart as he was planting a bomb at one of johannesburg 's most popular shopping malls -- a mall where my mother shopped and my friends and i played miniature golf . i was the first officer on the scene , and that experience was seared into my memory . across town from the mall , blacks were living in squalor . there were great divisions in our country . many of my colleagues were terrorizing black families who were crying out for the rights of simple human dignity : the simple right to have a vote in the country of their forefathers , the simple right to drink water from the same faucet as a white man . rights they had been denied by an oppressive , minority-white apartheid government . i witnessed officers charging a group of black people with a van and then taking their money . the people were just playing a game by the side of the street . the police themselves were also divided . during those years , if a white officer had a black officer with him as a crew member and went to stop by his house , the black officer would usually have to wait in the police van . my maid , a wonderful zulu lady , was shocked when i not only invited a black sergeant into my home but offered him a cup of tea from the same kind of cup i would use . read more about lochner 's experiences in south africa . the racial and tribal tension in south africa was a powder keg ready to explode into full-scale civil war . civil wars have destroyed many african nations , and south africa seemed destined for the same fate . nelson mandela was a human rights lawyer and freedom fighter , and to some white south africans and others , he was a terrorist . mandela was the marxist friend of the communist soviet union , from where he received training and weapons to wage his struggle . the rivonia trial , as it became known , ended in 1964 . mandela was sentenced to life in prison for his participation in several bombings around south africa ; some were deadly . a saint , mandela was not . then a miracle was born . it was february 11 , 1990 . the white apartheid president took the whole world by surprise when he announced the unconditional release of mandela from prison . we were shocked . it was completely unexpected . after his release , south africa suffered some of its most severe political violence as mandela and the white minority struggled to find a peaceful transition to a  one man , one vote  system . a few months later , i moved to dallas , texas . i remember constantly being on the phone with my family and hearing about the terrible violence going on . how will you remember mandela ? share your story on cnn ireport . the white minority that was enjoying power under the apartheid system was terrified . many were convinced they would be brutalized and driven out like those in neighboring zimbabwe . it was during this time that mandela 's strength and humility became evident . on may 10 , 1994 , with the entire world watching in awe , mandela was peacefully and joyously inaugurated as south africa 's first post-apartheid president . friends and former colleagues said voting lines had never been so long in south africa . it was just a really exciting time . mandela had the daunting task to unite groups of people who had been at war with each other for decades . how could he succeed ? how could mandela overcome decades of hate , decades of distrust ? how could mandela father a nation that would soon be called a miracle , a rainbow nation ? amazingly , mandela 's 27 years in prison became the catalyst to his success . as mandela wrote in his autobiography ,  a long walk to freedom ,  he was suffering at the hands of his captors , and he became determined to study his enemy . he wanted to understand them . he wanted to know them . mandela did the unthinkable . he befriended his white afrikaner prison guards . he learned their language and studied their culture . mandela even went to church with them , and his heart was changed . mandela 's friendship with his prison guards was sincere and endured to his death . so what was it that allowed mandela to miraculously unite a nation ? mandela forgave the afrikaners . forgiveness . yes that same forgiveness jesus expressed when he cried out to his father while hanging on a cross :  father , forgive them , for they know not what they do .  forgiveness removed the shackles of hate , and mandela knew that mutual forgiveness was the key to national reconciliation . mandela wanted to find a way to unite all the people of south africa -- something only the power of forgiveness could produce . to this day , i am so passionate about the role forgiveness played in madiba 's life . i remember so clearly how i had to personally take steps to overcome the ingrained apartheid mentality in south africa . even as a little boy , i noticed how the church custodian always sat in the back . i never experienced the kind of suffering mandela did , but i can relate to him as i know he must have had to work hard at overcoming his prejudices , too . he came to embrace rugby , which was a symbol of apartheid and despised by blacks . south africa had been banned from international rugby for decades , but suddenly found themselves back on the international scene after the 1995 rugby world cup was awarded to south africa . he united the entire nation behind their rugby team , and their world cup victory became one of the most storied events in the history of international sports . mandela chose a symbol of hate and turned it into a symbol of hope . as seen in the movie  invictus ,  mandela insisted on forgiveness as the key to uniting his beloved country . he went from political prisoner to people 's president . how did he learn to forgive ? this is something worth exploring . an officer i knew , who was one of those involved in charging black people with a van , started seeing things differently . he apologized for treating people the way he did simply because they were black .  i realize that the way i was treating people was wrong ,  he said . i have forgiven the terrorist who bombed the mall in johannesburg that day . i have no animosity or bitterness . just think about it . what would you do if you were treated the way mandela and his people were ? it 's almost like a miraculous , supernatural transformation had taken place in mandela 's life , and consequently , in the whole nation . forgiveness freed madiba , and forgiveness freed his country . what do you think about this essay ?
