{"text": "world map showing where radio waves conquered still hangs defiantly in marconi 's office . visitors arriving in essex 's county town are met with the proud sign ` welcome to chelmsford , the birthplace of radio ' . it was there , exactly 100 years ago , that guglielmo marconi opened the first ever wireless factory , from which he broadcast to the whole world . but rather than being a source of pride for the residents of chelmsford - recently upgraded to city status - the building from which the first airwaves sprung has instead become an embarrassment . the premises now lie in tatters - a pigeon-infested , crumbling graveyard . of memories . the marconi factory in chelmsford , essex , the first place to ever broadcast radio 100 years ago , now lies in tatters . there is still no decision on which developer will take a # 14m gamble on the site after its previous owners , ashwell property group , collapsed at the start of the recession . guglielmo marconi , the inventor of radio , is seen here at signal hill , st john 's , newfoundland in 1901 after the first transatlantic wireless transmission had been received . marconi 's office in the chelmsford factory is empty and gloomy , thanks to the bedraggled brown drape hanging in the window - but a world map showing where his radio waves conquered still hangs defiantly above a grimy mantelpiece . also pictured , members of the changing chelmsford group . marconi 's own office is empty and gloomy , thanks to the bedraggled brown drape hanging in the window . but a world map showing where his radio waves conquered still hangs defiantly above a grimy mantelpiece . earlier this month , 60 . environment , architecture , arts and community representatives from the . changing chelmsford group toured the historic listed building in new . street in the hope of finding a way to salvage its past glory . marconi 's invention had helped save the lives of more than 700 people on board the titanic , which sank in april 1912 , and orders for maritime wireless equipment were piling up . in the wake of the disaster , 200 ambassadors and delegates travelled to chelmsford to praise the pioneer for his vision at the international telegraphic conference , and the town 's burgeoning future was set . octogenarian terry heaton , who came from india to work at new street from 1964 to 1991 , was on the tour . broken pipework and bare walls litter the now derelict 1912 building ; right , marconi at his desk in electra house , moorgate , london in 1934 . the factory has been empty since 2008 , when one of the successors of the former marconi company moved to basildon -lrb- above in 1955 -rrb- , leaving the building at the mercy of the elements . the state of the factory is a far cry from the grand opening in june 1912 , when hundreds of world ambassadors and delegates attended the london international telegraphic conference after the titanic disaster . ` all the ipads and mobile phones , televisions and computers we have were down to guglielmo marconi , who chose chelmsford as the place to pass his gift to the world , ' he said . ` that building has to be saved . i used to work in there days on end . a place like that becomes part of you . ` it is one of the most important places in the modern world , but its present state is a disgrace . ' marconi needed premises for his new company - somewhere a relatively short distance from london and easily accessible by rail . chelmsford proved to be the perfect location . the first offices he established in hall street in 1898 were soon deemed unsuitable for the growing enterprise . by 1912 , the first purpose-built radio factory - the marconi works at new street - ultimately became the company headquarters . there is still no decision on which developer will take a # 14million gamble on the site after its previous owners , ashwell property group , collapsed at the start of the recession , leaving the property in the hands of the administrators zolfo cooper . the chelmsford changing group hope the land could become new homes , businesses , art spaces and workshops , either newly-built or in the existing art deco buildings . marconi and his wife -lrb- centre and left -rrb- outside the ` elettra yacht cabin ' in the rooms of the famous scientists at the ideal home exhibition in 1933 . the factory has been empty since 2008 , when one of the successors of the former marconi company moved to nearby basildon , leaving the 1912 building at the mercy of the elements . the changing chelmsford team , linked to the royal society of arts , was allowed into the crumbling premises on saturday to explore ideas for its future , in the hope of inspiring a new owner with its own vision . guglielmo marconi was born in bologna , italy , on april 25 , 1874 . as a child , he showed a keen interest in science - and , in his early twenties , began experimenting at his father 's country estate at pontecchio where he managed to send wireless signals over a distance of one and a half miles . a year later , marconi moved to england where he was introduced to william preece , the post office 's engineer-in-chief . shortly afterwards , he was granted the world 's first patent for a system of wireless telegraphy . in 1897 , he set up the wireless telegraph & signal company limited , which was renamed marconi 's wireless telegraph company limited in 1900 . he then performed a demonstration to the italian government -lrb- where wireless signals were sent over 12 miles -rrb- - and also established wireless communication between france and england across the english channel . marconi created permanent wireless stations at the needles , isle of wight , at bournemouth and later at the haven hotel , poole , dorset . in 1900 , he took out his famous patent no. 7777 for ` tuned or syntonic telegraphy ' . and to prove that wireless waves were not affected by the curvature of the earth , he used his system for transmitting the first wireless signals across the atlantic between poldhu , cornwall , and st john 's , newfoundland , a distance of 2,100 miles in december that same year . in 1905 , he married the hon. beatrice . o'brien , daughter of the 14th baron inchiquin - but the marriage was . annulled in 1927 . that year , he married the countess bezzi-scali of . rome . various other patents followed before he joined the italian army in 1914 where he was to reach the rank of navy commander . in 1923 , he revisited his studies of short waves , conducting tests between installations at the poldhu station and in his yacht elettra . these experiments would give rise to the beam system for long distance communication - used three years later by the british government to link england and canada . in 1932 , he set up the world 's first microwave radiotelephone link between the vatican city and the pope 's summer residence . and in italy in 1935 , he demonstrated the principles of radar . marconi received many honours during his lifetime , including the nobel prize for physics in 1909 , which he shared with professor karl braun - and was awarded the hereditary title of marchese in 1929 . he died in rome on july 20 , 1937 . source : nobelprize.org . the group met at anglia ruskin university 's marconi building down the road , before heading for the damp and disused complex . it was a far cry from the grand opening in june 1912 , when hundreds of world ambassadors and delegates attended the london international telegraphic conference after the titanic disaster . marconi was the star in a posse of dignitaries from america , japan , thailand , egypt , and even warring turkey and italy , who had travelled to chelmsford to congratulate him on building the world 's new home of radio in less than two months . later that day , marconi even hosted a lavish savoy hotel dinner for delegates , including press magnate lord northcliffe . but there are signs of a fight-back . yesterday , the windows of the listed building were set to be plastered with giant posters made by a local printing firm , depicting marconi . the group 's members came up with a range of ideas for phased development of the site . they hope the land could become new homes , businesses , art spaces and workshops , either newly-built or in the existing art deco buildings . professor john worthington , of the academy of urbanism , which financed the day , saw big possibilities for a gallery or theatre in the old marconi road power plant . ` it 's a marvellous , airy , vibrant space , ' he said . another suggestion was a restaurant for diners to muse over the city landscape in a new tower block overlooking the victoria road rail embankment . roger estop , a chelmsford city council architect , who attended in his private capacity as a member of the action group , said : ` we have a completely new opportunity with an open canvas . ' but he warned the audience : ` we are currently dealing with clients who have no feeling for the place ; all they want is their money back . ' he added : ` it is true that a previous planning permission allowed for demolition of the building with the wavy roof and the one that looked like an old art deco cinema , and we could not prevent a new developer doing that if he insisted . ` but we hope we can negotiate to get a gradual development that is meaningful to the community , with intelligent re-use of the existing buildings . ` we start next week with the message sent by the posters that the 1912 building is of world importance . ' changing chelmsford will meet again to thrash out a policy document to encourage community-minded development of the land . marconi veterans association 's chris gardiner said : ' i have a hard-nosed view about this now after so many disappointments . ` the answer is to demolish everything apart from the 1912 building and turn it into housing , like high rise flats and houses that people need and will give the developer return on his investment . ` no developer is going to have money to spare for saving buildings with concrete cancer , but they could rebuild in a style hinting at what was there before . ` even the 1912 building is compartmentalised so would be costly to open up , and the main walls are single skin , making it a cold winter prospect and costly to heat . ` it may be possible to get a developer to invest in the 1912 building , but not much more .
