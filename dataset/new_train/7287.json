{"text": "after waiting nearly 100 years for a suitable suitor , a rare plant has finally produced a family . the female wild asparagus was discovered in portland , dorset , in 1997 . but it was the only survivor of the species in the area and , with no male nearby , it could not propagate -- unlike most plants , asparagus has separate sexes , so to reproduce a male must pollinate a female . experts hunted for a mate , but the endangered wild asparagus is found at only 28 locations across the country . the loneliest plant in britain : the rare female wild asparagus has been saved after a specimen in the wilds of dorset was mated with a male partner from 175 miles away in cornwall . success : experts from five different agencies worked together to search for the plants , which are now thriving . it was n't until 2006 that experts found a male variety in cornwall which they carefully moved to dorset and then rubbed its pollen on the female 's stigmas . her fertilised flowers then grew , producing bright red berries which each containedsix seeds . these were recovered , sowed in pots and grown in greenhouses . after two years , 60 plants were deemed to be strong enough to plant out in the wild where they have spent the last five years . botanists from five different agencies - the national trust , natural england , the . national museum of wales , the dorset wildlife trust and the dorset environmental records centre - have made fruitless return trips to the site to see if the young plants had flowered . but it was n't until their most recent visit yesterday that they could finally declare the project a success . out of the original 60 plants , 51 are thriving and 11 of them - seven males and four females - have now flowered for the first time , meaning they can reproduce . wild asparagus is found in only 28 sites in the uk , mainly in coastal areas in cornwall and south wales , and its habitat is being steadily reduced . it was thought they were extinct in dorset until the female was found but experts said it was only a matter of time before she died out . the plant is different from the garden asparagus that is popular to eat because it grows flat along the ground and has smaller spears that have a bitter taste . the plant is different from the garden asparagus that is popular to eat because it grows flat along the ground and has smaller spears that have a bitter taste . the 60 plants were planted in two groups of 30 ; one on the causeway linking weymouth and portland alongside the lone female and the other near to portland bill lighthouse . janet lister , a conservation advisor for the national trust , said : ` it has taken them quite a while to mature but at long-last they are starting to flower which means they can sustain themselves . ` although there are only 11 of them flowering at the moment , the key thing is that both male and females are flowering on both sites . ` we are confident it will only be a matter of time before the other young plants come into flower . ` the aim is to secure the population of wild asparagus in dorset and we are very hopeful that that is going to happen . ' bryan edwards , an ecological surveyor at the dorset environmental records centre , said : ` we brought up a cornish boy to have a bit of fun with our dorset girl in 2006 and since then it has been a waiting game . ` because their natural habitat is in an exposed , hostile environment like sea cliffs it has taken the seedlings a bit longer to grow and start to flower . ` to stand any chance of long term survival , a wild asparagus colony needs to contain plants of both sexes . ` any colony reduced to a single plant is ultimately doomed to extinction . ` the males have a different size and shape of flower . ' as well as conserving a rare and endangered plant , it is hoped the genes from the wild asparagus could be introduced to the garden variety to make them more drought tolerant . wild asparagus appear to benefit from the north atlantic drift , the sea current that keeps the south west relatively warm , which is why they are found in coastal areas . painstaking : the female plant produced 60 seeds which were carefully propagated in a greenhouse and then planted in the wild .", "summary": " the rare female wild asparagus specimen has successfully mated .   it was paired up with a long-distance male partner in cornwall .   offspring have been planted in the wild , preserving it from extinction .
