{"text": "earth is 365 million miles -lrb- 588 million km -rrb- away from jupiter and 830 million miles -lrb- 1.3 billion km -rrb- from saturn . but these heavyweights of our solar system have a huge influence on what goes on in our planet , and could be to thank for humanity 's existence . the orbits of these planets are keeping our world moving in a circular path at just the right distance from the sun for life to flourish . moving saturn 's orbit just 10 per cent closer to the sun creates a tug that would stretch out earth 's orbit by tens of millions of miles . this view is looking towards the sunlit side of saturn 's rings from about 25 degrees above the ringplane . moving saturn 's orbit just 10 per cent closer to the sun creates a tug that would stretch out earth 's orbit by tens of millions of miles . this is according to elke pilat-lohinger of the university of vienna , austria , who has developed computer models to understand how jupiter and saturn affected the shape of other planets ' orbits . using a simple model that did not include other inner planets , professor pilat-lohinger found that the greater the tilt , the more the elongation in earth 's orbit , according to a report by jeff hecht in the new scientist . jupiter 's gravity , which is 2.5 times stronger than that of earth 's , is capable of pulling on other planets in the solar system - including our own . when mars and venus were added to the model , the orbits of all three planets stabilised slightly , but saturn 's tilt still had a major influence on earth . when mars and venus were added to the model , the orbits of all three planets stabilised slightly , but saturn 's tilt still had a major influence on earth . it is known as the ` death star ' due to a crater making it look like the star wars weapon . however , astronomers say they are a step closer to solving a mystery that has baffled them for decades about saturn 's moon mimas . the moon has an odd wobble - and scientists say its core is is either wonky or awash with water . it has a tell-tale wobble that is twice as big as expected for a moon with a regular , solid structure . mimas is mostly made of ice and has a diameter of 246 miles -lrb- 396km -rrb- . the researchers offer two explanations for the wobble : either it has a vast ocean beneath its surface , or a rocky core with a weird shape resembling a rugby ball . apart from these gentle ` librations ' , mimas otherwise presents the same face to saturn throughout its orbit . the model found that 20-degree tilt of saturn would bring the earth 's orbit closer to the sun than venus . it would also cause mars to leave the solar system entirely . in a similar study earlier this year , the university of new south wales and royal holloway university of london , ran various computer models of our solar system . with each iteration , the planets in the solar system remained in their place while jupiter moved around in different obits , ranging from circular to elliptical . the scientists also moved the entire orbit of jupiter inwards and outwards to test what would have happened if the planet had formed closer to the sun , or further away . each simulation was taken through a million year time frame , recording where earth would have been every 100 years as a result of jupiter 's position . ` the default assumption is this is something that is important , ' said jonti horner , an astronomer and astrobiologist at the university of southern queensland . ` there 's a lot of flexibility where jupiter will be , and you would assume that you 'd have a very smooth , very gentle variation in how the earth 's orbit behaves over time . ' while jupiter 's locations resulted in little change in earth 's orbit and tilt , the effect on earth 's climate remained unclear . jupiter 's gravity , which is 2.5 times stronger than that of earth 's , is capable of pulling on other planets in the solar system - including our own .", "summary": " bringing saturn 's orbit 10 per cent closer to sun creates a tug on earth .   tug is strong enough to stretch earth 's orbit by tens of millions of miles .   this is according to computer models created by university of vienna .   jupiter has a far more gentle variation in how the earth 's orbit behaves .
