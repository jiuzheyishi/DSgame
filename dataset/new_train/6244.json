{"text": "dogs have been man 's best friend for thousands of years and now new research has hinted that they helped early modern man hunt woolly mammoths . domestication of dogs could explain mammoth kill sites and why cavemen thrived in a hostile environment full of threats , according to a new study . the sudden appearance of dwellings built from mammoth bones could be due to humans hunting alongside the earliest domesticated dogs , scientists explained . man 's best friend : domestication of dogs could explain mammoth kill sites and why cavemen thrived in a hostile environment full of threats . a piece of large bone - probably from a mammoth - was placed in this dog 's mouth shortly after death . this finding suggests the animal was according special mortuary treatment , perhaps acknowledging its role in mammoth hunting , professor shipman said . speaking at the natural history museum 's opening of its latest prehistoric exhibition , professor adrian lister , a mammoth researcher , explained that humans and mammoths shared earth for around half a million years . the very last mammoths died out on remote islands around 4,000 years ago , although the species disappeared from the mainland at the end of the pleistocene 10,000 years ago . ` humans used their skins , fur and bones for huts and ivory for carving , ' he said . some 15,000 years ago , the climate began to gradually warm up and the forest spread out replacing grassland . the mammoths lost their natural habitat and experts think that global warming played a big part in their extinction . ` right at the end , when the mammoth was effectively endangered , people were hunting the animals and dealt the final blow , ' professor lister said . if they were using a more effective hunting technique by using domesticated dogs , it is possible that this sped up the species ' extinction . professor lister said that modern elephants are facing the same threats today . pat shipman of penn state university has taken a fresh look at european archaeological sites containing large numbers of dead mammoths and dwellings built with mammoth bones . her research comes at a time when many archaeologists agree that the vast animals became extinct because of a combination of climate change and hunting by humans . archaeological sites , some of which contain hundreds of dead mammoths have been discovered . it became relatively common between 45,000 and 15,000 years ago to build settlements primarily composed of bones and some of them revealed huts built of mammoth bones in complex , geometric patterns as well as piles of butchered mammoth bones , professor shipman explained . ` one of the greatest puzzles about these sites is how such large numbers of mammoths could have been killed with the weapons available during that time . ' earlier studies have concluded that the age distribution of the mammoths at these sites are similar to modern elephants killed by hunting or natural disasters . but professor shipman found that ` few of the mortality patterns from these mammoth deaths matched either those from natural deaths among modern elephants killed by droughts or by culling operations with modern weapons that kill entire family herds of modern elephants at once . ' the expert believes that a successful new technique off using dogs to help kill large animals such as the woolly mammoth -lrb- illustrated -rrb- was developed and its repeated use over time could explain the mysterious , massive collections of mammoth bones in europe that were used in settlements . she believes that a successful new technique for killing such large animals had been developed and its repeated use over time could explain the mysterious , massive collections of mammoth bones in europe . in a study published in the journal quaternary international , she said that early modern humans worked with the earliest domestic dogs to kill the mammoth . her claim is based upon recent work by mietje germonpré of the royal belgian institute of natural sciences , who uncovered evidence that some of the large carnivores at these sites were early domesticated dogs , not wolves as generally had been assumed . professor shipman used information about how humans hunt with dogs to formulate a series of testable predictions about these mammoth sites . ` dogs help hunters find prey faster and more often and dogs also can surround a large animal and hold it in place by growling and charging while hunters move in . both of these effects would increase hunting success , ' she said . ` large dogs like those identified by germonpré either can help carry the prey home or , by guarding the carcass from other carnivores , can make it possible for the hunters to camp at the kill sites . ' another unusual feature of these large mammoth kill sites is the presence of extraordinary numbers of other predators , particularly wolves and foxes . the archaeologist believes that dogs helped hunters find prey faster and more often and could surround a large animal and hold it in place by growling and charging while hunters moved in . ` both of these effects would increase hunting success , ' she said . this etching from 1896 shows ancient man using bows and arrows to bring down a mammoth and it is not hard to image that large fierce dogs would have made the exercise easier . ` both dogs and wolves are very alert to the presence of other related carnivores - the canids - and they defend their territories and food fiercely , ' shipman explained . ` if humans were working and living with domesticated dogs or even semi-domesticated wolves at these archaeological sites , we would expect to find the new focus on killing the wild wolves that we see there . ' a previous study by the university of tubingen in germany used isotopic analysis of dogs from the czech site of predmostí to show that the animals had different diets to wolves at the site , possibly indicating that humans fed the dogs . analysis of mitochondrial dna by the university of turku in finland showed that the individuals identified as dogs have a distinctive genetic signature that is not known from any other canid . ` since mitochondrial dna is carried only by females , this finding may indicate that these odd canids did not give rise to modern domesticated dogs and were simply a peculiar , extinct group of wolves , ' professor shipman said . ` alternatively , it may indicate that early humans did domesticate wolves into dogs or a doglike group , but the female canids interbred with wild wolf males and so the distinctive female mitochondrial dna lineage was lost .
