{"text": "the images are shocking . a man apparently wielding an ax looms over a figure lying spreadeagled on the cobbled road , clad in red overalls . the first man turns to face the camera as it passes and watches , ax in hand , as it drives into the distance . almost more disturbingly , swiveling around on google street view , a man stands watching the grisly scene , hand nonchalantly resting on his hip . all three faces are blurred . but the identities of the two men at the center of the tableau are far from a secret in this corner of edinburgh . the man lying seemingly lifeless on the ground is dan thompson , who has owned and run the tomson motor company on giles street -- in the edinburgh district of leith -- for 30 years . above him , longtime employee gary kerr . zoom closer and , through the distortion , kerr 's expression could make you shudder . the  axman  is laughing . his boss and apparent victim is chuckling too , when he describes the hoax to cnn . thompson and kerr have been at the center of much media attention in britain after a local newspaper picked up the story of their google street view  murder .  but it took a while . the photos , thompson reckons , were taken around august 2012 .  giles street is like a misshapen horseshoe . by chance , i saw the street view car going in other leg . i knew it would reach us in half a minute ,  he says .  i had just enough time to whip in , grab gary and a pick-ax handle and he came out to give me a so called ` leith massage , ' which is essentially being bashed .  kerr has worked at the tomson motor company for more than a decade , and was  right up  for the prank , thompson said . he said google had apparently uploaded the images and some months later the company was alerted when one of its suppliers rang it up  in fits of laughter .  thompson said it was more than a year before someone apparently alerted the police , who he says  very properly  came around to check out the incident .  a wpc -lsb- female police officer -rsb- has her car serviced here and she said ' i know exactly what 's going on here -- it 's a wind up . '  they came in and said ` you guys , do you happen to know anything about this ? ' we explained what had happened ,  thompson said .  they were smiling when they came in and were roaring with laughter when they left .  thompson said that he had n't heard from google about the prank but speculated that the publicity it had generated would be very good for the company .  it 's nothing obscene , but now a lot more people know about street view -- so i would think this must be a joy to them .  when cnn contacted google about the prank , the company declined to comment . thompson fears that his tableau may not be long for the cyberworld .  infuriatingly i think last thursday the street view car went past and we had n't set anything up ,  he said .  i expect there will ll be a lot of copycats of this now but the trick is spotting -lsb- the street view car -rsb- in time .  as for the police , they told cnn they would  always respond to any reports of concern for personal safety .
