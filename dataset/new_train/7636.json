' the fire brigade and police were called to the camp , pictured , after the gypsies caused disruption . the field on eaves green lane , pictured , is almost empty except for one occupied caravan as the gypsies leave . the local campaign group , known as residents against inappropriate development , kept a vigil in all weather conditions to prevent more travellers from gaining access to the field . the judge has given the travellers a further month to restore the site , pictured , to its former green belt state . the camp was set up after the travellers bought the land from a local businessman for # 100,000 and moved in over a bank holiday weekend . but angry residents wanted to preserve the green belt which separates the village from coventry and solihull . they formed a human barricade to prevent a convoy of lorries from delivering 1,800 tons of rubble to the site later that evening fearing it would ruin their tranquility . ever since then , local residents have worked on a rota basis , with shifts lasting anything from an hour to overnight . the judge gave the gypsies until april 21 to move and a further month to restore the site to its former green belt state . the departure of the gypsies is a victory for local residents , pictured , who campaigned tirelessly . landowner noah burton , 48 , a spokesman for the travellers said that there were ` no winners ' . he said : ` we have been left homeless and the residents have been left with the stigma of the gypsy site having been there . ` the head of raid 's house is still barely worth # 5,000 even when we have gone , the history of us being there is all over the place . ` this was never about green belt land , it was only about not wanting gypsies on their doorsteps , they told me that many times . ` now the people who lived on the site have had to leave their jobs , the only reason there is still a family there is because she had to work her notice . ` she has made herself redundant from her job because we have to leave and she wo n't be able to go . ' i ca n't tell you where the families have gone because many of them are forced to stop at the roadside now and the police have moved them on a few times already . ` we will still be around , you just wo n't be able to see us any more on the land . ` the council could have helped us , found a new site and moved us in straight away . then everyone would have been happy . ` once the last families have moved out , the work will begin to return the land to its former state .
