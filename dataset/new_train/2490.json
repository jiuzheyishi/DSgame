{"text": "anton hysen is a football player . he is also gay .  so what ?  he says .  being gay is not a choice -- i hate it when people say that .  in march 2011 , hysen , who plays in the lower leagues in sweden , became the first man to come out in more than 20 years within the world of football . he broke the taboo . fast forward two years and , while his life has changed immeasurably , the same problems remain .  there 's so much ignorance ,  he told cnn in an exclusive interview .  there 's a lack of knowledge . some people who are homophobic do n't even know a gay person . it 's all about preconceptions .  i hear that football players are supposed to be masculine . i know plenty of straight guys who are more effeminate .  there 's this illusion that every football player has to be macho and have a model girlfriend . it 's not acceptable to be a gay player .  why not ? we can run , we can play , we can score . so what 's the problem ?  the fight against homophobia in football has been stepped up in the uk in particular , with the  rainbow laces  campaign taking center stage over recent days . stonewall , a uk-based gay , lesbian and bisexual charity , teamed up with irish bookmaker paddy power to promote the initiative -- which urged players to wear the colored laces to promote awareness . the organization sent laces to all 92 professional clubs in england and the 42 in scotland but enjoyed only limited success , with clubs unhappy with the inclusion of a gambling firm and a lack of notice given by the charity . many football fans took to twitter to say they were unable to even see the laces , especially with players often boasting luminous footwear , while some professionals decided against wearing them for a multitude of reasons . ` it needs to be discussed ' but while he supports the campaign -- hysen wore the laces during his most recent game -- he stresses that it is only a small step in bringing about a meaningful change in attitudes towards homophobia .  i think it 's a good idea ,  he said , after laughing that he had hit the post when he should have scored in that previous match .  it 's not a big change but it is a step forward . it 's the least we can do . we can have lectures , we can ban people -- and laces wo n't change the mind of an idiot .  a homophobe wo n't change his mind because players are wearing rainbow laces , but we 're putting it into their minds and we 're putting the issue into society so we can talk about it .  it might make people more aware and make them reconsider but it 's not going to make people come out instantly .  we can talk about it and discuss it . it needs to be discussed . there are not many players out there -lrb- wearing them -rrb- but it 's a nice gesture .  i 've heard some idiotic excuses . i respect anyone who does n't want to -lrb- wear them -rrb- and has strong opinions on the matter but do n't give lame excuses . that 's silly .  there are a lot of different things we can do -- but this shows some players are ready to show their support . seeing a professional wearing them is great and gives comfort to gay people who are playing and are n't ready to come out .  who 's next ? in february , u.s. soccer player robbie rogers revealed he is gay but at the same time announced he was retiring from the sport . rogers , who was playing in england at the time , has since reversed his decision to quit and now plays back in his homeland with major league soccer side los angeles galaxy . but not since the tragic death of justin fashanu has a top-flight division witnessed an openly gay professional football player . fashanu , who committed suicide in 1998 , became the first # 1 million black player in the history of english football when he signed for nottingham forest in 1981 . constant speculation surrounded his private life , and at one time he reportedly claimed he 'd had affairs with conservative mps -- which further fueled media interest . with the rumors continuing throughout his career , he finally came out in 1990 and continued to play for a whole host of lower league clubs .  you have to understand ,  he said in an interview before his death ,  that footballers are very narrow-minded people . it 's the nature of the business . when you put yourself in the firing line , you are open to attack . i know i 'm there to be shot down in flames .  following his passing , one particular group of fans would recite the chant :  he 's gay , he 's dead , he 's hanging in a shed , fashanu , fashanu .  ' i hope someone else will come out ' while there has been huge progress since those dark days , the presence of homophobia in football has not been extinguished . hysen had hoped that he would become a trailblazer -- but rogers aside , there has been little movement in terms of players coming out .  i 've had quite a few anonymous phone calls from players who want to come out but i do n't know who they are or where they play ,  said hysen .  i hope that someone else will come out just like robbie rogers did . that was great for u.s. soccer . at last we 're having a discussion about it and that 's huge .  it has been pretty quiet and i understand that . people might not want to come out publicly and i understand .  for me , the whole experience has been really positive . i 've not had any trouble at all . if somebody says something , then i do n't care . i do n't have time for any of that . i do n't waste my energy on that .  lately it has been really good -- i do n't know why it 's a problem .  putting the gay in games . but it 's not just in football where the problem exists -- the 2014 winter olympics have also courted controversy following the russian government 's decision to implement a new law banning  propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors .  there have been protests across the globe , with some athletes threatening to boycott the games over what they believe are archaic and draconian laws . russia says the legislation is intended to protect children by prohibiting discussion of gay rights and relationships within their earshot .  i do n't understand what 's happening in russia ,  sighs hysen .  what year are we in ?  it 's like the stone age out there . i respect their laws . it 's their country and i respect that but it 's all about human rights . we 're all humans . it 's prehistoric stuff . it 's 2013 now .  athletes are n't going there because of their sexuality . you 're going there to perform your sport -- you go out there and play and do your best .  you 're not living there -- you 're just going to compete . it 's a problem . it 's difficult because you have to respect their laws but it 's ridiculous how we treat people in the 21st century .  i know a few people going but i 'd never go . i 'll watch at home on television .  football family . hysen is not shy in giving his views -- although he does squirm at the thought that he has become some kind of spokesman for gay sports stars :  i always speak from the heart and do n't care what i say .  with a strong family around him , he has grown into a confident and aspiring young man who quickly realized that his life would never be the same . but by his own admission , the fact that he is the son of glenn hysen , the former liverpool and sweden international footballer , may have given him an advantage which others may not be as fortunate to enjoy . as a player , his father won the now defunct uefa cup twice with swedish side ifk gothenburg before moving to england , where he won the league title in 1991 . he is now on the coaching staff at anton 's third division club utsiktens , while brothers tobias and alexander are also professional footballers . dancing star . but anton is famous in his own right -- his story an inspiration to millions around the world -- while he cites his victory in sweden 's  dancing with the stars  as another reason for his current popularity .  in sweden i get recognized a lot from my football but also from the dancing ,  he laughs .  i did n't think people would care that much but it 's nice .  when i first came out i thought i would be in the newspapers in sweden for a couple of days and that 's it -- i did n't think people would really care to be honest .  and then suddenly it went crazy , and within two days the whole world knew , but it feels pretty good . i know that i 've done something good with my life .  i was just a kid who happened to be gay -- i never thought it would be such a big deal .
