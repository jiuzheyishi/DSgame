' mr walbank told jurors the majority of the marriages which took place were between nigerians and nationals from the european economic area -lrb- eea -rrb- , mainly from portugal and the netherlands . he added : ` the fraud , the crown suggest , was n't confined to one or two , or even a couple of dozen of ceremonies . we are concerned in this case with hundreds of sham marriages . ` on some occasions eea nationals were flown into the uk specially for marriages to take place and then flown back out again . ' accused : the jury was told that amdudalat ladipo - herself an illegal immigrant - arranged the weddings between mainly nigerian and eu nationals . the court heard nigerian ladipo may also have been involved in fixing sham marriages at other churches , although the jury were told she only faces charges in relation to weddings at all saints . when police attended the church in july 2010 after being told a number of sham weddings were due to take place there that day they found ladipo there . the court heard one of the officers approached her and asked her why she was there . she replied one of her friends was getting married . however , when asked for her friend 's name she is said to have become agitated and was later seen trying to get rid of a brown envelope under a bush in the church grounds . when seized the enveloped was found to contain a number of id documents which were not hers and sham paperwork relating to the marriages and she was arrested . rev john , the curate at all saints church , and parish priest rev shipsides were arrested a few days later on august 3 . mr walbank told jurors : ` if the sham marriages had n't been stopped they would have continued at a rate of knots as there were many more booked at the church that would have taken place . ' jurors heard ladipo herself may have entered into a sham marriage with a dutch national in february 2010 . ` her reason for going through with the marriage we suggest is entirely consistent with the motive of others at all saints church during the indictment period , to stay in the country , ' said mr walbank . shipsides , of forest gate , east london , has already admitted conspiring to facilitate unlawful immigration . ladipo , of dagenham , and john , of barking , both in east london , deny the same charge . ladipo also denies possessing false identity documents . the trial , expected to take four weeks , continues . sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article .", "summary": " once couples were married there was a ` strikingly high proportion ' who made applications to the home office for right to remain in the uk .   case involves a ` massive and systematic immigration fraud ' , jurors are told .
