{"text": "a texas state senator tried tuesday to block an abortion bill by attempting a 13-hour filibuster , but appeared to fall short after 10 hours when the chairman ruled she had gone off topic . but a member of the senate then moved that the ruling be appealed , and the status of the ruling was in doubt . fort worth democrat wendy davis , 50 , took to the floor of the chamber late tuesday morning to criticize the bill , which would be among the nation 's most restrictive . rules called for her to stand , unaided , until midnight -lrb- 1 a.m. wednesday et -rrb- , for the filibuster to succeed . at the outset , davis said she was speaking for families whose  personal relationships with their doctor and their creator  would be violated by the bill .  these voices have been silenced by a governor who made blind partisanship and personal political ambition the official business of our great state ,  she said .  and sadly , he 's being abetted by legislative leaders who either share this blind partisanship or simply do not have the strength to oppose it .  davis had a snack and a small amount of water before beginning , her office said . she was not allowed to lean or take a bathroom break . at about 10 p.m. -lrb- 11 p.m. et -rrb- , davis talked about the abortion pill , ru-486 , and the chairman ruled that her comments were off topic . earlier in the evening , a fellow senator helped davis put on a back brace , which angered some lawmakers who said it violated filibuster rules . that view was upheld in a vote , and she was given a warning . before that , she had been ruled off topic . davis was allowed three warnings before the senate was to be allowed to vote on whether she must stop her filibuster . the sneaker-wearing senator spent much of the time reading testimony and messages from women decrying the bill and recounting stories of the struggles they , their friends or relatives faced in the days before birth control and abortion were legalized .  women realize that these bills will not protect their heath ,  she said .  they will only reduce their access to abortion providers and limit their ability to make their own family-planning decisions .  the bill would ban most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and tighten standards on abortion clinics and the doctors who work at them . critics say it would shut most of the abortion clinics in texas . it has passed the state house of representatives , and gov. rick perry , a former republican presidential candidate , has said he 'll sign it .  in texas , we value all life , and we 've worked to cultivate a culture that supports the birth of every child ,  perry said .  we have an obligation to protect unborn children , and to hold those who peddle these abortions to standards that would minimize the death , disease and pain they cause .  while republicans hold a majority in the senate , they do n't appear to have the votes to thwart a filibuster . abortion rights advocates were rallying behind davis online , pushing the hashtag #standwithwendy on twitter .  like never before , people in texas are standing up to demand that politicians respect women 's ability to make our own personal medical decisions , and the whole country is watching ,  cecile richards , president of the planned parenthood action fund , said in a statement on the filibuster . richards -- the daughter of former texas gov. ann richards -- said ,  this bill is dangerous and deeply unpopular , and it will hurt a lot of women . we wo n't go back , we wo n't back down , and we wo n't forget when these politicians are on the ballot .   partisanship and ambition are not unusual in a state capitol , but here , in texas , right now , it has risen to a level of profound irresponsibility and the raw abuse of power ,  she said in a statement on her website . davis was elected to the texas senate in 2008 , defeating a longtime republican incumbent . last year , she staged a filibuster to force a special session in an attempt to stop $ 5 billion in cuts to texas public schools , according to her website . davis , who became a single mother at age 19 , went on to graduate with honors from harvard law school , it says .", "summary": " sen. wendy davis said to have digressed .   davis would have had to hold the floor until midnight .    blind partisanship and personal political ambition  drive the bill , she says .   critics say the law would shut most of the state 's abortion clinics .
