{"text": "for more than three decades , concorde represented the pinnacle of business travel -- the ultimate status symbol for the jetset executive . considered a marvel of aviation technology , the distinctive droop-nosed aircraft traveled at twice the speed of sound , flying from london to new york in about three and a half hours -- half the time of commercial airliners . but even before an air france concorde crashed in 2000 , killing all 100 passengers and nine crew members on board , the luster was beginning to wane . battling high operating costs and low passenger numbers , air france and british airways grounded their small , aging fleet a mere three years later . but the dream of supersonic flight has not disappeared . aviation manufacturers such as boeing , lockheed martin and aerion are working on supersonic technology -- with the latter predicting it could have a supersonic business jet in service as early as 2020 . industry expert joe lissenden , the director of aerospace and defense consulting in the americas for ihs jane 's , says it 's likely that a next-generation supersonic commercial aircraft will emerge . high demand from passengers , historic profitability on the routes and significant technological improvements have combined to make supersonic flight all the more viable , he said . read also : the air fare too good to be true . for lissenden , the one challenge that remains is fuel cost .  faster flights consume fuel faster which makes the flight more expensive ,  he said .  but this is a premium route , and premium prices will be charged .  crucial to the efforts to restore supersonic aircraft to the skies is the work of national aerospace programs such as nasa and japan 's jaxa . peter coen is the supersonics research project manager for nasa 's fundamental aeronautics program . while the agency is not working on a specific supersonic aircraft , he said ,  we are working on technologies we feel represent barriers to bringing back successful supersonic aircraft .  those barriers include high atmosphere emissions , noise produced when taking off and landing , and the sonic boom -- the sound associated with the shockwaves created when objects travel faster than the speed of sound , which has prevented supersonic aircraft from flying overland routes . see also : air force 's hypersonic test fails . coen said his division was concentrated on addressing the sonic boom issue first , because  if you do n't have overland supersonic flight , there 's never going to be a market for the supersonic aircraft .  nasa has been collaborating with boeing and lockheed martin on systems-level design studies , with each manufacturer producing models that have been subjected to wind tunnel testing to gauge their effectiveness . coen said phase one testing had successfully validated the basic design techniques . reshaping the aircraft , the designs -- boeing 's two-jet configuration with engines mounted above the wing , and lockheed martin 's tri-jet configuration , with two engines below the wing and a third mounted in the tail -- had been proven to significantly reduce the sonic boom to a  thump ,  dropping the noise from concorde levels to close to what is considered the level of acceptability . coen said he expected to see a next-generation  son of concorde  in the marketplace by around 2030 , while a supersonic business jet  could happen sooner .   the boom is the barrier and if we can get past that , i think we 'll see people giving supersonic flight a lot more serious consideration ,  he said . the japan aerospace exploration agency -lrb- jaxa -rrb- also hopes to develop a supersonic passenger aircraft that is quiet , economical and environmentally friendly , and expects to achieved it some time this century . spokesman masahisa honda said that while the agency currently had no aircraft in specific development , along current projections it predicted a supersonic business jet to enter the market some time after 2015 . read also : ` hidden ' airline charges -- dirty tricks or customer choice ? one of the frontrunners to do so is the aerion sbj , an 8-12 passenger business jet .  it will herald a return to supersonic civil flight without concorde 's environmental and economic drawbacks ,  said aerion spokesman adam konowe . he said development of a joint venture with aircraft manufacturers to produce the sbj had been slowed by the recession , but once a deal was struck he anticipated a six-year development program to bring the aircraft to market .  we believe the sbj will be certified , and enter service around the end of the decade -- 2020 ,  he said . but not everyone is convinced that a return to supersonic passenger flight is just around the corner . chris seymour , head of market analysis with aviation experts ascend , was skeptical that there would be much progress before at least 2030 .  i think there 's so many issues to be considered that i certainly ca n't see it happening in the next 20 years ,  he said . seymour believes that although technological barriers will likely be overcome , the key factor in whether it will become a reality is whether a market exists that is prepared to pay a premium for the ultimate status symbol in business travel -- particularly in an air-travel market that is focused on low prices .  will you have enough passengers willing to pay higher fares to fly more quickly ?  he said .  if you look at concorde , that was n't the case . it came along at a time when the 747 also came in , which carried more people for lower fares . that 's where the market was .  peter warth , director of complete aviation solutions , also believes that a return to supersonic flight is further off than some are making out .  there seems to be multiple technological and commercial obstacles that will need to be cleared ,  he said . but he conceded :  i 'm sure that when the original plans for concorde , the a380 and the 787 dreamliner were announced , the same questions about whether it could be achieved were asked . but they eventually delivered . i think time will tell . ", "summary": " the quest continues for a next-generation supersonic aircraft .   aerion predicts it will have a business jet in service by about 2020 .   nasa is close to muffling the sonic boom that prevents overland supersonic flight .   some analysts question whether a market exists for expensive supersonic travel .
