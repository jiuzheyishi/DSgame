{"text": "forget delia smith and rebecca adlington -- there 's only one retirement of note this year . mark roberts , the world 's most prolific streaker , has stripped for the last time -- and your intrepid reporter was there for his finale , wearing just a pair of crocs . for two decades , the liverpudlian father-of-three has been the usain bolt of the naked dash . in 1995 , he leapt naked on to fred talbot 's weather map on daytime tv show this morning , and a year later he appeared nude on the green during the open at royal lytham . then , in 2004 , he was fined # 550 for trespassing after streaking across the pitch at the super bowl in texas -- a match watched by 130 million people in 87 countries . flashback : mark roberts is hanging up his birthday suit after stripping off 519 times , including at the 1996 open at royal latham when he was escorted from the green by police officers . winning streak : the 48-year-old once ran out onto centre court during the men 's final of the wimbledon tennis championships . no balls please : the streaker , who was lead away from centre court with a blanket covering his private parts , has given up streaking . for good measure , mark has also stripped off at wembley , wimbledon and ascot . ` there 's . no major venue or event i have n't done , ' he says proudly . ` but i 'm . nearly 49 now and my children have begged me to stop . it 's time . i 'm not . ready for my slippers just yet , but gravity 's against me . ' last . week , for his last outing -- his 519th and final streak -- i joined him . i . would love to say that sitting naked on a bench in an icy . buckinghamshire park was somehow a freeing experience . but , with my . modesty barely covered by an a4 notepad , i would be lying . blue . with cold , i felt utterly ridiculous , a feeling not helped by the barks . of derision from passers-the whole episode in his stride . but i was further discomforted to . notice that even he , unlike me , was wearing clothes , after a fashion : a . monkey g-string . ` is n't that cheating ? ' i asked . he . laughed : ` i 've shown my todger enough now , i think i 've earned my . stripes . anyway , it 's the buttocks that make people laugh . ' and . that 's the key to mark 's 20-year ` career ' . middle-aged with a proud pot . belly , he cuts a comical figure , wholly devoid of vanity . the title of . his planned autobiography says it all : i did n't know an inch would take . me this far . tutu clever : mr roberts protected his modesty with a swimming cap and tutu when he jumped into the pool during world swimming championships in barcelona in 2003 . ` i 'm no muscle mary or porn star , ' he . says . ` that 's why it 's funny . i 'm just a regular , 16st fella . if i was . buff , i 'd just be a poser . ' his odd obsession began by accident in . 1993 when he saw a woman streak down the pitch at a rugby sevens game . in hong kong . ` i was working in a bar over there and i was a bit merry , ' he says . ` when i saw that girl i said out loud ,  pah , anyone could do . that .  some bloke replied ,  ok , big mouth , you try it ,  and i said , .  all right then .  ` it was just ale talk . but the next . day there was a bang at the door and it was a mate with a taxi waiting . i . could n't back out then . ` everyone . was dancing and clapping at the stadium and i started getting a buzz . off the crowd -- my heart was thumping through my chest . so i pushed to . the front and took my shoes and socks off . ` i . ran backwards to wave to the crowd and , as i turned round , there was . the ball . i picked it up and ran the whole length of the field and . scored a try . against the all blacks . there and then , i was hooked . ' therein . lies the nub of mark 's compulsion : he loves to make people laugh . he . says : ` my first time changed my life . everyone should try it once . i 'd . never had any history of nudity . i 'm actually quite shy . on a beach , i 'm . coy and i 'll get changed under a towel . but when i perform , i 'm like a . different man . cold front : in 1995 the liverpudlian father of three leapt naked on to fred talbot Â¿ s weather map on daytime tv show this morning . ` what i realised that day in 1993 was that while i could perhaps make four or five people laugh by telling a joke in a pub , i could , just by doing something daft on a pitch , make tens of thousands of people laugh . ` i do n't have a compulsion to take my clothes off . it 's only the laughter that matters . it 's nothing like flashing . there 's nothing sexual about it -- it 's just comedy nudity . ' not everyone gets the joke . his scuffles with over-zealous security guards over the years have left him with two broken toes , four broken ribs , a broken finger and 25 stitches in his leg . in 2007 , merseyside police sought an anti-social behaviour order banning mark from displaying his buttocks and genitals in public . but the judge rejected the application , saying mark 's behaviour did not cause real distress . that viewpoint is what marks him apart from stephen gough , the so-called naked rambler , who has spent six years in jail after walking the length of britain in the nude . on one occasion , for example , gough was jailed for a breach of the peace after a judge said he had ` intentionally caused shock and alarm to children and their parents ' after he deliberately -lsb- walked -rsb- naked past a busy children 's play-park ' -- despite ` repeated police requests not to do so ' . not so super : mr roberst was carried off the field by houston police after he delayed the start of the second half of super bowl xxxviii in houston , texas in 2004 . ` he thinks it 's his right to walk naked wherever he wants and that has clearly caused offence , ' says mark . ` i just set out to entertain people and always in a big arena . i 'm no threat to anybody . ' but mark has been kept in a cell overnight 30 times and fined a total of # 4,000 . single for nine years , mark has three children -- rebecca , 24 , mark , 19 , and georgia , 15 -- by two different women but he no longer speaks to either of the mothers . it was a recent remark by son mark that made him decide it was time to call it a day . mark snr says : ` he said to me the other day ,  dad , when are you going to stop , all my mates are watching you ?  i asked him ,  what do they say ?  ` and he said ,  they all laugh their heads off . ' so i replied ,  what 's the problem , then ?  he just said ,  well , you 're my dad .  that really hit home with me . ' mark left school at 15 , with no qualifications . now jobless , he lives in a # 400-a-month rented house in anfield , liverpool , but he is a strangely proud man . ` i 'm not on the dole , my mates are helping me out . i 've always found a way to support me and the kids . and , streaking or not , i will again . ' not that streaking has proved a big earner . ` i made a couple of grand from underwear adverts in spain ten years ago , ' he says . he is also the star of a channel 4 documentary to be screened this week . so , unhappily , i joined him for his swansong -- and he does have a point . there is , if our ad hoc audience is anything to go by , something inherently comical about two foftysomething blokes running across a park in the middle of february . as we thankfully reclaim our clothes after a streak that will be -- for us both -- our last , mark says : ` that 's it now , i 'm done . but you always want more out of life , do n't you ? you never know what 's on the other side of a door unless you open it . i 'm ready . ' on the ball : mr roberts donned a tartan hat when he interrupted the champions league final between bayer leverkusen and real madrid in 2002 .", "summary": " mark roberts is giving up streaking after two decades .   father-of-three has stripped on this morning and at wimbledon .   the 48-year-old has spent 30 nights in police cells .   autobiography ' i did n't know an inch would take me this far ' planned .   streak ! the man who ca n't keep his clothes on will be shown on channel 4 on thursday at 10pm .
