{"text": "days after russia and the united states reached a deal on getting syria to give up its chemical weapons , world powers are quarreling over the details . the agreement , reached by russian foreign minister sergey lavrov and u.s. secretary of state john kerry over the weekend , calls for a u.n. resolution demanding that syria turn over its chemical weapons to international control in a specific time frame . russia wo n't support any resolution that would authorize the use of force against syria if it does n't comply , lavrov said tuesday . but the united states and france want to keep the threat of force on the table if syria does n't comply . those allies say they are convinced that syrian president bashar al-assad 's regime was behind a chemical weapons attack in opposition areas that , according to u.s. estimates , killed more than 1,400 people . representatives of those three powers and the two other veto-wielding permanent security council members met behind closed doors at the united nations on tuesday to hammer out a draft resolution , a meeting a u.n. diplomat called  constructive .   for the first time there was a discussion of the actual text ,  said the diplomat , who did n't want to be named discussing ongoing private negotiations .  there are well-known different views on some of the elements , but we are trying to resolve those issues .  the meetings were likely to resume wednesday , the diplomat said . u.n. weapons inspectors reported monday that an august 21 attack outside damascus had been carried out using the nerve gas sarin . tuesday , secretary-general ban ki-moon said the findings should spur member states to bring the bloodshed in syria to a halt , urging both washington and moscow to  demonstrate their leadership .   let us be clear : the use of chemical weapons in syria is only the tip of the iceberg ,  he said .  the suffering in syria must end .  though the inspectors did not assign blame for the attack , a u.s. analysis of their report shows the syrian regime was responsible for the august 21 massacre outside damascus , state department spokeswoman jen psaki told reporters in washington .  based on our preliminary review of information contained in the report , several crucial details confirm the assad regime 's guilt in carrying out this attack ,  she said . one of the munitions identified in the report , a 120-millimeter improvised rocket , has been linked to previous attacks by the al-assad regime , and  we have no indications that the opposition has manufactured or used this style rocket .  in addition , the environmental , chemical , and medical samples collected by u.n. investigators  provide clear and compelling evidence  that the rockets used in the attack contained sarin gas , a nerve agent , she said .  we know the regime possesses sarin ; we have no evidence , however , that the opposition possesses sarin .  she added that the united states reserves the right to take military action . though diplomacy is the preferred option ,  i do n't want to predict what the end result will be ,  she said . still , she was willing to predict that that end result would not include the status quo in damascus .  we do n't see a future for assad , a future in syria that includes assad ,  she said . international inspections of syria 's declared chemical weapons storage sites are to begin next month and all chemical weapons are to be eliminated by june 30 , 2014 , she said . french foreign minister laurent fabius shared psaki 's view that the syrian regime was responsible for the massacre . but , at the same news conference , lavrov brushed aside a question about blame . he noted that the u.n. inspectors in syria were not tasked with figuring out who was responsible and that that was not the point of the u.n. report . russia has suggested syrian rebels may have been behind the attack , though critics have said rebels did not have the means to unleash chemical weapons . a scathing report . inspectors found  clear and convincing evidence  that the nerve agent sarin was delivered by surface-to-surface rockets  on a relatively large scale  in the august 21 attack on a damascus suburb , ban said monday .  it is the most significant confirmed use of chemical weapons against civilians since saddam hussein used them in halabja in 1988 ,  ban said , referring to the chemical attack against kurds in northern iraq that killed thousands , mostly civilians ,  and the worst use of weapons of mass destruction in the 21st century ,  ban said .  the international community has a responsibility to ensure that chemical weapons never re-emerge as an instrument of warfare .  but on tuesday , ban said it was  for others to decide whether to pursue this matter further to determine responsibility and accountability .  the diplomatic quarrel over just who may have been responsible for the chemical weapons attack came as the toll from conventional weapons continued to mount . the opposition local coordination committees of syria reported that 70 people -- including four children and seven women -- were killed tuesday nationwide . syrian-turkish border tension . a blast rocked the syrian side of the turkish-syrian border tuesday , turkey 's semiofficial anatolian news agency reported . video shot by activists showed torrents of black smoke emerging from blazing vehicles at the crossing as survivors tried to help victims . the lcc said the attack wounded many people . the explosion , which happened near a border gate , comes a day after turkish planes shot down a syrian helicopter crossing into turkey . it came down on syrian territory , turkish deputy prime minister bulent arinc said . syria 's state news agency sana said the helicopter was watching for  terrorists  crossing the border and erroneously strayed into turkish airspace , but was on its way back across the border when shot down . cnn 's nick paton walsh , richard allen greene , josh levs , aliza kassim , joe sterling and jennifer deaton contributed to this report .", "summary": " new : 70 die in latest violence , opposition says .   u.n.
