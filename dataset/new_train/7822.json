{"text": "earnings : david cameron attacked nhs management salaries and council golden handshakes . david cameron has launched a fresh assault on public sector pay - saying he was ` surprised ' at the number of senior staff who earn more than him . he said he did not think it was fair that chief executives in local councils and the nhs should have a higher salary than the prime minister and the chancellor . state salaries had been allowed to drift ` up and up and up ' over recent years without any thought to whether such high rates were necessary to attract the best candidates . the prime minister earns # 142,500 and it is believed that more than 300 staff employed by local councils take home more than him . thousands more in the public sector , from nhs managers to doctors and bbc staff , also earn more . mr cameron also attacked ` golden handshakes ' and generous early retirement deals which are often offered to departing highly-paid staff in the public sector . he made the comments at one a pm direct question and answer sessions in carlisle on friday . when asked whether he thought it was fair that jill stannard , chief executive of cumbria county council , was on a salary of # 170,000 - almost # 30,000 more than him , he said : ` the short answer is no , not really . ` it 's quite surprising sometimes just how many people in the public sector are paid more than the prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer . ` a lot of public sector salaries drifted up and up and up and there was n't enough thinking about what we really need to pay to get someone who is good . ' ms stannard , 55 , is taking early retirement to make way for a money-saving management shake-up at cumbria council . in the past three years the council 's budget has been reduced by # 88m and it must save a further # 50m by 2016 . attack : david cameron , pictured with deputy prime minister nick clegg , has said that high nhs salaries do not necessarily attract the best staff . a series of top jobs could go , and a new interim chief executive will be on a much lower salary than ms stannard . mr cameron went on to attack golden handshakes - and called on councils to be more transparent about how they bring in such deals . he said : ` there also was n't enough thought about what payment they get when they have to go and what sort of pay-out they get . ` we 're changing this . we 're saying you have to publish all this information . everyone should be able to see what council staff earn , what the contracts are , and there should be a vote on this properly . ` i come from oxfordshire , and in my constituency , west oxfordshire , we share a chief executive with the neighbouring council . making savings : cameron said there was not ` enough thought ' about how much public sector workers are paid . ` there 's a lot more you can do . you can get police services , fire services to share some of the back office staff to share some of the payroll . ` to think a bit more like a business and think what can i do to drive down costs whole still delivering a good product . we need government to think like that . ' it also emerged yesterday that councils have signed thousands of gagging orders which prevent individuals from blowing the whistle on poor practice and wrongdoing . they have signed agreements relating to pay-outs of more than # 115million in the past three years , the vast majority of which contain gagging orders . more than 12,000 so-called compromise agreements were signed by 199 councils in britain between 2009 and 2012 .", "summary": " cameron said state salaries had been allowed to drift .   ` up and up and up '   jill stannard of cumbria county council is on a salary of # 170,000 .   cameron attacked ` golden handshakes ' and generous early retirement deals .
