{"text": "offering tests to men in their late forties could reduce prostate cancer deaths by half , say experts . prostate specific antigen -lrb- psa -rrb- screening is used to detect prostate cancer , but remains controversial , because it became widespread long before there was substantial evidence to prove its value . it can also be unreliable , giving false positive results which can cause anxiety and result in unnecessary treatment . prostate cancer can be a source of anxiety for middle aged and older men . until now , the most recent study found that prostate cancer screening reduced deaths by 20 per cent . but , with this came a high rates of unnecessary treatment . statistics showed that to save one life , nearly 50 cases needed to be treated . in 2010 , when the uk national screening committee in england last . reviewed medical data , it decided that a national screening programme should not be introduced . but now swedish research , published in the bmj , has found that if screening was offered to men aged between 45 and 49 , it would predict nearly half of all cases . researchers reviewed a study carried out between 1974 and 1984 involving 21,277 swedish men aged between 27 and 52 . all the men had donated blood samples at the start of the study . the researchers used these stored samples to run psa tests . research has shown that screening men aged between 45 and 49 for prostate cancer -lrb- pictured -rrb- could save many lives . they then checked to see if the psa reading predicted whether or not they developed prostate cancer . the researchers then used these results to work out the best age at which men should be screened . they found that screening under the age of 45 detected too few deadly cancers . prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the uk . more than 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year . symptoms include a difficulty passing urine , a desire to frequently pass urine or needing to rush to the toilet . psa is a protein produced by both normal and cancerous prostate cells . but a high level of psa can be a sign of cancer . a psa reading higher than four , but less than 10 is usually due to a benign enlarged prostate . a reading higher than 10 may also just be a a symptoms of benign prostate disease . the higher the level of psa , the more likely it is to be cancer . and delaying screening until after age 50 missed too many . screening between the ages of 45 and 49 spotted 44 per cent of the cancers that became deadly . in the study , 1,369 of the men had prostate cancer , 241 had advanced disease and 162 died from it . the study stated that all men should be offered a psa test in their mid-to-late 40s . they advised that those with a high psa reading should return for surveillance , checks and treatment if necessary . those with normal results could wait another five to ten years for their next psa test . the study said : ` at least half of all men can be identified as being at low risk and probably need no more than three psa tests in a lifetime . ' ` this is likely to reduce the risk of overdiagnosis while still enabling early cancer detection among those most likely to gain from early diagnosis , ' they say . public health england review evidence for screening every three years to ensure that the programmes offered by the nhs are based on the most up-to-date information available . prostate cancer uk said more research efforts should be channelled into finding a better screening test for the disease .", "summary": " almost 50 % of deaths can be predicted before age 50 .   there is no routine screening programme in uk .   but screening between the ages of 45 and 49 spotted 44 % of the cancers that became deadly .
