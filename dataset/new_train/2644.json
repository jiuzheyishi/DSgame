{"text": "as they seek solace from the ignominy of a ban from representing their country because of a drinking bout , six australian rugby internationals might just have been served the perfect tonic - knowing that they are not part of the country 's olympic team . a day after a total of 15 players were disciplined for breaching ` internal team protocol ' , the australian olympic committee -lrb- aoc -rrb- issued guidelines about how its own athletes should behave at future games after the consumption of alcohol . there is to be no ` swaying , staggering or falling down ' while rambling or boisterous conversations , annoying team members and difficulty in paying attention to others are also outlawed . while drinking may be permitted outside the olympic village , team members have been left in no doubt as to the expectations now placed upon them .  these restrictions have been implemented to ensure that australia 's olympic athletes are given the opportunity to compete to the best of their ability and with distinction ,  said a statement bearing the name of aoc president john coates . the failure to comply with these directives , which include the non-consumption of any alcohol in the olympic village , would likely lead to expulsion from the team camp . the first test for australian athletes will come at the winter olympics in sochi in february . the measures came after a 2012 olympic games where some australian athletes were criticized for their drunken behavior at an olympics where the nation collected its lowest medal haul in 20 years . the swimming team 's drunken behavior was particularly frowned upon following an independent review , while a rower was detained by police for damaging shop windows after a drinking session . last week , it was the turn of australia 's rugby players to hit the headlines for their drinking . veteran international adam ashley cooper was one of the six suspended , along with nick cummins , liam gill , tatafu polota-nau , benn robinson and paddy ryan . while the latter will miss the match against wales later this month , the remaining five will all miss this weekend 's clash with scotland . yet the extent of the consumption of what coach ewen mckenzie called  inappropriate levels of alcohol  went even further , with a further nine players warned as to their future conduct .  let 's be clear - these are internal sanctions and are n't a result of any complaints or reports of inappropriate or sinister behavior while our players were out ,  said the former international .  we 've done this because we need to continually reinforce the need for our players to make smart decisions to benefit the team .  the worst thing you could do for the wallabies in the long term is nothing , because that would mean we would be ignoring poor culture and a significant performance issue .  despite the drinking spree , which took place early on wednesday morning of last week , australia defeated ireland 32-15 in dublin three days later , with cummins among the try scorers . several australian rugby players have been involved in drinking incidents in recent times , including james o'connor -- who lost his contract with the national team as a result -- and kurtley beale , who has sought counseling for his problems .", "summary": " australian olympic committee issues stringent drinking code .   move comes a day after six australian rugby players were barred for ` inappropriate ' alcohol consumption .   australia 's swimmers and rowers fell foul of alcohol at 2012 olympics .
