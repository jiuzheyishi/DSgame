{"text": "sapelo island , georgia it 's a culture struggling to survive . fewer than 50 people -- all descendants of slaves -- fear they may soon be taxed out of the property their families have owned since the days of slavery . they are the gullah-geechee people of sapelo island off georgia 's coast , near savannah . this small , simple community is finding itself embroiled in a feud with local officials over a sudden , huge increase in property assessments that are raising property taxes as much as 600 % for some . many say the increase could force them to sell their ancestral properties .  that 's part of the american history . that 's part of what built this country ,  said charles hall , 79 , a retired u.s. air force colonel who was born under a midwife 's care in the same home he lives in today .  sapelo being the only intact gullah-geechee community in the country that 's left , that is a part of history . it will be a shame not to preserve  it , he told cnn . mcintosh county 's decision to reappraise homes on the island sparked the problem . county attorney adam poppell told cnn that the gullah-geechee culture is invaluable , but the properties had been historically undervalued due to errors in previous property appraisals .  we have to follow the law , and assess at fair market value ,  he told cnn . to fix the problem , he said ,  the state has to create a special exemption for cultural communities .  sapelo island , about the size of manhattan , is a short 20-minute boat ride from georgia 's coast . but in some ways , it seems much farther . the bumpy , unpaved dirt roads are a constant reminder that this is an island with few services . there are no police officers , fire rescue personnel , doctors or hospitals . there is no school or post office . people drive their garbage to a single garbage compactor . there are no grocery stores . the gas station is open only on tuesdays and thursdays . ninety-seven percent of the island is owned by the state of georgia . residents live on a small section known as hog hammock . a ferry makes three round trips each day , with the last departure from the mainland at 5:30 p.m. residents ca n't miss that ferry if they want to work or go to school on the mainland . they complain this limits their employment opportunities and prohibits their children from participating in after-school activities . half of nation 's foreclosed homes still occupied . many have fled the island over the years because opportunity just does n't exist there . cornelia bailey has been one of the loudest defenders of the island where she was born and raised . she 's the ninth generation of her family to live on the island , whose slave roots are traced back to angola . she said the taxes on her one acre property have gone from $ 600 a year to about $ 2,300 .  all these years of getting nothing , then all of a sudden , they want to lay this tax on your back and still not give you nothing ,  she said .  for the last three years , we 've been paying $ 128 a year for garbage collection . i do n't even have my green garbage can . where 's my can ?  she added , with a hint of anger in her voice ,  you can call 911 , but nobody gon na squeal up to your front door , so forget it .  homeowners are hiring lawyers now to have their displeasure heard in state and federal court . reed colfax -- a partner at relman , dane & colfax , one of the leading housing discrimination litigation firms in the country -- is heading full speed into court to have the tax bills struck down for at least half the residents of the island .  the solution is that we freeze the tax assessments , we get the services to this island , so the people can live here ,  he said .  families can move back in , have children here , have jobs on the mainland , or even develop their own economy here on the island .  tax assessors board chairman james larkin suggests the sapelo residents brought this issue on themselves , as some began to sell their property to developers and non-islanders who built bigger , upscale vacation homes , causing valuations to increase , and along with them their property taxes .  if they had n't started selling their property , there would n't be a problem ,  he told cnn . but reginald hall is n't buying that argument . he and his family own three properties on more than seven acres of property on the island . the assessed  fair market value  of their property went from $ 176,075 in 2011 to $ 910,333 in 2012 . that brought on increase of more than 500 % in property taxes . he is refusing to pay the taxes and he refuses to sell his family land , which he says is worth over $ 3 million .  once you leave , you are separated from more family members ... which is a real interruption in the generational teachings on this island of the culture ,  he said .  we leave , and we 're gone . ca n't come back , because if we try to come back after we sell , you ca n't afford to buy ,  he told cnn . cornelia bailey said her land may be worth about $ 384,000 , but in reality it is priceless .  i told one guy it was priceless , and he said everything has a price , and i said , you do n't know me , this is priceless . you do n't have enough money to buy it , so forget it ,  she said .  we have a legacy that most people would die to have . we 're fighting to keep it even for the unborn .
