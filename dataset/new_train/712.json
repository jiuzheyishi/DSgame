{"text": "no other way to obey : labour deputy leader harriet harman said she supports calls for a press regulator . labour will back statutory regulation of the press deputy leader harriet harman reveals today . in an interview with the spectator magazine , miss harman said the opposition supports calls for a law to set up a press regulator , arguing there is no other way of ensuring papers agree to obey the rules . the intervention puts labour at odds with some senior tories , including the prime minister , who has warned that he would prefer to avoid statutory regulation since that could lead future generations of mps to meddle with press freedom . miss harman has made clear labour opposes political interference in the content of papers , and any attempt to police the division between fact and comment - proposals examined by lord justice leveson 's inquiry into the media . but she rejected a proposal drawn up by lord black and lord hunt on behalf of the existing regulator the press complaints commission which would have seen papers sign a binding contract with the regulator to stick to the rules with punitive fines when they are broken . that plan would avoid the need for a new law , but miss harman said that would not be tough enough since it may lack the teeth to force proprietors like richard desmond of the daily express - who withdrew from the pcc . miss harman said : ` the big challenge is how you make sure that we get a proper press complaints system , ' arguing that previous failures ` gave the press a sense of impunity ' . ` in terms of the press complaints the fundamental issue is not having a situation where people decide not to opt into a press complaints system . ` any press complaints system has got to deal with the problem of impunity . it has got to apply to all the newspapers not just those who chose to have it apply to them . apply to all : miss harman said the challenge will be getting a ` proper press complaints system ' and that it must apply to all newspapers , ` not just those who chose to have it apply to them ' ` for all that guy black and lord hunt think that people are going to sign binding contracts , richard desmond has already said he might not , so i think there will need to be a statutory underpinning ' of the new organisation ` independent from parliament , politicians and government ' . she added : ` it 's hard to see how you can otherwise have something which applies to all newspapers but which does not gave that power . however else could it be done ? ' the way is now paved for a political row over the recommendations of lord justice leveson , who is expected to propose some sort of statutory regime when he reports next month . nick clegg has said the lib dems will back leveson , and if necessary a statutory code as long as his proposals are ` proportionate ' . will back it : nick clegg said the lib dems will back leveson , and if necessary a statutory code as long as his proposals are ` proportionate ' she also insisted that newspaper websites should be covered by the same press code of conduct as their papers - despite claims from editors that this puts them at a commercial disadvantage relative to other internet media outlets . ` it 's the newspapers ' own code so it 's quite invidious of them to argue that it ' s oppressive for them to abide by it when they 've said that is the code they themselves have adopted . ` the papers remain very influential particularly in setting the whole agenda for the rest of the media so having accountability is very important . ' she said it would be ` difficult ' to draw up a new regulator for internet publications but would merely ask some web-based media outlets to ` opt-in ' to the new organisation . ` you could certainly have a position which applies to all newspapers but allows them to opt-in even if they 're offshore .
