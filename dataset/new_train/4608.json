{"text": "washington a late evening meeting between president barack obama and the leaders of the house and senate failed to reach agreement wednesday on a spending plan to avert a government shutdown , but all the participants said progress was made and talks would continue . if there is no deal by midnight friday , when the current spending authorization measure expires , parts of the government will close down . obama called the 90-minute talks with house speaker john boehner , r-ohio , and senate majority leader harry reid , d-nevada ,  constructive  and he said they narrowed and clarified the outstanding issues .  i remain confident that if we 're serious about getting something done , we should be able to complete a deal and get it passed and avert a shutdown ,  obama said in brief remarks to reporters .  but it 's going to require a sufficient sense of urgency from all parties involved  to prevent a shutdown that  could have real effects on everyday americans .  both reid and boehner told reporters in their own brief comments that the meeting made progress in narrowing their differences , and that their staffs would work through the night to try to reach further consensus .  i have confidence we can get this done ,  said reid , who criticized boehner and republicans earlier in the day for intransigence .  we 're not there yet .  boehner , standing next to reid , said  we do have some honest differences ,  and he emphasized there was no agreement on either a specific figure for spending cuts for the rest of the current fiscal year or on policy issues that the republicans want included in the measure , such as specifically prohibiting funding for abortions .  no one wants the government to shut down ,  boehner said . time : are we headed for a shutdown ? obama called the meeting because of a lack of progress in negotiations during the day , white house spokesman jay carney told reporters . a white house source familiar with the situation , speaking on condition of not being identified , told cnn that  there was almost no progress made today .   there would n't be a meeting if it was n't a necessary step at this stage in the process ,  the source said of the evening talks . boehner announced earlier that the house of representatives will try to buy more time for negotiators by voting thursday on a one-week government funding bill that would cut spending by $ 12 billion and fund the pentagon for the remainder of the current fiscal year . gop budget chief calls for $ 6.2 trillion in spending cuts .  republicans have no interest in shutting down the government ,  boehner insisted . but  we are going to fight for as many spending cuts as we can get .  gop leaders said they were prepared to pass the bill on a strict party-line vote if necessary . democrats , insistent they have already met the republicans more than halfway in negotiations , oppose such a measure , and it was considered unlikely to clear the senate . in two speeches on the senate floor during the day , reid accused gop leaders of being unwilling to compromise because of pressure from the conservative tea party movement to cut deeper and include provisions on political issues .  we meet them halfway , they say no . we meet them all the way , they say no ,  reid said , calling the latest proposed extension from the house a  diversion  from making  tough choices  to settle the matter .  the republican leadership has the tea party screaming so loudly in its right ear that it ca n't hear what the vast majority of the country demands ,  reid said . tea party : bring on a government shutdown . obama , on the road in pennsylvania , declared that he did n't  want to see washington politics stand in the way of america 's progress .   at a time when you are struggling to pay your bills and meet your responsibilities , the least we can do -lrb- is -rrb- meet our responsibilities to produce a budget ,  he said .  that 's not too much to ask for .  obama blamed the gop for using the budget crisis to push provisions relating to hot-button issues such as abortion , health care and the environment . debates over those issues were holding back talks , he said . boehner has insisted his caucus will not back down on those issues . he proposed the one-week extension after meeting with his republican house colleagues . reporters outside heard applause from within the room at one point . republican sources told cnn the applause was for boehner when he choked up while thanking his colleagues for their support on the issue . government shutdown : white house details consequences . behind all the rhetorical bluster and bombast , however , negotiations continued unabated . obama talked to both boehner and reid over the phone earlier wednesday , and democratic and republican leadership staffers continued meeting on capitol hill in an attempt to break the stalemate . obama met tuesday with congressional leaders including reid and boehner , and warned then that he would seek further meetings if the negotiations yielded insufficient progress . as for the overall numbers , negotiators were looking at a package of cuts for the rest of the fiscal year that would probably total a bit over $ 33 billion but less than $ 40 billion , according to a democratic congressional source . the fiscal year ends september 30 . ireport : looming government shutdown . the republican-led house has passed a bill that included $ 61 billion in cuts from current spending levels , but it was rejected by the democrat-controlled senate . two previous extensions of the government spending resolution have included $ 10 billion in cuts . in response to the looming budget deadline , the u.s. office of personnel management posted information on its website tuesday about how a shutdown would affect federal employees . the posting said that most federal workers paid with funds appropriated by congress would go on temporary furlough in the event of a shutdown . it would be up to congress to decide if furloughed workers get paid for the time missed when the shutdown ends , the posting said . health benefits continue if the shutdown lasts for less than a year , it said . if there is a shutdown , an estimated 800,000 government workers will likely be asked to stay home , according to senior administration officials . among other things , the irs will stop processing paper tax returns , the small business administration will stop making loans and federal home loan guarantees will be put on hold . u.s. troops would be paid through friday , but after that , paychecks to members of the military , including those in war zones , would stop . the national institutes of health would stop accepting new patients and would put clinical trials on hold . a justice department spokesperson said on condition of not being identified that  critical national security , law enforcement and prison operations  would continue in the event of a shutdown . political ticker : nation split on shutdown blame game .  all fbi personnel in the field will continue to work , and the department will be ready to respond to any and all contingencies that might arise during this time ,  the justice spokesperson said . however , some functions including civil litigation , outreach to crime victims and grant processing would be stopped or curtailed , the spokesperson said . congressional veterans from both sides of the aisle indicated wednesday a strong desire to avoid a shutdown .  my concern with a shutdown is , what is our long-term goal ? what are we trying to achieve ?  asked rep. mike simpson , r-idaho , a senior member of the house appropriations committee .  if it is repeal obamacare -lrb- the health care reform law enacted last year -rrb- , do we think in two weeks or a month obama 's going to go , ` you guys were right , ' and sign onto it ? i do n't think so . so you better look at what your goals are and what you 're willing to accept , or do n't do it .  sen. barbara mikulski , d-maryland , said a shutdown would mean  enormous negative consequences , and i think we 're going to rue the day the way we 're functioning here . we need to come to the table and ... act like rational human beings .  republicans , under pressure from the conservative tea party movement to make deep cuts that would reduce the size of government , blame democrats for failing to pass a fiscal year 2011 budget last year when they controlled both congressional chambers . they also say that obama and his party are ignoring the peril of the rising federal deficits and national debt . democrats contend that the $ 61 billion in spending cuts in the house bill would harm the economic recovery and slash education and innovation programs essential for continued growth . obama and reid both insist that democrats have agreed to more than 50 % of the spending cuts sought by republicans , which they said should be sufficient for a compromise on an issue that has little overall effect on the deficit and debt issues . the budget brinkmanship shows the political stakes of the situation , with both parties trying to depict the other as unwilling to do what 's right for the country . boehner has cast aside assertions by democrats that they had agreed to more than half the cuts sought by the gop , saying the democrats used  smoke and mirrors to get there .  a senior democratic source with knowledge of the ongoing negotiations said the biggest obstacle to a deal involves whether reductions in mandatory spending programs , known in appropriations parlance as  changes in mandatory spending  or chimps , should be part of spending cuts . examples of mandatory spending programs include pell grants , the children 's health insurance program and some types of highway funding . such programs are funded for multiple years at a time , with the spending set for the time period covered , exempt from congressional authorization each year . democratic sources have said they want about half the overall cuts in this spending bill to come from mandatory spending programs , and they have proposed the necessary reductions in programs at the u.s. department of agriculture , the justice department and the treasury department , and in pell grants . republicans , who want any spending cuts to reflect a reduction in the size of government , note that reducing the spending in a mandatory program for one year does n't prevent the amount from returning to its original level the following year . cnn 's dana bash , deirdre walsh , ted barrett , kate bolduan , terry frieden and dan lothian contributed to this report .", "summary": " new : evening meeting with obama , congressional leaders fails to bring agreement
