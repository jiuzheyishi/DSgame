{"text": "whose side are you on ? a : i do n't like hockey . -lrb-  i ca n't see the puck .   too many fights .   i do n't get the rules .   i ca n't name a player except that wayne what 's - his-name . gatsor : . b : i like hockey . -lrb-  a lot better in person than on tv .   baseball 's so slow .   basketball 's all guys 8 feet tall .   i would n't watch soccer if you paid me .  -rrb- . me , i am b. hockey and i are old friends . i grew up in chicago , right now the hottest town on ice . i also lived in detroit , the self-named  hockeytown , usa .  i now reside in los angeles , current home of the game 's stanley cup . -lrb- that 's the trophy that goes to the championship team , for those of you who would n't know a stanley cup from a sippy cup . -rrb- . the chicago blackhawks have been in the news . why ? well , that 's a good question . because they win a lot ? uh , kind of . because they do n't lose ? er , technically , no . i will try to explain it if you 've got a couple of minutes to kill . -lrb- which is also a hockey thing ... killing a couple of minutes while a guy 's in a penalty box . -rrb- . chicago 's record is 21-0 . that 's how it looks in the national hockey league 's standings , at least . w 21 , l 0 . are the blackhawks unbeaten ? um , no . bleacher report : top 25 all-time chicago blackhawks . it 's a little complicated . a hockey game no longer can end in a tie . it uses an overtime period to break a tie . if that does n't work , a  shootout  is held , similar to soccer 's . one-on-one vs. a goaltender until someone wins . as a reward for extending a game to overtime , a team is given a bonus point by the nhl . so , even if you lose a game in extra time -- as the blackhawks have -- you did n't  lose .  already knew that ? hey , you obviously know your hockey ! -lrb- quick trivia question : a team in ohio is called the columbus blue jackets . true or false ? -rrb- . if you are into pucks , you might be aware that the blackhawks put together a pretty cool 30-game streak over a span of two seasons without being defeated in three 20-minute periods . chicago is aware . chicago 's on fire . the team is the talk of the town . cubs , schmubs . on national tv 's sports news , the two smokin ' - hot teams have been basketball 's miami heat -lrb- beating almost everybody they play -rrb- and hockey 's blackhawks -lrb- kinda sorta technically not losing to anybody they play -rrb- . i suppose you have heard of miami 's basketball star . his name is lebron james . he grew up in ohio , where he never once wanted to grow up to be a blue jacket . but he did tweet that the blackhawks are awesome . i do not know if you know who chicago 's hockey stars are . one of them is jonathan toews , which is pronounced  taves ,  not toes , not tweeze . he went to the university of north dakota , as most great athletes do . -lrb- ok , maybe not  most .  -rrb- . another one is marian hossa , which is pronounced  ho sa ,  not hoss sa , not hah sa . he is from stara lubovna , slovakia , where everybody probably watches him on cnn with no clue who lebron james is . a definite one is patrick kane , as in citizen . he was born and raised in buffalo , new york , where a boy is so lucky because he can play ice hockey outdoors 10 to 11 months a year . bleacher report : why the 2013 chicago blackhawks will go down as one of the best teams ever . together with some sharp teammates , not the least of whom is patrick sharp , these guys have got chicago rocking and rolling . from the time tenor jim cornelison operatically belts out our national anthem -lrb- or canada 's -rrb- to the times they pump up the volume to  chelsea dagger  by the fratellis to celebrate a blackhawk goal , a home game at the united center is usually loud , usually sro and usually bigger than bieber and beyonce rolled into one . if i exaggerate , sue me . i checked with jay blunk to find out just how big things there are . jay is the team 's executive vice president .  we 've been very fortunate to experience unprecedented television ratings ,  he told me wednesday .  merchandise sales have accelerated . the nhl announced that jonathan toews ' jersey sales were the number one-selling jersey in the country for the month of february . we also just passed the 200 consecutive-game sellout mark . tickets have become some of the hottest regular season tickets in history .  if he exaggerates -- and i doubt it -- do n't sue me . i 'm enjoying this too much . you see , it was n't so long ago my boyhood favorites the blackhawks were skating on -lrb- insert  thin ice  cliche here -rrb- . they looked as dead in the water as a cruise ship . a great organization had become disorganized . a popular team to watch had disappeared off the radar . a team born in 1926 had turned into the walking dead -lrb- on skates -rrb- . chicagoans lost interest . they had ditka 's da bears , followed by jordan 's da bulls , followed by a 2003 cubs team that could have won the world series and a 2005 white sox team that did . i moved back there in 2003 . the bad blackhawk team of 2003-04 played in 74 games and won 20 . espn the magazine ranked it 119th of 120 franchises in all of sports , in terms of ownership , fan relations , players , coaching , intangibles such as  bang for your buck ,  ahead of only the houston texans , a new pro football team with zero dark history . home games were n't even shown on tv . on the nightly news , sportscasters gave time to highlights from games of the chicago wolves , a minor-league team , almost as much as they did the blackhawks . hey , if i liked minor-league hockey , i 'd live in rockford . i seldom saw anybody in a blackhawk jersey go out in public anymore , except maybe mike myers from  wayne 's world .  the 2004-05 season did n't happen . a union war broke out , and the nhl 's whole season was wiped out . chicago basically yawned . the blackhawks had n't won a stanley cup since 1961 . that was their first since 1938 . bleacher report : how will history view this team ? i was a hockey guy . i was n't just familiar with old-time hockey names such as bobby hull . i knew kenny wharram and ab mcdonald and  moose  vasko and bill hay . i thought of them as other chicago sports fans might think of a dick butkus or an ernie banks . so you can see , almost as exciting as winning 2010 's stanley cup was , why the 2013 superstart of the blackhawks is a sight to behold . los angeles finally cracked the ice ceiling in 2012 with the kings ' first championship , which was a pleasure to watch . i have a daughter who recently asked whether i could get her hockey tickets . she did n't want one direction or lady gaga . she wanted kings versus red wings . i was so proud . hockey is n't for everybody . it 's just for us cool people . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of mike downey .", "summary": " the chicago blackhawks are on a winning streak .   mike downey : home games are  bigger than bieber and beyonce rolled into one    downey remembers when local chicago tv stations did n't even carry blackhawks games .   before 2010 , the blackhawks had n't won a stanley cup since 1961 .
