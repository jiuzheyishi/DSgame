{"text": "this feels like a homecoming to kenny miller . his heart had long been set on a return to rangers . pretty much , it seems , from the moment he left in 2011 . for all that longing , miller could never have imagined what would happen to the club between his second and third spells as an employee . the bitter experience of administration and slumping to the foot of the league ladder has been followed by almost incessant turmoil off the field . even now , with the club just one step short of climbing back into the top flight , uncertainty still lingers . video : scroll down to see kenny miller 's on rejoining rangers for a third ibrox spell . homecoming : kenny miller has returned to rangers after penning a one-year deal . the club 's board and a section of its support have spent the summer at loggerheads over season-ticket renewals , with the exact uptake yet to be made public . the financial situation is regarded by most as fragile yet that did not put off miller in the slightest . even at 34 , he would not have been short of other options - but rangers was the only interest he pursued . insisting he did not seek any assurances over the club 's future , miller 's only concern is what could happen on the field of play as ally mccoist 's side seek to gain promotion from the championship . ` i 've not sought anything , ' he said . ` i 'm here to play football . if things happen off the field then i 'm sure i 'll have to deal with it like everybody else at the club when that happens , but hopefully it wo n't . goal machine : miller has netted 67 times for rangers during his first two spells . ` hopefully , we wo n't get back to the situation we have found ourselves in before . for me , i wanted to come back to this club to play football , pull that jersey on and get out in that stadium in front of these fantastic fans again . i am fortunate enough to have that opportunity . ` any time i meet anyone and speak about rangers it 's always , one , am i coming back ? and , two , they would like to see me back here . ` the chat has always been about football and not what 's happened off the field or what 's going to happen off the field . ` it 's all been about getting this club back to where it belongs , which is challenging at the top . ' asked if the speculation about rangers ' off-field health might dissuade other players , he added : ` that 's every footballer 's prerogative but it was never an issue for me . i wanted to come back no matter what 's gone on . feeling at home : miller is back for a third spell at ibrox . ` i want to play for this football club and i 'm just delighted that it 's done now . if anyone else has reservations then that 's up to them . ' for miller , signing his contract earlier this week completed ` a long , long process of trying to come back ' , after previous possibilities were wrecked by a whole variety of circumstances . the question now is whether he will be the only ibrox old boy to return this summer . mccoist is also thought to be keen on kris boyd , out of contract at kilmarnock and attracting interest from both aberdeen and dundee united . it remains to be seen whether a deal for the 30-year-old can come to fruition , but miller would be more than happy to renew their previous partnership . ` i think kris would excite everyone , when you see what he brought to the club in the four-and-a-half years he was here , ' said miller . ` he scored an incredible amount of goals . ` that 's what he does . last season he scored 22 league goals for a struggling kilmarnock team , which is phenomenal . ` i 've spoken to kris and i think that , if the opportunity was there , it 's something he would be interested in . ` personally , i 'm just happy to be here and i 'd like to thank the chief executive and the manager for giving me that chance . back where he belongs : miller has returned to scotland from a spell in canada with vancouver whitecaps . ` whoever comes in or whoever i 'm asked to play alongside up front , i 'll be delighted to do it . just pulling on that jersey again will be enough but if the big man comes back he will definitely be an asset for the club . ' pulling on a darker blue shirt again remains unlikely . miller retired from scotland duty last year to concentrate on his club career with vancouver whitecaps and to limit the number of draining transatlantic flights . those travel concerns are no longer present , but he feels gordon strachan has plenty of more youthful options to spearhead a push for euro 2016 qualification . ` you 're spot-on that my decision to stop playing for the national team was largely down to those flights , ' admitted miller , capped 69 times . ` it was hard for me to do that travelling and still perform at optimum levels for my country , and also to go back to canada or the states and then be fully fit to play for my club the following saturday . ` that was really tough and , ultimately , it was a big part of my decision . now that i 'm back i 've no thoughts about coming out of that retirement and making myself available for selection . ` scotland 's results in the last year have been excellent and i hope that we continue to make progress under gordon strachan . ` we have a lot of fantastic younger boys available to play in my position and i 'm sure we have more than enough to make sure that we 're challenging for a place at euro 2016 . ' his focus will , therefore , be on a demanding domestic challenge with rangers pitched in alongside hearts and hibs in a second tier unlike any other in the past . club before country : miller has no plans to come out of retirement and add to his 69 caps for scotland . miller is confident that it will bring the best out of the existing ibrox squad . how long it will take for the club to be restored to the top flight-winning force he once knew is a different question . ` who knows ? ' said miller . ` the first aim this year is to win this league and get back into the top flight . ` after that , we know what this club 's about - winning trophies . there is not going to be any thinking that we 've got a couple of years to get back in contention . ` we need to be challenging straight away , it 's as simple as that . that 's what the players will be looking to do . ` how long it will take , who knows ? but i know for a fact that if i am here next year and we are in the top flight , there 's no way i will be settling for second best .
