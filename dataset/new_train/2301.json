{"text": " duck dynasty  star phil robertson is back on a&e after a short suspension over controversial remarks he made about gays and black people . while the right is congratulating itself on winning this battle , it 's actually losing its war on marriage equality . but both developments are good for america . what do i mean ? simple : while i completely disagree with robertson 's view on gays , he has the right -- which i defend -- to practice his faith and advocate his political and religious beliefs . the debate that erupted after his comments is healthy for our nation . if a person espouses views that others find offensive , they should be countered -- not silenced . and the right losing its war on marriage equality is also good for our nation because we must eradicate discrimination in all forms . to those who do n't understand -lrb- or refuse to understand -rrb- how opposing marriage equality is discrimination , all you need to do is check out three court decisions announced , coincidentally enough , during the same time period that the robertson controversy raged . first , the new mexico supreme court ruled on december 19 that marriage equality would be the law of that state . the court declared that  barring individuals from marrying and depriving them of the rights , protections , and responsibilities of civil marriage solely because of their sexual orientation violates the equal protection clause .  then on december 20 , federal district judge robert shelby struck down both utah 's statutes and an amendment to the utah constitution that had been approved by voters in 2004 banning same-sex marriage . shelby found that the state 's  prohibition on same-sex marriage conflicts with the united states constitution 's guarantees of equal protection and due process under the law .  shelby also interestingly noted that the lawyers opposing same-sex marriage were making arguments that were  almost identical  to those offered by opponents of interracial marriage in the 1960s -- including that each was a  threat to society .  while the decision is on appeal , currently gay couples are free to marry in utah . and then on december 23 , federal judge timothy black ruled that ohio public officials must recognize same-sex marriages when issuing death certificates . consequently , gay couples married legally in other states would have the same rights as straight couples under ohio law . as black instructively noted ,  the question is presented whether a state can do what the federal government can not -- i.e. , discriminate against same-sex couples ... simply because the majority of the voters do n't like homosexuality -lrb- or at least did n't in 2004 . -rrb- under the constitution of the united states , the answer is no .  let 's be honest : these court decisions are vastly more important than whether multimillionaire phil robertson returns to his reality tv show . and keep in mind , while a&e lifted robertson 's suspension , it also announced it would  use this moment  to air public service announcements  promoting unity , tolerance and acceptance among all people .  a&e : star of ` duck dynasty ' is back . putting partisan fighting aside , marriage equality will be the law of the land in the future -- it 's just a question of when . the u.s. supreme court in june struck down the defense of marriage act . currently , 18 states and the district of columbia recognize marriage equality . that 's up from 12 just six months ago . and despite what some on the right will tell you , opinion polls are clear that a majority of americans now support marriage equality . astoundingly , adults younger than 30 support marriage equality by a whopping 81 % . indeed , the generational divide on this issue could n't be more apparent than when you compare the views of two self-described rednecks on gays : phil robertson versus honey boo boo . while robertson likened gays to those who commit bestiality , the much younger honey boo boo stated last year :  ai n't nothin ' wrong with bein ' a little gay . everybody 's a little gay .  the fact that our nation is moving to embrace marriage equality can not come as a surprise to anyone with a sense of our country 's history . we are by our nature a progressive nation -- it 's one of the reasons we are an exceptional country . true , it may take a great deal of blood , sweat and tears , but we move forward . we have seen this from the fight for women 's right to vote , to ending segregation , to striking down laws that banned interracial marriage . until the day marriage equality is recognized , we can expect to see a vibrant , healthy -- and hopefully respectful -- debate on this issue . and that is something we should treasure , because that , too , is one of the reasons our nation is exceptional . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of dean obeidallah .", "summary": " right wins  duck dynasty  battle but losing war , dean obeidallah says .   marriage equality will be the law of the land in the future , he says .   vibrant , healthy debate is one reason our nation is exceptional , he says .
