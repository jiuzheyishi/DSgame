{"text": "kimi raikkonen can offer no excuses for his poor start as ferrari technical director james allison says it 's simply because he 's driving ` slower than fernando -lrb- alonso -rrb- at the moment ' . the anticipated duel with alonso has failed to materialise with the spaniard out-qualifying raikkonen in four of the six races and , crucially , finishing ahead in every grand prix . raikkonen is languishing in 12th place while alonso is the best of the rest when it comes to drivers ' standings , third only to runaway mercedes pair nico rosberg and lewis hamilton . slow start : kimi raikkonen -lrb- pictured -rrb- has failed to ignite a duel with ferrari team-mate fernando alonso . losing battle : raikkonen was out-qualified in four of six races by alonso and sits 12th in the drivers ' standings . speed : raikkonen has been urged to up his game by ferrari technical director james allison . in terms of points , alonso has amassed 61 compared to raikkonen 's less-than-impressive 17 . alonso is in his fifth season with ferrari and has full knowledge of how the team works , while raikkonen is only in the first year of his return to the maranello marque . the cars , however , were a clean slate given the radical regulations . but raikkonen seems to not have adapted to the changes as naturally as alonso . ` i 'm not sure it 's entirely fair to say he is struggling more than fernando , ' said allison in assessing raikkonen 's form to date ahead of this weekend 's canadian grand prix in montreal . ` they both have similar feedback with the car , and there are aspects of this year 's rules that make the cars across the pit-lane a far from easy aspect for the driver . ` there is a lot more torque from the engine , a lot less aerodynamic grip , and the tyres are deliberately less aggressive than last year . ` all that means they are quite a handful to drive , not too breezy for anyone , be that at the front or back of the grid . ` the . problems kimi has with the car under braking , downshifting , are the . same as fernando , and pretty much the same as being experienced by other . drivers at other teams . ` he 's just going a little slower than fernando at the moment , but that gap is closing as the year progresses . ' no contest : alonso has adapted to the radical changes more naturally than his ferrari team-mate . looking down : raikkonen has a mere 17 points compared to alonso 's 61 in the drivers ' standings . ferrari expected to be in the hunt for this year 's championships , only for mercedes to outclass them after the rules overhaul . it is allison 's first full season as technical director after leaving lotus a year ago , and he recognises the sizable task . ` it 's tough . making a car quick that was n't quick in the first race is a particularly challenging task , ' added allison . ` it 's very difficult to produce a rate of improvement substantially different to the people we are fighting with . ` however , we 've had a race or two where the pieces we took to the track were useful , but not big steps forward . ` we hope in the coming races to have a more steady progression of things we hope will lift us up in our competitiveness . ` but we wo n't know for sure until we get there because it depends on what everyone else does . ' i do n't think we can claim to have produced a chassis that is , at the moment , the equal of either the mercedes or the red bull . ` we 're not lagging hugely behind , but there is work for us to do before we can hold our hands up and say we are completely happy with the chassis performance . ' view : raikkonen ended in 12th in the monaco f1 grand prix , while alonso finished a more respectable fourth .", "summary": " ferrari technical director james allison admits kimi raikkonen is ` going a little slower than fernando -lrb- alonso -rrb- at the moment '   alonso out-qualified raikkonen in four of the six races and finished ahead in every grand prix .   alonso is third in drivers ' standings , behind mercedes ' nico rosberg and lewis hamilton , while raikkonen is 12th .
