{"text": "it was a staggering sight , even in a mexican city that has seen its share of violence in recent years as drug-related crimes surged . seven bodies sat slumped in white plastic chairs placed near a central plaza in uruapan , mexico . local media reported messages were left behind , written on poster board and pinned to some of the victims ' bodies with icepicks . the men appeared to have been killed by gunfire , and investigators believe organized crime groups are to blame , mexico 's state-run notimex news agency said . investigators have n't provided details about who they suspect was responsible or why they targeted the men -- windshield washers and farm workers , according to notimex . uruapan , a city of a quarter million people in the western state of michoacan , made headlines in 2006 when members of a drug cartel -- la familia michoacana -- hurled five decapitated heads of rival gang members onto a dance floor there . that cartel has since fractured , but violence in the region has remained a grisly reality . the seven corpses found in uruapan last weekend were among at least 30 killed nationwide -- a high death toll that once again drew attention toward drug-related violence in mexico , where more than 60,000 people were killed in drug-related violence from 2006 to 2012 , according to human rights watch . read more : rape case in mexican resort city puts violence back into the spotlight . the violence comes as mexican president enrique pena nieto pushes a new strategy aimed at focusing more on dealing with social and economic issues that fuel the drug trade and less on combating cartels head-on . uruapan is among the metropolitan areas in mexico tapped for the president 's new program , which aims to prevent violence , school dropouts , addiction and domestic violence , and also to better detect problems in mexico 's education system . without jobs and social programs , pena nieto told cnn last year , millions of mexicans  have no other option than to dedicate themselves sometimes to criminal activity .  the goal of the government 's new strategy , interior minister miguel angel osorio chong said last month , is creating a  culture of peace and respecting the law .  mexico reports more than 26,000 missing .  it is the responsibility of the state to pursue criminals and punish them to preserve peace and harmony ,  he said ,  but we are convinced that fighting and punishment alone do not resolve the problem .  some analysts have praised the new government approach .  the cartels have been able to recruit tens of thousands of killers in part because poor neighborhoods have been systematically abandoned over decades and lack sufficient schools , community centers and security -- in short they lack opportunity ,  the international crisis group said in a recent report on mexico 's cartel violence .  there are many dedicated mexican social workers with the experience and ability to reach the vulnerable groups if they are given resources . if they succeed in reducing violence , theirs can become a security model to follow instead of one to fear .  will the new strategy work ? is this past weekend 's violence in uruapan and elsewhere a sign that the new tack is n't working ? it 's soon to tell , less than four month 's into pena nieto 's presidency , one analyst told cnn en español this week .  in politics , there are no miracles , in economics , there are no miracles , and in security even less so ,  said jose carreno , a mexican journalist who has covered the government 's security strategy .  they are things that happen little by little , gaining ground piece by piece .  it could be up to a year before any significant changes show up in statistics , he said . and it 's likely mexican military troops deployed by former president felipe calderon to fight cartels will remain in the streets for another year as well , he said .  i do not see any immediate substitute for them ,  he said . some mexicans have said they are n't ready to wait for a change in the government 's approach . self-defense groups have started forming in some areas where government troops have n't been able to put a stop to cartel violence .  we think the government is very timid , very slow ,  sergio mejia , the head of an association of restaurant and business owners in acapulco , told cnn last month .  if there is no immediate response , it leaves us no choice but to join the fight .  authorities are investigating the emerging defense groups , a top mexican official told cnn en español this week .  it is an investigation to find out who they are , what weapons they have , how many of them there are , what they are pursuing , etc. . we have them located , mapped , all of them . we are busy resolving the issue ,  said manuel mondragon , mexico 's national security commissioner .  what are we going to do ? well , this is an issue that i ca n't reveal openly , but what i can say is that we have them precisely located and identified .  13-year-old assassin murdered in mexico . u.s. approach also shifting . in a report to congress this month , the u.s. state department said some efforts to combat cartels in mexico have paid off . major cartel leaders have been captured , the report says , and the number of annual deaths because of drug-related violence declined from 2011 to 2012 . the united states and mexico 's cooperation to fight cartels is  unprecedented ,  according to the state department 's 2013 international narcotics control strategy report , which says the united states has provided $ 1.1 billion in security aid to mexico since 2008 through the merida initiative . more leaders of criminal organizations have been brought to justice as a result , the report says .  that success , however , has also resulted in smaller , fractured organizations that have violently attempted to consolidate their power ,  the report says . and with profits from the drug trade dropping , cartels have turned to other activities , such as kidnapping , extortion and human trafficking . the report suggests that for the united states , too , it 's time for a new approach .  the focus of u.s.-mexico cooperation has shifted from providing large-scale equipment to engaging in training and capacity building , and from focusing on the federal-level to building state - and municipal-level capabilities . accordingly , justice sector reforms , drug demand reduction , and culture of lawfulness initiatives should play a larger role ,  the report said .  the united states should also continue programs to curb its domestic drug demand and inhibit the illegal flow of arms and cash into mexico .  pena nieto has been pushing for ties for the neighboring nations to go beyond the drug war . and security issues received only a slight mention in statements from both governments wednesday announcing president barack obama 's plans to visit mexico in may . as officials change their tones and tactics , authorities in uruapan also will be trying a new approach , mexico 's state-run notimex news agency reported wednesday . next month , officials will open trade-in centers there and elsewhere in michoacan state where residents can receive tablets , netbooks or money . in exchange , they 'll have to hand in their guns . slaying highlights violence at mexican tourist hotspot .", "summary": " seven dead bodies sit slumped in white plastic chairs left in a public view in a mexican city .   the city is one of the places tapped for a new program from mexico 's president .   the new strategy focuses on dealing with social and economic issues that fuel the drug trade .   analyst : it 's too soon to tell whether the new approach is working .
