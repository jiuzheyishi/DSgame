{"text": "the analysis of mh370 's erratic final movements paints a terrifying picture of the doomed flight 's last moments , with an expert saying they fit the pattern of a pilot on a suicide mission who wanted to crash the plane in one of the world 's most inaccessible areas . the remote crash site , now tracked to 2,500 kms off australia 's west coast , means salvage teams might never recover the plane 's black box , which would leave the flight 's fate forever shrouded in mystery . if that 's the case , it would mean the family of a pilot , passenger or crew member responsible would still be eligible for compensation payments . the stunning analysis follows reports malaysian police have made mh370 's pilot the key focus of their immediate investigation , with officers interviewing captain zaharie ahmad shah 's family and friends about his behaviour and mindset in the days leading up to the flight . meanwhile , authorities have again been forced to call off the search for debris , with bad weather hampering their efforts for the second time in just three days . scroll down for video . ` last joyride ' : the pilot was upset over his marriage breakdown and was ` not in the right frame of mind to be flying ' troubled mindset : investigators are now focusing on captain zaharie ahmad shah , interviewing friends and family about the pilot 's state of mind . authorities have been able to piece together a rough snapshot of the mystery flight 's final moments . shortly after its final voice communication on march 8 , flight mh370 reportedly climbed suddenly to between 43,000 and 45,000 ft where it remained for 23 minutes . military radar then picked up the plane flying as low as 5,000 ft. the distance to the now-defined crash site means the plane must have then climbed to a normal cruising altitude of around 35,000 ft before eventually plunging into the southern indian ocean ... family troubles : zaharie ahmed shah , captain of malaysian flight mh370 , with his family . one experienced pilot told mailonline that the sudden climb could have been a tactic to incapacitate the passengers and crew , ruling out a mechanical failure and instead blaming ` deliberate human interaction ' . he said the drop to 5,000 ft could have been to re-pressurise the plane , before climbing again to its normal cruising altitude , before : ` flying to a remote location where you know no one would ever find it . that way insurers would still pay out to your loved ones . ' if the cabin was to be depressurised at 45,000 ft , experts say , passengers and crew would only have about 15 seconds of functional consciousness before beginning to pass out . any one without access to a bottled oxygen supply - like the one found in the cockpit - would be dead in minutes . australian aviation security expert , mark bishop , said that at that height , even the masks that automatically drop from the ceiling - which mix oxygen with cabin air - would only extend consciousness for up to 15 minutes as their flow is n't strong enough to stave off the effects of hypoxia at that altitude . ` even with the oxygen out , it would only give them 15 minutes or so , ' he said . ` eventually they 'd pass out even with their masks on . ' search abandoned : thursday 's salvage mission had to be aborted due to bad weather . it 's the second time in three days the planes and boats have been ordered back to base . international effort : the search team now includes military from australia , usa , japan and china . the high-ranking officer told usa today that the investigation 's immediate focus was pilot , saying that nobody else aboard the plane was capable of the maneuvers they now know the plane made shortly before dropping off radar . captain zaharie 's son , ahmad seth , says he has ` ignored all the speculation ' around his father . captain zaharie 's son , ahmad seth , today broke his silence , saying he has ` ignored all the speculation ' around his 53-year-old father since the plane mysteriously disappeared en route to beijing from kuala lumpur 19 days ago . and the 26-year-old , captain zaharie 's youngest son , says the family has yet to accept the official ruling that all 239 people on board are dead , insisting they will wait for physical evidence . i 've read everything online . but i 've ignored all the speculation , ' he told the new strait times . ` we may not be as close as he travels so much . but i understand him . ` now , we are just waiting for the right confirmation . i will believe it when i see the proof in front of my eyes .
