{"text": "debbie grosch-squance became seriously ill with a flesh eating bug after contracting a chest infection . doctors had to amputate her right leg to save her life . for many of us , struggling out in the cold this winter to exercise sounds like a nightmare . but for debbie grosch-squance , it 's something she feared might never be possible . debbie , a mother-of-two from plymouth , lost her right leg after a chest infection spiralled out of control . she became severely ill with a flesh-eating bug and in order to save her life , doctors had to amputate her right leg . today , she says she is fitter than she has ever been and also slimmer -- and she hopes her story will inspire others in similar situations . her problems began after she developed a nasty cough and chest infection . ` i 've always been fit and healthy but this chesty cough really knocked me for six , ' she told mailonline . ` my gp advised me to take paracetamol and ibuprofen but then two days later i began to experience a cramp-like pain in my right calf . it got progressively worse and nothing would ease it . ' after another visit to her gp she was provisionally diagnosed with dvt -lrb- deep vein thrombosis -rrb- and advised to go to hospital . what she did n't know then was that she was actually suffering from necrotising fasciitis , a deadly flesh-eating bug . ` i was told my chest infection was caused by the strep a virus and sometimes it can mutate for no apparent reason and start attacking soft and healthy tissue , ' said debbie , 47 . ` before the amputation i was a keen runner - half marathon standard -- and i 'd done a 10k the week before . debbie with her husband tony and teenage daughters after her leg was amputated due to the flesh-eating bug . that nearly killed her . ` when i arrived at hospital the pain was getting worse and worse and i just wanted it to stop . i had some blood taken and a doctor came to speak to me when i was shown to a bed . that was the last thing i remember until 12 days later . ' in the days that followed , debbie 's family , including her husband tony and her two teenage daughters , watched in despair as her condition deteriorated . the day after her admission , still undiagnosed , she began to go into toxic shock as the toxins began to affect her major organs and her blood pressure dropped to zero . she said : ` i 'm told that doctors and other medical staff began to frantically try to get lines into my body and things looked very grim . i was taken down to theatre immediately and my leg cut open and it was then that the diagnosis was changed from dvt to necrotising fasciitis . ' the flesh-eating bug had ravaged her right leg and there were worrying patches of black tissue appearing on her fingers and trunk . doctors removed the dead tissue from debbie 's legs and placed her in a morphine-induced coma in intensive care . she then went into cardiac arrest and her devastated family was told it was unlikely she would survive the night . from the very beginning , the seeds of hope were sown that debbie would eventually be able to run again . she was back in the gym a month after the amputation . ` when i was brought round 10 days later , my leg was basically just bone between my knee and ankle . it was in such a bad way that the doctors told me i needed to make a decision . ' one option was to have reconstructive surgery . but this would involve numerous operations - with no guarantee they would work -- and she would still need a stick to walk . the other option was to have an amputation above the knee and be fitted with a prosthetic leg . in the end , the decision was made for her . while considering her options , she took a turn for the worse and spent four days battling for her life . ` on easter sunday i signed the consent form to have my right leg amputated above the knee . it was one of the hardest decisions i have ever made , but even today i think it was the right one . being wheeled down to theatre knowing i was going to lose my leg was also very surreal . ` even when i came round , i felt so much better than i had for ages . tony , my husband , remarked on how much better i looked already . i knew then that i had made the right decision . ' from the very beginning , the seeds of hope were sown that debbie would eventually be able to run again . painstaking : debbie had to learn to run again from scratch . ` basically , my whole life as i knew it ended that day and i knew i would have to re-start my life all over again . i set myself small goals along the way , but always with the ultimate aim of being able to run . ' her personal trainer before the tragedy , naso shemetras , also visited her in hospital . ` she came to see me in hospital and promised i would get fit and again and i would run again , ' says debbie . ` the whole experience . has really made me value everything in my life and really appreciate my health ' ` and she really did a lot to help me back to fitness - i was back in the gym a month after leaving hospital , when i was still on one leg and crutches . ' naso later went on to win the exorex personal trainer of the year award for her remarkable work with debbie . ` once i was able to walk with a prosthetic leg without the aid of crutches or a walking stick , about nine months post-amputation , i walked the race for life and was ready for the big challenge -- returning to running . ' it was a painstaking journey but with advice from another amputee , she began to make progress . ` he advised me to start by jumping from my good leg onto the prosthetic foot to gain confidence in my prosthetic leg and i practised this every day . i then tried the hop/skip style of running , where you jump twice on the good foot and then land on the prosthetic foot and repeat . this got me moving a bit faster . debbie says she is now fitter and more active than ever . she now runs twice a week , cycles and swims as well as working two jobs . ' i . then felt ready to try step over step running , so accompanied by my . husband tony , and a belt round my waist so he could hold me up whilst . attempting it , we went to the local athletics track . ` it . was hard work and the first few steps i made were very clumsy and . awkward , much like a baby elephant . it was exhausting and i realised . just how hard this was going to be . ' she then enlisted the help of running coach julian wills . ` i was very nervous to start with . he had to teach me how to run completely from scratch , as i could hardly put one foot in front of the other . ` it was exhausting - my own leg had to learn how to run alongside a mechanical leg which was quite alien to it , and a lot of the practise was to re-train my brain . ' today , six years after losing her leg , debbie says she is fitter and more active than ever . she now runs twice a week , cycles and swims as well as working two jobs as a supervisor of a pre-school and an admin assistant . debbie before her accident , when she ran to half marathon standard . ` i was a keen runner beforehand , so i . was pretty fit , but i 'm definitely fitter now -- and slimmer . i am now . quite obsessive about my health and fitness now . the whole experience . has really made me value everything and appreciate it . i 'm also fitter . because you use so much more energy exercising with a prosthetic leg . ` i . had to learn how to run up and down kerbs , but hills were my biggest . fear . uphill is hard work - as an amputee , i already use up to 100 per . cent more energy to run , but running up hills is like climbing a . mountain - and plymouth has plenty of hills ! ` running on the pavements is a whole . new ball game , too . the obstacles are many -- cracks in the pavement , people , . dogs , children , drains , sharp bends and kerbs . ' running downhill is particularly scary . ` i 've fallen over a few times running downhill - usually at bus stops , much to the amazement of waiting passengers , but never hurt myself , thankfully . ` when i took part in my first run with able-bodied people , i ran it in 22 minutes -- probably double the time i would have been able to do it in normally . it was 1.5 miles , which does n't seem a lot - or it certainly did n't when i had two legs . but that was then and this is now , and it was a challenge for me . ' i trained hard and even though i had to stop a couple of times to catch my breath , i got my first medal and was proud of my achievement . ` above all , the important thing is i survived the whole original ordeal and i 'm here today with my family .
