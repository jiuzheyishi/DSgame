{"text": "would the  first conservative  recognize modern conservatism ? the conservatism of recent days has been a conservatism of radical individualism : a politics that sees its job as protecting society 's  makers  from society 's  takers .  yet the man most often credited as the founder of modern conservatism , the 18th-century british thinker-politician edmund burke , saw things very differently . against the politics of  i want , i want , i want ,  he emphasized continuity , responsibility and community . that was a tough teaching 200 years ago , and it remains a tough teaching today . it 's not a surprise that it often goes unheard . this year , however , burke 's tough teaching is again getting the articulation it deserves , thanks to two distinguished books by two rising conservative thinkers , one british , one american . jesse norman is a british member of parliament who strongly identified with prime minister david cameron 's modernizing conservatism . his book was first published in great britain under the title  edmund burke : philosopher , politician , prophet  but then rereleased in the united states under the pithier  edmund burke : the first conservative .  as norman tells it , burke was a thinker and politician who rejected the demands of  i want  in favor of the duties of  you should .  in burke 's words : .  -lsb- t -rsb- he state ought not to be considered as nothing better than a partnership agreement in a trade of pepper and coffee , calico or tobacco , or some other such low concern , to be taken up for a little temporary interest , and to be dissolved by the fancy of the parties .  burke rejected both the  i want , i want  of people who expect ever more generous social programs from government -- and the  i want , i want  of bankers and brokers who wish to be allowed to stake huge gambles with other people 's money .  except in reaction to the most extreme necessity , -lsb- burke 's -rsb- politics is one of moderation . he was an early supporter of free markets , but only within a strong context of personal probity , law , market norms and trust .  norman 's burke forcefully critiques the disintegration of society into personal atoms , each seeking only its own personal economic betterment .  -lsb- t -rsb- he individual is not simply a compendium of wants , human happiness is not simply a matter of satisfying individual wants , and the purpose of politics is not to satisfy the interests of people living here and now : it is to preserve an evolving social order which meets the needs of generations past , present , and future .  make no mistake : norman 's burkean politics is conservative politics . burke defended free enterprise and private property rights . burke 's contemporary adam smith , author of  the wealth of nations  and founder of modern economics , saluted burke as the only person whose ideas had corresponded with his own without any prior communication between the two . burke favorably reviewed smith 's books , and the two men became friends . yet burke could also forcefully denounce the abuse of economic power and the corruptions of wealth . norman again :  -lsb- h -rsb- e regarded as his greatest achievement his campaign to restrain the influence , greed and self-dealing of the east india company , and to insist on the accountability of private power to legitimate public authority .  here is a conservative who has much to say in the era of predatory finance and selective bailouts . a politician himself , norman shrewdly appreciates that burke 's contributions emerged from an active career . burke understood the limits of the possible because he himself had often bumped up against them -- hard . burke spent only a few months of his long political career in office ; he passed most of his parliamentary career estranged from the government of the day and exerted almost all of his influence in writings and speeches from the back benches . norman bumped up one of those limits himself . in september , he voted against his own party leadership on a proposed intervention in the syrian civil war and was stripped of his party leadership position . in politics , yet separated from it -- that is the place and role to stimulate fresh political thought . the author of this year 's second great work on burke , yuval levin , is located both closer to -- and simultaneously further from -- political power even than norman . a former domestic policy adviser to president george w. bush , levin now edits the flagship conservative policy magazine , national affairs . at the same time , he is one of the most influential advisers of rep. paul ryan , the former gop vice presidential nominee ; you might say that levin now holds the irving kristol chair as a one-man republican brain trust . levin presents his new work on burke as a study of a fierce debate that erupted in the 1790s between burke and his one-time friendly acquaintance , thomas paine . both men were migrants : burke , irish-born , had moved to england ; paine , english-born , moved to the american colonies . paine had given words to the american revolution in his pamphlet  common sense ,  which became , after the bible , probably the most widely read book in the america of the 1770s . burke had urged compromise with the americans in speeches in parliament and then , after it was too late for reconciliation , urged peace and acceptance of independence . fifteen years later , however , those two former allies bitterly quarreled . burke 's 1790 book ,  reflections on the revolution in france ,  eloquently and prophetically warned that revolution would end in blood and tyranny . paine wrote a rebuttal to burke ,  the rights of man ,  published in 1791 . he transplanted himself to france to lend personal support to the new regime and was elected to the french national assembly . to his surprise -- but probably not to burke 's -- paine ended up in a french prison cell when his preferred faction lost power in late 1793 . but he was not guillotined , and he lived and kept writing , becoming probably the first writer in english to propose something prophetically like the modern welfare state . in  the great debate : edmund burke , thomas paine , and the birth of left and right ,  published in december , levin argues that paine deserves equal billing with burke as a founder of our modern political debates . levin sets each thinker as a standard and corrective for their modern descendants . yet as levin himself seems well aware , it is the conservatives who have drifted further -- and who need correction more . levin 's burke often seems to be debating -- not against his contemporary paine -- but against our contemporaries of the libertarian right .  burke essentially denies the relevance -lrb- though not necessarily the existence -rrb- of abstract , individual , natural rights . he defines instead some practical rights to the benefit of society . and those benefits do not amount to freedom or power . in fact , some of the benefits of society to which men have a right involve restraints on their freedom and their passions .  and again : .  human beings can not live in society if they follow their wants and passions unrestrained , and so one of the rights of citizens is to have their passions brought under some control . thus society guarantees some liberties and some restraints , and precisely how these are balanced is in normal times a matter of prudence , not absolute principle .  and once more , this time maybe most tellingly : .  where paine imposes on government the obligation to respect the freedom of action of each of its citizens , burke imposes on government a much less exacting -lrb- if somewhat more demanding -rrb- obligation to meet the wants of the people and advance the interests of the complex social whole .  it is paine , levin 's non-hero , who speaks the language of the tea party -- and burke , levin 's hero , who rejects maximum individual rights in favor of a theory of social obligation . burke sees , and levin sees with him , that a politics of egoism and individualism leads to the dissolution of the institutions a conservative will want to protect . as levin concludes :  today 's conservatives are thus too rhetorically strident and far too open to the siren song of hyper individualism . ... they could benefit by adopting burke 's focus on the social character of man -lsb- and -rsb- from burke 's thoroughgoing gradualism .  these are wise and needed cautions -- and phrased with the cautious wisdom necessary to make them acceptable to conservatives who do not wish to hear what they most need to know . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of david frum .", "summary": " british thinker edmund burke often considered the  first conservative ,  david frum says .   yet burke would differ from the radical individualism of today 's u.s. conservatives , he says .   frum says burke saw the importance of community , continuity and responsibility .   frum : two new books show the need for taking burke 's philosophy seriously today .
