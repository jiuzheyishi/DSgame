{"text": "and ted thornhill . updated : . 10:26 est , 25 april 2012 . from space earth looks completely untouched . however , it 's deceptive , as a new video shows in mesmerising fashion . ` anthropocene ' demonstrates just how much the planet has been transformed by humans by illuminating every road , shipping route and flight path . scroll down for video . illuminating : anthropocene is a three-minute rollercoaster ride through the latest chapter in the story of how one species has transformed a planet . global map showing major road and rail networks over land , along with transmission line and underwater cable data superimposed over satellite images of cities illuminated at night . human technology presence over africa at night . road , rail and data transmission lines are highlighted on the map - along with the undersea data cables that connect continents . the three-minute clip is the result of 13 years of devotion by canadian anthropologist felix pharand . using an ordinary home pc , pharand . input data from agencies such as the geospatial intelligence agency and . atmospheric administration to create accurate illustrations of how . humans have ` domesticated ' our planet - superimposing the data on images . of the earth 's cities lit up at night . pharand claims three per cent of the planet 's land surface is under tarmac - an area the size of india . recently , the united nations populations fund revealed that by october 31 , there will be an extra billion people on the earth compared to 1999 . the u.s as you 've never seen it before : the states is lit up in the video showing thousands of ways of getting from a to b . the video literally highlights the stark contrast between the infrastructures of europe and north africa . according to the un it has been estimated of all the humans ever born , over six per cent , are walking the earth today . ` these pictures show several sides of global human activities , ' said 34-year-old felix , from montreal , canada . ` we see everything from paved and unpaved roads , light pollution , railways , electricity transmission lines . ' ` it shows the extent of our civilisation , the patterns of our global sprawl , how human-influenced our planet now is . ' air traffic routes across north america and europe - showing the ` hubs ' that connect the world , such as london 's heathrow , jfk in new york and frankfurt . air traffic routes over eurasia - just one of the technologies felix pharand deschenes has mapped over a night-time view of our planet . felix taught himself design to communicate his ideas more effectively - and wanted to create the sort of visions of planets seen in sci-fi movies , but using real data from our world . ' i thought there would be huge strengths associated with global pictures depicting how far we 've been at colonising , domesticating and transforming our home planet . i started to gather data from numerous sources and to explore ways of assembling them . we 've seen similar pictures in movies like star wars , contact , avatar and the likes but i have never seen realistic renderings for our earth . so i thought - why not try to make some ? felix is positive about the legacy of our species . ` today 's global civilisation is the work of billions of people throughout history , ' he said , ` it has been established through much effort , successes and sufferings - as well as wars , inventions , exchanges , crisis and socio-technological changes . the world at the start of the 21st century is also the result of what we call the great acceleration - the most rapid transformation of the human relationship with the natural world in history . ` many human activities reached take-off points sometime in the mid-20th century and sharply accelerated towards the end of the century . these shots are a tool to raise awareness - i think we have a duty to remain optimistic in our hearts , ' says pharand , a director of environmental group globaia . by the end of the 21st century the world population could more than double to 15.8 billion people .", "summary": " three per cent of the planet 's land surface is under tarmac - an area the size of india .
