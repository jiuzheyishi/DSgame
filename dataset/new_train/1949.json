' it is estimated that about four in ten people carry the red-head gene variant without having red hair themselves -- accounting for many surprise births of babies who are red-headed . about 40 per cent of men and women in ireland carry a red head variant , but only 10 per cent have red hair . in scotland , just over 30 per cent are known carriers and up to 13 per cent have red hair , while in england only 6 per cent of people have red hair . on the continent , only about 1.3 per cent of people are red-headed , getting much rarer heading towards the south-east . when counting the entire world population only just over 0.5 per cent -lrb- one in 200 -rrb- have red hair , which is nearly 40million people . identifying carriers : couples can get dna tests to see if they are carrying the ` ginger gene ' -lrb- file picture -rrb- . about one in four of the children of two carriers will be born with red hair and half will themselves be carriers . ` families can carry a variant for generations , and when one carrier has children with another carrier , a red-headed baby can appear seemingly out of nowhere ' dr jim wilson , britainsdna . half of the children of a carrier will also inherit the variant , even if their other parent is not a carrier . recent research indicates millions of britons carry ` silent ' genes for redheadedness . while this does not turn their hair ginger , it may expose them to a range of increased health risks that afflict redheads . these can include increased sensitivity to pain , skin cancer , parkinson 's disease and even tourette 's syndrome .", "summary": " simple dna test available at exhibition at olympia in london next month .   carriers could have ginger children even if neither parent has red hair .   about 40 % of us carry gene variant without having red hair ourselves .
