{"text": "lloyds bank was accused of betraying small firms last night after sacking hundreds of business advisers -- and leaving employers to get lending advice by phone . the taxpayer-backed bank will axe half of its travelling small business relationship managers , hitting up to 120,000 firms in every part of the country . from may , minnow companies and start-up firms will be left relying on phone banking or the internet to get in touch with the lender . betrayal : taxpayer-backed lloyds bank , heavily bailed out by government after the credit crunch , will axe half of its small business relationship managers , hitting up to 120,000 firms in every part of the country . lloyds is already one of the worst culprits for choking off lending to small firms , despite taking part in a government scheme designed to boost loans . since june 2012 its cumulative net lending -- the difference between the total amount of money handed out minus the total amount paid back by its customers -- is minus # 2.2 billion , according to the bank of england . critics said the latest move was further evidence that the lender had turned its back on the country 's smallest enterprises . john allan , of the federation of small businesses , said : ` small firms have lost trust in their bank and much more needs to be done to repair the damage . ` thirty per cent of our members keep in touch with their bank through face-to-face meetings . ` it is difficult to understand why lloyds will only offer their smallest business customers help and advice by phone if their goal is to rebuilding trust and re-establish personal relations with those firms . ' lord oakeshott , former liberal democrat treasury spokesman , said : ` that 's a giant step in the wrong direction by lloyds . the smallest businesses need local bankers , not box-tickers , to understand their needs . the more of a bank we taxpayers own , the less they lend . ' centralised : from may , minnow companies and start-up firms will be left relying on phone banking with call centre operatives like these or the internet to get in touch with the lender . -lrb- stock image -rrb- . the bank employs more than 1,000 small and medium-sized enterprise relationship managers . but 560 of these will lose their jobs amid another round of redundancies costing 1,080 staff at the group , which is in the process of shedding 15,000 staff over several years . another 300 staff will see their roles outsourced . of the 250,000 small and mid-sized firms on its books , the smallest 120,000 will no longer be able to get meetings with travelling relationship managers . they will still have access to branch staff ` when they start up ' , although the bank said its ` specialist business managers ' will be based in a central office . lloyds defended the move , saying that smaller companies had ` less complex needs ' than larger firms . a spokesman said ` this will help us cater more effectively for the needs of our clients -- including many smaller firms that want to make more use of the telephone and internet to manage their day-to-day banking and the increasing number of start-ups we are helping to support . ' he added : ` all of our clients will continue to have the support of specialist business managers and for our smallest clients , in addition to branch staff , managers based in our central teams . to underpin this reorganisation , we are investing in improved technology and services . ` we want to ensure all our clients get the right level of support , whatever their size , sector , or location -- and how ever they bank with us .
