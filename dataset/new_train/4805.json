{"text": "it was a shimmering metal wall hanging fashioned from thousands of bottle tops that won el anatsui international acclaim . during the venice biennale in 2007 the ghanaian sculptor transformed the facade of a museum by draping one of his exquisite metal tapestries over the top of it , causing a sensation in the art world . today , he is hot property , collected by the world 's major museums and selling his rippling metal installations that nod to indigenous art for hundreds of thousands of dollars . his latest work goes on display this week at new york 's high line , an elevated park built on an old freight rail line in manhattan .  broken bridge ii  will be his largest installation yet -- a 37-foot-high sculpture made of recycled pressed tin and mirrors woven together with copper wire .  the idea of the mirrors is to bring in the landmarks of new york ... to celebrate the achievements of where the work is ,  he said . the empire state building is one building reflected in the sculpture . read related : america 's black cowboys fight for their place in history . el anatsui is known for his interest in indigenous art and use of materials that he finds locally -- like the whiskey bottle caps that he uses for his tapestries -- and he puts it down to his upbringing which was cut off from traditional ghanian culture . he was born in the small town of anyako in the volta region of ghana during british rule . the youngest of 32 children -lrb- on his father 's side -rrb- , his mother died when he was a baby and he was brought up in a presbyterian mission house by his uncle , a presbyterian minister .  when you 're living in a mission house , you have everything there , you do n't need to go out and therefore you do n't know too much about indigenous society ... i was kind of isolated from it ,  he said . even as a boy , he knew he wanted to be an artist :  i had a kind of calling .  he went on to study fine arts at the university of science and technology in kumasi , then an  unimaginable  thing to do . at that time , only a few years after ghana achieved independence from the uk in 1957 , the post-colonial hangover meant el anatsui studied a british-style curriculum , only covering european art . read related : chinese sculptor xiang jing 's painful search for truth . he felt strongly that he wanted to know something about his own indigenous culture .  having been estranged from it and exposed to art being produced in europe and asia , i was wondering why we did n't have art as well ,  he said . he remembers coming across a national cultural center in kumasi and there began to discover ghana 's  very interesting art forms .  they included  adrinka ,  a series of ideograms or graphic symbols that represent aphorisms . it reminded el anatsui of the european quest in science during the renaissance to use symbols to represent abstract concepts . the similarity gave him  quite a shock ,  and was the catalyst for his exploration of his native culture -- and his attempts to , as he puts it ,  indigenize my consciousness .  he started using materials from his local environment , recyclables like the bottle caps .  a lot of people call them waste , but to me they are not waste ... there are people who collect these things , smash them and make them into utensils like big cooking pots ,  he said . read related : south african rugby legend : sport can unify a nation . the bottle tops in his flowing , shimmering installations also have a deeper meaning . he says they are meant to act as a reminder that african slaves were exchanged for european liquor during the transatlantic slave trade . while the fluidity of the sculptures are meant to reflect the unsteady relationship between europe , africa and america . despite the deep affinity el anatsui has for homegrown african culture , he resists being called an african artist .  i do n't know any -lrb- artist -rrb- who wants to be geographically categorized only . artists want to be known only as artists ,  he says . he says that when the metropolitan museum of art in new york first acquired his art , it was for their african galleries and only later for their modern and contemporary art galleries . this  raises so many questions as to what precisely i am -- am i an african artist or an artist ?  he asks , adding it is high time museums  revisited their categorizations .  he adds :  an artist in india is the same as an artist in africa , ghana , japan or america .  another thing he does n't want to be prescriptive about is how his work is hung in galleries . he sends his work out with no instructions leaving it up to the curators to decide how to install it . at first they are confused but eventually they discover  they themselves are also artists ,  he says .  it 's a versatile form . i think an art form should be a replica of life itself -- life is not something which is cut and fixed -- it is constantly changing .
