{"text": "the world 's first printable gun has been deemed a serious safety and security concern after a gun printed by the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms exploded before it was even fired . this danger is matched by the problem with fully-functioning 3-d printed guns - they work all too well . the blueprint for the 3-d gun known as the liberator was made available online six months ago by the group defense distributed with the aim of enabling anyone to print a gun with a 3-d printer six months ago . scroll down for video . no toy : the first gun printed on a 3-d printer , the liberator , has been tested by the atf . new technology : an ultimaker 3-d printer . the state department demanded the design be taken offline but not before it was downloaded more than 100,000 times . the atf used the blueprints to print the plastic gun on a 3-d printer . the bureau released the results of its tests on the liberator on wednesday , posting a series of videos on the tests to youtube . the weapon was found to have the power to penetrate several inches of flesh as well as a human skull . ` the bottom line is , the penetration results demonstrated that the liberator is a lethal weapon , ' earl griffith , chief of atf 's firearms technology branch told the huffington post . ` the .380 bullets fired from the liberator penetrate sufficiently to reach vital organs and perforate the skull . ' the atf printed several versions of the gun using different materials . the gun printed in a plastic material called visijet exploded during the test . explosive : the liberator made from visijet exploded during testing . a gun rendered in a stronger plastic known as abs shot eight rounds without any problems . ' -lsb- the testers -rsb- quit after eight rounds , but there was no issue with the firearm at that point , ' atf spokesperson tim graden told forbes . authorities say the guns are a particular concern because they 're made of plastic which is undetectable , meaning they could be brought into areas where weapons would normally be banned such as airports , schools and courts . depending on the metal detector , a bullet might not be enough to set it off , and the only way the gun itself could be detected would be with an x-ray machine , which are n't used in many facilities . undetectable : authorities are concerned that plastic 3-d guns could be brought into places such as schools or government buildings where metal detectors would n't find them . new threat : a liberator pistol next to the 3d printer on which its components were made . the single-shot handgun is the first firearm that can be made entirely with plastic components forged with a 3d printer . the gun manages to bypass the undetectable firearms act by including a metal block in its make-up . however , the metal part of the gun does n't play any part in its function and could be removed . the undetectable firearms act of 1988 expires early next month , and there is a push to have the law updated to account for printed plastic guns . new york congressman steve israel told the washington post that he 's making a ` last-ditch effort ' to renew and update the law . ` it would be unfathomable to me if we are not able to renew thiws law right now , ' he said . atf spokesperson tim graden outlined the bureau 's concerns to forbes : ` one , they do work . two , they 're not reliable , and three , they 're undetectable , ' says graden . ` and that 's a safety and security issue because they can make their way into secure facilities . '", "summary": " the liberator is the first 3-d printed gun .   the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms tested several versions of the gun in different plastics .   one made of visijet exploded before it was fired ; another of more durable plastic fired eight shots easily .   authorities say the gun is a safety and security concern because it 's not detected by metal detectors .
