' mr young , a former fixer to the super-rich , told the court his wife 's claims were those of a ` fantasist ' and rejected her accusation that his friends were ` sheltering ' his money . he had met cowell fewer than five times and had ` never had any business with him ' , and it was ` laughable ' that he had a secret shareholding american idol . mr young claimed he had ` probably bumped into sir philip in the street once and seen him outside a nightclub once ' in two years . he said he had had no income since 2006 and was living ` with the support of friends ' . sir philip , mr cowell , mr caring and mr berezovsky , who was found hanged at his ascot mansion earlier this year , all dismissed her allegations of a conspiracy . in his ruling yesterday , the judge said that he ` entirely and unreservedly ' accepted the evidence given to the court by sir philip and mr caring about their loans to mr young . before their split , the couple lived in unimaginable luxury . they owned six mansions in belgravia , britain 's most exclusive postcode , and the family home was # 21million wood perry house in oxfordshire , described as ` buckingham palace in miniature ' . they also had a # 3.5 million beach house in miami , a yacht in monaco , employed a small army of servants and housekeepers , and dined in the finest restaurants . they drove fabulous cars , including two mercedes gullwings worth # 700,000 each . mr young had a # 70,000 watch , and said jewellery he bought for his wife 's 40th cost # 150,000 .", "summary": " michelle young claims she made a stand for women and will make history .   attacked husband scot for forcing one of their daughters into state school .   declares she is an example of women falling through the net in family law .   she had demanded half her husband scot 's .   assets , maintaining he was worth ' a few billion at least ' but had hidden .   away ' a vast fortune '   speaking outside court she described her lengthy legal battle as ' a desperate struggle for me and my daughters '   said husband made ` mockery of justice system ' , vowing ` this is not over ' "}
