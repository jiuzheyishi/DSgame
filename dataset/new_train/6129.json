{"text": "there is already a 3d printer that creates pancakes , so the next logical step is to top these breakfast items with your very own 3d printed fruit . a cambridge firm has created a device that uses a culinary technique known as spherification to build replica raspberries and blackcurrants using flavoured gel . the droplets of gel are placed into a dish of solution , and positioned in such a way to mimic the shape and colour of various fruits , which are then spooned out of the dish and are instantly edible . scroll down for video . a cambridge firm has created a device that uses a culinary technique known as spherification to build pieces of fruit using flavoured gel . droplets of gel are dropped into a dish of solution , pictured , and positioned in such a way to mimic the shape and colour of various fruits . spherification is a technique used in cooking to shape liquids into spheres , designed to look like caviar . for flavoured liquids , including fruit juices that do n't contain any calcium , the liquid is mixed with powdered sodium alginate , then dripped into a bowl of cold calcium chloride or another soluble calcium salt . each drop of the alginated liquid forms into a small sphere in the calcium solution . the solution reacts with the aginate to create an outer layer of thin , flexible skin . the printer was created by designers at firm dovetailed , and is aimed at chefs and foodies . it was revealed at the tech food hack event earlier this week , organised by microsoft research cambridge . to create the flavours , the researchers use fruit juices mixed with powdered sodium alginate , dripped into a bowl of cold calcium chloride . each drop of the alginated liquid forms into a small sphere in the calcium solution and this solution causes the outer layer of each sphere to form a thin , flexible skin . the printer , pictured , was created by designers at firm dovetailed , and is aimed at chefs and foodies . it was revealed at the tech food hack event earlier this week , organised by microsoft research cambridge . the firm has already perfected how to create raspberries , pictured , and blackcurrants , and is working on developing larger fruit such as apples and pears . to create the flavours , the researchers use juices mixed with powdered sodium alginate , dripped into a bowl of cold calcium chloride . dr. vaiva kalnikaitÄ— , creative director and founder of dovetailed , said : ` our 3d fruit printer will open up new possibilities not only to professional chefs but also to kitchens in our home - allowing us to enhance and expand our dining experiences . we have re-invented the concept of fresh fruit on demand . ' dr gabriel villar , chief inventor at dovetailed , added : ` with our novel printing technique , you can not only re-create existing fruits , but also invent your own creations . the taste , texture , size and shape of the fruit can all be customised . ' the firm has already perfected how to create raspberries , blackberries and blackcurrants and is working on developing larger fruit such as apples and pears . each drop of the alginated liquid forms into a small sphere in the calcium solution and the solution causes the outer layer of each sphere to form a thin , flexible skin . users can then spoon out the fruit , pictured , and it is instantly edible . earlier this week , a norwegian father built a 3d printer , pictured , out of lego to make pancakes . miguel valenzuela , from oslo , norway , and his pancakebot tour the country making presentations to school children , and he has made the plans to his brilliant invention available online . earlier this week , a norwegian father built a 3d printer out of lego to make pancakes . miguel valenzuela , from oslo , norway , and his pancakebot tour the country making presentations to school children , and he has made the plans to his brilliant invention available online . the father-of-two wrote on an indiegogo fundraising page that his unique invention was inspired by his daughters , and he built the contraption to help inspire children to become interested in engineering .", "summary": " the dovetailed 3d printer uses a technique called spherification .   it places droplets of flavoured gel into a dish of cold solution .   each drop is placed in a certain position to mimic the shape of fruit .   it currently ` prints ' raspberries and blackberries and the firm is working on apples and pears .   each of the fruits can be customised for flavour as well as texture .
