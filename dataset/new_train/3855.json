' professor brown will present her findings this week at resveratrol 2012 , a conference dedicated to research into the compound , at the university . previous studies have shown even tiny amounts of the compound can reach target tissues in humans . scientists have been exploring . resveratrol 's potential to reduce the risk of heart disease , alzheimer 's . and even the ageing process . it is available as a supplement , . however , cancer trials involving resveratrol supplements have proved disappointing . cure : resveratrol , found in the skin of red grapes has been known to have cancer fighting properties . ` people do take it as a supplement , but there 's no clinical evidence that this is of any benefit ' said professor brown . there is some evidence that very high doses of resveratrol may interfere with certain medicines . ` we 're still trying to understand the mechanism behind the way resveratrol works and see if it translates to human tissues and cells ' said prof brown . within two years , her team hopes to conduct a human trial on patients at high risk of bowel cancer . sarah williams , of cancer research uk , warned : ` people should n't drink wine in an attempt to get any health benefits resveratrol can offer . ` alcohol has been estimated to cause around 12,500 cases of cancer a year in the uk . the best way to cut the risk of cancer through alcohol is to drink less .
