{"text": "shocking : christian woman asia bibi , pictured , has seen her appeal against the death sentence denied . a pakistani christian woman has been sentenced to hang after she was accused of making ` blasphemous ' comments about the prophet mohammed during an argument . while working as a berry picker in 2009 , 46-year-old asia bibi got into a dispute with a group of muslim women who objected to her drinking their water because as a christian she was considered ` unclean ' . hours after the incident one of the women reported mother-of-five ms bibi to a local cleric , claiming she had made disparaging remarks about the prophet mohammed during the row . as a result of the allegations , a furious mob arrived at ms bibi 's home and savagely beat her and members of her family . she was later arrested , charged with blasphemy and eventually sentenced to death - with her entire family forced to go into hiding after receiving threats on their lives . this week , despite international outrage and hundreds of thousands of people signing a petition for her release , ms bibi lost an appeal to have her sentence overturned , meaning she now faces death by hanging . the shocking case hit global headlines after two prominent politicians who tried to help ms bibi were assassinated , one by his own bodyguard . lawyers showered the killer with rose petals when he appeared in court and the judge who convicted him of murder had to flee the country . ms bibi 's lawyer , naeem shakir , said her accusers have contradicted themselves many times since first raising their complaint . two witnesses allegedly involved in the incident did not appear in court , he said . a muslim prayer leader did appear , saying he did not witness the original altercation , but that ms bibi had confessed to the supposed crime in front of him . speaking of ms bibi 's failed appeal against her death sentence , mr shakir said : ' i was expecting the opposite decision . we will file an appeal to the supreme court of pakistan in a few days . ' but gulam mustafa , the lawyer for the complainant , said the court 's decision was correct . ` asia 's lawyer tried to prove that the case was registered on a personal enmity but he failed to prove that , ' he said . support : ashiq maseeh , husband of asia bibi , along with his daughters sidra , second left , and esham , left , speak to pakistani minister of minority affairs shahbaz bhatti , right . he was later murdered . human rights groups say pakistan 's blasphemy law is increasingly exploited by religious extremists as well as ordinary pakistanis to settle personal scores . the law does not define blasphemy and evidence might not be reproduced in court for fear of committing a fresh offence . there are also no penalties for false accusations . those accused are sometimes lynched on the spot . if they are arrested , police and the courts often allow trials to drag on for years , as in the case of ms bibi . the delays tend to be caused because officials are afraid of being physically attacked if they release anyone they feel had been wrongly accused of blasphemy . only one person has been executed since pakistan imposed a de facto moratorium on executions in 2008 . this year has seen a record number of blasphemy cases as well as increasing violence against the accused . mrs bibi - a farm worker from rural punjab - released a memoir called ` blasphemy ' last year , in which she described her torment at not knowing how long she has left to live . talking about how she ended up being accused of blasphemy , she says : ' i drank water from a well belonging to muslim women , using ` their ' cup , in the burning heat of the midday sun . worried : the daughters of mrs bibi pose with an image of their mother who faces death by hanging . the crime of blasphemy was sealed into pakistani law under british rule but strengthened during the years of military dictator muhammad zia-ul-haq , who died in a plane crash in 1988 . in recent years , however , the country - which is 96 per cent muslim - has seen a surge in accusations of insulting islam , says islamabad-based think-tank , the center for research and security studies . but many analysts see the claims as score-settling or a front for property grabs , and in fact have nothing to do with islam . if found guilty , defendants can expect the death penalty . the charges are hard to fight because the law does not define blasphemy so presenting the evidence can sometimes itself be considered a fresh infringement . it can also be very difficult to find a lawyer willing to defend those accused of the crime . blasphemy carries the death penalty in pakistan but the accused are often lynched or languish for years in jail without trial because lawyers are too afraid to defend them . judges have previously been attacked in pakistan for acquitting blasphemy defendants and two politicians who discussed reforming the law were shot dead . ` i , asia bibi , have been sentenced to death because i was thirsty . i 'm a prisoner because i used the same cup as those muslim women , because water served by a christian woman was regarded as unclean by my stupid fellow fruit-pickers . ' in the book , mrs bibi describes how - tired of being considered a second-class citizen simply because of her religion and insulted by constant calls for her to convert to islam - she decided to stand up to the crowd and defend christianity . pushing and shoving ensued , forcing ms bibi to flee the scene . when she returned to work five days later she was attacked again , but this time the crowd were accusing her of having insulted the prophet mohammed . battered and bruised , ms bibi was dragged before the local islamic teacher who told her the only way she could redeem herself was by converting to islam . otherwise , he said , she would face death . in november 2010 ms bibi was sentenced to death in a sharia law court , becoming the first woman in pakistan 's history to be given the death penalty for blasphemy . over the past four years ms bibi has languished in the high-security district jail seikhupura , 22 miles north-west of lahore , before being moved to a more remote prison . officials now make her cook her own food every day because they fear that ms bibi has so many enemies - within both the prison population and its staff - that she is at serious risk of poisoning . anger : protesters hold up placards while demanding the release of mrs bibi at a rally in lahore in 2010 . ms bibi 's death sentence has drawn international outrage from human rights groups , including human rights watch who say pakistan 's blasphemy laws amount to form of religious persecution . on news that ms bibi 's appeal against her conviction had been overturned , kate allen , uk director of amnesty international , said : ` this is the latest blasphemy outrage to come out of pakistan . it seems obvious that this is a case of religious persecution , and it 's very likely the result of a squabble which escalated out of all proportion . ' ` blasphemy accusations in pakistan are often used to settle petty vendettas and persecute minority groups . it 's a complete disgrace that the courts are complicit in these vendettas . ' meanwhile a spokesperson for christian solidarity worldwide said : ` asiya bibi 's sentence is a tragic reminder of the continued abuse of the dysfunctional blasphemy laws and the underlying weaknesses in pakistan 's justice system . ' ` deeply-rooted problems of prejudice , inefficiency , corruption , and under-resourcing are amplified in blasphemy cases , and even more so for religious minorities , ' the spokesperson added . ` the only hope she has for justice is when the case is heard in the supreme court , and we urge chief justice nasirul mulk to consider asiya bibi 's case with the utmost urgency , ' they went on to say . pope benedict xvi publicly called for clemency for ms bibi , describing his ` spiritual closeness ' with her and urging that ` human dignity and fundamental rights of everyone in similar situations ' be respected . her case also attracted the attention of a number of online petitions calling for her release , one of which attracted over 400,000 signatures from the citizens of over 100 countries .", "summary": " asia bibi , 46 , was accused of blasphemy after dispute with muslim women .   women told her christians make muslims ' water ` unclean ' by drinking it .   tired of insults and calls for her to convert , ms bibi defended her religion .   she was then accused of insulting the prophet mohammed , before an angry mob arrived at her home and savagely beat her and her family .   she was ordered to convert to islam or face death on ` blasphemy ' charges .   despite international outrage she this week lost an appeal against sentence .
