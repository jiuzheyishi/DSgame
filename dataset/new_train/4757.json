{"text": "editor 's note : william jelani cobb is associate professor of history at spelman college and author of the forthcoming  change has come : barack obama and the meaning of progress .  he blogs at http://americanexception.com/ . william jelani cobb says barack obama 's white house has been remarkably silent on same-sex marriage . last week gov. john lynch signed a bill making new hampshire the sixth state to legalize same-sex marriage . it was a paradoxical moment . the new law is a reminder that same-sex marriage is the civil rights issue of our era and just how far the movement for marriage equality has come . it also highlighted the unexpected and remarkable silence from the white house on this issue . during the campaign , barack obama assured gays and lesbians that he supported repealing  do n't ask , do n't tell  as well as adoption and anti-discrimination rights for the gay community . those kinds of promises carry a particular weight when made by a man whose very capacity to run for elected office is the yield of another civil rights struggle . that lineage and the high expectations that come with it gave obama an amazing degree of latitude , allowing him , for instance , to remain relatively unscathed even when he placed the rev. rick warren on the inauguration day program . but to date he has taken no significant action on this front and , more critically , his administration is actually being outpaced by state legislatures around the country . granted obama has been in office for just 4 1/2 months , but given the developments in iowa , california and new hampshire , they have been among the most significant months in the struggle for marriage equality . the administration likely wishes to avoid the culture war debacle of bill clinton 's early presidency . but gay rights are a national issue in a way they were n't in 1993 . thus the clouds of disappointment we already see gathering . we long ago overdosed on comparisons of obama and previous presidents , but it 's hard to miss the way his administration had begun to echo that of john f. kennedy . and not in a good way . during the 1960 campaign , kennedy ran as a forward-looking democrat who understood the necessity of civil rights . he promised an executive order banning housing discrimination . gestures like his phone call to a pregnant coretta scott king while her husband languished in an albany jail and robert kennedy 's judicial arm-twisting to secure his release endeared the young candidate to millions of african-americans . but once in office , kennedy made civil rights a low priority . by 1962 , martin luther king was openly critical of kennedy and bitterly observed that the movement activists had become  pawns in a white man 's game .  it is worth recalling that the 1963 march on washington was organized not only to ensure passage of a civil rights bill , but also to ensure that kennedy would not cave to southern democrats on the issue . in retrospect , kennedy 's reputation as a supporter of civil rights was greatly exaggerated . on one occasion , atlanta mayor william hartsfield invoked kennedy 's name -- without his knowledge or approval -- as the reason local politicians were  forced  to release martin luther king from prison . the plan was to direct the anger of southern whites at kennedy rather than the local officeholders who wanted king out of jail , but one side-effect was to raise kennedy 's standing among black voters . in reality , though , as both candidate and president , kennedy was consistently behind the curve of history . it is far too early to make such assessments of president obama , but there is a disturbing parallel . he has carefully outlined support for civil unions and his opposition to a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage . but as a former law professor , obama certainly knows -- and the language of the recent california ruling makes frighteningly clear -- the logic of civil unions is essentially the logic of  separate but equal .  -lrb- try reading the california decision and the plessy v. ferguson opinion consecutively . -rrb- ireport.com : share your thoughts on same-sex marriage . on the surface , civil unions are a politically safe middle ground , an attempt to highlight the artificial divide between secular unions and the religious rite of marriage . but the fact is that marriage is a civil institution just as much as it is a religious one , and therefore religious objections to same-sex marriage should n't be an obstacle . we allow atheists to marry and we do not refer to a wedding performed by a secular judge or justice of the peace as a  civil union .  the president would do well to define this moment by taking immediate action to repeal  do n't ask , do n't tell  or ensure adoption rights for homosexual , bisexual and transgender families . kennedy believed that promoting civil rights would jeopardize other aspects of his domestic agenda during a national crisis . barack obama has a broader set of crises to resolve than any president in modern history , but that is not a rationale for inaction on this issue . ultimately , the gay rights movement will have to learn something that the civil rights movement learned again and again during the 20th century -- it is often necessary to force the hand of even your allies to achieve your goals . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of william jelani cobb .", "summary": " william jelani cobb : white house has been largely silent on same-sex marriage .   he

reluctance on civil rights .
