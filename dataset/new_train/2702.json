{"text": " our inventions are wont to be pretty toys , which distract our attention from serious things . they are but improved means to an unimproved end .  - henry david thoreau . the march on washington in 1963 was a day for great speeches . of course , no one knew that the day would also include one of the most famous speeches of the 20th century , martin luther king 's  i have a dream  oration -lrb- actually titled ,  normalcy no more  -rrb- . in fact , king 's adviser and draft speechwriter , clarence b. jones , says that with everyone consumed by march logistics , the speech was not their highest priority , and hours before the event while king was considering a theme for his speech he did n't know exactly what he would say . ah , the triumph of procrastination . it was a different time , a time when politicians like jfk and preachers like mlk made efforts to craft big ideas in beautiful language . it was the age of thriving newspapers and bookstores . back then , audiences listened expectantly for the art of rhetoric . they demanded that speakers respect them enough to put real effort and poetry into their publicly spoken words . and , they listened without the pressure and distraction of multitasking on mobile devices . they listened patiently , even while sweating profusely in the august heat . what about today , in the age of social media ? would martin luther king , jr. be an active social media communicator ? and , a more important question : how well would martin luther king , jr. 's gift for rhetoric translate over social networks ? opinion : 50 years later , civil rights struggle is far from over . the answer to both questions is positive . as a public theologian he had an encyclopedic knowledge of political writings and literature . he had an amazing ability to educate , inspire and mobilize people through language and speech . he would have recognized that social media is the public square of the 21st century . a keen communicator could not afford to be silent in this space . according to king 's advisers , clarence b. jones and andrew young , martin would have utilized twitter and other social media . jones says ,  he would be up all hours of the night telling me and stanley levison his thoughts and we would have learned to send tweets .  it 's worth noting that during the mid-1950s , king -lrb- most likely assisted by a staff member -rrb- responded to readers ' letters in his  advice for living  column in ebony magazine . he did this in order to communicate with a more diverse audience through popular media . he discontinued the responses after his life became too busy and his doctor recommended a slower pace following his 1958 stabbing . as a man who both loved people and loved to talk , he would have a large social media footprint . as for the second question , could king be king via twitter ? the real taste test is found in the actual language he used to educate and inspire . and , surprisingly , much of it fits within the most constraining of social media platforms , the 140 character limit of twitter . here 's a sample : .  injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere . we are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality .  108 characters .  truth , crushed to earth , shall rise again .  -lrb- quoting the poet william cullen bryant -rrb- 42 characters .  we shall overcome because the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends towards justice .  -lrb- paraphrasing abolitionist unitarian minister theodore parker -rrb- 93 characters .  let justice roll down like waters and righteousness as a mighty stream .  -lrb- from the biblical prophet amos -rrb- . 71 characters .  i believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality .  88 characters .  this is why right , temporarily defeated , is stronger than evil triumphant .  74 characters .  our loyalties must transcend our race , our tribe , our class , and our nation ; and this means we must develop a world perspective .  128 characters . and ,  from every mountainside , let freedom ring . and when this happens , when we allow freedom to ring , when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet , from every state and every city , we will be able to speed up that day when all of god 's children , black men and white men , jews and gentiles , protestants and catholics , will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old negro spiritual , ` free at last ! free at last ! thank god almighty , we are free at last ! '  oops , 470 characters . ok , he 'd have to split that one into a quartet of tweets . king 's instincts for youth culture were strong and , if alive today , he would be a prominent commentator with a vast social network of followers and friends . this would be an easy way to engage in meaningful dialogue with millennials and gen x , particularly important since researchers report that younger people do not attend traditional houses of worship at near the rate of their parents . in fact , we now call them  nones  referring to the fastest growing response to the question of one 's religious preference . probably , they would never hear his sermons from the pulpit , but they would read his tweets and facebook posts and see his instagram pics . for dr. king , everybody in and nobody out . seeking to engage youth , he taught a course at morehouse college to a small group of college students that included former naacp chairman julian bond , he spoke to countless university audiences , and he was famously photographed playing pool on chicago 's west side with  the boys in the hood  -- not to mention the touching photos of him with his own lovely children . king was determined to remain relevant to a dynamic freedom movement that rode on the backs of students despite the fact that , ultimately , he was bound by conscience to criticize the most militant expressions of that youth culture , largely dominated by malcolm x , stokely carmichael of  black power  fame , anti-war hippies , and huey p. newton , co-founder and icon of the black panther party . his inner moral compass compelled him to criticize ideologies that encouraged further racial separatism and/or violence . google executive chairman eric schmidt and jared cohen say in a new book ,  the new digital age ,  that the internet is  the largest experiment involving anarchy in history  creating a brave new capacity for free expression and free movement of information . we have seen evidence most recently in egypt where the arab spring was driven by social media but later also led to troubling disruptions to a young , fragile democracy . king was no fan of anarchy . he was irrevocably committed to nonviolent civil disobedience , and would have taken pains to influence the marketplace of ideas toward greater order , fairness , interdependence and civility . our new global connectivity requires an encompassing moral vision of how humans can and should live together . dr. king understood this and would be an active voice expressing the big ideas of freedom and justice for all , through mellifluous phrases and cadences that would appeal even to hip hop ears . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of robert franklin .", "summary": " robert franklin : martin luther king was an especially skilled communicator .   franklin says king would have used social media tools to share his message .   king reached out , not only through sermons and speeches , but also the media .   franklin : king 's message would still have broad appeal today .
