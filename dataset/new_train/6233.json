{"text": "follow @@ jeffpowell_mail . for carl froch next , it 's las vegas or bust . only the lure of a grandstand farewell performance in the star-spangled fight capital of the world is likely to dissuade the conqueror of wembley from bowing out after ` the greatest night of my boxing life ' . at coming up 37 and having finished his aggravated business with george grove in the most conclusive manner possible - with one of the most spectacular knock-out punches in the annals of the prize-ring -- he needs an irresistible reason to go back to the well of world championship punishment yet again . looking ahead : carl froch , snapped by our man graham chadwick in the aftermath of his stunning victory over george groves at wembley , would like to end his glittering career in las vegas . game over : carl froch 's monster right hand knocked out george groves in front of 80,000 people at wembley . brutal : groves was poleaxed in the eighth round to leave his world title hopes in tatters on saturday night . party time : froch celebrates his victory over groves in their rematch as he retained his two world titles . julio . cesar chavez jnr -- colourful namesake son of the mexican legend -- on . that strip of temptation to the rich tune of pay-per-view in america as . well as britain could provide the incentive . or maybe a rematch with andre ward , the only super-middleweight in the world froch has not defeated . ` how is eddie hearn going to pull off anything to top what i 've just done ? ' , froch asked of his matchroom promoter after he had illuminated an historic saturday night at wembley stadium by exacting retribution against george groves in a manner which not only sent his young challenger into a coma but stunned a record 80,000 crowd . froch provided the answer himself : ` it has always been a dream of mine to fight in las vegas . that box remains to be ticked . i will enjoy the summer with my family before i even think about what to do after this incredible night . ` this could be the perfect way to hang up the gloves . but a signature fight in the mgm grand garden ... ' the more he thought about it the more appealing that notion became : ` after all , i feel 36 years young . ' next up ? froch fancies a crack at julio cesar chavez jnr -lrb- left -rrb- in the fight capital of the world , las vegas . another bristling young englishman , former olympic gold medallist james degale , reinforced his claim as no 1 contender for froch 's ibf belt with an impressive victory of his own , over american brandon gonzalez . but the silencing of another noisy neighbour like groves is low on froch 's priorities and gale expects he will have to wait for his moment . not least because after two successive mandatory fights against groves , froch is now entitled to at least one voluntary defence of his ibf and wba titles . so while it might be convenient again for hearn to bring together two of his stable of fighters , he concedes : ` i have to find something to put before carl which floats his boat . otherwise who knows if he will box again ? ' still , even as he took his late-night leave of the fabulous scene of his concussive glory , the nevada seed was beginning to take root in his warrior mind . froch recalled how a low-key first trip to vegas filled him with the ambition to return there as a show-topping champion . making a scene : groves had planned his entrance to the final detail as he wowed the wembley crowd . pretty in pink : froch 's walk-on was less complicated but the champion still made his presence felt . taking a trip : groves entered the cavernous wembley stadium on a red double decker bus . he travelled to watch prince naseem hamed take on marco antonio barrera there 13 years ago , taking his partner rachael with him . ` back then we did n't have much money , ' he said . ` we could n't afford the mgm so we stayed down at circus-circus . ` we 'd saved up to go so arrived skint . i knew nothing about gambling but could n't resist trying . i threw our last few dollars cash on the craps table and lost . ` so i thought i could get it back by putting the biggest bet i could extract from the atm machine on naz to win . just our luck , he lost his world title . ` but now i had the dream of going back there with my name up in lights . ' hearn will try to make that happen , preferably against chavez . not because froch lost to ward but because , as he puts it : ` andre is a great fighter but has such an awkward style that he ca n't draw enough fans to fill his own front room . ' chavez was quick to respond . ` i welcome a fight with froch , ' he said . ` the fight would be huge ; mexico and england have always had a great rivalry in sports . also , the fight would give me the opportunity to become the first fighter from mexico to win the super-middleweight world title . ' hearn calculates , also : ` after this performance against groves , carl is where the big money is in the super-middleweight division . so there is an orderly queue forming to fight him , if he decides to go again . ' third time ? froch could complete his trilogy with mikkel kessler with both men having won one fight each . unification : wbc super-middleweight champion sakio bika -lrb- right -rrb- wants to fight froch . other options include a rubber match against his old danish warrior foe mikkel kessler , with whom he stands at one win apiece and who has just decided to make a comeback . wbc champion , tough-nut sakio bika , turned up at wembley carrying his belt and offering a title unifying match . bika will also be a target for groves once he has ` gone back to the drawing board ' . shrewdly , saint george had taken out insurance against a second loss to froch by signing in advance a big-money contract with his new german promoters , sauerland . but exactly where he goes from here depends on how he reacts to being heavily knocked out in the eighth round of a fight which he had trumpeted froch had ` no chance of winning ' . froch said : ` a defeat like this can either finish a boxer 's career or give him the motivation to come back all the stronger . it depends on his character . there are one or two other belt-holders out there against whom he might win a world title . ` but to be honest he lacks the essential element of real hardness to trouble the elite . i doubt he can ever beat ward . and deep down he knows now i would beat him ten times out of ten . ' options : james degale is now the mandatory challenger for froch 's ibf super-middleweight title . big win : the referee steps in to stop the fight between degale and brandon gonzales at wembley .", "summary": " carl froch could retire after beating george groves .   nottingham cobra could also finish his career with a fight in las vegas .   julio cesar chavez jnr is the most likely option .   the mexican has said he is prepared to fight froch .   james degale is the new mandatory challenger for froch 's ibf world title .
