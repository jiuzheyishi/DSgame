{"text": "a giant salt water crocodile that lived 160 million years ago was as long as of a double-decker bus , scientists claim . the terrifying creature roamed the ocean feasting on marine animals such as turtles and may even have eaten dinosaurs , according to a new study . the fearsome prehistoric reptile measured more than 30 feet long -lrb- 9 metres -rrb- . a giant salt water crocodile that lived 160 million years ago was almost as long as a double-decker bus , scientists claim . m. hugii -lrb- illustrated -rrb- was the largest at 30.4 ft -lrb- 9.3 metres -rrb- . fresh research into machimosaurus reveals key details of how and where it lived . experts say three different species could be found in europe and a fourth in ethiopia . m. hugii was the largest at 30.4 ft -lrb- 9.3 metres -rrb- which is larger than the biggest nile or saltwater crocodiles of the modern era . the biggest living captive crocodile living today measures 18ft -lrb- 5.5 m -rrb- . the smallest of the prehistoric crocodiles was m. buffetauti at around 19 feet -lrb- 6 metres -rrb- , while m. mosae was between 20 and 26 feet -lrb- 6 to 8 metres -rrb- . the african creature , m. nowackianus , is only known from a single tooth , so its body length can not be reliably estimated . four species of machimosaurus roamed the ocean feasting on marine animals such as turtles and even dinosaurs . three of the species believed to live in the area which is now modern europe , are illustrated , along with a human to show scale . m. hugii was the largest of of the prehistoric crocodiles at 30.4 ft -lrb- 9.3 metres -rrb- which is bigger than the largest nile or saltwater crocodiles of the modern era . the biggest living captive crocodile living today measures 18ft -lrb- 5.5 m -rrb- a stock image of a saltwater crocodile in queensland , australia , is pictured . four species of machimosaurus lived 160 million years ago . three could be found in the waters around europe and one in africa . the creatures ate marine animals such as turtles and even perhaps dinosaurs . although machimosaurus had blunt , conical teeth and long , slender snouts , they were so large that they could almost anything they wanted . m. hugii was the largest at 30.4 ft -lrb- 9.3 metres -rrb- . the smallest of the prehistoric crocodiles was m. buffetauti at around 19 feet -lrb- 6 metres -rrb- , while m. mosae was between 20 and 26 feet -lrb- 6 to 8 metres -rrb- . the african creature , m. nowackianus , is only known from a single tooth , so its body length can not be reliably estimated . each of the species evolved to hunt in different habitats , from open seas to rivers . ` m. hugii was the largest of all these species , with a body length exceeding nine metres , dr mark young , of the university of edinburgh , said . although machimosaurus had blunt , concical teeth and long , slender snouts , they were so large that they could almost anything they wanted . bite marks inflicted by one of the beasts have even been found in the fossilised bones of a giant long-necked dinosaur . scientists believe machimosaurus swam long distances in the open sea , but probably hunted near coasts , snatching any unfortunate animal that got too close . each of the species adapted features that enabled them to live and hunt in a range of habitats . they varied in body length , the composition of their skeleton , skull and lower jaw shape . machimosaurus fed on marine turtles and lived during the late jurassic period , either on the coast or in large rivers flowing into the sea . m. hugii would have been well adapted for swimming in open seas while its closest cousins lived stuck close to the coast . although machimosaurus had blunt , concical teeth and long , slender snouts , it was so large it could almost anything it wanted . bite marks inflicted by the beast have even been found in the fossilised bones of a giant long-necked dinosaur . this illustration shows a cetiosaurus oxoneoensis , which lived at around the same time . the study , published in royal society open science , analysed fossils held in museums across europe and found they were much bigger than any living crocodile . the evolution of machimosaurus mirrors that of today 's crocodiles , whose saltwater varieties are far bigger and suited to larger territories compared with their smaller cousins that live closer to shore or in fresh water . from detailed analysis , the researchers were able to determine key elements of the animals ' anatomy and lifestyle and concluded not all were of the same species . until now , scientists were unsure whether more than one species of machimosaurus existed . in may 2012 , paleontologists from north carolina state university shared news of the fossilised remains of a 60-million-year-old south american giant turtle -lrb- illustrated -rrb- that lived in what is now colombia . in may 2012 , paleontologists from north carolina state university shared news of the fossilised remains of a 60-million-year-old south american giant that lived in what is now colombia . carbonemys cofrinii , which means ` coal turtle ' , was part of a group of turtles known as pelomedusoides . the specimen 's skull measures xx inches -lrb- 24cm -rrb- and the shell , which was recovered nearby and is believed to belong to the same animal - measures five feet seven inches long -lrb- 172cm -rrb- . the fossil was named carbonemys because it was discovered in 2005 in a coal mine that was part of northern colombia 's cerrejon formation . dr dan ksepka , a palaeontologist and research associate at the north carolina museum of natural sciences , believes a turtle of this size would have needed a large territory in order to obtain enough food to survive . ` it 's like having one big snapping turtle living in the middle of a lake , ' he said . ` that turtle survives because it has eaten all of the major competitors for resources . we found many bite-marked shells at this site that show crocodilians preyed on side-necked turtles . ` none would have bothered an adult carbonemys , though - in fact smaller crocs would have been easy prey for this behemoth . ' smaller relatives of carbonemys existed alongside dinosaurs . but the giant version appeared five million years after the dinosaurs vanished , during a period when giant varieties of many different reptiles -- including titanoboa cerrejonensis , the largest snake ever discovered -- lived in this part of south america .", "summary": " fearsome prehistoric predator measured more than 30 feet long -lrb- 9 metres -rrb- .   three different species of machimosaurus lived in europe .   m. hugii was the largest , while m. buffetauti was the smallest at around 19 feet -lrb- 6 metres -rrb- , according to university of edinburgh paleontologists .   creatures had blunt , conical teeth and long , slender snouts .   fossil evidence shows they ate turtles and even long-necked dinosaurs .   evolution of machimosaurus mirrors that of today 's crocodiles .
