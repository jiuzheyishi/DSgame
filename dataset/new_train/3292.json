{"text": "pg tips apparently have no interest in funding retirement of their star . as celebrity retirement homes go , this one is disappointingly low key . there are no chaises longues , no gilded mirrors , no hot and cold running servants , and no carb-free meals arriving under silver domes . there is n't even a telly -lrb- though there was one once -- showing westerns and old episodes of kojak all day long -rrb- . fancy a cuppa ? choppers , in the wig , starring in a pg tips advert . instead , there 's a large mound of grass populated by a couple of tree stumps , and a very basic climbing-frame draped with rope , all enclosed by a mini-moat and high smeary glass walls . inside , behind two floppy plastic doors , is a large area covered in straw . there are four shelves for beds and lights go out at 8pm . choppers the last surviving british pg tips chimp and , in the seventies , one of our biggest television stars . this is home to choppers , the last surviving british pg tips chimp and , in the seventies , one of our biggest television stars . now 42 years old , she has a kindly face , a bit of a stoop and a lot of very bristly facial hairs . she . potters about her enclosure in twycross zoo in leicestershire , . occasionally stopping for a sniff , a scratch or a rub against the tree . stump . her previous . incarnation -- dressed in flowery frocks and enormous wigs , proffering . cups of tea and opening fetes , shopping arcades and new schools -- seems . quite unbelievable . and long forgotten . but memories have come rushing back after zoo officials claimed that choppers -lrb- along with the rest of ` the tipps family ' -rrb- was irretrievably damaged by her brush with celebrity and human contact during her developing years . ` she 's mixed up . she did n't know how to interact with other chimps . it 's taken years for her to re-integrate , ' said sharon redrobe , of twycross zoo . to add insult to injury , pg tips apparently have no interest in funding the retirement of their one-time star . it 's hardly surprising if choppers is a bit confused . for at the height of their fame , the twycross chimps did n't exactly lead normal lives . under the loving -lrb- if , with the benefit of hindsight , misguided -rrb- supervision of the zoo 's eccentric founder , molly badham , they starred in countless commercials , became massive stars and helped fund twycross as it is today . it all began in 1956 , back when nobody baulked at the thought of dressing up wild animals in pinnies and blue-rinse wigs and training them to iron shirts , ride exercise bikes and sip daintily from china cups and saucers . pg tips chimp choppers in one of the pg tips adverts that aired during the 1970s . for nearly three decades , generations of twycross chimps posed as tea ladies , exercise fanatics , james -lrb- ` brooke ' -rrb- bond , cowboys with ten-gallon hats and six shooters and tour de france cyclists , all to sell more tea . perhaps the most enduring advert featured two removal men -- mr shifter and son -- wrestling with a piano stuck on the stairs . the apprentice asks his dad if he knows the piano is on his foot , earning the reply : ` you hum it , son , i 'll play it . ' cue choppers 's big moment -- wearing a flowery dress , frilly pink pinny and blue rinse wig , she offers them a consolatory cup of tea . although we could never admit it now , the adverts -lrb- voiced by , among others , peter sellers , kenneth williams , cilla black , arthur lowe , bob monkhouse and miriam margolis -rrb- were brilliantly funny . popular : picture shows the chimps trainer kenny reid with ` jacky ' in 1986 . and they were fantastic for business . within two years , pg tips went from fourth in the market to britain 's top-selling tea . for their part , the chimps -- all young and bouncy and brilliantly malleable and adaptable -- had an absolute ball . they are natural show-offs and adored the attention . they are also fantastic mimics , highly intelligent and with 98.5 per cent of their dna identical to humans , very easy to teach . each action -- pouring tea , ironing , man-handling a piano -- was broken down into a series of parts and demonstrated over and over until they could n't resist mimicking . everywhere they went they caused a stir . they hosted tea parties watched by enormous awestruck crowds , appeared on blue peter and tiswas and even took part in a race from london 's post office tower to the empire state building in new york , staying in five-star hotels where they enjoyed room service . instead of the recommended chimpanzee diet of leaves , fruit and the occasional low-flying bird , they were fed sugary tea , jam sandwiches for breakfast and snacked on buns , ice cream and boiled eggs . handler : one of the pg tips monkeys with handler molly badham . meanwhile , they lounged around on heated beds for up to seven hours a day watching westerns and the wrestling on their own wide-screen television . some could even work the remote control and use a human toilet . molly and her partner , natalie evans , hand-reared dozens of baby chimps in a house in the grounds of the zoo . at one stage , several of the chimps lived with them , cuddled up on the sofa and even accompanied them the hairdresser . but as they approached maturity , . between six or eight years old , such domestic bliss came to a halt . they . were too big , too dangerous . according . to choppers 's current keeper , adult chimps are five times stronger than . humans and can be killers if provoked -- and are prone to aggressive . outbursts . the brooke-bond pg tips chimps making their 100th tv commercial in rome in 1986 . for choppers , the celebrity life ended in the mid-seventies . for other , younger , chimps coming up through the ranks , the high life continued up to the eighties , until , uncomfortable at the demand for increasingly ornate outfits and wigs , molly withdrew her apes from their pg tips contract . although the chimps ' time being treated as humans was at most five or six years , according to dr charlotte macdonald , the zoo 's head of life sciences , the damage was done . ` it 's not a good start in life to be treated like a human . it means they do n't learn ape behaviour and they 're not very good at being with other chimps , ' she says . since then , poor choppers has been . trapped between two worlds -- half-chimp , half-human . it did n't help . that , as long as molly badham stayed in charge at twycross , certain . privileges remained -- tv , sugary tea , jam sandwiches , chocolate bars , . toys to play with . fame : a chimp films a pg tips advert in 1989 which was part of a campaign which cost # 5million . and although , in the wild , chimps live in groups , choppers and her long-term companion louis -lrb- aka brooke bond -rrb- were given private accommodation . there is no question that molly -lrb- who died in 2007 , aged 93 -rrb- adored her chimps and meant well . she was a world authority on primates and the tv revenue transformed the zoo from a few sheds to a thriving breeding centre . ` the chimps would do anything for her , ' says retired mail photographer mike hollist , who spent a lot of time with molly . ` they loved dressing up and watching themselves on telly . you forgot they were chimps and thought they were children . they enjoyed it immensely . ` there was no cruelty involved . she 'd know immediately if they 'd had enough and never pushed it . she really loved them . ' while life got back to normal at twycross , pg tips looked elsewhere for chimps -- first in italy and then america , until the tea firm killed off the tipps family in 2002 . adverts : choppers , a 42-year-old ape , became one of the stars of the pg tipps tea adverts in the 1970s . she lived in a cage at the zoo with co-star louis -lrb- pictured right in the advert -rrb- until he died at the age of 37 last july . meanwhile , life rumbled on in leicestershire for choppers and louis until , last year , the latter passed away , aged 37 . today , choppers spends her time lounging about , foraging for food and playing a brain game with boxes of hidden food and a stick and occasionally even taking part in the all-important mutual grooming sessions with her new pals benji , noddy and rosie . meanwhile , twycross is busy trying to erase links with pg tips . there is no mention of pg tips on the website , no merchandise in the shop , no photos on the wall , not even a commemorative plaque on choppers ' enclosure . there , ever the performer , she 's still keen to put on a bit of show . i watch as this showbusiness veteran climbs atop the tree stump , scratches , sniffs , urinates , smacks her lips , jumps up and down a bit and grins . there 's not a flowery pinny in sight , and she happily looks much more chimp than human . a pg tipps monkey at twycross zoo . choppers is the last surviving member of the tipps ` family ' at the zoo .", "summary": " choppers was huge star but is now last surviving british pg tips chimp .   42-year-old potters about her enclosure in twycross zoo , leicestershire .   pg tips apparently have no interest in funding retirement of their star .
