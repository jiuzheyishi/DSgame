{"text": "a former fbi agent who went missing in iran was working for the cia there , not conducting private business as officials have previously claimed , the associated press and the washington post reported on thursday . both the state department and bob levinson 's family have long denied he was working for the u.s. government when he disappeared on a trip to iran in 2007 . but thursday 's reports from the washington post and the ap claim that levinson had been on a cia mission to dig up information . a source who 's involved in the matter told cnn that there 's proof that levinson worked for the cia undercover and under contract while also working as a private investigator . the ap says it decided to move forward with publishing the sensitive story after holding off several times .  the ap first confirmed levinson 's cia ties in 2010 and continued reporting to uncover more details . it agreed three times to delay publishing the story because the u.s. government said it was pursuing promising leads to get him home ,  the news agency said in its report .  the ap is reporting the story now because , nearly seven years after his disappearance , those efforts have repeatedly come up empty . the government has not received any sign of life in nearly three years . top u.s. officials , meanwhile , say his captors almost certainly already know about his cia association .  cnn 's source , who declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the investigation , said that after six and half years in captivity and interrogations , it 's more than likely that levinson 's captors know he was working undercover .  the family is aware of the risk created by this story and are praying for his safety , as they have for six years ,  a levinson family spokesman told cnn thursday night .  all they want is to bring bob home .  in a written statement , the family criticized the u.s. government 's response to the situation .  bob is a courageous man who has dedicated himself , including risking his own life , in service to the u.s. government . but the u.s. government has failed to make saving this good man 's life the priority it should be . there are those in the u.s. government who have done their duty in their efforts to find bob , but there are those who have not ,  the statement said .  it is time for the u.s. government to step up and take care of one of its own . after nearly 7 years , our family should not be struggling to get through each day without this wonderful , caring , man that we love so much .  officials contacted by cnn on thursday declined to comment on any alleged ties between levinson and the u.s. government .  we have no comment on any purported affiliation between mr. levinson and the u.s. government ,  cia spokesman chris white said .  the u.s. government remains committed to bringing him home safely to his family .  national security council spokeswoman caitlin hayden criticized the ap for publishing the story and said it  does nothing to further the cause of bringing him home .   without commenting on any purported affiliation between mr. levinson and the u.s. government , the white house and others in the u.s. government strongly urged the ap not to run this story out of concern for mr. levinson 's life ,  she said .  we regret that the ap would choose to run a story that does nothing to further the cause of bringing him home . the investigation into mr. levinson 's disappearance continues , and we all remain committed to finding him and bringing him home safely to his family .  other detained americans . ap : ` one of the biggest scandals in recent cia history ' the agent-turned-security-consultant was last heard from on march 8 , 2007 , when he checked into a hotel on iran 's kish island and then checked out to return to the united states the next day . from the start , the cia and the state department denied there were any government ties to levinson 's trip . and levinson 's family said he had been in iran on private business investigating cigarette smuggling . but the washington post and ap reports differ sharply from public government descriptions . after levinson 's disappearance , the washington post and ap reported , cia officials initially downplayed his ties with the agency and said he did not go to iran for the agency .  but months after levinson 's abduction , e-mails and other documents surfaced that suggested he had gone to iran at the direction of certain cia analysts who had no authority to run operations overseas ,  the washington post story says , citing officials .  that revelation prompted a major internal investigation that had wide-ranging repercussions at langley .  the ap 's story describes the situation as  one of the biggest scandals in recent cia history .  according to the reports , the cia changed how analysts work with contractors as a result . and the agency paid $ 2.5 million to levinson 's family , the washington post and ap said . source : cia apologized to family . cnn 's source said that david mcgee , a family friend who used to be a federal prosecutor in florida , helped find the documents that proved levinson 's cia connection . ever since levinson 's disappearance , mcgee had been trying to do whatever he could to locate his friend . with the help of his paralegal , mcgee found e-mails exchanged between a cia analyst and levinson . the e-mails discussed levinson 's 2007 trip to iran , the source said . and more importantly , they revealed the trip had a cia connection , as the ap and the washington post reported . mcgee took the e-mails to the senate intelligence committee and to sen. bill nelson from levinson 's home state of florida , a committee member at the time , the source said . at first , the source said , the cia denied any involvement .  as a result of the documents , they conducted an investigation and discovered it was true ,  the source said . a cia representative asked to meet levinson 's family in pensacola , florida , the source said , and  personally apologized on behalf of the cia .  mcgee met with the cia and negotiated a $ 2.5 million settlement with levinson 's family to fend off a lawsuit , the source told cnn . but all the while , in public statements , the u.s. government continued to deny any ties between levinson and the cia -- work that , according to the ap and washington post reports , was done off the books . as a results of the investigation , three cia employees were fired and seven others were disciplined , the source said . at least two of the three people fired have been rehired by other government agencies , a source told cnn , confirming information first reported by the ap .  they fired their own people and then took care of them ,  the source said . the justice department opened a criminal investigation into the matter , according to the source . so far , the source said , no one has been charged . justice department spokesman andrew ames declined to comment . where is levinson ? levinson 's whereabouts remain unclear . during an exclusive interview with cnn 's christiane amanpour in september , iranian president hassan rouhani offered little when asked what he could tell levinson 's family .  we do n't know where he is , who he is ,  rouhani said .  he is an american who has disappeared . we have no news of him .  in 2011 , the state department said new evidence suggested that levinson , who has diabetes and high blood pressure , was alive and being held somewhere in southwest asia . this year , a source with knowledge of the investigation told cnn ,  we have every reason to believe that he 's alive and that the iranians control his fate .  last month , levinson became the longest held american hostage in history . at the time , levinson 's family members told cnn 's new day that they were worried because they have n't had any word since they received five photos in 2011 . the pictures show levinson in an orange jumpsuit , holding messages .  we have not received any recent information about him ,  said his wife , christine levinson ,  although i do believe he is safe and will come home to us soon .  wife of u.s. pastor held in iran pleads for his freedom .", "summary": " source : the cia apologized to the family , paid $ 2.5 million settlement .   family :  it is time
