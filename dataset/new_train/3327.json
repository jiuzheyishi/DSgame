{"text": "world bank president robert zoellick will step down in june . world bank president robert zoellick will step down in june it has been revealed and the u.s. government has indicated that his replacement could go to a non-american . the obama administration said it would open the process to competition , marking the first time it has shown willingness to loosen its grip on the world 's top development lender . zoellick took the reins at the bank in 2007 after a staff revolt pushed out paul wolfowitz , and he moved quickly to return the institution 's focus to alleviating poverty . developing countries have for years pressed for a greater voice in leading global financial institutions and are likely to stress the importance of a competitive process , but the united states is still widely expected to retain its hold on the job . u.s. treasury secretary timothy geithner said in a statement : ` it is very important that we continue to have strong , effective leadership of this important institution , and in the coming weeks , we plan to put forward a candidate with experience and requisite qualities to take this institution forward ' . while geithner called for an ` open and expeditious process , ' analysts say washington can ill afford to give up the post without risking the u.s. congress cutting funding for the bank . in an interview , zoellick said his decision to leave on june 30 at the end of his five-year term was his own and was not due to pressure from the obama administration . the former u.s. chief trade negotiator and deputy secretary of state dismissed speculation he would join a republican presidential campaign as ` not true , ' saying only that he would decide what to do next once he leaves the world bank . ` it really was my own decision , ' zoellick said . ` my personal sense is it 's time to move on and i think once you feel that way you should n't stay . ' zoellick , who discussed the selection process with the board in a two-hour meeting yesterday , said the first step was for the board to call for nominations . ` an open process is important , ' he said . in the running ? possible u.s. candidates include secretary of state hillary clinton , left , and former white house economic adviser lawrence summers , right . speculation has been rife over who might take the job when zoellick departs . possible u.s. candidates include secretary of state hillary clinton and former white house economic adviser lawrence summers , but the state department said clinton would not be taking the job . ` she has said this is not happening , ' spokeswoman victoria nuland said . emerging market and developing countries have campaigned hard in recent years to break europe 's grip on the top position at the international monetary fund and the united states ' hold on the presidency of the world bank . officials from large emerging economies like brazil said the selection process for zoellick 's successor should be based on qualifications and not nationality . however , they acknowledged that given u.s. congressional pressure the job will probably remain in the hands of an american . last year , emerging market economies made an aggressive push to fill the imf top job in a bitter contest won by france 's christine lagarde . on capitol hill , lawmakers said the world bank job should stay in u.s. hands . zoellick took the reins at the bank -lrb- hq in washington pictured -rrb- in 2007 after a staff revolt pushed out paul wolfowitz . ' i think it ought to be -lrb- an american -rrb- given the balance between that and the imf and the interests that we have right now , ' said senate foreign relations committee chairman john kerry , a democrat from massachusetts . senator richard lugar of indiana , the committee 's top republican , echoed that sentiment : ` ideally i would like to see an american replace him ... that would be my preference . ' nancy birdsall , who heads the center for global development in washington , said that while the united states was committed to an open process on paper , domestic politics necessitated a american successor . ` the election year timing puts the white house in an especially unenviable position . there is a risk that the world bank could become a highly partisan , u.s. hot-button issue , as the un has too often been , ' she wrote in a recent blog . when zoellick took the job in july 2007 , he turned the attention of the bank to a brewing food and energy price crisis that was stoking social unrest in the poorest parts of the world . as the bank looked for ways to help , the global financial crisis of 2008 threatened to undermine more than a decade of strong growth in emerging and developing countries . under zoellick , world bank lending increased sharply to $ 44 billion in fiscal 2010 from $ 13.5 billion in 2008 , reflecting the increased development needs of fast-rising countries in asia , africa , latin america and the middle east . zoellick also won approval for an $ 86.2 billion increase in the bank 's general resources . it was the first increase in more than 20 years . he championed more voting power for emerging economies and convinced china , brazil and others to contribute more funding . despite budget strains in the developed world , zoellick lobbied for and secured more than $ 90 billion in pledges to replenish a separate world bank fund for the poorest countries . in an effort to modernize the world bank , he has given a greater voice to emerging economies . he has also championed the need for better governance in regions such as the middle east , where street protests toppled dictators in tunisia , egypt and libya .", "summary": " robert zoellick will step down in june after five years .   u.s. still expected to retain its hold on the top job .
