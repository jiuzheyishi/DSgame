{"text": "ukrainian forces began military operations in the east of the country tuesday , marking a definite end to a unilateral cease-fire that had been in place for 10 days . the speaker of ukraine 's parliament , oleksandr turchynov , told lawmakers the government 's  anti-terror operation  against pro-russia separatists had been  renewed .  ukrainian armed forces have been conducting  attacks on terrorists ' bases and defended posts ,  he said . the announcement came hours after ukrainian president petro poroshenko said that his country would not renew a cease-fire with the separatists , vowing instead to  attack and liberate our land .   termination of cease-fire is our response to terrorists , insurgents , marauders ... and -lrb- those who -rrb- deprive people of normal peaceful life ,  poroshenko said . in a statement on his website , poroshenko congratulated ukraine 's armed forces and border guards for re-establishing control over the checkpoint at dolzhanskyi , in  the first victory since the restoration of the cto ,  a reference to the government 's counterterrorist operation . he said the armed forces and the state border service of ukraine regained control over the checkpoint and combat engineers removed mines from the checkpoint and adjacent roads . violence flared tuesday in donetsk , one of the cities at the heart of the separatist unrest . interior minister arsen avakov , on his official facebook page , said that militants had launched an attack on a regional police headquarters building in donetsk , killing one police officer and badly injuring two more . avakov said the police were barricaded inside the building in the city of donetsk and that the fighting was ongoing . the interior ministry later said three people were seriously injured -- one woman and two special forces policemen . three others were injured and hospitalized , the ministry said . police successfully fought back the attack , the ministry said on its website . on its website , the donetsk regional state administration said ukrainian forces attacked the central part of kramatorsk from the air and ground . a bus attack in kramatorsk left four people dead and five others injured . the statement did not say which side in the conflict carried out that attack . yuriy stets , information security head for the national guard and a parliamentarian , told cnn that the national guard had regained control of zakotne , near slovyansk , and were targeting two other towns . cease-fire hopes dashed . the fragile cease-fire expired at midnight monday , hours after poroshenko spoke by phone with russian president vladimir putin , german chancellor angela merkel and french president francois hollande . poroshenko also talked on the phone with u.s. secretary of state john kerry . the cease-fire -- agreed on last month amid a volatile political crisis -- raised hopes that ukraine could be moving back from the brink of full-fledged civil war . as part of a peace plan , poroshenko urged the rebels to lay down their arms and engage in talks . he also called for the strengthening of ukraine-russia border controls , the freeing of hostages and changes to the constitution to decentralize power . in his statement , poroshenko said the militants had failed to take up a  unique opportunity  to support the peace plan and had instead violated the unilateral cease-fire more than 100 times . putin , addressing russian diplomats in moscow , said he regretted the decision to end the cease-fire .  unfortunately , president poroshenko decided to resume a military operation . i and my eu colleagues could not convince him  of the need to settle the crisis peacefully . putin : ` only on equal terms ' putin said russia had been obliged to annex ukraine 's crimea region in march in order to prevent nato forces entering , which would have created  a completely different alignment of forces .  he told the diplomats that they would  face growing pressure in defending national interests  and that  the events provoked by the west in ukraine have become a concentrated political expression of deterrence toward russia .  putin also referred to russia 's tense relationship with the united states , suggesting that the current crisis was born of the west 's attempts to impose its own way of doing things on the rest of the world .  our relationship with the united states is not the best at the moment ,  he said .  we have always tried to be predictable partners , handle business on an equal basis , but in return our legal interests were partially ignored and are still ignored . russian and u.s. contacts have a great meaning for the entire world .  we are ready for constructive dialogue , but again i emphasize only on equal terms .  russia 's ambassador to the european union , vladimir chizhov , said tuesday that the refusal to extend the cease-fire is a  negative sign ,  the russian foreign ministry said on twitter .  this makes it even harder to understand the logic of how the confirmation of the so-called 15-point peace plan correlates with the refusal to prolong truce ,  chizhov was quoted as saying by state news agency itar-tass . ` enemies and invaders ' poroshenko declared in a late-night televised address that the cease-fire was over . in kiev 's independence square , known as maidan , activists outside the presidential administration building applauded poroshenko 's stance .  we need only military actions ,  a priest named valentyn said in a reuters interview .  we were forced by those who entered our country as enemies and invaders .  the crisis has its roots in former president viktor yanukovych 's decision last year to shun a european union association agreement and turn toward russia instead . the move unleashed deadly strife that led to yanukovych 's ouster , ukraine 's loss of crimea , and a pro-russia separatist rebellion . russia also massed troops along its western border with ukraine . the association agreement , which will bring closer trade and political ties between ukraine and europe , was finally signed by poroshenko and european leaders last week . after monday 's phone call , poroshenko said his goal was peace but insisted it takes the participation of all parties to maintain stability , noting violations of the cease-fire by pro-russia separatists . the ukrainian government  has been completely fulfilling its commitments and unilaterally complying with the ceasefire regime for 10 days and paid dozens of lives for that ,  he said . peace talks were held last week among ukrainian government officials , pro-russia separatists from the restive eastern luhansk and donetsk regions , russian officials , and members of the organization for security and cooperation in europe . ` bloody truce ' activist vadym told reuters there was no point in continuing the cease-fire .  there is definitely no need for an extension of the truce ,  he said .  because a lot of our boys died during this truce .  fellow activist yulia agreed .  bloody military actions are better than such bloody truce ,  she said .  we must put an end to it once and that 's all .  a statement from putin 's press office about the call said the russian president  stressed the need to extend the cease-fire and also establish a reliable mechanism for monitoring  it . ukrainian president : peace depends on putin 's mood .", "summary": " interior minister says militants have attacked police hq , causing police casualties .   putin says he tried to persuade poroshenko to resolve crisis through peaceful means .   speaker tells parliament that ukraine military has restarted operation against militants .   poroshenko declares an end to a unilateral cease-fire with
