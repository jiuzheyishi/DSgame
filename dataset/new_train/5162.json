{"text": "second chance : michelle morgan-grainger was first told her cancer was incurable . a british woman has become one of the first to benefit from pioneering surgery that uses tissue taken from a cow 's heart to rebuild the liver . the operation brings the possibility of whole donor organs being taken from animals -- known as xenotransplantation -- ever closer . michelle morgan-grainger , 42 , from liverpool , was diagnosed with a rare form of liver cancer in october 2010 . doctors initially told her she could not be cured . but two months later , she underwent a procedure to remove the tumour in her liver along with a large portion of her inferior vena cava -lrb- ivc -rrb- . this major blood vessel is positioned close to the back of the liver and returns blood from the lower half of the body back to the heart . the ivc was then reconstructed with a patch made from the outer lining of a cow 's heart , a material called bovine pericardium . ` art form ' surgery . the procedure is likened to an art form by hassan malik , consultant hepatobiliary surgeon at aintree university hospitals nhs foundation trust , liverpool . ` this was a long and complex procedure and is offered only in a handful of places around the world , ' he says of the operation , called a right hepatic trisectionectomy with enblock resection of the ivc . ` there are only five centres in europe with experience in such cases . to date about 150 patients have been treated worldwide . the bovine patch has been used in heart surgery for a while but employed in just six liver surgery cases , four of which we 've performed . ' according to mr malik , what makes michelle 's operation so specialist is the use of this bovine material , as well as the fact so much of the ivc was removed . ` usually , if the ivc needs reconstruction , a plastic-type synthetic material rather than the natural bovine material has been used , ' he says . however , this carries a higher risk of infection and also of blood clots forming after surgery . ` with the bovine material , the risks are dramatically reduced , ' he says . ` patients avoid the need for long-term use of drugs to thin the blood , which have side effects . the bovine material is pre-treated and has gone through chemical processes to remove the risk of infection , which means it is as close as you can get to the ivc , without taking part of another human vein . ' why use a cow graft ? ` the . material is a similar thickness , it 's flexible and easy to cut to shape . and suture in place , ' says mr malik . ` synthetic materials tend to be . more rigid . and if the synthetic material becomes infected , it will need . replacing . ` the bovine . material becomes a part of the patient and will last as long as they do . the choice of synthetic or bovine material comes down to an assessment . made by the surgeon . we find it seems to work without any problems . ' each . year in the uk , 3,400 people are diagnosed with primary liver cancer , . when a tumour originates in the liver . the outlook is often poor . pioneering work : how the liver and the blood vessel was removed and the tissue from the cow 's heart put in its place to form a new blood vessel . liver cancer usually presents with few symptoms and most cases are detected once the cancer is advanced . there are different types of primary liver cancer but possible symptoms can include jaundice -- this causes the skin and whites of the eyes to go yellow -- discomfort in the stomach , weight loss , and loss of appetite . suitability for surgery depends on various factors , including the size and position of a tumour and whether the liver is damaged by cirrhosis -lrb- scarring -rrb- . but for some , it can offer the chance of a cure . pain in the side was cancer . michelle visited her gp after experiencing a pain in her side , similar to muscle strain , for a couple of weeks . doctors thought she may have gallstones , but the pain persisted and later scans revealed the worst . indeed , by the time michelle 's cancer was diagnosed , her tumour was 6in in size -- though fortunately it had n't spread elsewhere in her body -- and she was told by doctors that it was inoperable . but after her case was referred to the specialist liver surgery centre at aintree university hospital , mr malik , along with surgeon mr stephen fenwick , offered her a surgical solution . mr malik says : ` as we had experience of this kind of surgery , we thought we could help her . as it turns out , her operation was life-changing . ' cattle aid : the tissue from the cow is of similar thickness as the original blood vessel and is more flexible than synthetic materials . a ten-hour operation . michelle , who is married and works as a health director for bt , says : ` the surgeons told me about the procedure and explained they could give it a try , but they did n't know if it would work . it was my decision , and i wanted to try something rather than do nothing . ' during the ten-hour operation , performed under general anaesthetic , mr malik and mr fenwick removed 80 per cent of michelle 's liver . as the tumour was wrapped around the tubular ivc , three-quarters of the vein had to be removed . ` the liver is the only organ in the body with the ability to regenerate , ' says mr malik . ` over three months , the piece of remaining liver regrows to its original size . but you have to try to recreate the structure of the ivc . imagine a can of drink : if you cut a hole in the side , three-quarters of the way around the can , then one side is intact and the rest is open . you have to try to close that gap and this bovine material acts as a wall . ' eleven days after surgery , michelle left hospital . three months later , she was back at work . and less than 18 months on , she is cancer-free . ` i made a joke about mooing when i found out about the bovine material , ' says michelle . ` but i 'm thankful it was used . i know i 'm very lucky . i have scans and blood tests quarterly , so i live each three months at a time . ` i recently raised # 42,000 for charity and i want to continue to fundraise to increase awareness of liver cancer and also to raise awareness of my surgeons and the hospital , because if it was n't for them , i would n't be here .
