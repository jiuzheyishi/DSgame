{"text": "ask any football fan or would-be wag in the north where the top footballers live and you will get a quick answer -- within the ` golden triangle ' that lies between the towns of alderley edge , knutsford and wilmslow in cheshire . for 20 years , football 's superstars have flocked to this patchwork of villages , 20 miles from manchester and 45 miles from liverpool . many of them have bought homes from multi-millionaire developer david hughes -- the man who has helped make the term ` footballer 's house ' part of estate-agent vocabulary . top of the league : multi-millionaire property developer david hughes is selling his very own ` footballers house ' , complete with pool , helipad and 25 acres of land . david 's client list is impressive . his . very first footballer transaction was with harry kewell , who played for . liverpool from 2003 to 2008 , and since then he has sold mansions to , . among many others , manchester united 's edwin van der sar , nemanja vidic . and nani , and buy-to-let apartments to manchester united manager sir . alex ferguson and former captain gary neville . yet the biggest star he . sold a home to , and the client he remembers most fondly , was the boy . from the back streets of madeira : cristiano ronaldo . ` people forget how young and naive ronaldo was when he first arrived in manchester , ' recalls david , sitting in the study of his enormous country house in chelford , which is for sale at # 15 million . ` he was just 18 , his english was poor and i remember he had a trusted friend -- a waiter in manchester -- whom he made his financial adviser . ` my abiding memory of ronaldo is calling in to see him in the leisure complex of the house i sold him . he and his friend were trying to make their own ice bath . they had bought an industrial-size ice-making machine and were trying to shovel ice into a plunge pool . big player : the ` arabian themed ' dining room at holly tree house . grand designs : the grand pool with skylights and tropical fish mural . ` they had laid the wires from this machine across the wet floor and jammed the bare flex into sockets with bits of pencil . it was suicidal . sir alex ferguson never knew how close he came to having # 80 million worth of footballer go up in smoke . ' david 's involvement in property was originally little more than a casual punt . in 1997 , he sold 25 per cent of his allsports sports retail business for # 19 million . the property market was booming , so he spent # 400,000 converting bollington mill , near prestbury in cheshire , into mews cottages . when he sold these on for # 800,000 , he got a taste for the easy money to be made . david decided to specialise in the top end of the residential market , hitting on a formula that ideally matched young footballers ' tastes . he would buy a dated home on a good-sized plot in the golden triangle , knock it down and build another in its place . when he built the new home , he would create a huge extended basement . the homes all had underfloor heating and state-of-the-art sound , lighting and security systems . leisure centres with saunas and cinema rooms were a ` must ' . now david is selling his own home , holly tree house , which is a template for the footballers ' homes he 's sold . indeed , he used it as a show house when he tried to interest cricket star freddie flintoff in buying one of his properties off-plan . true ` footballer 's house ' : holly tree house , is located in an area of cheshire known as the ` golden triangle ' due to the high number of footballers who reside there . every imaginable item of ostentation is on show : the white drawing room has enormous chandeliers , gold-leaf cornices and hand-made carpets , while the dining room , in royal blue and reds , has an arabian feel to it . to most people it may seem wildly over the top but david reckons it is quite subdued , compared with the tastes of many of the stars . ` ronaldo ordered a bedroom in a mass of black satin from portugal , ' he says . ` on his bed he had three enormous cushions , one with a c , the second with an r and the third with a 7 -- his initials and shirt number . ' although the tastes of footballers match the stereotype , david is keen to contradict the image of their wives . ` they are portrayed very unfairly , ' he says . ` they are always very attractive but the ones i have met -- notably vidic 's wife and patrice evra 's -- have been very quiet and charming too . ' there is wit in david 's house . in the pool , a mural creates the illusion of swimming off richard branson 's necker island . the 25 acres of grounds , which include a japanese water garden , fishing lake , tennis court , golf tee and green and heli-pad , also hide deer which are , on closer inspection , made of stone . david lost his property business in the 2008 banking crash , but he still owns swathes of the ` golden triangle ' and his reason for selling is unrelated to business . ` i built this house in 1997 with my first wife and it still has her stamp on it , ' says david , who has been married to his present wife , gill , for four years . ` now we are going to build the same house again -- but slightly smaller .
