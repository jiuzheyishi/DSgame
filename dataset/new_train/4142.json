{"text": "vladimir putin always understood that the old ways would no longer do . he had witnessed the errors of 20th century dictatorship firsthand as a kgb agent stationed in dresden during the last years of the cold war . the young soviet officer was shocked at how  totally invasive  the east german police state 's surveillance was of its own citizens . in 2000 , reflecting on those years on the eve of his first term as russia 's president , putin said ,  i only regretted that the soviet union had lost its position in europe , although intellectually i understood that a position built on walls and dividers can not last . but i wanted something different to rise in its place . and nothing different was proposed .  more than a decade later , something different has risen to replace the totalitarian models of old . modern strongmen are more sophisticated and cunning then their twentieth-century predecessors . these savvy authoritarians eschew the most heavy-handed methods -- mass executions , disappearances , brutal crackdowns -- as an extreme last resort . instead , subtle forms of coercion are preferred . rather than have its activists roughed up , a human rights organization is more likely to be shuttered for fire-code violations . these regimes are fluent in the language of democracy and human rights , and may even establish human rights commissions -- despite being the chief perpetrators of any abuses . laws are written in vague terms and then applied capriciously against those who question the regime 's ways . and fear is always a potent weapon .  my father used to say that he would rather live in a dictatorship like cuba ,  one venezuelan activist told me .  at least there you know if you criticized the government , they would put you in prison . here they rule through uncertainty .  of course , elections are de rigueur in modern dictatorships -- and not the absurd sham polls of the soviet union that always left brezhnev with 99 percent of the vote . today the ballot stuffing usually stops at 70 percent . everyone understands that it is better to appear to win a genuine election -- which means you need the opposition to win some votes -- than to participate in a clear charade . there is something darwinian about the way that authoritarianism has evolved . because , in many ways , it has never been harder to be a dictator . in the past 20 years , the democracy promotion business boomed . many dictatorships lost their chief lifeline with the collapse of the soviet union . the internet , satellite communication , and smart phones make it incredibly difficult for a regime to keep its worst crimes secret . in 1989 , the chinese communist party tried to strong-arm cnn off the air before they mowed down protesters on the roads leading to tiananmen square . if people assembled in the square today , the regime 's response would be captured on a thousand iphones . in response to these pressures , the smartest regimes did not close themselves off from the world or seek to become the next north korea . police states hold no appeal . instead , they evolved . in russia , the kremlin has responded to protests by passing a raft of laws that enable the authorities to squash activists with fines and prison sentences . in venezuela , hugo chavez has engineered the electoral rules with some of the world 's most sophisticated gerrymandering . in jordan , the government has proposed one reform after another -- without ever curbing the monarchy 's true power . in china , the communist party altered its social compact with its people , granting them greater personal freedoms in exchange for keeping tight control of their political rights . in malaysia , the ruling party promised to relax its rule -- right before it banned street demonstrations . when people responded in protest , prime minister najib razak referred to them as a  sign of a mature democracy .  it was the perfectly tailored reply of the modern authoritarian . in a world of unfettered information and open borders , we should understand authoritarian regimes for what they are . they are not the outgrowth of a certain culture , history , or level of economic development . rather , they are conscious , man-made projects that must be carefully built , polished , and reinforced . but it makes no difference if a regime has developed innovative strategies , political tools , or social controls if it does n't use them . no matter how sophisticated these regimes may be , some are finding that their methods are wearing thin . since the announcement of putin 's return for a third presidential term 12 months ago , putin and the kremlin have demonstrated a remarkably tin ear . the trial of pussy riot is just the most recent example where the regime has appeared flatfooted -- unnecessarily politicizing issues that make it appear overweening and abusive . putin has now lost the support of much of the urban middle class and young people -- a group that always polled highly for putin -- and his ruling party 's brand is in shambles . as one activist told me ,  it is no longer cool to be pro-putin .  that is an important loss for a regime that banks on the apathy of its citizens . in venezuela , chavez 's prospects are in question . the past month has been his worst politically , with a string of disasters and accidents that underline how much the state has crumbled under his watch . workers -- if ever he had a core constituency -- recently booed el comandante at a rally . although his control of the media , oil wealth , and state machinery keeps him formidable , it is increasingly clear -lrb- to venezuelans of all political stripes -rrb- that the country is reaching a breaking point . of course , syria offers a daily reminder that some dictatorships still opt for a bloodbath . in 1982 , hafez assad brutally ended an uprising in the syrian city of hama . it is estimated that between 10,000 and 40,000 syrians were slaughtered in a month . bashar assad chose to follow his father 's example in crushing his own rebellion . the difference is that in 1982 the elder assad could be confident that he could perpetrate his crimes with impunity . his son 's regime looks less tenable by the day . no matter what happens , assad 's government will never win back its legitimacy . apparently assad never learned that the old ways would no longer do .", "summary": " dobson : sophisticated authoritarians replacing old totalitarian regimes .   fear , election-fixing , legislation are tools of the modern strongmen , dobson says .   despite their sophistication , methods of regimes like putin 's are wearing thin .   dobson : syria 's assad is reminder that some dictatorships still prefer a bloodbath .
