{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- the difference between the scale of the european terrorist threat and the threat in the united states was underlined by wednesday 's arrest of christopher lee cornell , a 20-year-old ohio resident , who had been monitored by an fbi informant and was allegedly plotting an attack , inspired by isis , against the u.s. capitol . one day after cornell 's arrest belgian authorities took down a group they believed was plotting imminent attacks , resulting in a battle with the suspects who opened fire with military weaponry and handguns . two of the suspects were killed . some members of the group had reportedly returned from fighting in syria with isis . the two cases could hardly be more different . in ohio , we saw the arrest of a classic lone wolf allegedly inspired by isis with aspirations to carry out an attack but scant capabilities , while in belgium we saw the takedown of what appears to have been an isis cell with serious capacities for attack . this contrast can also be seen if we carefully analyze the tactics and characteristics of last week 's paris attacks and compare them with the boston marathon bombing in 2013 . in paris jihadist terrorists killed 17 people in a series of attacks , beginning with the assault on the offices of charlie hebdo , followed by the killing of a policewoman and a hostage-taking in a kosher grocery . the attacks received sustained global media coverage throughout the three days that they unfolded . in addition to the three shooters , at least a dozen others are suspected of some kind of involvement in the paris attacks . the attackers had a substantial weapons cache , including assault rifles , molotov cocktails , a grenade and even a rocket-propelled grenade . they also had bulletproof vests . two of the attackers had traveled to yemen , where they received training from al qaeda in the arabian peninsula . the attacks in paris were the most deadly by jihadists in europe in a decade . the terrorists adopted so-called fedayeen --  those who sacrifice themselves  -- tactics in which armed men assault targets with the intention of fighting to the death to prolong the battle as long as possible , thereby maximizing media coverage and the number of casualties . the most deadly example of such an attack were the assaults in mumbai , india , in 2008 by 10 pakistani lashkar-e-taiba operatives , which killed 166 people . similar to those in paris , the mumbai attacks involved multiple targets , the operatives were armed with assault rifles , and the men had received training from a terrorist organization . the mumbai attacks lasted four days , and they were intensively covered by media from around the world . on the other end of the spectrum , the boston marathon bombing provides an example of a less sophisticated attempt at a fedayeen-style attack . on april 15 , 2013 , tamerlan and dzhokhar tsarnaev allegedly detonated two bombs along the route of the boston marathon , killing three people . three days later the tsarnaevs allegedly shot and killed a police officer at the campus of the massachusetts institute of technology , and in the early morning of april 19 the tsarnaevs had an intense firefight with police in which tamerlan was killed and dzhokhar was wounded and later taken into custody . as was the case in paris , the boston bombers had multiple targets , and the attackers appear to have intended to conduct attacks until they died . however , the bombers were not trained abroad by a terrorist group ; they were not part of a larger group of conspirators , and they were not as well-armed as the paris conspirators . the paris terrorists were more sophisticated in their tactics and training than the boston bombers , but the paris attacks were far less sophisticated than the attacks in mumbai . the terrorists in mumbai received direction on their cell phones throughout their assault from their commanders who were manning a control room in pakistan . the mumbai attacks also involved a larger number of people -- the 10 gunmen who infiltrated india as well as many others who provided training and support from pakistan during the attack . the paris attacks were , in short , a hybrid of the terrorist tactics that we saw in boston with the tactics we saw in mumbai . u.s. security officials warn that the united states is at risk of similar attacks to those that occurred in paris . attorney general eric holder told cnn 's state of the union ,  what we saw in france over the course of this last week is unfortunately what we 're going to have to confront in the future .  the united states is certainly at risk of some version of a paris-like attack using fedayeen-style tactics . after all , a much-less sophisticated version -- the boston attacks in 2013 -- has already happened . however , the history of jihadist plots inside the united states since 9/11 suggests that the combination of terrorist characteristics and tactics that we saw in the paris attacks would be unusual in the united states . in none of the deadly attacks conducted in the united states since 9/11 have the participants received training from terrorist organizations abroad . carlos bledsoe , who killed a u.s. soldier in little rock , arkansas , in 2009 ; maj. nidal hasan , who killed 13 at fort hood , texas , the same year ; and the boston bombers were all so-called lone wolves , none of whom had training or direction from a terrorist organization . these are in marked contrast with france . as the new york times notes thousands of french citizens have traveled to fight in syria or iraq and 200 have returned , a far less manageable challenge than the 150 or so americans who have reportedly gone or attempted to go to fight in the syrian conflict . of those americans , only about a dozen have joined jihadist groups , according to fbi director james comey . this is not to say that holder 's warnings should be dismissed . firearms are , of course , widely available in the united states , and one can certainly imagine a jihadist group forming to conduct an armed assault . a few such plots involving more than one or two lone wolves have been foiled in the united states -- although none in the past few years . in 2009 , for instance , the fbi arrested a group of seven men in north carolina led by daniel boyd , who had amassed firearms and plotted attacks in the united states . the plot was foiled because informants had long monitored it after boyd 's activities came to the fbi 's attention in 2005 . perhaps the closest the united states came to seeing an armed assault similar to the one in paris was in 2005 when kevin james , levar washington , hammad riaz samana and gregory patterson plotted attacks on a number of locations in california , including synagogues . the group was arrested after law enforcement linked the members to a robbery . the militants had no links to foreign terrorist organizations . nor is the united states immune to plotting by individuals with training by terrorist groups abroad . in 2009 , three men -- najibullah zazi , zarein ahmedzay and adis medunjanin -- all of whom received weapons training in pakistan 's tribal areas , plotted to bomb the new york subway but were arrested before they could do so . similarly , in 2010 , faisal shahzad , who was trained in pakistan , tried to blow up an suv in times square . the bomb failed to detonate properly . given this history , it would be unwise to ignore holder 's warnings of the potential of paris-like attacks inside the united states . however , there are real differences between the scale of the threat from terrorists in the united states compared with the scale of the threat in france , and american policymakers and commentators should be careful to make those differences clear when speaking to the public .", "summary": " attorney general eric holder has warned of paris-like attacks in the united states .   peter bergen says so far attacks have been less sophisticated domestically than in europe .
