{"text": "while many streets across the country are decorated with festive greetings , the roads of birmingham look distinctly less cheerful . rubbish has piled up around the city after collections were suspended for christmas and boxing day leaving residents angry . but homeowners are asking why the city 's council did not organise an extra collection , or rearrange the delivery date so it would not clash with christmas or boxing day . piles of rubbish litter the moseley area of birmingham , and residents fear the winds will blow the rubbish all over their community . household waste in the area has built up over the festive period , and homeowners have demanded to know why a collection could not have been made . those living in bordersley green in birmingham say the winds threaten to scatter the rubbish everywhere . furious resident lisa wenner , 69 , who has lived in the area all her life , said : ` the rubbish is 10ft high in some places , the winds are getting pretty high and if the bags are n't collected soon the rubbish will be blown everywhere . ` if that happens we are going to have rubbish in our houses and gardens , what would be done about that ? ` surely an extra collection could have been arranged for the day after boxing day ? ' local ian richards , 35 , an account manager , added : ' i do n't pay my council tax for my rubbish not to be collected just because it 's christmas . ` surely if a service is going to be removed then we should get some money back ? ` did they not think that christmas means far more rubbish ? far more for us to deal with ? rubbish dump : the council says they widely publicised the fact that collections would not be made over christmas . residents have been ` shocked ' that the council did not provide a christmas rubbish collection . ' i bet they blame government cuts or something , but they could have just rearranged it for the next day . ` as for seeing adverts about it . across the city , well i certainly did n't see any , it came as a complete . shock to me and my family . ' mother-of-two emily clapham , 29 , is frightened that the build up of waste will spread germs : ` the whole area is going to stink soon , it 's raining here and the bags are becoming saturated with the water . ` soon this is going to start breeding diseases , we should not have to deal with that , especially not at this time of year . ' resident james furnish , 45 , said : ` we all have a bit more rubbish at christmas , and when they do n't come and pick it up what can we do ? ` it 's piled high down every street , you have to walked down the pavements everywhere , and sometimes it 's started to blow into the road . ` they have n't even cleared the litter bins they provide on the streets , so those are overflowing as well . ` pretty soon this whole area is going to start to smell awful . it 's disgusting . ' eric pickles has warned councils they face a cut in government funding if they do not reinstate weekly collections . a spokesperson for birmingham city council said the collection dates had been ` widely publicised ' . he said : ` the bins are collected weekly , they were suspended over christmas day and boxing day and that was widely publicised . ` collections resumed on the 27th and will be continuing over new year , if they would normally have a collection on boxing day they will have on on january 2 . ' birmingham city council could face the wrath of communities secretary eric pickles , who warned councils last month that they face a cut in government funding if they refuse to reinstate weekly bin collections . local government and communities secretary eric pickles says a voluntary scheme has ` stopped the rot ' and prevented more councils switching to hugely unpopular fortnightly schemes.but he threatened to go further - suggesting central government grants to local authorities will be slashed in the long-term for those that refuse to bring back the weekly bin round.at least half the homes in britain - 10million households covered by 180 local authorities - have lost their weekly collections and now have general rubbish taken away only once every two weeks . the politician said in his vow to bring back weekly collections : ' i believe it 's a fundamental right for . every englishman and woman to be able to put the remnants of their . chicken tikka masala in their bin without having to wait two weeks for . it to be collected . ` once-a-week household rubbish collections came into law in 1875 to stamp out cholera and other plagues which claimed huge numbers of lives . they were maintained until after labour 's 1997 election victory , when local authorities were encouraged to collect household waste and recyclable rubbish on alternate weeks . the audit commission downgraded councils in their inspections if they kept weekly collections and told them to adopt ` progressive ' solutions of ` only emptying the refuse bin on a fortnightly basis or issuing smaller bins ' . the coalition announced a # 250million scheme to prevent more local authorities moving to fortnightly collections and persuade others to switch back . mr pickles has approved bids from 85 councils . but despite his strong words , just five local authorities have restored weekly collections in full .", "summary": " council says it ` widely publicised ' fact that collections were suspended .
