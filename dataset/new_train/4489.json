{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- the international criminal court opened an inquiry into attacks in palestinian territories , paving the way for possible war crimes investigation against israelis . in a statement friday , the court 's top prosecutor said the decision follows the palestinians ' signing of the rome statute . in doing so , they officially become icc members on april 1 , giving the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in palestinian territories . while a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation , it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides .  there are no timelines provided in the rome statute for a decision on a preliminary examination ,  the icc said in a statement . israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu described the inquiry as an  outrage ,  saying the court is overstepping its boundaries .  the palestinian authority is not a country and therefore it is not the court 's place , also according to its own rules , to carry out an examination like this ,  netanyahu told the jerusalem post . the united states also said it  strongly  disagreed with the court 's decision .  as we have said repeatedly , we do not believe that palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the icc ,  the state department said in a statement . it urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations .  we will continue to oppose actions against israel at the icc as counterproductive to the cause of peace ,  it said . but the icc begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as  palestine .   the office considers that , since palestine was granted observer state status in the un by the unga -lrb- general assembly -rrb- , it must be considered a  state  for the purposes of accession to the rome statute ,  it said in a statement . prosecutor fatou bensouda said her office will  conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality .  the latest war between israel and hamas militants in gaza left more than 2,000 people dead last summer . the inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since june . the international criminal court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes . as members of the court , palestinians may be subjected to counter-charges as well .", "summary": " an inquiry allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to file charges .   the u.s. calls for negotiations between palestinian , israeli officials .
