{"text": "prominent euthanasia campaigner dr philip nitschke is being investigated by police , after two melbourne women sent the controversial doctor a letter in an attempt to justify their alleged suicide pact . police are investigating the deaths of two melbourne women , who allegedly used equipment marketed by exit international to commit suicide in march . the pair allegedly penned a note to the organisation 's founder , dr philip nitschke , prior to committing suicide . dr claire parsons , 66 , wrote that she decided to commit suicide after assisting to end the life of her friend val seeger , 75 , who suffered from alzheimer 's disease . dr parsons and ms seeger lived together as housemates in the northern melbourne suburb of viewbank . in the note , released by exit international , dr parsons wrote of her distress in not legally being able to assist ms seeger in her alleged desire to be euthanised . ` given the laws that exist at this time in history , what i am obliged to do , i will do , and do willingly , ' dr parsons wrote . ` none of our actions has been taken lightly . but neither have they been taken with sorrow or regret . ' ` for us , this has been an entirely rational decision , taken in full knowledge of contemporary research in the field and experience of working with people who have alzheimer 's . ' dr nitschke admits the pair attended one of exit international 's melbourne workshops in september . he also said they were quite open about their plan at meetings of their local exit international chapter . according to the letter , the pair met 24 years ago when dr parsons , who completed post-doctorate studies at harvard university , had come to australia from the united states to further her career in health research . they moved in together after ms seeger 's mother died , a few years after they met - when dr parsons was assisting in research at the hospital at which ms seeger served as director of nursing . at 50 years old , ms seeger was forced to retire due to a serious heart condition . but into her retirement , ms seeger volunteered alongside dr parsons at the australian red cross ' emergency and disaster programme . not one to shy away from controversy : dr nitschke has said the pair were open about their plan during meetings at their local exit international chapter . they volunteered until a few months prior to ms seeger 's diagnosis with alzheimer 's disease in march 2013 . ' -lsb- ms seeger -rsb- wishes to die having lived a life of joyful giving , at a time when alzheimer 's is not just robbing her of words or numeracy but when it starts to rob her of reason and clear decision making , ' dr parsons wrote in the letter to dr nitschke . ` being a technophone , she has also asked me to help her so she does not get this final step wrong and end up in a vegetative state despite her earnest wishes . ' discussing her reasoning for agreeing to assist ms seeger , dr parsons added : ` she does not want to die alone . no one does . therefore , i have made a promise that i will be with her and help her should she need assistance . ' it is believed dr parsons committed suicide after assisting to end the life of ms seeger . courting further potential bad press : dr philip nitschke pictured outside his adelaide euthanasia advisory clinic , which he has admitted to wanting to expand to melbourne . ` the police are obliged to charge me with aiding and abetting a suicide and i am not prepared to undergo the harassment and disgrace of prosecution . this leaves me no choice but to join my friend at her time of death , ' the note reads . speaking to mailonline , dr nitschke said he was ` not too sure what the strongest motivation -lsb- for the suicide -rsb- was . ' ` but if she 's dying just because she feared prosecution , then that 's tragic , ' dr nitschke said . he said that although the pair purchased the equipment through his organisation , he did not receive the letter until after they had died . in victoria , assisting a suicide carries a maximum five-year jail sentence . six people have been prosecuted under suicide-related laws since 1997 . dr nitschke has courted controversy over the years , through his prominent campaigns to have euthanasia legalised . he founded the ` dying with dignity ' group exit international in 1997 and currently runs a euthanasia advisory clinic in adelaide . the herald sun reported dr nitschke was looking at potential sites for a clinic in the north melbourne suburb of essendon this week . anyone seeking support and information about suicide prevention can contact lifeline on 13 11 14 or the suicide call back service on 1300 659 467 . sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article .", "summary": " dr claire parsons , 66 , and val seeger , 75 , sent a note to dr philip nitschke prior to committing suicide .   ms seeger , who suffered from alzheimer 's disease , was concerned about her deteriorating condition and did not want to die alone .   dr parsons committed suicide after helping her friend ` die with dignity '   dr nitschke admitted the pair openly discussed their plan at a melbourne exit international meeting .
