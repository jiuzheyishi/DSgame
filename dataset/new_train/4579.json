{"text": "new york competitive eater joey  jaws  chestnut proved himself the official top dog of the hot dog-eating world when he ate 62 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes at the annual nathan 's hot dog eating contest on monday , but his archnemesis takeru kobayashi crushed chestnut 's world record at an off-site event where he pounded down 69 hot dogs and buns . for the fifth year in a row , chestnut beat the 17-man field at the 96th annual major league eating event at coney island in brooklyn , new york . kobayashi , who has been banned from the contest due to a contract dispute with major league eating , competed from afar : on the roof of a manhattan bar , in unison with chestnut and his fellow competitors . kobayashi polished off 69 hot dogs and buns to the tune of a crowd chanting  kobi ! kobi !  and the official nathan 's hot dog eating contest playing on a television beside him . he beat chestnut 's 2009 world record of 68 hot dogs and buns . but chestnut brushed off the feat since kobayashi was miles away from the cheering crowds in brooklyn .  it was n't a competition ,  he said .  it was no different than what i do at practice on my own and i 'm able to break a record at my house ,  chestnut added . event organizers agree , arguing that the record is not official if it 's not broken at coney island .  i do n't know if it was a magic show or an eating contest ,  said richard shea , president of major league eating .  not having been there , it seems like a bit of a farce . the hot dog eating contest is on coney island .  major league eating will not recognize kobayashi 's 69 hot dogs as a new world record , shea said . kobayashi , who gained 18 pounds during the contest , said his makeshift competition was to remind the world  that i 'm still good , that i 'm still in the contest ,  he said through an interpreter .  during practice , i had already broken the record , so i had enough confidence that i could beat that ,  he added . kobayashi took home six consecutive nathan 's contest titles from 2001 to 2006 . last year , he was arrested after rushing the stage at the coney island event . but chestnut remains the official champion , and he will share his official title with sonya  the black widow  thomas , who devoured 40 hot dogs and buns to beat eight other eaters in the first women 's nathan 's hot dog eating contest . thomas missed her own personal record by just one hot dog . event organizers split the contest into female and male competitions this year to give the ever-expanding female field of competitors a chance at the big prize . both chestnut and thomas were awarded $ 10,000 . chestnut took home the contest 's signature mustard belt -- a yellow championship belt -- while thomas was the first recipient of a pink belt , meant to promote event sponsor pepto bismol .", "summary": " joey chestnut wins nathan 's hot dog eating contest , eating 62 hot dogs and buns .   takeru kobayashi beats chestnut 's world record at a separate event .   major league eating will not recognize kobayashi 's feat as a record .   sonya thomas wins the women 's competition , eating 40 hot dogs and buns .
