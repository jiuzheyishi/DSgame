{"text": "the mayor of san diego 's goodbye concludes friday at 5 p.m. , when his resignation -- submitted last week after a string of women accused him of sexual impropriety and boorish behavior -- becomes effective . a spokeswoman for bob filner did not immediately return a call , and the city website -- still showing his photograph -- did not outline what he planned to do on his final day at the helm of the country 's eighth-largest city , which has 1.38 million residents . but attorney gloria allred , who represents several of his 19 accusers , held a news conference with  some of his victims .   san diegans will finally be free of bob filner and all the shame that he has brought to the city ,  allred told reporters .  this is a day for celebration and a day for congratulation .  the former nine-term democratic congressman began what was to have been a four-year term last december , but resigned last week as the accusations grew . an apology and promise to seek help , delivered on july 11 , failed to save his job .  i have diminished the office to which you elected me ,  he said in a prepared statement .  i have reached into my heart and soul and realized i must and will change my behavior . as someone who has spent a lifetime fighting for equality for all people , i am embarrassed to admit that i have failed to fully respect the women who work for me and with me , and that at times i have intimidated them .  he added ,  i am also humbled to admit that i need help . i have begun to work with professionals to make changes in my behavior and approach .  opinion : no room for lecherous mayors . but the city council accepted his resignation on august 23 in a 7-0 vote , after which the 70-year-old mayor offered a  deep apology .   the city should not have been put through this ,  he said .  and my own personal failures were responsible .  still , he insisted , he had  never sexually harassed anyone .  while he was  trying to establish personal relationships ,  the mayor said ,  the combination of awkwardness and hubris , i think , led to behavior that many found offensive .  he added :  not one allegation ... has ever been independently verified or proven in court .   but the hysteria that has been created ... is the hysteria of a lynch mob ,  filner said . politicians and the news media had  unleashed a monster ,  and the resulting  hysteria ended up playing into the hands of those who wanted a political coup -- the removal of a democratically elected mayor purely by rumor and innuendo .  city council president todd gloria , a fellow democrat who had called on filner to resign , is to serve as interim mayor , and a special election is scheduled for november 19 .  obviously , the biggest deal is just to clean up city hall ,  said katie keach , the incoming interim mayor 's deputy chief of staff . he will also review all of the city 's departments  to find out what 's working and what 's not and what might have been hidden over the last nine months ,  she said . gloria will work to  restore some of the trust of san diegans .  the city website , which displayed a smiling picture of filner ,  will be switched around five today ,  she said .  i know that it is on it .  the agreement does not affect a lawsuit brought against filner by irene mccormack jackson , filner 's former communications chief . though she remains a municipal employee , jackson left her job in july , when she sued the mayor , saying he had subjected women to  crude and disgusting  comments and inappropriate touching . she has been offered her old job back , keach said . the city 's liability does not end with his departure . and filner himself is hardly out of the woods . he faces one lawsuit , and a spokesman for the state attorney general said a criminal investigation is under way . numerous public officials , including all nine city council members and the state 's two u.s. senators , had urged filner to step down . so , too , did most locals , according to polls . some of them voiced that view to city council members last week . others rose to support filner . scott andrews said that  everything but due process has occurred ,  while one woman called the political machinations  a circus to get a good man out of office .  cnn 's greg botelho contributed to this report .", "summary": " bob filner 's resignation becomes effective at 5 p.m. -lrb- 8 p.m. et -rrb- .   in all , 19 women have accused filner of impropriety .   filner apologized but said he  never sexually harassed anyone  "}
