{"text": "few predictions are certain when it comes to the future of air travel ... except this one . it looks like being a lot more comfortable . a british company has come up with adjustable plane seats you can book to suit your shape and size . it means larger passengers need not worry about squeezing into uncomfortable , tight spaces , moving to business class or paying double -- they just book an expanded seat to fit them . and families can enjoy more comfortable flights without taking up more overall space -- mothers and fathers can add a few notches to their seats while smaller children can have theirs scaled down . the morph , as the seat has been called , also allows for the possibility of slimmer travellers paying less for occupying smaller spaces . the design by london firm seymourpowell has already attracted attention from plane manufacturers such as boeing and airbus . details of passengers ' sizes and needs will be fed into a computer and airline staff then adjust the varied seating arrangements at a touch of a button before take-off . morph works by replacing the traditional foam pads used in airline seats with a fabric that is stretched across the width of three seats , around a frame and over formers , a little like a hi-tech hammock . it promises comfort without reducing leg room . unlike traditional seats , which are created individually using foam padding , the new design is based around a single piece of fabric stretched across the back of a frame for three seats . another piece of fabric is placed along the bottom , creating a hammock-style chair . the frame includes ` formers ' which move up or down underneath the fabric , allowing the passenger to alter the recline , as well as the height and depth of the seat pan , according to their size and comfort . crucially , the formers , which act as arm rests and dividers between the three seats , can also be moved left or right to alter their width , making the seats bigger or smaller . economy class airline seats are , on average , around 18in wide . squeezing into a small airline seat could become a thing of the past , but larger people might have to pay more for their airline seat if the new morph concept becomes a reality . but the morph seats would allow , for example , a couple travelling with a young child to book two larger 22in seats to improve their comfort , while the child would occupy a smaller and cheaper 10in seat . jeremy white , of seymourpowell , admitted that some airlines were resistant to charging people according to their size , but claimed passengers would welcome improved choice . larger travellers could see it as a better option than being charged twice over . ` one airline told us that if they have an oversized passenger , they make them buy two seats , ' he said . ` i ca n't think of anything more degrading or humiliating than forcing someone to buy two seats because they are a bit wide . ' the seats can be reclined and adjusted to suit an individual 's preferred seated position by moving the seat ` formers ' , which in turn morphs the fabric to provide a ` tailored fit and greater comfort , ' according to the firm . mr white said the seats can also be adjusted to suit other needs such as privacy for lone travellers , mothers with children , people working or less abled passengers . the seats are unlikely to be fitted into existing aircraft , so it could be more than a decade before the morph design is introduced . however , some airlines have already adopted similar seating plans . air new zealand 's dreamliners feature ` skycouches ' , a row of three economy seats that can be turned into a sofa . and earlier this year airbus announced it would be offering an additional two inches on some aisle seats on its new a320 jets to keep up with ` demographic trends ' . analysts have suggested imposing a ` fat tax ' on passengers above a certain weight to cope with demands from larger passengers . in april , samoa air became the first airline to operate a ` pay-by-weight ' system .", "summary": " british design firm seymourpowell has designed morph to offer passengers choice over the amount of space they pay for .   the width of the seat can be adjusted , .   while an individual can also control the seat pan height and depth , to .   make sure they are comfortable .   morph uses a fabric that is stretched across .   the width of three seats , around a frame and over formers , a little like .   a hi-tech hammock .
