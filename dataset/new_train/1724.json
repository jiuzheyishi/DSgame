{"text": "a british paleontologist has discovered not one , but two new species of dinosaur while studying fossils in a canadian museum . dr nick longrich was examining fossilised bones from two horned dinosaurs , which had been kept in the canadian museum of nature for 75 years . and he found that , while they had previously been classified as a species from canada , they more closely resembled dinosaurs from the american south west - suggesting they are a new species . this illustration shows pentaceratops aquilonius , a new species of dinosaur discovered by a british paleontologist in a canadian museum . dr nick longrich was examining fossilised bones from two horned dinosaurs , which had been kept in the canadian museum of nature for 75 years , when he made the finding . the fossils had previously been classified as anchiceratops and chasmosaurus , species known to be from canada , but now that classification may need to be changed . one represents a new species of pentaceratops , said dr longrich , named pentaceratops aquilonius - a buffalo-sized plant-eating dinosaur from around 75 million years ago . the second appears to be a new species of kosmoceratops , a dinosaur with an ornate skull from utah , though more complete fossils are needed to confirm this . back in september , scientists announced they had discovered a supermassive dinosaur measuring 85ft -lrb- 26m -rrb- long and weighing 59,300 kg -lrb- about 65 tons -rrb- . the skeleton of the dreadnoughtus schrani , seven times bigger than t-rex , was also the most complete skeleton ever found of its type , with more than 70 per cent of its bones - excluding the head . because all previously discovered supermassive dinosaurs are only known from partial remains , dreadnoughtus offers an unprecedented window into the largest animals to ever walk on earth . dr longrich , from the university of bath , said his find revealed dinosaur species from the region were much more diverse than previously thought . ` we thought we had discovered most of the species , but it seems there are many undiscovered dinosaurs left , ' said dr longrich , from the university 's department of biology & biochemistry . ` the total dinosaur diversity must have been extraordinarily high . ` we 've really only just scratched the surface . ' pentaceratops was a smaller cousin of triceratops , belonging to a group of large , horned dinosaurs with a long brow horn and elongate frills called the chasmosaurinae . the dinosaurs were based in western north america at the end of the cretaceous period , around 75 million years ago . up until now , ten chasmosaur species have been recognised from that period , with distinct species occurring in the northern and southern parts of the continent . dr longrich believes that , although distinct northern and southern provinces existed , there was contact between them . dinosaurs would spread from one part of the continent to the other , then diverge to form new species . competition between the different species then prevented the dinosaurs from moving between the northern and southern regions . pictured here is the fossil previously believed to be anchiceratops ornatus at the canadian museum of nature , ottawa , ontario . but dr longrich said it may have been classified incorrectly . this image shows what was previously thought to be chasmosaurus russelli . dr longrich said his find revealed dinosaur species from north america were much more diverse than had been previously thought . ` the distribution of dinosaur species was very different from the patterns seen in living mammals , ' dr longrich said . ` in living mammals , there tend to be relatively few large species , and they have large ranges . with cretaceous dinosaurs , we see a lot of large species in a single habitat . ` they also tend to be very regional - as you move from one habitat to another you get a completely different set of species . ' the patterns help explain why paleontologists keep finding more species , as they discover them when examining different habitats . dr longrich believes such patterns are caused by dinosaur biology . ` in this sense , dinosaur biology seems quite different from mammal biology , ' he said . ` it could be that mammals are more intelligent and so they tend to have more flexible behaviour , and adapt their behaviour to their habitat . ` on the other hand , dinosaurs may have had to adapt themselves physically to survive in a different habitat , and evolved new species . ' dr longrich 's study appears in the academic journal cretaceous research .", "summary": " dr longrich from bath university has discovered new species of dinosaur .   he made the finding while working at the canadian museum of nature .   the fossilised bones from two dinosaurs had been stored for 75 years .   previously they were thought to be species from canada called anchiceratops and chasmosaurus .   but dr longrich said they are new species from western north america .   one is a species of pentaceratops , and the other is kosmoceratops .   both lived in the cretaceous period about 75 million years ago .
