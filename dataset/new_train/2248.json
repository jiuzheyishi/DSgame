{"text": "since march 11 , the six reactors at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant have been in various states of disrepair after being battered by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami . here is the latest on the status of each reactor and what was being done to prevent further emissions of radioactive material . reactor no. 1 . pressure and temperature levels at the no. 1 reactor continue to fluctuate , though hidehiko nishiyama of japan 's nuclear and industrial safety agency told reporters friday that the situation then appeared  rather stable .  while conceding that  controlling the temperature and pressure has been difficult ,  nishiyama said there were indications that the pressure and temperature were both decreasing . authorities hope to begin injecting fresh water , rather than seawater as has been done , into the reactor 's spent nuclear fuel pool . according to the japan atomic industrial forum , a nuclear industry group basing its data on official government and utility information , the no. 1 unit 's reactor core has been damaged , but its containment vessel was not . as of friday , the reactor 's cooling systems were still not operational . still , the building was  severely damaged  by an earlier hydrogen explosion . while electricity issues remain , lighting has been restored for this and the no. 2 reactors . reactor no. 2 . like with no. 1 , there has been evidence of high radiation levels in spots in and around the no. 2 reactor -- though not as high as that of the no. 3 unit . nishiyama said friday that authorities hope to start injecting fresh water -lrb- rather than the current seawater -rrb- into the reactor 's core and spent nuclear fuel pool . the water is being pumped in to help cool down nuclear fuel rods and prevent the further emission of radioactive material . damage is  suspected  in this unit 's containment vessel -- the only such vessel so compromised , according to the japan atomic industrial forum . the reactor 's core is also thought to be damaged . but the building itself has only been  slightly damaged ,  the same group reports . that said , the containment vessel pressure is considered  stable ,  the nuclear industry trade group reports . reactor no. 3 . the water that three men stepped in while laying cable in the basement of the no. 3 unit 's turbine building had 10,000 times the amount of radiation typical for that locale , nishiyama said . the workers -- each of whom tested 170 or more millisieverts of radiation , including two with direct exposure on the skin -- were admitted friday for four days of observation at japan 's national institute for radiological sciences , a research hospital in chiba . he noted that the contamination likely came from the reactor 's core , adding there 's a possibility of  some sort of leakage .  that potentially could come from a crack in the reactor core , though nishiyama cautioned that there is no definitive answer yet on how the radioactivity got into the basement . despite the suspected damage to the reactor core -- something that is n't presumed at any of the other five reactors -- the nuclear safety official said there is evidence that pressure is somehow being maintained in the vessel , making it less likely there is a big gash .  radiation levels are high  in some locations in and around the reactor , nishiyama said . these issues , including the radiation in the water , are prompting authorities to consider  other routes  to address issues at the reactor without exposing workers to excess radiation . nishiyama said that , as of friday afternoon , there was no firm plan on workarounds . firefighters from kawasaki , with assistance from the tokyo fire department , sprayed water friday on the no. 3 reactor and its spent nuclear fuel pool . the building of the no. 3 reactor was  severely damaged  after an explosion caused by the buildup of hydrogen gas , reports the japan atomic industrial forum . its core reactor is also damaged , its fuel rods are either partly or fully exposed . as to its nuclear spent fuel pool , reports are that the pool was  possibly damaged  and the water level has been low -- a reason for the repeated spraying . reactor no. 4 . a concrete pump truck was used once again friday to inject seawater into the unit 's fuel pool . along with the nos. 5 and 6 units , the no. 4 was offline on a scheduled outage when the earthquake hit , and as a result the reactor 's water level and pressure are continued safe . but its nuclear spent fuel pool was  possibly damaged ,  which is why authorities have said its water levels are low and why they 've made repeated efforts to fill it up with seawater . reactor no. 5 . the no. 5 unit appears safe , for now , nishiyama said . its capability to cool the fuel rods in the spent fuel pool is working again , according to the japan atomic industrial forum . as with units nos. 4 and 6 , this reactor was off on a scheduled outage when the quake hit and there are no major issues with the reactor and core itself . the nuclear spent fuel pool is thought to be functioning , aside from continued concerns about powering its cooling system to ensure that the fuel rods contained within remain cool . as with unit no. 6 , three holes were punched in the building earlier in order to relieve pressure and prevent a hydrogen explosion . reactor no. 6 . the no. 6 unit appears safe , for now , nishiyama said . its capability to cool the fuel rods in the spent fuel pool is working again , according to the japan atomic industrial forum . the no. 6 reactor was offline when the tsunami struck , and there are no major concerns about the structure or safety of its core or containment vessel . the nuclear spent fuel pool is thought to be functioning , aside from continued concerns about powering its cooling system to ensure that the fuel rods contained within remain cool . as with unit no. 5 , three holes were punched in the building earlier in order to relieve pressure and prevent a hydrogen explosion .", "summary": " the nos. 1 and 3 reactors are prime concerns at the northeastern japan plant .   authorities are trying to determine the source of an apparent leak in reactor no. 3 .   an official says no. 1 seems  rather stable  after challenges with heat and pressure .
