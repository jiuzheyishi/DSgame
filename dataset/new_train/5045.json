{"text": "thousands of the most seriously ill emergency patients are being forced to travel further to hospital in ambulances following a swathe of a&e closures and downgrades . figures obtained by the mail on sunday show that the number of patients with life-threatening conditions taking longer than 30 minutes to reach a&e has rocketed by an average of 37 per cent in two years . most of these people will be transported by ` blue light ' ambulance -- so the extra journey time means they are being transported further than ever to access emergency care . there has been a huge rise in the number of patients taking 30 minutes or more to get to a&e . patient groups blame cost cutting . figures from ambulance trusts across england show a rise of up to 63 per cent in just two years in the number of priority category a patients spending 30 minutes or more on the road after being collected by paramedics . such patients are so ill that trusts have a legal requirement to get paramedics to 95 per cent of cases within eight minutes . but there is no upper limit on the time it takes to get them to hospital . the shocking rise in journey times has been attributed to the closure and downgrading of a&e departments , with some operating limited opening hours . but it also shows the effect of the government 's policy to introduce major trauma networks , which means some of the most seriously ill patients go to specialist centres rather than the closest local casualty department . while paramedics are highly trained and can perform life-saving techniques , the disclosure still raises fears that patients are being put at risk by such policies . hope daley , of trade union unison , which represents ambulance workers , said : ` alarm bells should be ringing in the government and the department of health about this shocking rise in the time it takes seriously ill people to get to hospital . concerned : public services trade union unison , pictured here at a previous picket , said ` alarm bells should be ringing ' in the government over the revelations . ` patients need fast , efficient treatment without having to wait in pain . the financial straitjacket on the nhs is leading to a&e units up and down the country closing or reducing their hours to daytime only . the government must see that its policies are damaging the ability of the nhs to care properly for patients . ' a mail on sunday investigation uncovered 33 hospital emergency departments which have either already been closed or downgraded , or are under threat of closure . senior nhs executive mike farrar this week warned that the public must accept the closures if the health service is to survive and called on politicians to back the changes . but many mps are preparing to join campaigns and protest marches in their constituencies against the unpopular moves . doctors are still largely divided on the issue . while some claim the changes will improve patient care and mortality rates , others insist it puts patients at risk and dismantles the nhs . shadow health minister andrew gwynne said : ` david cameron promised to put doctors in control , but he has allowed a&e closures to be driven through even where they do n't have clinical support . ministers must take urgent action to ensure patients do n't pay the price for his broken promises on the nhs . ' this newspaper revealed in september that category a patients in newark , nottinghamshire -- where the a&e department closed last year -- took an average of 90 minutes to reach an alternative casualty department after the initial 999 call . the latest figures , obtained after a freedom of information request , illustrate the national picture for the first time , covering eight out of 11 ambulance trusts in england . senior nhs executive mike farrar has warned the public must accept cost cutting measures if the service is to survive . in the area covered by south central ambulance service , the number of category a patients taking longer than 30 minutes to reach a&e increased by 63 per cent between 2009-10 and 2011-12 -- representing an additional 2,000 patients waiting longer before being seen in hospital . the picture was similar in the north east -- where a&e units in bishop auckland and hartlepool have closed in the last few years -- with an additional 1,500 patients facing a 30-minute transit compared with two years ago , a rise of 62 per cent . in this area , patients with a certain type of heart attack or suffering major trauma are now taken to specialist units rather than district hospitals . in yorkshire , 17,305 seriously ill patients spent 30 minutes in transit compared with just over 11,000 in 2009 -- an increase of more than 50 per cent . several a&e s in yorkshire have closed or have been downgraded and others have limited opening hours . the numbers in the area covered by south east coast ambulance service represent a rise of 37 per cent in two years , and in the east midlands there were 23 per cent more journeys taking longer than half an hour in just 12 months . in the west midlands the numbers rose by 27 per cent . the exceptions to the national picture were in the east of england , where there was a rise of less than one per cent , and in london , where the number of journeys taking longer than half an hour fell by around a third . roger goss , of campaign group patient concern , said : ` we 're getting close to crunch time when we find out who was right -- the medics who tell people they are more likely to survive if they travel to a specialist unit , or those who said patients would be arriving at a&e in a box .
