' mr james said clark , who has been sacked , moved out of his home after his marriage broke down and went to live at his school . he said : ` he was effectively living for some time in a cupboard in a school where he worked at the time . ` that fact explains the presence of the material in that particular location . ' mr james added : ` this has been an extremely salutary lesson for him . he feels very concerned about the way he will be seen by right-minded members of the public . ` he has mentioned to me how sad it is that by behaving in this way he had deprived himself of the work he enjoyed very much . he will no longer be able to work in the sort of environment that he had worked in previously . ` this was a product of the circumstances of a break-up in his personal life . he is unlikely to behave in this way again .
