{"text": "before the likes of apple , google and other pioneers of the technological world , 20th century inventors came up with novel and wacky ways of developing existing products . among the most bizarre ideas that never managed to take off include reading glasses fitted with mirrors and radio-fitted hats from the 1930s ; an extendable caravan that made a stretch limousine look compact , and a car that could scoop pedestrians off the road to prevent them from being run over . other inventions include a vending machine that served hot sausages in germany and a contraption that shut out all outside noise and was fitted with an oxygen mask to ensure the wearer did n't suffocate . these hamblin glasses were invented in 1936 and were designed to make it easier for people to read in bed . the words from the page were beamed to the reader 's eyes using mirrors so the reader could lie on their back and now have to strain their neck . forget the stretch limo , this invention from 1934 is a stretch caravan . it was designed by a french engineer and comprised of three sections that slotted together when the caravan was being towed . when the holidaymakers arrived at the campsite , the caravan could be extended to provide extra living space . in 1924 , swimwear was fitted with wooden panels as safety devices . the wood was naturally buoyant and were designed to stop wearers from drowning . yet despite these early inventors ' forward-thinking , many of these creations never made it into the mainstream . the pioneering radio hat designed in the u.s in 1931 comprised of a boater hat fitted with a transmitter and speaker , allowing the wearer to take the news with them wherever they go . a more ambitious way of using the relatively new wireless radio technology was in the 1921 radio pram . it was fitted with a transmitter and meant parents could keep up with news and current affairs while walking their child . the radio could also be used to soothe the baby 's crying . for people who preferred reading rather than listening to the radio , a pair of hamblin glasses were invented in . 1936 designed to make it easier for people to read in bed . the . words from the page were beamed to the reader 's eyes using mirrors so . the reader could lie on their back and not have to strain their neck . many of the other historical brainwaves of the early 20th century involved inventors ' taking transportation at the time and making it more efficient or useful . a french inventor created an amphibious bicycle that let the user navigate land and sea using bulbous floats combined with wheels . the 1924 wooden swimsuit allowed wearers to swim safely because the wooden panels were naturally buoyant and would keep them afloat . following the invention of the wireless , inventors in the u.s took the technology a step further . the radio headwear , left , was invented in 1931 and comprised of a boater hat fitted with a radio transmitter and a speaker . while the radio pram from 1921 , right , was equipped with a transmitter that could be used to soothe the baby as it slept . before radar equipment became more mainstream , an inventor in the 1940s came up with this novel way of trying to listen for enemies . the dishes were used to pick up and amplify sounds , which became louder as they moved through the tunnels . the user could then listen into by standing in the centre and putting each ear on the tunnel exits . italian goventosa de udine 's harebrained idea for a one-wheeled motorcycle was conceived in 1931 and enabled the rider to hit speeds of 150 kilometers per hour . forget the stretch limo , in 1934 one french engineer invented the stretch caravan . it comprised of three sections that slotted together when the caravan was . being towed . when the holidaymakers arrived at the campsite , the caravan . could be extended to provide extra living space . another wacky design to come from the same decade may have been one of . the first off-road vehicles . invented in 1936 , the truck was fitted with ten wheels and each tyre sat at slightly different angles . this meant it could drive across . all terrains and climb up and down slopes with a 65 per cent gradient . this wacky design may have been one of the first off-road vehicles . it was invented in 1936 and had ten wheels with tyres sitting at different angles . this meant it could drive across all terrains and climb up and down slopes with a 65 per cent gradient . another take on the design of cars at the start of the 20th century , this vehicle was fitted with a safety scoop to prevent pedestrians from being run over . it was designed in france and this picture dates back to 1924 . transport safety was also a key . concern and in 1920s paris , inventors came up with a scoop to attach to . the front of cars which meant that if a pedestrian were hit they would . be safely scooped up into the net . all . the noise of the city too much for you ? how about slipping into hug . gernsback 's 1925 invention , the isolator . this contraption . was designed to eliminate all outside noise and isolate the user in a . peaceful working environment . it came complete with an oxygen mask so the wearer would n't suffocate . later in the century , before radar equipment became mainstream , an inventor in the 1940s came up with a novel way of trying to listen for enemies . large dishes were used to pick up and amplify sounds , which became louder as they moved through attached tunnels . the user could then listen in by standing in the centre and putting each ear on the tunnel exits . hugo gernsback 's 1925 invention , the isolator , pictured left , was a contraption designed to eliminate all outside noise and isolate the user in a peaceful working environment . it came complete with an oxygen mask so the wearer would n't suffocate . the invention on the right is an early , german take on the vending machine from 1931 that served hot sausages rather than fizzy drinks .", "summary": " others include reading glasses fitted with mirrors so readers did n't have to strain their neck , invented in 1936 .   in paris during the 1920s , one inventor created an extendable caravan that made stretch limousines look compact .   a german invention included a vending machine which dispensed hot sausages instead of fizzy drinks .
