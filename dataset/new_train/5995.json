{"text": "flt lt des smith in 1942 when stationed at raf ibsley . he has left money in his will to help restore the tower . a unique wartime control tower where classic film the first of the few was filmed has been saved from ruin thanks to the legacy of a spitfire pilot . more than 70 years after the movie starring david niven and leslie howard was recorded at raf ibsley the dilapidated concrete building is to be restored to its former glory after wartime pilot des smith left thousands dedicated to the cause in his will . then prime minister winston . churchill gave his permission for ibsley to be used for the biopic which chronicles the true story of how two of the most remarkable men in aviation history - visionary spitfire designer rj mitchell and his test pilot geoffrey crisp - designed a streamlined monoplane that led to the development of the spitfire . but the film was shot while the tower was in use and work was constantly interrupted when real spitfire . pilots had to scramble . but it was thanks to this that howard was able to recreate scenes from the battle of britain from the first hand accounts of squadrons 501 and 118 - which fought in the 1940 battle - and were based there . some of the raf pilots were even given small parts in the movie . ironically , the base was just a few miles from the one-time home of nazi propagandist the traitor william joyce , nicknamed lord haw-haw . he moved from the area in 1937 shortly before he left for germany and began his notorious radio broadcasts . the raf ibsley airfield heritage trust . has now secured a lease for the air base in hampshire 's new forest and now . hope to preserve it forever by turning it into a museum using some of the money left in fl lt smith 's will . before he died in 2010 aged in his late 80s , fl lt smith recalled his time at ibsley , which is near the town of ringwood . des smith , pictured in 2010 back in the ibsley control tower he fought to save for the nation , and where classic film the first of the few was filmed . more than 70 years after the movie starring david niven and leslie howard was recorded at raf ibsley the dilapidated concrete building is to be brought back to life . he said : ' i was posted to ibsley just a few weeks after they finished filming the first of the few in early 1942 . ` there were three squadrons based there including 501 , which was the one i was in . ' i . remember flying in and out of the new forest during the war and i 've . always lived locally so i 've watched as the tower has become neglected . ` it . all looks a bit different now because gravel has been extracted from . the ground and that process has left lakes near the old air base . ` although the tower is just a shell , the surroundings are beautiful with the lakes and trees . the first of the few told the true story of two of the most remarkable men in aviation history - visionary spitfire designer rj mitchell and his test pilot geoffrey crisp . a spitfire pictured at raf iblsey , where three squadrons were based during world war two . ` it is the only tower in the forest that it is possible to restore and we just hope that we can get it done . the battle of britain was the german air force 's attempt to gain air superiority over the raf from july to september 1940 . it was one of the turning points of world war two and prevented germany from invading britain . the battle began in mid-july with luftwaffe concentrating on attacking shipping in the english channel and attacking coastal towns and defences . from 12 august , hermann goering , one of the leaders of the nazi regime , shifted his focus to the destruction of the raf , attacking the many airfields and radar bases which had sprung up across the country during the war . convinced that fighter command was now close to defeat , he also tried to force air battles between fighter planes to break british strength . however , goering grew frustrated by the large number of british planes that were still fighting off his attacks . luftwaffe switched tactics again and , on hitler 's orders , set about destroying london and other major cities . eleven days later , on what became ` battle of britain day ' , the raf decimated the huge incoming luftwaffe formations in the skies above london and the south coast . the tower , a so called type 518/40 ` watch office with meteorological section ' base , is similar . to about 50 others that were built for world war ii but it was the only one . with concrete floors and balcony . the trust will now start . weatherproofing and carrying out structural surveys of the building in . the next few months , followed by refurbishment plans and a major . fund-raising campaign . the news has delighted shirley simmonds , president of the ibsley historical group that has been campaigning for many years for the building to be saved . the widow of battle of britain pilot flight lieutenant vernon simmonds , who was also a driver at ibsley in the war , said : ` at last it finally feels like something is happening . ` i 'm absolutely delighted that this building will be given a new and useful purpose , telling future generations the story of raf ibsley , its squadrons and the many thousands of personnel that served there . ' roly errington , chairman of the raf ibsley airfield heritage trust , said : ` it is the last chance saloon for this building and if it gets much more damaged by rain it will be beyond saving . ` it is a unique building and was the first base that the americans took over and was the place where they flew their first sorties from . ` to make it succeed it has to be about more than just rescuing a unique building from dereliction , we must also give it a sustainable future . ` we want to create somewhere for people to come and find out about raf ibsley and show them how a world war two airfield would have operated . ` we intend to tell the stories of the people that lived around the airfield , and the impact it had on their lives . ` we want to restore the building as a tribute , from our generation , to the service personnel from great britain and around the world that served at ibsley and , in particular , to those that lost their lives while stationed here . ' 501 spitfire squadron at raf ibsley in 1942 . some of those posted at ibsley had bit parts and helped contribute to the film starring david niven and leslie howard . the ibsley historical group was formed in 1992 and consisted mainly of people who worked at the base . the raf ibsley airfield heritage trust has been formed recently to concentrate on securing the future of the building . the airbase is surrounded by lakes because the area was used to extract gravel from after the war .", "summary": " pilot des smith vowed to restore raf ibsley to its former glory before he died in 2010 .   the film was shot while the tower was in use and work was interrupted when real spitfire .   pilots were scrambled .   it is hoped the building will be turned into a museum telling story of world war two airfields .
