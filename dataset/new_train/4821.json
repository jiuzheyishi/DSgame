{"text": "days after he fatally shot an unarmed black teen in august , officer darren wilson was cutting grass when he was told his home address was circulating online . within three hours , he 'd grabbed some bags and gone into hiding , according to his attorneys .  he had to leave the grass , literally , half mowed ,  his lawyer , neil bruntrager , told cnn 's don lemon late wednesday . since then , he 's stayed under the radar by moving from house to house , including briefly living with one of his lawyers , and spending time watching movies in dark theaters to avoid detection . wilson says he 's sorry but his conscience is clear . ` not a question of if ... but when ' his lawyers revealed details about his time in hiding to cnn and the washington post newspaper wednesday . they told cnn that wilson is in talks to leave the ferguson police department and may give up being an officer altogether -- after a grand jury decided not to indict him in the death of michael brown .  it 's not a question of if , it 's a question of when ,  bruntrager said about his leaving the police department . bruntrager confirmed what cnn originally reported last week . his time in hiding . wilson 's shooting of the teen sparked days of sometimes violent protests in the st. louis suburb of ferguson . as a result , the officer 's address was shared online , forcing him to flee his home , his attorneys said .  there were death threats out against him ,  bruntrager said .  there were bounties that had been placed upon his life .  his client , he said , resorted to various measures to hide his identity .  he 's had to learn to live in a way that makes him completely unnoticeable . as a consequence , there are several techniques that he utilizes that make that happen ,  bruntrager said without elaborating .  it 's an odd way to live your life . but for him , it 's all about his family .  except for his getting married last month , bruntrager told the washington post on wednesday that wilson mostly stayed out of the public eye . wilson preferred going to the movies because it was dark , bruntrager told the paper , jokingly saying that the officer  cross-dressed a lot .  keeping him safe was the first priority , he said . future uncertain . immediately after the shooting , wilson maintained that he wanted to return to his job as a police officer , his lawyers said . but his officer days may be behind him .  realistically , he ca n't go back to being a police officer ,  bruntrager said .  he knows that . there 's no illusion about any of this . but it 's the way in which he leaves ... that 's important to him on different levels .   we want to make sure when he does , it 's amicable ,  he told cnn .  he 's on paid leave , and there are discussions that are going on right now to separate from the department in an amicable fashion .  another attorney told the post that wilson 's safety had a lot to do with his decision to leave .  i think i expressed to him , ` do you realize your first call -lrb- back on the job -rrb- will be to a blind alley where you 're executed ? ' he took a pause for a minute , thought about it and said , ` oh . ' that is the reality ,  his attorney , james towey , told the paper . wilson , 28 , spent six years with the ferguson police department before being placed on leave after the shooting on august 9 . before his stint in ferguson , he worked for two years at another police department . last week , cnn reported that wilson told associates he would resign to help ease pressure and protect his fellow officers . wilson had expressed concern about resigning while the grand jury was hearing evidence for fear it would appear he was admitting fault . his many interviews . wilson has said he killed the 18-year-old out of fear for his life during their encounter . he maintains he did nothing wrong and was forced to shoot brown after the teen attacked him and tried to take his gun .  i just felt the immense power that he had . and then the way i 've described it is , it was like a 5-year-old holding onto hulk hogan ,  wilson told abc news on tuesday .  that 's just how big this man was . he was very large , very powerful man .  his lawyers said his story has remained the same throughout .  i met darren wilson approximately one hour after the incident ,  his attorney , greg kleoppel , told cnn .  that statement has been consistent one hour after the shooting , the following interview with the st. louis county detective and on august 10 when it was recorded at the st. louis county police department .  bruntrager said the officer went through a series of interviews .  before he testified before the grand jury , he was also interviewed by the fbi and the justice department . they came in and gave him an exceedingly rigorous interview , where they did n't leave any question unasked ,  he said . called a ` murderer ' brown 's father , michael brown sr. , did n't mince words when he spoke about the officer . he described him as a  murderer  during an interview with cnn .  he understood his actions . he understood exactly what he was doing . you know , he did n't have a second thought , a pushback thought , or nothing . he was intending to kill someone . that 's how i look at it ,  the elder brown said .  he was going to kill someone at that point .  next steps . wilson 's legal fights may not be over . there 's a federal investigation under way .  so we have a civil rights charge potentially down the road ,  kleoppel told cnn .  however , that 's going to be very difficult to prove , because on a civil rights violation , you must prove that he intended to violate an individual 's rights , and in this case , his life . civil suit ... we 'll have to wait and see .  but his legal issues are the least of wilson 's worries .  he still has to deal with so many other issues because of all this ,  bruntrager said . ` sorry for your loss ' though he has not said much , wilson sympathizes with brown 's family , his lawyers said .  his remorse and his sadness about what happened is there , and it 's real ,  bruntrager told cnn .  but in respect to the browns , he 's been very careful to sort of stand back . he knows that whatever he says , it 's not going to be read as he means it . he thought it 's better to say , ` i 'm sorry for your loss . ' it 's simple , but it 's direct . and if you knew him , you 'd understand that 's the kind of guy he is .  complete coverage of what 's happening in ferguson .", "summary": " lawyer : wilson may give up being an officer altogether .    it 's not a question of if , it 's a question of when ,  attorney says .   wilson , 28 , spent six years with the ferguson police department .
