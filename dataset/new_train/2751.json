{"text": "there 's a reason most of scotland 's population clusters near the english border . it 's safer there -- ok , give or take certain glasgow pubs . the country just gets wilder the further north you go . from its ghostly peat bog moors , to the minke whales and basking sharks patrolling its islands , the wild geese that flock here and even its own indigenous cat -lrb- a wild cat -- in scotland ? -rrb- , this small country contains some of the most unspoiled territory left in europe . yet few people in heavily urbanized britain -- or outside it -- know much of these fiercely beautiful places within their country 's borders . fewer still have explored them . below is the nitty-gritty -lrb- there 's probably some scottish way of saying that -rrb- of getting to them , starting with a certain improbable cat ... 1 .  highland tigers  there are fewer than 100 purebred wildcats left in scotland . seeing a  highland tiger  in the wild is a rare privilege , but you might glimpse one in the thick heather and fir woodlands of the cairngorms national park -lrb- access free , 365 days a year -rrb- . this pocket wilderness is home to red deer , golden eagle and osprey , as well as wildcats . most of the park , whose landscapes include four of scotland 's five highest peaks , can be explored only on foot . 2 . the curlew 's cry on the moor . few places feel as wild as windswept rannoch moor . only one road crosses this expanse of peat bog , heather moorland , streams and lochans -lrb- a small loch -rrb- . often the only sound here is the cry of the curlew , a wading bird . this remote country is traversed by the west highland way . after crossing the moor , this long-distance trail plunges into the forbidding ravine of glencoe . in 1692 , campbell soldiers in government pay massacred almost 80 macdonald clanspeople here . the walk across the moor from bridge of orchy -lrb- four trains daily from glasgow -- see scotrail.co.uk -rrb- takes one day . allow another day to walk to glencoe and down the rugged  devil 's staircase  to the coast . you can camp anywhere on the way , but beware of swarms of biting midges in summer . 3 . scotland -- by sea kayak . the scottish sea kayak trail is europe 's first long-distance sea kayak journey . this 500-kilometer odyssey takes in almost mythically beautiful stretches of coastline between gigha , off the mull of kintyre , and the summer isles , near ullapool . you can do the journey in stages , or in one epic voyage that takes around two weeks . wilderness scotland -lrb- inverdruie house , inverdruie , aviemore ;
