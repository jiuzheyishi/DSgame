{"text": "follow @@ mike_dickson_dm . from getting lost on the metro to badly chipping his tooth on a baguette to making miraculous mid-match recoveries from injury -- strange things tend to happen to andy murray at the french open . nothing , however , could top the tale of the unexpected that would be reaching the final at the expense of rafael nadal , the man who has only ever lost one best-of-five-set match on clay out of 89 played . without a head coach and largely scratching around for form prior to the event , murray must defeat not only the eight-time champion , but also the opponent who has proved the most formidable obstacle to his ambitions at grand slams . video scroll down to watch sportsmail 's mike dickson preview the semi-finals in paris . all set : andy murray plays a volley as he takes part in a practice session at roland garros on thursday . murray 's finest career achievements have come when the spaniard has been out of the way , either through being absent with injury -lrb- the 2012 us open and olympics -rrb- or wimbledon last year , when nadal was upset in the first round . ahead of friday 's semi-final , wimbledon champion murray was honest enough to admit : ` i 'd rather it was someone else than rafa , but it 's a great opportunity for me to go out there and play a great match and see if i can beat him . ' there had been plenty of drama even prior to wednesday night 's extraordinary late win over gael monfils , with the marathon against philipp kohlschreiber and beating fernando verdasco despite letting slip 15 break points . that , coincidentally , was the number that he had when he met nadal in the semi-finals here three years ago in going down in straight sets . it showed that he is easily capable of creating opportunities against the greatest ever clay court player . braveheart : murray lets out a roar after his quarter-final victory over gael monfils on wednesday . murray did so again three weeks ago when he led the spaniard 4-2 in the decider of the italian open quarter-final : ` i did n't win but maybe if i had won a few more matches in the build-up it could have helped , ' he said . ` i 'm in a good position right now . i would have signed up for this . ` the hunger is there . i believe 100 per cent i can beat rafa and novak -lrb- djokovic -rrb- , but on this surface it 's harder for me than other courts because it 's not my best and they are two of the greatest clay-court players . ` it was hard for the two or three months after wimbledon . as soon as i had the surgery and made that decision , motivation was n't an issue for these events . i had no days off for three months getting ready for the australian open . i did n't need to do that . close-run : murray shakes hands with rafael nadal after their italian open quarter-final in rome last month . ` a lot of players have surgery and take three or four weeks off but i trained every single day to get ready to get myself in shape and i am seeing the benefits of doing that now . ' murray needs a big win against one of his main rivals -- he has not beaten a top-10 player since wimbledon and only jo-wilfried tsonga from the top 20 -- to authenticate the claim that he is properly back . as john mcenroe said on thursday : ` playing nadal in the semis -- it 's  now let 's see how far he is going to go here  . ' words of wisdom : nadal speaks with coach and uncle toni -lrb- left -rrb- during a practice session in paris on thursday . far from ivan lendl 's absence being a handicap , it is starting to look an advantage in some ways with murray taking responsibility for himself in a sport which always boils down to self-reliance . his success of the past 10 days makes it far less likely that he will bring a new coach in before wimbledon . murray and nadal have the closest thing to a genuine friendship between the established stars of the men 's game , but theirs is also the most statistically one-sided rivalry with the spaniard ahead 14-5 . history suggests it is difficult to see that improving in the scot 's favour on friday . respect : murray lost to nadal in three sets in their last semi-final clash at roland garros in 2011 . ernests gulbis plays djokovic , making the tournament 's special guest appearance among the ` big four ' in the semi-finals , and he has earned it . it helps that the 18th seed cares little for reputations , and his frank discourse on life and tennis after every match leaven the stolid fare generally served up by his peers . what will serve him best on friday is his outstanding backhand among other things , and if djokovic slips up in any way then the colourful latvian is the kind of free spirit who will happily take advantage . fired up : ermests gulbis takes on novak djokovic in the first semi-final at roland garros on friday .", "summary": " nadal has only ever lost one best-of-five set match on clay out of 89 played .   the world no 1 is an eight-time champion at roland garros .   murray took nadal to three sets at the italian open last month .   the spaniard leads the head-to-head record 14-5 .   novak djokovic faces ernests gulbis in friday 's first semi-final .
