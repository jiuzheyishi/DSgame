{"text": "warning : stephen hester , the rbs chief executive , warned today that it could take 10 years for the government to dispose of its 81 per cent stake in the bank . the sale of state-owned royal bank of scotland so taxpayers can be repaid their # 45billion stake could drag on for a decade , according to its outgoing chief executive . stephen hester said that privatising the bank was a long-term project that could take until 2023 . mr hester was pushed out last week in a move approved by chancellor george osborne , although he will pick up a golden goodbye worth up to # 5.6 million . he was brought in to run the bank after the treasury was forced to bail out rbs during the financial crisis five years ago by buying an 81 per cent stake . but mr osborne believes he is not the right person to guide the bank through privatisation . mr hester said : ` it is clearly up to the government how it privatises , when it privatises and what the important features are . ` my observation is that if the desired proceeds are # 45billion , then there has never been a privatisation that raises that much in one go . it is likely that it would be , if you do it conventionally , four or five goes over ten years . ` that 's why i 've always been confident that the state would get its # 45billion back . ' he said he would support a wholesale giveaway of shares to the public , in the style of the privatisation of british gas in the eighties , which was marketed with the ` tell sid ' ad campaign . mr hester said that while such a giveaway was ` perfectly legitimate ' , mr osborne had to consider the politics of the sale as well as the economics . he claimed he did not feel any anger over the manner of his departure , adding : ` i do n't want to show frustration , i do n't want to punch someone in the eye . sell-off : the government is hoping to recoup the full # 45billion it spent bailing out the royal bank of scotland at the height of the financial crisis . ` i have n't hidden from anyone that i am torn a bit at this juncture . ` part of me did want to see the job . fully through , did want the champagne and roses of a successful . privatisation . another part of me thought ,  goodness me , this job drives . me nuts from time to time and how long do i want to do it for ?  . ` i genuinely mean i am comfortable . with what has happened . rbs is in much better shape than we had any . right to think it could be . i want the company to have a good future and . i want to pass the baton on smoothly and without rancour or difficulty . i am happy with this result . ' the treasury is said to agree that . the sell-off will take a while . sources said last week it would take . ` many years ' to complete what would be the biggest privatisation in . history . replacing mr hester is expected to . take at least six months , with mr osborne reportedly sharing the rbs . board 's view that the next chief executive must be prepared to stay on . for at least five years . a # 1 billion rescue plan for the co-operative 's troubled banking arm is set to be unveiled this week in a move likely to hit up to 5,000 small investors . the mutual has been racing to plug a shortfall of up to # 1.5 billion in its finances identified by the prudential regulation authority -lrb- pra -rrb- , the new city watchdog . it is likely to do so through the disposal of its insurance business and a portfolio of loans , although the sunday times said a large part of the cash is expected to come from bondholders . this would impact more than 5,000 investors who lent money to the co-op through securities called permanent interest bearing shares that pay dividends of up to 13 per cent a year . as much as 30 per cent of their cash could be wiped out or transferred into a new vehicle , it was reported . no taxpayers ' money will be involved and the co-op will be spared from having to sell other assets in the wider group , such as its pharmacy chain . the black hole in the co-op 's capital reserves largely stems from commercial property loans acquired through a merger with the britannia building society in 2009 that created a financial ` super-mutual ' .", "summary": " outgoing boss says government 's 81 % stake will have to be sold off in four or five tranches over a decade .   hester could leave with a # 14million ` golden goodbye ' package .   george osborne set to begin sell-off of lloyds shares this summer .
