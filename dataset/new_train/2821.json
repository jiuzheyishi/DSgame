{"text": "california republican gubernatorial candidate tim donnelly took to cnn 's spanish-language airwaves recently to deny accusations that a campaign ad he shot with cuban-venezuelan actress maria conchita alonso is racist . the candidate , who is also a state assemblyman , touted his filipina wife as evidence that he 's not prejudiced .  if i am a racist , i 'm not a very good one ,  donnelly said thursday on cnn en espaÃ ± ol 's  directo usa  show .  i must have gone to the wrong school where you learn how to be a racist because i married a woman with dark skin . as a matter of fact , her skin 's darker than maria conchita 's .  alonso agreed , saying ,  tim is married to a filipina . his daughter-in-law is mexican . he is not a racist and neither am i , as we are now being accused .  the three-minute video , released january 13 on youtube , has come under fire by some latinos and latino groups . in the video , alonso cradles a small , sweater-clad lapdog she calls tequila as she translates , and oftentimes reinterprets , donnelly 's views on a wide range of issues . at one point , alonso makes a somewhat crude allusion to donnelly 's boldness . in the ad , donnelly says ,  i want a gun in every californians gun safe . i want the government out of our business and our bedroom . i want to bring the film industry back where she belongs , hollywood .  to which alonso responds ,  los tiene bien grandes y esta enojado  meaning ,  he has really big ones , and he 's angry .  the candidate said the exchanges are meant to be tongue-in-cheek , but to some latinos , who have taken to twitter to express their outrage , the spot comes across as bizarre and ridiculous and as a stereotypical attempt to connect with latino voters . alonso , in particular , has drawn sharp criticism for endorsing a tea party favorite and immigration hard liner who in 2011 tried to gather enough signatures to repeal california 's so-called dream act , a law that allows undocumented college students to use state financial aid programs . donnelly also founded a local chapter in 2005 of the armed civilian border patrol group the minutemen . in a series of tweets , mexican-american cartoonist and immigration activist lalo alcaraz called alonso a vulgar spanish term for idiot or stupid . tony hernandez , co-founder and producer for the immigrant archive project , an independent initiative dedicated to preserving the life stories of america 's immigrant population , tweeted that he was shocked to see the latina actress supporting the perceived anti-immigrant gubernatorial candidate . over the weekend , the 56-year-old former beauty queen turned telenovela and hollywood star said the resulting fallout forced her to resign from a san francisco production of  the vagina monologues .   of course she has the right to say whatever she wants ,  producer eliana lopez told local cbs affiliate kpix .  but ... doing what she is doing is against what we believe .  alonso , however , said on  directo usa  that she firmly stands by her decision to support donnelly for two reasons : donnelly 's proposed plan to create more jobs and his desire to raise the minimum wage to $ 20 an hour , something the candidate has said he would do by unleashing california 's natural resources .  we ought to be fracking and drilling our way to prosperity rather than sitting on an ocean of oil and importing it from our enemies ,  donnelly told  directo usa  anchor juan carlos lopez , noting what occurred in north dakota . in that state , mcdonald 's restaurants offered employees about $ 15 an hour , plus signing bonuses after the discovery of the parshall oil field in 2006 , which boosted the economy and led to a labor shortage . as to donnelly 's stance on immigration , alonso offers a few explanations .  after 9/11 , he told me that he organized a group of civilians to go protect the border from the invasion , not of mexicans ,  alonso said .  a lot of arabs and drugs enter through the mexican border , so what he did was protect us from the people who wanted to come attack us .  alonso also said donnelly  today supports the idea of helping immigrant children who came to the u.s. at the age of 3 or 5 with their college education .  however , donnelly said in the  directo usa  interview that the dream act  is an open-ended entitlement that will invite and incentive more people to come here illegally . ... i 'm not upset at people for coming here . i 'm mad at my government for inviting people to come the most dangerous way possible and putting their lives at risk .  a spokesman for california democratic gov. jerry brown dismissed donnelly 's campaign ad .  what this video lacks in terms of logic and sanity , they make up for it in pure entertainment value ,  said dan newman , a political strategist and adviser to brown . even some fellow republicans have taken issue with donnelly 's latest spot . in a statement , cafÃ © con leche republicans , a latino group , said the ad is so bad it 's almost laughable . and , the group said , rather than appeal to hispanics , the ad insults their intelligence .  maria conchita alonso is no doubt a great actress , but as we 've seen time and time again , movie stars often lack common sense ,  the group said in a release . the actress is known to be politically provocative . she is an outspoken critic of former cuban leader fidel castro and of deceased venezuelan president hugo chÃ ¡ vez , whom she once described as a hitler-like dictator and upon his death said she was not sad about his departure but that  ideally he would be alive with cancer , in jail .  but this endorsement surprised many people , leading some to wonder whether she was paid to support donnelly . the actress said she was not . the pair has found some support on social media , where some people have tweeted that alonso should not be attacked but should be free to exercise her first amendment right to free speech . however , the overwhelming sense among latinos appears to be that invoking ethnic stereotypes and vehemently opposing immigration reform might not be the best strategy to win the governorship of a state where about 38 % of its residents are latino .", "summary": " cuban-venezuelan actress maria conchita alonso makes ad with candidate .   tea party republican donnelly , alonzo
