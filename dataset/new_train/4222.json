{"text": "films such as  django unchained  carry with them an uncommonly high concentration of influence and opportunity . due to the scarcity of diverse and inspiring representations on screen , quentin tarantino 's latest movie casts a longer shadow than many are willing to acknowledge . in a recent interview with uk channel 4 , tarantino stated his goals and interpretation of the oscar-nominated film 's impact :  i 've always wanted to explore slavery ... to give black american males a hero ... and revenge . ... i am responsible for people talking about slavery in america in a way they have not in 30 years .  he went on ,  violence on slaves has n't been dealt with to the extent that i 've dealt with it .  my personal biracial experience growing up on both sides of segregated hoods , suburbs and backcountry taught me a lot about the coded language and arithmetic of racism . i was often invisible when topics of race arose , the racial adoptee that you spoke honestly in front of . i grew up hearing the candid dirt from both sides , and i studied it . the conversation was almost always influenced by something people read or saw on a screen . media portrayals greatly affect , if not entirely construct , how we interpret  otherness .  people see what they are shown , and little else . it 's why my dad forced me to study and value history from an absurdly young age -- to build a foundation solid enough to withstand cultural omissions from the curriculum and distortions from the media . it 's what led me to become a teacher of american and african history out of college . there is a glaring difference in outlook between those who have mined the rich , empowering truth about how we 've come to be , and those who just accept that there 's only one or two people of african descent deemed worthy of entire history books . if , like tarantino , you show up with a megaphone and claim to be creating a real solution to a specific problem , i only ask that you not instead , construct something unnecessarily fake and then act like you 've done us a favor . vote for your oscar favorites .  django unchained  is being projected on screens around the world , out of context : a slim percentage of consumers have any real understanding of what took place during slavery , one of history 's most prolonged , barbaric and celebrated human rights violations . sadly , for many americans , this film is the beginning and the end of that history lesson . this film follows a brave , cunning and fearless lead character whose name starts with a  d.  viewers of the film 's trailer would think that character is django , played by jamie foxx . in fact , his name is dr. king schultz , a german portrayed by christoph waltz , -lrb- spoiler alert -rrb- who sacrifices his life in the pursuit of freedom and justice for the black man . it is the white dr. king , who after sharing a motivational tale about a man reaching a mountaintop , nobly gives his life for  black justice .  tarantino rightly claims that the abundant use of  nigger  in the film was authentic and of the time . of course it was . so was chattel slavery and the back-breaking manual labor that kept these massive plantations thriving . tarantino 's plantations are nearly empty farms with well-dressed negresses in flowing gowns , frolicking on swings and enjoying leisurely strolls through the grounds , as if the setting is versailles , mixed in with occasional acts of barbarism against slaves . it 's the opposite of the exploration of the real phenomenon of slavery about which he boasts . sometimes we sacrifice accuracy for story , but these inaccuracies are completely unnecessary . how does depicting slave plantations like circus campgrounds , fit with delirious , babbling overseers wielding bull whips and overdressed rabble wandering aimlessly , further django 's truth ? the film 's antagonist , calvin candie , played by leonardo dicaprio , supposedly runs one of the very worst plantations in all of mississippi . yet on the road he dines with his slaves , and at home , his fields are mostly empty and he only seems to have slaves in his house . is this one of those rare slave plantations that primarily trades in polished silverware and gossip ? that authenticity card that tarantino uses to buy all those  niggers  has an awfully selective memory . in the film 's opening sequence , shackled blacks literally hold the key to their shackles and do n't use them , choosing instead to trudge forward , hindered by biting chains , to kill a white man . in the third act , after seeing django kill the australians , the blacks sitting in an open cage neither communicate with each other or consider stepping outside of the cage . review : ` django unchained ' in fact , in this entire , nearly three-hour film , there are no scenes with black people interacting , or even looking at each other , in a respectful or productive way . if only one black person -lrb- django -rrb- displays the vaguest interest in gaining freedom , while the rest consistently demonstrate that they would n't do anything with that freedom , were they to obtain it , then we 're not able to become invested in them or their pursuits : we ca n't relate to shiftless characters . being illiterate , and/or brown , does not remove the ability to think , or observe or yearn or plan or develop meaningful relationships . despite the repeated suggestions that they are similar narratives ,  django unchained  has little in common with  inglourious basterds ,  tarantino 's 2009 fantasy involving a band of american soldiers taking revenge against the nazis . the latter 's title characters choose to form a band of men who risk their lives for a generous and creative endeavor to stop the holocaust completely , saving all of their people , not just one .  django  is just a random guy , who , to no credit of his own , was plucked from slavery by an impressive white man and led on a journey to save his wife .  inglourious  did not walk us through provocative scenes of concentration camp torture , gas chambers and ethnically stereotyped victims . nor were jewish characters subjected to the indignities of being torn apart by dogs . and while we have our trusty authenticity card out , did the jewish people not suffer the repeated verbal onslaught of  kike ,   rats  and other grotesque terms ? were such words used in  inglourious basterds  more than 100 times ? how about 70 ? ok 30 ? 10 ? thankfully , tarantino knew that he was perfectly able to tell a story without such gimmicks . -lrb- he also knew the community he claimed to be avenging would n't stand for it . -rrb- . hey , remember when tarantino was selling those emaciated jewish prisoner action figures with the concentration camp tattoos ? so funny and ironic and harmless , right ? no . that would have been cheap and disgusting . yet the filmmakers agreed to the release of action-figure slave and slaver dolls to help promote  django .  it was an especially offensive decision because selling slave figurines falls directly in line with the centuries-old american tradition of desensitizing us to the horrors of slavery with cute , palatable commodities . tarantino did n't invent this tacky strategy ; he just dug it back up . opinion : why ` django ' stirs race debate . think for a moment of the lengths that tarantino went , to create a heroic triumph for his  inglourious basterds .  he created an imaginary scenario wherein his characters could outwit and ultimately incinerate hitler and his top advisers in a movie theater . it was choose-your-own-adventure heroism to create figures that took complete agency in the acquisition of their freedom . a very cool idea . a big reason slavery is avoided in american storytelling is guilt . unlike the holocaust , when it comes to slavery , our people were the bad guys . but we 're not german , so we can rail on hitler and the nazis all day without thinking critically about our legacy . for descendants of slaves , and all americans , our ovens -- the slave plantations -- are tourist destinations and wedding venues , home to preservation societies and guided tours . the  good ole days ,  when faceless black folks with zero potential were merely quiet , collateral damage . america 's minimal comprehension of slavery combined with the kind of trivialization  django  offers renders us ill-equipped to empathize with its victims . this is a chicken or the egg manipulation :  do i know nothing about the complexity of slavery because it 's not that big a deal , or must it not be that big a deal because i 'm only vaguely informed ?  none of my criticisms would be different had the person in the director 's chair been a different color -lrb- though all widely released american films heavily involving slavery in the united states have been directed by white men -rrb- . my concerns are limited to the onscreen material , its advertised aims and the consequences . we try so hard to distance ourselves from the generations that made a business out of systematically crippling a people and the public 's vision of their abilities and intentions . we 're so different now , are n't we ? we are civilized . by popular measure , so were they . and we deserve better , than this lazy , oversimplified reduction of our history . -lrb- note : want to read more about django ? click here for a detailed breakdown of the specific scenes that i found problematic . -rrb- .", "summary": " director quentin tarantino says he  wanted to explore slavery  in his film .   jesse williams says tarantino 's version of slavery is wildly unreal .   he says few films have dealt with slavery , making it important to handle subject with respect .   williams : '  django  subordinates black characters , fails to illuminate slavery .
