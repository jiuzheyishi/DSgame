{"text": "your iphone guzzles more energy than your refrigerator . iphones burn through significantly more energy than a new mid-sized refrigerator , according to a new study . the average new mid-sized refrigerator uses about 322 kilowatt hours a year while your iphone uses about 361 kilowatt hours annually . the majority of that energy is n't used to charge your battery , it 's used to power data centers responsible for the wireless connections and data streaming that bring your device to life . this revelation was made in ` the cloud begins with coal : big data , big networks , big infrastructure and big power , ' a paper published by the technology investment advisory digital power group . energy guzzler : a customer shows her new iphone 5 at the apple store in hong kong . the world 's communications systems use 1,500 terawatt hours -- 10 per cent of global energy and as much as germany and japan combined , according to the paper . the usage is equal to total global electricity usage in 1985 . just one terawatt hour is enough to power roughly 90,000 homes for an entire year . with more and more devices being ` smart ' or ` connected ' each day , hourly internet traffic is expected to exceed annual internet traffic in the year 2000 , the paper says . a lot of energy is needed to power the world 's communications backbone , and a lot more is going to be needed in the future as more and more server farms are fired up to stream netflix to whatever is in your pocket , backpack or purse . more efficient than an iphone : this refrigerator uses less energy than an iphone . by 2035 , only slightly less energy will be needed to power ` the cloud ' than for lights , the paper estimates . it takes more energy to stream a few episodes of breaking bad to your iphone than it does to stamp them onto a dvd and ship them to you , according to the paper . one of the world 's largest consumers of cloud data , not surprisingly , is apple , and it takes a lot of juice to handle all those iphones and ipads . unfortunately , the bulk of this energy comes from coal , over 55 percent in apple 's case , according to greenpeace . the suv of phones : iphones use more energy than refrigerators . ` coal 's dominance arises from the importance of keeping costs down while providing ever-greater quantities of energy to the growing economies , and as the iea recently noted , the absence of cost-effective alternatives at the scales the world needs , ' says the paper . as long as coal continues to be the world 's cheapest source of energy , it likely will also be the most used , further contributing to global warming . since global data usage is n't going to drop , apple might have the answer . apple is working towards using 100 per cent renewable energy , and is already 75 per cent of the way there , according to its website . using solar , wind , hydroelectric and geothermal power sources , apple has its sights on becoming as close to carbon neutral as possible -- other companies should take note .", "summary": " the majority of the energy is used for cloud services , not charging the iphone .   the majority of the energy used to power the cloud comes from coal .   in the next two decades , servers will require almost as much energy as lights .
