{"text": "benghazi , libya doctors at a field hospital in martyrs square in zawiya said friday that 17 people were killed and another 150 were wounded when government forces attacked the city . they predicted the death toll would rise by morning . six pro-regime soldiers who were captured said they had been told that the city was being run by arab militants and it was their job to liberate it , according to the doctors , who asked not to be identified . the soldiers added that they had been misled so that they would fight against their countrymen , the doctors said . by the end of the day , the situation was calm in the seaside city , they said . the casualties were announced shortly after libyan leader moammar gadhafi accused followers of al qaeda leader osama bin laden of brainwashing the youth of zawiya with hallucinogenic drugs , resulting in the unrest .  they put it with milk or with other drinks , spiked drinks ,  he said . after taking the tablets ,  they attack this police station or that one so they can steal from there the criminal records .  he pleaded with the protesters ' mothers to track them down in the streets of the coastal town about 55 kilometers -lrb- about 35 miles -rrb- west of tripoli and take them home . he added that he had ordered an end to the violence there , but his order upset his security forces .  they told me they are being shot at and they were doing it in self-defense ,  gadhafi said .  why do you give us orders to stop ?  addressing the people of zawiya , he sent condolences to the families of the dead and wounded .  these are our children ,  he said .  we are quite upset about the senseless loss of lives .  zawiya 's residents are free to do as they like , though there will be consequences , he said .  if you want to pit against one another , then it 's up to you ,  he said .  but the borders of the city will be sealed in order to stop it from spreading elsewhere .  he added ,  how can such lunatic youth cause such anarchy ?  gadhafi said libya has peaceful ways for its citizens to address their grievances .  we are not like egypt or tunisia ,  he said , referring to two countries that have ousted their leaders in recent weeks .  here , the authority is in the hands of the people . you can change your authority , just make committees . and if you think they are corrupt , take them to court . prosecute them .  in an apparent allusion to calls for government officials to be held accountable for violence against libyan civilians , gadhafi said it is bin laden who should be prosecuted .  he 's responsible for any acts of murder or sabotage ,  gadhafi said . he accused foreigners of fomenting the discontent .  these acts can not happen by libyan men ,  he said .  no libyan of any background would go into this , join these acts of sabotage .  some of the people involved in the opposition , he said , were detained by the united states in guantanamo . finally , he expressed confidence that all will end up will for his regime .  i believe zawiya will toe the line ,  he said , then directed his final comment to the city 's residents themselves .  please live up to my expectations , people of zawiya .  a resident of tripoli who said she was too afraid to give her name for fear of retribution , called kadhafi 's speech  crazy .   we 're all in our houses like we 're sitting in jail ,  she said .  we ca n't go outside or we get shot . we hear the bullets .  she called for other nations to impose a no-fly zone so that kadhafi would not be able to fly in mercenaries . violence occurred elsewhere too thursday . a formerly pro-government newspaper in libya reported thursday that african mercenaries were shooting at unarmed civilians in tajura , about 25 miles east of tripoli . cnn could not confirm the report . ten days into protests that have resulted in his loss of control of eastern libya and led members of his government to defect , gadhafi faced new international pressure thursday . switzerland ordered that his assets , and those of his entourage , be frozen , the swiss foreign ministry said . gadhafi 's characteristically rambling remarks followed reports that anti-government forces had gained control of zawiya . at the hospital , a woman who said her son had been shot told cnn ,  blood is all over the streets .  the woman said unarmed people had been fired on indiscriminately .  we want to call all human beings : zawiya is finished ,  she said .  the people -lrb- are -rrb- finished . the people -lrb- are -rrb- dying .  she said it was unclear who was behind were shooting . many seemed to be african mercenaries , but they may have been from the government or military , she said .  people are crying ,  she said , calling for help from the world .  where -lrb- are -rrb- the people ? where is the peace ?  the hospital in zawiya is  a disaster ,  she said , adding that some shooters had entered the hospital and insisted that no one was killed . cnn could not confirm reports for many areas in libya . the libyan government maintains tight control of communications and has not responded to repeated requests for access to the country . cnn has interviewed numerous witnesses by phone . misrata -- sometimes spelled misurata -- is in the hands of the opposition , who have driven out the mercenaries , witnesses and media reports said . it is the country 's third-largest city and is east of tripoli . witnesses and reports also said the town of az zintan was under opposition control . the opposition already controls libya 's second-largest city , benghazi , where crowds cheered as international journalists drove through . the only shooting that could be heard was celebratory gunfire . men in their 20s were guarding the city with shotguns , clubs or hunting knives . but tripoli was a different story . gunfire erupted at dawn thursday as chanting crowds dispersed . government security forces were tightening their grip on the capital , according to sources . in one neighborhood , no one was allowed in or out .  there 's nobody walking in the street , nobody is trying to get out , even to look through the window ,  said a resident who , for security reasons , did not want to be identified .  it 's a little scary .  she said she was risking her life by talking to a reporter .  i 've been trying to keep my identity hidden ,  the woman said .  there are reported kidnappings happening in homes for anybody credible that is talking to the media and giving them the truth about what 's happening in libya .  continuing a stream of defections among libyan diplomats , the ambassador to jordan , mohammed hassan al barghathi , said thursday he was resigning because of the unrest . so , too , did a cousin of gadhafi , ahmed gadhaf al-dam , a top security official who was considered one of gadhafi 's closest aides . in a news release , his office said he left libya last week  in protest of the way the crisis was handled  and that he had resigned . underscoring the growing distance between the gadhafi regime and libyan diplomats , the flag hanging outside the libyan mission to the united nations in new york was the opposition flag ; the regime 's flag had been taken down . but an anchor on state television said that libyan diplomats and staff in saudi arabia had sent a cable of support  paying their respective loyalty to the leader of libya .  the u.n. security council will meet privately at 3 p.m. friday to discuss taking additional measures against libya . the u.n. human rights council also plans to meet friday to discuss a resolution that would suspend libya from the council . the resolution would condemn  the massive and unacceptable violence currently being perpetrated in this country ,  french foreign minister michele alliot-marie said thursday in a statement .  it holds the libyan authorities accountable . this violence could constitute crimes against humanity .  governments around the world scrambled to get their citizens out of the country . a ferry chartered by the united states to evacuate u.s. citizens remained in port in tripoli because of bad weather , diplomatic sources said . dena drotar said her mother , who was on the ship , told her that her fellow passengers were being fed , but were anxious and having difficulty sleeping ,  so they 're also getting a little bit giddy .  in washington , a senior u.s. military official said the pentagon was looking at  all options  it can offer president barack obama in dealing with the crisis .  our job is to give options from the military side , and that is what we are thinking about now ,  said the official , who declined to be identified because of the extremely sensitive nature of the situation .  we will provide the president with options should he need them .  obama called french president nicolas sarkozy to discuss the situation , and both presidents  reiterated their demand for an immediate halt to the use of force against the civilian population ,  the french embassy said . cnn 's richard roth , saad abedine , waffa munayyer , pam benson , ben brumfield , amir ahmed , ingrid formanek , eve bower , salma abdelaziz , mitra mobasherat and jaime florcruz contributed to this report .", "summary": " new : reports of 17 dead , 150 wounded in coastal city of zawiya , near tunisia .   switzerland freezes libyan leader moammar gadhafi 's assets .   gadhafi accuses followers of osama bin laden of brainwashing youth of zawiya .   portions of eastern libya are under the control of the opposition .
