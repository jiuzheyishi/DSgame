{"text": "recent headlines about contaminated foods , from peanut butter and salad to turkey and eggs , are enough to make even the most intrepid eater a little bit paranoid . but before you commit to a life of vitamins and astronaut ice cream , take comfort in the fact that you 'll likely be ok eating as you always have :  we have a very safe food system ,  says shelley feist , executive director of the partnership for food safety education . there are only three foods so risky that you should avoid them altogether . here 's the red-light list : . raw milk . fans of raw milk -lrb- meaning milk that has n't been pasteurized or homogenized -rrb- credit it with having more beneficial bacteria and enzymes than its processed counterpart , but science has n't proven any of these claims . and raw milk can become contaminated in a number of ways : by coming into contact with cow feces or bacteria living on the skin of cows , from an infection of the cow 's udder , or from dirty equipment , among others . the special heating process we know as pasteurization is the only effective way of killing most , if not all , harmful bacteria -- which can include listeria , salmonella , and e. coli . health.com : 10 types of food that can make you sick . according to the centers for disease control -lrb- cdc -rrb- , there were 86 reported food poisoning outbreaks from raw milk between 1998 and 2008 , resulting in 1,676 illnesses , 191 hospitalizations , and two deaths . raw milk is responsible for nearly three times more hospitalizations than any other foodborne disease outbreak , says hannah gould , ph.d. , senior epidemiologist with the cdc 's enteric diseases epidemiology branch . it 's no wonder selling raw milk to consumers is illegal in about half of u.s. states .  we have two people , in california and pennsylvania , who developed guillain-barrÃ © syndrome -lsb- which can cause paralysis and respiratory failure -rsb- after contracting a bacterial infection called campylobacteriosis from drinking raw milk ,  says john sheehan , head of dairy safety at the u.s. food and drug administration -lrb- fda -rrb- .  these were healthy , active people who came down with debilitating , lifelong diseases .  health.com : how to practice food safety in your home kitchen . raw sprouts . when sprouts were identified as the culprit in the food poisoning outbreak that killed at least 50 people in europe this past summer , you probably wondered : what could be so bad about innocent , vegan-friendly sprouts ? but food-safety experts were n't surprised . according to the cdc , there have been at least 30 reported outbreaks of foodborne illness in the u.s. from raw or lightly cooked sprouts since 1996 . all types of sprouts -- from the alfalfas you get on a sandwich to the mung bean sprouts garnishing your thai food -- can be dangerous when not thoroughly cooked . this is largely because of how they 're grown , explains michelle smith , ph.d. , senior policy analyst at the fda : the warm , moist environment necessary for growing sprouts provides the perfect conditions for bacteria -lrb- such as salmonella or e. coli -rrb- to multiply . health.com : how can you tell if food poisoning is harmless , or life-threatening ? ask for restaurant and take-out meals to be sprout-free , since you ca n't know how well they 've been cooked . and if you just ca n't live without sprouts , try getting used to giving them a hot bath before you eat them : research has shown that you can kill salmonella by immersing contaminated sprouts in boiling water for five seconds . raw oysters from the gulf of mexico . everyone knows that eating raw shellfish can be dicey -lrb- and in fact the cdc advises against it entirely -rrb- , but bivalves from the gulf of mexico take it to a whole new level . waters in the gulf are warmer than those in the pacific northwest and other popular oystering spots , making it possible for a bacterium called vibrio vulnificus to thrive .  oysters are filter feeders , which means they concentrate any contaminants in the water ,  explains william e. keene , ph.d. , a senior epidemiologist at the oregon public health division .  a number of toxins can get into an oyster , but none are remotely as bad as vibrio vulnificus .  health.com : 10 states where rare and exotic diseases lurk . healthy people who ingest a v. vulnificus -- ridden oyster might have vomiting , diarrhea , and abdominal pain , but for anyone with a compromised immune system , the bug can infiltrate the bloodstream , causing a severe and life-threatening illness called septicemia , which is fatal in one-third of cases . and while having a pre-existing medical condition puts you at particular risk ,  anyone at all can get horrifically sick ,  keene says . the good news is that several big seafood purchasers , like legal sea foods and costco , require that gulf oysters be pasteurized before being served , as does the state of california -- so in these places the risk is far lower . pasteurized or not ,  the simplest tactic here is to avoid raw gulf oysters altogether ,  says sarah klein , staff attorney at the center for science in the public interest . that can go a long way toward keeping you safer . copyright health magazine 2011 .", "summary": " pasteurization is the only effective way of killing harmful bacteria in milk .   there have been 30 reported outbreaks of foodborne illness from sprouts .   eating raw shellfish from the gulf of mexico is particularly dicey .
