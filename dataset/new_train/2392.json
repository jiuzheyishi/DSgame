{"text": "arsenal may top the english premier league table going into 2014 , but jose mourinho leads the way when it comes to post-match performances . after a hard-fought 2-1 win that kept his chelsea team in touch with arsenal and manchester city ahead of the epl 's new year 's day program , mourinho sought to deflect any possible criticism of his players with a blustering counter-attack . when questioned about key incidents in sunday 's match , which continued the tense clashes between the two teams in recent years , the portuguese manager accused luis suarez of  an acrobatic swimming pool jump  and going down  like somebody shot him .  this was after chelsea 's match-winner samuel eto'o had clearly body-checked the 19-goal striker off the ball inside his own penalty area while cesar azpilicueta cleared the ball .  suarez lost a duel with azpilicueta ... and now he 's doing an acrobatic swimming pool jump to try to get the penalty , because he 's so clever because he 's in the area where the liverpool supporters are behind ,  mourinho insisted at his press conference .  but -lrb- referee howard -rrb- webb is 10 meters away . and i think the only mistake webb did was not to give him a yellow card .  suarez has a reputation of going to ground too easily , but this season the uruguayan has been a reformed man -- being named interim captain by liverpool manager brendan rodgers -- following last season 's eight-match ban for biting chelsea 's branislav ivanovic .  the player is amazing ,  acknowledged mourinho , who has yet to suffer a home league defeat in his two spells at stamford bridge .  he does everything to win and brendan is doing a fantastic job on him because he 's changed . there 's no doubt that he 's changed .  but when the situation is like this and you are losing comes the nature of the player , the wild nature of the player or the cultural nature of the player .  culturally people from that area -lrb- south america -rrb- , they like it . it 's not also that area . there 's a corner in europe where i belong to , that they also like diving .  rodgers , meanwhile , was aggrieved that eto'o was still on the pitch following a high tackle on jordan henderson that provided the free-kick for martin skrtel 's early opening goal -- the defender pounced from close range after ivanovic tussled with suarez . eden hazard leveled with a superb curling effort , and eto'o poked in a 34th-minute winner from oscar 's low cross .  he should 've been sent off ,  rodgers said of the cameroon striker .  i know we scored from it , but that was a wild challenge , where he 's raked down his knee and down his shin and did n't even get a yellow card .  luis will always provoke a challenge from defenders , that 's why he 's world-class . what he probably does n't expect is to provoke a challenge from someone who 's not involved in the contact .  he 's running to challenge azpilicueta and eto'o is streetwise , he 's cute , he blocks him . on another day you could give that as a penalty , because it 's obstruction in the area .  rodgers was measured in his comments after being charged by the english football association for criticizing match officials following liverpool 's 2-1 defeat by manchester city on thursday . his team topped the table last weekend , but a second straight reverse left the reds in fifth place -- six points behind arsenal , and four adrift of third-placed chelsea . the team leading going into the new year has won the title for seven of the past nine years , though arsenal was one of the exceptions in 2007-08 , dropping back to third . the london side was missing record signing mesut ozil and top scorer aaron ramsey for sunday 's trip to in-form newcastle , but battled to a vital 1-0 victory thanks to olivier giroud 's eighth league goal this season . the france striker glanced in theo walcott 's 65th-minute free-kick to inflict newcastle 's first league defeat since october .  there is something in the team that is special on the mental front ,  said arsenal manager arsene wenger .  we have many times been questioned , but we have shown that at west ham , where we were 1-0 down , we have shown that again today , where we were a bit backs-to-the-wall in the last 15 minutes .  last year in this period , we were out of the championship race , but in 2013 , we have been quite consistent .  arsenal 's win allowed london rival tottenham to move up to seventh place above newcastle with a 3-0 win at home to 12th-placed stoke , as spain striker roberto soldado netted a penalty before belgium midfielder mousa dembele and england winger aaron lennon added the others . everton climbed above merseyside rival liverpool into fourth with a 2-1 win at home to ninth-placed southampton , as on-loan chelsea striker romelu lukaku struck the 74th-minute winner -- the belgium international 's ninth in the league this season .", "summary": " third-placed chelsea two points behind arsenal after beating liverpool 2-1 .   samuel eto'o scores winning goal , having helped liverpool 's opener with foul .   arsenal top of the table following sunday 's 1-0 victory at newcastle .   everton in fourth above liverpool after winning 2-1 against southampton .
