{"text": "in a rare outreach to iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , president barack obama has written a letter about the fight against islamic state militants - a development that sparked uproar in some congressional circles . the us and iran are each engaged in military efforts to degrade the islamic state group , essentially putting the longtime foes on the same side in the campaign against the extremists . however , the obama administration has repeatedly insisted that it is not coordinating and will not coordinate its military actions with iran , though officials from both countries have discussed the matter more broadly . secret communique : president barack obama -lrb- left -rrb- has written a letter to iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei -lrb- right -rrb- about the fight against islamic state militants . in reaction to the secret missive from the commander-in-chief , a senior congressional source told fox news that it could damage america 's fledgling relationship with sunni-led states in the region . ` this f *** s up everything , ' the source put in bluntly , adding that the president should have informed congress about his diplomatic efforts . obama 's letter to iran 's powerful religious leader comes against the backdrop of the looming november 24 deadline in nuclear negotiations between the us and iran , as well as five other world powers . while obama has previously sent three letters to khamenei , any communication between the two men has been extremely rare . the wall street journal , which first reported that obama had sent the letter , said it described a shared interest between the us and iran in fighting islamic state militants and stressed that any cooperation on that would be largely contingent on iran agreeing to the nuclear deal . however , while not confirming nor denying the existence of the letter , administration officials said there were still no plans to cooperate or coordinate with iran against the militants . ` the united states will not cooperate militarily with iran in that effort , ' white house spokesman josh earnest said . ` we wo n't share intelligence with them . ' diplomatic sources separately confirmed the existence of the letter to the associated press . they did so on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss obama 's outreach . obama authorized a us-led air campaign against islamic state fighters in iraq in august and expanded the mission the following month to neighboring syria . the us is taking action alongside several other nations , including a handful of regional partners . iran is not part of the us coalition , but it has also been fighting the islamic state group on the ground . obama 's letter reportedly described a shared interest between the us and iran in fighting islamic state militants . pictured above is an isis fighter in the countryside of the syrian kurdish town of kobani in october . pen pal : obama has previously sent three letters to khamenei , pictured here in september lying in bed at a hospital in teheran recovering from prostate surgery . however , iran 's interests in pursuing the islamic state 's defeat differ from those of the obama administration . iran is a staunch supporter of syrian president bashar assad , who is a target of the militants and opposed by the us . two chief critics of obama 's foreign policy , gop sens. john mccain of arizona and lindsey graham of south carolina , called it ` outrageous ' that obama would seek to enlist iran in its fight against is given iran 's support for assad and shia extremists throughout the region . ` the consequences of this ill-conceived bargain would destroy the syrians ' last , best chance to live in freedom from the brutal assad regime , ' the two senators said in a joint statement . house speaker john boehner , asked in a separate briefing about the reported letter , said he did not trust iran 's leaders and did not think they should be brought into the fight against islamic state . us officials have not ruled out the possibility that a nuclear accord with iran could open the door to discussions on other issues , but they have sought to keep the delicate negotiations focused solely on tehran 's disputed nuclear program . the us and its negotiating partners say iran is pursuing a bomb , while iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes . the prospects for a final agreement remain uncertain , with obama saying on wednesday that the ability to secure a deal is an ` open question . ' stern critics : gop sens. john mccain of arizona -lrb- left -rrb- and lindsey graham of south carolina -lrb- right -rrb- called it ` outrageous ' that obama would seek to enlist iran in its fight against is . the technical details of the talks have been closely guarded by the negotiating partners -- the us , britain , china , france , germany , russia and iran . the broad parameters of a potential agreement include iran cutting back on its number of centrifuges enriching uranium and redesigning a planned heavy water reactor so it does n't produce plutonium . both materials can be used in nuclear warheads . in exchange , the us in particular would have to roll back some of the financial , trade and oil sanctions that significantly cut off iran from global markets . the us and iran broke off diplomatic relations in 1979 after the islamic revolution and the storming of the us embassy in tehran , where 52 americans were held hostage for more than a year . however , the relationship began to thaw after obama took office , particularly following the election last year of a more moderate-sounding iranian president , hassan rouhani . us and iranian officials held a series of secret meetings last year that ultimately paved the way for the resumption of international nuclear negotiations . obama and rouhani also held a historic phone call last fall , the first direct communication between their nation 's leaders since the islamic revolution . however , the two men have not spoken since and skipped the opportunity to meet face-to-face while attending un general assembly meetings in new york in september . despite rouhani 's standing as president , us officials believe khamenei , the powerful supreme leader , has the ultimate say in whether iran reaches a nuclear deal with world powers .", "summary": " the president reportedly wrote the letter to ayatollah ali khamenei in october .   news of the letter comes just weeks ahead of november 24 deadline in nuclear negotiations between the us and iran .   the white house has not confirmed the existence of the letter , but press secretary josh earnest said us wo n't cooperate militarily with iran .
