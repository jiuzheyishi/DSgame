{"text": "lotus owner gerard lopez has urged renault to name names in future the next time they attempt to drop teams in trouble . renault sport f1 president and managing director jean-michel jalinier revealed last week at least one team had not paid their bill with regard to their supply of this season 's power units . jalinier admitted the late payments were ' a serious concern ' and that the critical point was ` just weeks away ' . let 's be clear ! lotus owner gerard lopez insists they 've paid renault for this season 's power supply . with four teams as renault customers - red bull , toro rosso , lotus and caterham - the belief at the time was that jalinier could not be referring to the former two marques , given their resources in being backed by energy drinks billionaire dietrich mateschitz . the obvious deduction was jalinier was pointing an accusing finger at lotus and caterham , both of whom are reputed to be struggling financially . caterham team principal cyril abiteboul insisted his marque had paid up , leaving only lotus as the sole team under suspicion . following sunday 's spanish grand prix , lopez was seen engaged in talks with renault bosses in his team 's motorhome at the circuit de catalunya in barcelona . seemingly to clear the air , lopez said : ` this is why we had a meeting , because i wanted them to clarify their price . ' i said to them if they are going to say things , then name the team that is an issue . ` do n't just say ` teams ' and then expect people to make their own judgements . we respect the arrangements we have with them . ` if there is -lrb- somebody who has not paid -rrb- , it must be somebody else , but i 'm not even sure there is , to be honest with you , so we 'll see . ' tricky time : romain grosjean has picked up just four points during this season 's formula 1 championship . asked directly whether lotus had paid up , lopez replied : ` we 've paid up . we 're absolutely in line with them . ' the situation , however , did not detract from lotus ' best result of a previously troubled season as the enstone-based marque scored points for the first time this campaign . from a season-high fifth on the grid , romain grosjean finished eighth , dropping three places according to lopez due to an electronic issue with the power unit for a couple of laps . lopez had previously insisted spain would effectively be the start of his team 's season , and so it proved , and now he has high hopes . ` we 've been saying from the beginning of the season we have a really good car , but it 's been tough because of the foundations we had , ' he said . ` in theory , we have a car that is behind mercedes - well , everyone is behind mercedes ! - but closer to red bull , and then able to fight and beat pretty much any other car . ` this is one more step of confirmation , but only that , so we need to keep on pushing and working . ` but i think we will now have a normal season , which for us is being able to fight for being the third , fourth team -lrb- in the constructors ' championship -rrb- .
