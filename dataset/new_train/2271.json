{"text": "washington in what one advocate called  a christmas miracle for airline passengers ,  the department of transportation on monday announced a rule prohibiting u.s. aircraft on domestic routes from remaining on a tarmac for more than three hours with travelers aboard .  airline passengers have rights , and these new rules will require airlines to live up to their obligation to treat their customers fairly ,  transportation secretary ray lahood said in a statement . exceptions to the three-hour rule would be allowed only for safety and security reasons or if air traffic controllers advise a pilot that returning to the terminal would disrupt airport operations , the department said . u.s. airlines operating international flights departing from or arriving in the united states  must specify , in advance , their own time limits for deplaning passengers , with the same exceptions applicable ,  the statement said . airlines also are required to provide adequate food and water for passengers within two hours of their plane being delayed on the tarmac , the department said , maintain operable restrooms and provide medical attention if necessary . the rule is a victory for passengers ' rights organizations , which have long pushed for such a measure . it will take effect 120 days from the date of its publication in the federal register , which will be sometime next week , the dot said .  this is a christmas miracle for airline passengers ,  said kate hanni , who founded flyersrights.org after she and her family were stranded on an austin , texas , tarmac for more than nine hours in 2006 .  everyone needs to say thank you to the obama administration and the department of transportation .  flyersrights.org describes itself as the largest nonprofit airline consumer organization . hanni said her group has achieved its goal , saying ,  i was always optimistic , but i really did n't know if we would get it .  the dot statement said ,  the rule was adopted in response to a series of incidents in which passengers were stranded on the ground aboard aircraft for lengthy periods and also in response to the high incidence of flight delays and other problems .  in one of the most high-profile recent incidents , 47 passengers spent nearly six hours overnight on a rochester , minnesota , tarmac in august , with only pretzels to eat .  we were not offered food . we were not offered water ,  passengers link christin testified in september at an unofficial capitol hill hearing sponsored by advocates for a passenger bill of rights .  the toilet broke at 3 o'clock in the morning , and it was impossible to sleep ,  he testified . read more stranded on the tarmac stories . the dot blamed a poor decision by regional carrier mesaba airlines for the stranding of the continental airlines passengers . lahood said in august that a mesaba representative improperly refused requests by the captain and crew to let passengers off the plane . mesaba , based in eagan , minnesota , and owned by delta air lines , was the only carrier able to assist continental flight 2816 on its way from houston , texas , to minneapolis , minnesota , after it was diverted because of strong thunderstorms , lahood said . but according to the dot , mesaba 's representative refused to help passengers off the plane , saying incorrectly that the airport was closed to passengers for security reasons . mesaba , continental and expressjet airlines were fined $ 175,000 for their roles in the incident , the department said monday . expressjet was operating the continental flight . among those testifying at the september hearing was robert crandall , former chairman and chief executive of american airlines , who spoke in support of the three-hour limit . after monday 's announcement , james may , president and ceo of the air transport association , issued a statement :  we will comply with the new rule even though we believe it will lead to unintended consequences -- more canceled flights and greater passenger inconvenience .  the association represents the principal u.s. airlines .  in particular , the requirement of having planes return to the gates within a three-hour window or face significant fines is inconsistent with our goal of completing as many flights as possible . lengthy tarmac delays benefit no one ,  may said . the rule brings the united states closer to european regulations aimed at protecting passengers , hanni said . according to the european transport commission 's web site , those include  information and minimum assistance ,  including  catering , communications and an overnight stay if necessary .   this is the best gift that airplane passengers could have had , and it 's been a decade coming ,  hanni said . the business travel coalition also applauded the rule . according to the dot , the new rule also : . • prohibits airlines from scheduling  chronically delayed  flights . those who do may face enforcement action from the department for  unfair and deceptive practices .  • requires airlines to designate an employee to monitor the effects of flight delays and cancellation , respond  in a timely and substantive fashion  to consumer complaints and give consumers information on where to file complaints . • requires airlines to display flight delay information on their web sites for each domestic flight operated . • requires airlines to adopt customer service plans and monitor compliance . • prohibits airlines from retroactively applying material changes that could negatively affect consumers who have already purchased tickets . the dot said it also plans to  begin another rulemaking -lsb- process -rsb- designed to further strengthen protections for air travelers .  areas under consideration include requiring airlines to submit contingency plans for lengthy tarmac delays to the dot for review and approval , to disclose baggage fees and to report additional tarmac delay data ; and strengthening requirements that airline ads disclose the full fare consumers pay for tickets , the department said . cnn 's mike ahlers and josh levs contributed to this report .", "summary": "
