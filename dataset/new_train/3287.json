{"text": "it was his deathbed interview , and a yellow-faced chopper read , australia 's most notorious underworld figure , had some bombshells to drop . a little over a fortnight before he died of liver cancer in october 2013 , read sat down for an interview with 60 minutes and revealed he had been responsible for four cold-blooded killings . he was remorseless . claimed he did n't feel anything when he killed people . no surge of adrenalin . no rush . and the man who once said ` you put a camera in front of me ... i 'll lie my head off ' insisted he was telling the truth . ` that 's what it 's all about , the last interview , the last picture show , ' he said . ` i 'm telling the truth now . ' scroll down for video . notorious : chopper read , who had his own ears cut off in an attempt to be shifted out of a maximum security prison , was australia 's most infamous underworld figure . ` deathbed confessional ' : dying of liver cancer , read appeared sick and yellow-faced in his final interview with 60 minutes last year . in the interview he confessed to four murders . he wanted to be like ned kelly : chopper 's body was riddled with tattoos at the end . resemblance : eric bana played chopper in the self-named film , released in the year 2000 . myth # 1 : he blowtorched people 's feet and snipped toes off with boltcutters . adam shand writes : ` he had never chopped anyone 's toes off with a set of boltcutters , nor had he ever applied a blowtorch to anyone 's feet . ` that had all been borrowed from the legend of linus patrick ` jimmy the pom ' driscoll . ' myth # 2 : he killed sidney collins , a missing queensland bikie boss . adam shand writes : ' -lrb- friends -rrb- mark dixon and jacko dismissed the confessions as a grab for a final payday . ` he had been nowhere near casino when sid collins had disappeared , they said . ' myth # 3 : he killed notorious paedophile reginald isaacs . adam shand writes : ` it is highly likely that read and hegyalji had nothing to do with isaacs ' death , yet in the years to come , read would ` confess ' hundreds of times that he and mad charlie had murdered isaacs . ` he would run a dozen different versions in books , shows and interviews , all of them factually impossible , of how they had slain the monster of d division ' . myth # 4 : he killed desmond costello , a union heavyweight . adam shand writes : ` there was no hard evidence linking read to those killings ... nothing more than his say-so , or he would have been arrested long ago . ' source : the real chopper : the man behind the legend , inside and out . his confessions came as little shock to the many australians who thought of ` uncle chop chop ' as a badass - a murderous , but strangely familiar , character . but , like many of chopper 's stories , there was little evidence . for three of the four murders , the only proof was his word . the interview was one last effort at cementing the myth of chopper . and it was a missed opportunity to tell the truth about it all , author and journalist adam shand argues in a new book , the real chopper : the man behind the legend . ` he did n't have the courage to tell people that finally , a lot of what he was saying for the last umpteen years was rubbish , ' mr shand told daily mail australia . chopper , who spent 23 years and nine months in prison , ` was n't nearly as bad as he said he was ' , mr shand said . ` he was a most unremarkable crook . ' his tall tales of murder , all based on his say-so , were likely too incredible to be real . mr shand wrote that chopper 's associates , mark dixon and mark ` jacko ' jackson , ` dismissed the confessions as a grab for a final payday ' . they said chopper was ` nowhere near ' casino , nsw , at the time he was said to have killed queensland bikie boss sidney collins in 2002 . mr shand also told daily mail australia that chopper he was only a teenager in 1971 , when he was supposed to have murdered union heavyweight desmond costello - an unlikely proposition . and as for his apparent murder of notorious paedophile reg isaacs in jail , in the mid-70s ? ` his story does n't match -lrb- the facts -rrb- at all , ' mr shand told daily mail australia . there 's only proof he was behind the deaths one of his alleged victims : drug dealer sammy ` the turk ' ozekam , who was gunned down outside bojangles nightclub in st kilda , melbourne , in 1987 . chopper was acquitted of his murder after pleading self-defence . likewise , mr shand wrote that chopper 's stories of chopping of toes , torture and blowtorching people 's feet were n't grounded in reality . the tagline of bana 's movie was ` never let the truth get in the way of a good yarn ' . an autographed picture of ` chopper ' read . shot dead : even chopper read was surprised when he was acquitted of murdering sammy the turk -lrb- pictured -rrb- on the grounds of self defence . victims ? in his final interview , chopper read claimed he murdered union heavy desmond costello -lrb- left -rrb- and sidney collins -lrb- right -rrb- , a queensland bikie boss . in his prime : chopper worked as an informer for victoria 's armed robbery squad in 1986 - 87 . if anything , chopper appears to have been a lousy crook . whether it was armed robbery , impersonating a police officer or killing sammy the turk , ` just about everything he ever did , he was caught for , ' mr shand said . and while he often said his motto was never plead guilty , chopper , who would spend 23 years and nine months behind bars , almost always did . ` he would open up like a watermelon falling off a truck , ' mr shand wrote . but he had a glorious imagination , which grew out of his love of cowboy tales and gangster yarns as a child . he had something of a lonely childhood - his mother , a devout seventh day adventist , was a ` religious zealot ' . he developed an ambition to become a household name similar to those other legends of australian criminal history , ned kelly and 1920s melbourne gangster squizzy taylor . and that 's what he became . he first felt the glow of infamy when , imprisoned in the notorious maximum security h division wing of pentridge prison in the 1970s , he convinced a fellow inmate to cut his ears off in order to get him shifted out . everyone slashed their wrists , mr shand wrote . chopper , however , needed to do something more dramatic . and while the extent of his biggest crimes are questionable , many of his bizarre antics were the stuff of truth . he audaciously tried to kidnap a county court judge in 1978 . and he once spooned two or three tablespoons of faeces into the prisoners ' stew at pentridge prison . as you can imagine , it made him a lot of enemies . read was a devoted dad to his two sons , charlie -lrb- pictured -rrb- and roy . father figure : read promised wife margaret he would never return to crime . the myth around chopper ballooned in the 1990s after the publication of some of chopper 's ` diaries ' . and then it appeared to spin out of control . australians have purchased more than 500,000 copies of his books , according to an abc report . plus there was eric bana 's feature film , which hit the big screen in 2000 . mr shand , who followed chopper 's case for years , trawled through his prison file and interrogated his friends and enemies , told daily mail australia that in reality , chopper was just a fraction of the myth he created . ' i would say there 's about ten per cent truth , ' he said . he said mark read - devoted father of his two boys , roy and charlie - became imprisoned by the myth of chopper . ` everyone wants to be famous ... he craved fame , he craved acceptance , ' mr shand said . ` mark brandon read , was not prepared to step outside the cartoon character and say ,  here i am !  ' -lrb- even in his books -rrb- he gives you big , juicy hints some of this was n't all quite right . but we all sort of chose to ignore thos ' ` he told people he never cut people 's toes off with a pair of boltcutters . really he was just giving people what they wanted . earlier this month , chopper read posthumously won the ` best supporting actor ' gong at the melbourne underground film festival for a role he played in the comedy start options exit ' . it was a strangely appropriate tribute , mr shand said . ' i think he 's been acting his whole life , ' he told daily mail australia , ` so it 's not surprising ' . the real chopper : the man behind the legend , inside and out by adam shand is available now for $ 32.99 through penguin books .", "summary": " new book busts myths about chopper read .   read got a fellow inmate to chop his ears off to get out of maximum security .   claimed he had murdered four people in his deathbed confessional .   there is only proof he killed one person , sammy the turk .   friends wrote off his confessions as a ` grab ' for money .   author adam shand says chopper 's final interview was ` sad '   ` did n't have the courage to tell people what he was saying was rubbish '   ' i would say there 's about ten per cent truth ' "}
