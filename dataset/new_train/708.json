{"text": "updated : . 02:28 est , 6 july 2011 . company , atten-shun ! labour mps leapt to attention in the commons yesterday afternoon when it came to a standing order 24 motion on the murdoch newspapers ' alleged nefarious doings . any sergeant major would have been proud to call that lot his platoon . one minute they were on their bottoms . the next they were ramrod straight on their pins . a rare parliamentary procedure , the so 24 . it calls for mps to indicate their approval for an urgent debate by standing , rather than the usual shouting or voting in a lobby . the charge : a private detective working for the news of the world is accused of hacking into milly dowler 's voicemail after she went missing . the opposition benches were almost full . the government side was largely empty . a few tory backbenchers stood , some of them hesitantly because , perhaps , they were unused to the procedure . zac goldsmith -lrb- con , richmond park -rrb- was one of those supporting the motion . rich zac is one of the few mps to be unafraid of mr murdoch . until yesterday , at least . but yesterday a lot more joined him . group bravery has kicked in . nick clegg , deputy prime minister , used the word ` grotesque ' to describe the hacking of the late milly dowler 's telephone . ` if this is true it is simply beneath contempt , ' said mr clegg . ` grotesque , heart-rending , ' he added . harriet harman managed to put aside her well-known admiration for the red-top press -lrb- you know how harriet does love a page 3 girl -rrb- and cried : ` we must clean up the british press . ' is she turning into jonathan aitken ? this from a woman who happily tolerated the murdochites back in the blair and brown governments when organs such as the sun and the times urged readers to vote labour . ben bradshaw -lrb- lab , exeter -rrb- indicated his approval . mr bradshaw was culture secretary in the last government . miss harman and others wanted a public inquiry . mr clegg argued that that could get in the way of any chance of prosecutions . the standing order 24 motion was moved by chris bryant -lrb- lab , rhondda -rrb- , who long ago had his political prospects bruised by press coverage -lrb- you may recall a marvellously fetching photograph of him in his tidy smalls -rrb- . mr bryant , who is one of the ablest parliamentarians in this commons , came up with a memorable phrase . he accused news of the world grunts of ` playing god with a family 's emotions ' in the milly dowler case . much to consider : rebekah brooks , the chief executive of news international - owned by rupert murdoch - has been urged to ` consider her position ' by labour leader ed miliband . this had an echo , perhaps , of the comment once made by a press council chairman that certain newspapers ` dabbled in people 's souls ' . the dowler allegations are much more potent than previous phone-hacking complaints , which seemed to have more to do with the injured pride of politicians and celebrities . while the matter remained only about john prescott , no one was likely to become too fussed . this time , however , there is genuine astonishment and affront . this time the reported offence is palpably nasty . mr bryant read his short speech off a page of tightly-typed script . it focused as much on police ` lies ' as it did on grub street 's misdemeanours . the government front bench and , oddly , the lib dem benches , remained seated when the standing vote on mr bryant 's motion was taken . they were abstaining . the debate will occur today , after prime minister 's questions . political bravery being in large part a question of fashion , it would be a surprise to hear anyone today stand up for the murdoch organisation , or indeed for the printed press . the prime minister piled in yesterday from afghanistan . mr clegg was saying his stuff at the despatch box . ed miliband was attacking murdoch from a filmed venue somewhere in london -- maybe an adenoid clinic , for all we know . suddenly they were all at it . down with murdoch . down with pesky journalists . though the anger about milly dowler is genuine , there is also a faint whiff of a political elite exacting revenge on a media which has repeatedly shown mps to be swindlers and hypocrites . what a toxic carry-on . at this rate we 'll have old rupe himself summoned to the commons chamber and told to prostrate himself like some disgraced japanese industrialist . speaker bercow would love that .", "summary": " battle between parliamentarians and the press is usually knockabout stuff . but this time there is genuine outrage among mps at the idea that a murdered girl 's phone was hacked .
