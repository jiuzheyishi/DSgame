' miss bussell also revealed she considered breast enlargement surgery after ending her ballet career . ` i told myself i would have a boob job when i stopped dancing , ' she said . ` but when it came to it , the idea of having anything false in my body was too strange . cosmetic surgery is not for me . i would rather enhance my looks with facials and creams .
