' keith vaz mp said the voluntary code was not working and said the government should introduce targets to reduce the amount of sugar in food and drinks . health experts have become increasingly concerned at the population 's intake of sugar - comparing it to tobacco in terms of its public health impact . simon capewell , professor of clinical epidemiology at the university of liverpool , said in january : ` sugar is the new tobacco . ` everywhere , sugary drinks and junk foods are now pressed on unsuspecting parents and children by a cynical industry focused on profit not health . ` obesity and diabetes already cost the uk over # 5billion a year . without regulation , these costs will exceed # 50billion by 2050 . ' obesity and diabetes costs the uk economy in the region of # 5 billion a year . as part of its commitment to the calorie pledge , coca cola has cut the amount of sugar and calories in glacéau vitaminwater and sprite by 30 per cent . but a 330ml can of coca cola still contains 35g - or nine teaspoons - of sugar . a spokesman for coca cola gb said : ` we have no plans to change coca cola . we know that people love it and we provide two great-tasting sugar-free , no calorie options in diet coke and coca-cola zero , which together comprise more than 40 per cent of the cola we sell in the uk . ' nestlé has reduced the number of calories in aero and white kitkat chunky bars by 5 per cent . however , it has not reduced the number of calories in milk chocolate kitkat bars and other popular products such as lions and rolos . unilever , which owns wall 's and ben & jerry 's , pledged to cut the number of calories in children 's ice creams , which now contain 110 or fewer calories per serving . it is also offering ` smaller and lower calorie alternative choices ' such as mini magnums . but ordinary magnum bars and ice cream tubs from ben & jerry 's have not been changed . a unilever spokesman said : ` sugar plays an important role in ice cream , not only for taste but also for texture and structure . however , we have a programme in place that aims to gradually reduce sugar in our products whilst maintaining our high standards of product quality . ' a department of health spokesman said : ` many manufacturers and retailers are already taking sugar , fat and salt out of their products as a result of our responsibility deal , which is based on working collaboratively with industry rather than imposing unrealistic targets . ` the scientific advisory committee on nutrition is currently undertaking a review of carbohydrates , and they are looking at sugar as part of this . their draft report which is due to be published later this year will inform our future thinking .
