{"text": "there 's a movement under way among dads in america that 's changing what you see on tv . across the country , more and more are fed up -- and rising up against the stereotype of the inept , clueless father .  we 're not the peter griffin or the homer simpson that we 're often portrayed as ,  said kevin metzger , who runs the dadvocate blog . it 's often the chief gripe among the dads i interview about modern fatherhood . david holland , father of three , rails against  doofus dads  in ads . in his blog blather . wince . repeat. , he calls them  madison avenue 's go-to guy .  during every commercial break , he says , he and his wife  try to see who can be the first one to spot the idiot husband or father .  in a sign of their growing power , dads out to end the stereotype recently scored a knockout blow against a pair of tv ads . a huggies ad earlier this year said the company put its diapers  to the toughest test imaginable : dads , alone with their babies , in one house , for five days .  what exactly made time with dad  the toughest test imaginable ?  the ad showed dads making some unpleasant faces and ended with a woman saying ,  good luck , babe .  another huggies ad featured a group of dads not changing their babies ' diapers while watching an entire game through  double overtime .  angry dads and moms responded with complaints , saying fathers are n't incompetent parents who leave their kids in dirty diapers . chris routly took it a step further , creating a petition on change.org .  this was n't just that they had created a bumbling dad character or that sort of thing or just excluding dad ,  like so many other tv portrayals , he said .  they were using language that was really saying dads are terrible at this stuff .  huggies took action . on facebook , the company praised dads and said its intention was to  break out of stereotypes .  and huggies officials called routly , giving him a list of steps they were taking to show fathers in a better light . soon , huggies issued new ads featuring dads caring for their toddlers . last month , the nyc dads group heaped praise on them for  raising the bar  in how a father was portrayed . huggies is n't the first to run into frustration from consumers rejecting what they view as an outdated , inaccurate trope . at&t angered some with an ad about a father who somehow could n't wrap his mind around the concept of wireless internet . the image of the hapless dad has long roots in american pop culture . a study of comics as far back as the 1940s found  incompetent  fathers and other mocking portrayals resurging at times across the decades . but tv did n't start skewering dads frequently until much later , says bob thompson , director of the bleier center for television and popular culture at syracuse university . while dads in  leave it to beaver  and  the donna reed show  had flaws , they were close to what was then thought of as  perfect ,  part of an idealized white american family . later , shows such as  the cosby show ,   family ties ,   growing pains  and  full house  showcased caring dads of a new generation , thompson says . but by the late 1980s , more shows wanted to distance themselves  from the corny , syrupy stuff  -- and in stepped shows such as  married with children  and  the simpsons .  it 's only natural that comedies would take on dads , thompson says .  comedy is about inversion -- taking people who are in authority and control and making them the butt of jokes .  so in a society  that has been so dominated by men ... comedy is naturally going to play against that .  dads on tv today are presented in so many different ways that it 's impossible to say things are getting better or worse , he says . from the stay-at-home dad in  up all night  to the lovable dads in  modern family ,  relatively positive portrayals abound . thompson says the growing push for  recognizable  dads who reflect today 's realities are probably to credit for these characters . meanwhile , dramas such as  game of thrones  and  mad men  show such bad fathers that  you 'd beg social services  to put their children in a foster home with al bundy , he jokes . plus , thanks to modern media , people now can always create their own videos about dads and , sometimes , watch them go viral . to some , the idea that anyone would be upset over this stereotype is ridiculous . huggies ' facebook page has hundreds of posts from women and men saying they found the original ads funny .  the problem these days is everyone has lost their sense of humor ,  christine lee wrote . and every group of people -- including moms -- gets caricatured and stereotyped on tv . do some dads just need to lighten up ? no , says chris routly . there 's a growing rejection of stereotypes in general -- and that should apply to dads as well , he argues . he 's also concerned that boys and men  see the bumbling dad ... and think that 's what 's expected of them ,  the stay-at-home father of two told me by phone while baking chips for his kids out of kale from his garden .  they 're not expected to be good , so they rise to the low bar that 's set for them .  and it can lead girls and women to have low expectations for how their husbands will handle fatherhood , he says . part of the problem , routly says , is that a lot of people believe negative stereotypes really apply to far more dads than they do . i ran into that myself last year . a column on cnn.com by a stay-at-home father complained that  most  dads  just wan na chill in front of sportscenter with a bowl of chips  after work and complain to their stay-at-home wives about how hard they work . on his blog , the writer railed against the  millions of dads who view their days at home as recovery from work .  i responded with a long list of studies showing how well dads are actually doing , including this from pew research :  almost all fathers who live with their children take an active role in their day-to-day lives through activities such as sharing meals , helping with homework and playing .  while by far most of the responses i received were positive , some were from angry people insisting the negative depictions must accurately describe the average dad . routly says he received hate mail after launching his petition .  there are people who are so invested in maintaining these kinds of roles and stereotypes that they felt like they needed to attack me .  but he also heard from men thanking him and sharing stories of custody battles and judges who assumed they were n't as good at parenting simply because they 're men . while there 's seriousness behind their complaints about the stereotype , these dads insist they can take a joke .  by and large , men are willing to laugh at themselves ,  says holland .  but there just becomes a point where you say , ` ok , the first 400 of these were funny . '  and thompson of the bleier center , himself a dad , says he enjoys laughing at these depictions , which exaggerate characteristics of some fathers , even today .  as long as there are clueless bumbling men there will be clueless bumbling dads ,  he says .  i 'm sure there were clueless bumbling cavemen . actually , his name was fred flintstone !  discuss this article with josh levs on facebook or twitter .", "summary": " fathers like chris routly are fed up with their portrayal as inept buffoons on tv .   routly created a petition against huggies commercials that showcased clueless dads .   huggies revamped its ad campaign after routly and others objected to it .
