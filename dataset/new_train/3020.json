{"text": "cambridge scientists say that taking as little as 20 minutes of exercise three times a week may be enough to reduce the risk of alzheimer 's . taking 20 minutes of exercise three times a week could drastically reduce the risk of alzheimer 's , research shows . cambridge scientists say that even getting off the bus one stop early and walking the rest of the way could help prevent the devastating illness . they have found that a third of all cases are due to lifestyle reasons including inactivity , obesity , smoking , high blood pressure and having a poor education . but of these , a lack of exercise was found to be the single most important cause . researchers believe regular physical activity ensures there is a steady flow of oxygen-rich blood to the brain . this is thought to prevent the build-up of plaques -- deposits of protein in the brain which cause alzheimer 's . a total of 850,000 britons have been diagnosed with dementia -- including alzheimer 's -- although this will more than double by 2050 as the population ages . there are no effective treatments and the illness is having a devastating effect on families and placing an increasing burden on the nhs . but the researchers say adults can drastically lower their risk even by just walking to work . professor carol brayne , from cambridge university 's institute of public health , said : ` the important message is that there are aspects of healthy life which reduce risk . ` this does n't say we can prevent dementia and alzheimer 's altogether . but there is a proportion which is preventable . even just having a vigorous walk a few times a week , and ideally make it social event . ` it 's really difficult for many people to take exercise . if nothing else is possible , even a walk will help . that 's what evidence suggests . ` so 20 minutes to half an hour , three times a week . i would say to just fit something into life in the best possible way . this might be getting off the bus stop the next stop up , and walk the last bit . ' nhs guidelines say adults should do at least two-and-a-half hours of exercise a week , including gardening or housework . but more than a third do n't manage this , including a fifth who are classed as ` inactive ' , doing less than 30 minutes a week . professor brayne said that if someone started exercising they would be more inclined to eat healthily and give up smoking , further reducing their risk of dementia . the research , published in the journal lancet neurology , looked at almost 30 studies linking dementia to various lifestyle causes . a lack of exercise contributed to 22 per cent of cases , twice as many as any other cause . a third of all cases of alzheimer 's are due to lifestyle factors such as obesity , smoking , high blood pressure , and poor education - but of these a lack of physical activity was found to be most significant . other researchers are trying to establish exactly how physical activity prevents dementia and if any particular type is more effective . they suspect that it keeps the heart and blood vessels strong , which maintains a steady flow of blood to the brain . this may prevent the build-up of plaques , protein deposits in the brain which are thought to trigger alzheimer 's . but professor brayne said that in the meantime , adults should try to fit exercise into their lives . he said : ` simply tackling physical inactivity , for example , will reduce levels of obesity , hypertension and diabetes , and prevent some people from developing dementia , as well as lead to a healthier old age in general -- it 's a win-win situation . ' dr doug brown , of the alzheimer 's society , said : ` this valuable study adds to a growing body of evidence strongly suggesting that simple lifestyle changes can help lower our risk of developing dementia . ` regular exercise is a good place to start , as well as avoiding smoking and eating a mediterranean diet . ' statistically , one in three adults over 65 will develop dementia . alzheimer 's is the most common form . more than a third of people do n't manage to get the recommended two and a half hours of exercise per week , with a fifth classed as ` inactive ' , getting less than 30 minutes .", "summary": " scientists say inactivity is most important lifestyle factor for alzheimer 's .   believed exercise keeps blood flowing to brain reducing build-up of plaque .   just 20 minutes of physical activity three times a week could cut risk .   simply getting off bus one stop early and walking home could help .
