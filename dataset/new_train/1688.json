' that 's because those who renounce are seen as willing to give up their citizenship primarily for financial reasons . there 's also an ` exit tax ' for the very rich who choose to leave . during the last 25 years , a number of millionaires and billionaires have renounced their citizenship . among them : ted arison , the late founder of carnival cruises , and michael dingman , a former ford motor co. director . mad money : a woman wearing a a statue of liberty costume encourages people to get their taxes done before today 's deadline . tuesday blues : javier merlo -lrb- centre -rrb- and his wife robin merlo do their taxes at an h&r block office in miami , florida . leaving : an action comic last year had superman renouncing his citizenship . but those of more modest means renounce , too . they say leaving america is about more than money ; it 's about privacy and red tape . two filing requirements affect americans abroad : the report of foreign bank and financial accounts - which has been around since 1970 but now carries penalties for noncompliance - and the foreign account tax compliance act , passed in 2010 with the aim of reducing offshore tax evasion . the first regulation requires all americans , including those living abroad , with at least $ 10,000 in overseas bank accounts , to file a supplementary form disclosing all of their foreign accounts . that includes any accounts in which the u.s. citizen has a financial interest . that could include a joint account with a spouse or child , accounts for corporations in which the american owns more than 50 per cent of the value of shares of stock , or any trust or estate that benefits the u.s. citizen . the tax compliance act - the newer law - asks foreign financial institutions such as banks , hedge funds , and private equity funds to provide the irs with information on u.s. clients . the united states and five european union countries recently announced their intent to allow institutions to report the information through their own governments , rather than directly to the irs . institutions that do not comply will be subject to a 30 per cent withholding tax on certain u.s.-sourced payments and proceeds of property sales beginning in the 2013 tax year - for instance , dividends on investments in u.s. companies . some expatriates say they were unaware of the first regulation for years and even decades . in 2008 , the irs received only 218,840 such filings . american nationality law grants citizenship to almost everyone born in the united states or born abroad to american parents , regardless of how much time they 've spent in the united states . many may not even know the extent of their u.s. ties . advocate : lucy stensland laederich co-runs fawco , a women 's expat organization serving overseas americans and the international community . in 2004 , the stakes for noncompliance rose . failure to file meant potential fines and criminal charges . americans abroad can be punished for noncompliance even if they owed no income tax - and irs data show that most of them do n't owe money . income up to $ 95,100 is n't taxed under a rule called the foreign earned income exclusion . in 2009 , the income cap was $ 91,400 , and 88 per cent of all taxpayers claiming the foreign earned income exclusion owed nothing . since 2008 , the irs has offered several voluntary-disclosure grace periods during which expatriates can file back taxes without facing criminal charges - but with the possibility of incurring penalties . marylouise serrato , head of american citizens abroad , a non-profit organization based in geneva , says that many members feel scared about reporting requirements they did not know existed . their disenchantment , she says , is pushing some to renounce . ` americans abroad are terrified . we 've . had people pay tens of thousands of dollars in fines .

' i hear about banking problems again and again and again , ' says phil hodgen , an attorney who has been helping americans expatriate since 2008 . the new reporting rules , he says , pose ' a huge administrative burden . it 's made americans too expensive to keep .
