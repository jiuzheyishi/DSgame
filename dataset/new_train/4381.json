{"text": "china has told the united states to butt out of a territorial dispute with japan in the east china sea after washington warned that a military claim by beijing to airspace in the region raises the risk of  misunderstanding and miscalculations .  the creation of an  air defense identification zone  by china comes amid increasing tensions between beijing and tokyo over competing claims to disputed islands in the sea , which are believed to be situated near large reserves of natural resources . china 's announcement saturday of the zone , which it described as an early-warning system for self-defense , drew a swift response from the united states , japan 's closest military ally . washington warned that the latest chinese move creates the risk of potentially dangerous miscalculations in the sensitive region , where chinese and japanese ships and planes have already been involved in tense encounters .  this unilateral action constitutes an attempt to change the status quo in the east china sea . escalatory action will only increase tensions in the region and create risks of an incident ,  u.s. secretary of state john kerry said .  we have urged china to exercise caution and restraint , and we are consulting with japan and other affected parties throughout the region ,  kerry said . the united states has thousands of troops stationed in japan as part of a security treaty between the two allies . ` inappropriate remarks ' but chinese officials dismissed the u.s. comments as unjustified interference . american criticism of the air zone announcement is  completely unreasonable ,  col. yang yujun , a ministry of national defense spokesman , said sunday . the united states should stop taking sides on the issue , cease making  inappropriate remarks  and not send any more  wrong signals  that could lead to a  risky move by japan ,  he said . beijing demands that the united states respect chinese national security , stop making  irresponsible remarks  about the air defense identification zone and make  concrete efforts  for peace and stability in the asia-pacific region , yang said . the chinese ministry of foreign affairs said it had lodged a representation with u.s. ambassador gary locke asking the united states  to correct its mistakes immediately .  dispute escalates . the dispute over the islands -- known as the senkaku islands by japan and the diaoyu islands by china -- has strained relations between the two east asian countries . the islands are close to strategically important shipping lanes and their surrounding waters are full of rich marine life . the chinese defense ministry said the new air zone was not directed toward a specific country . but it released a map and coordinates that show the zone covers most of the east china sea , as well as the islands . it declared that aircraft in the area must report their flight plans to china , maintain two-way radio and clearly mark their nationalities on the aircraft . and it warned that its armed forces  will adopt defensive emergency measures to respond to aircraft that do not cooperate in the identification or refuse to follow the instructions .  china 's declaration is  definitely a net escalation in the dispute  with japan , said stephanie kleine-ahlbrandt , director of asia-pacific programs at the u.s. institute of peace .  it makes it more likely that jets will be scrambled ,  she said .  an aerial encounter carries a much higher risk because of the faster timings involved  than in a maritime encounter . ` profoundly dangerous ' japanese prime minister shinzo abe said monday he is  extremely concerned  about the chinese announcement .  it unilaterally changes the status quo in the east china sea and escalates the situation ,  abe said .  it is a profoundly dangerous act that may cause unintended consequences in the area .  tokyo  can not accept at all  that the chinese air zone claim includes the disputed islands , which japan considers  an inherent part  of its territory , a japanese foreign ministry statement said . the japanese government said has made  strong protests  to beijing , summoning the chinese ambassador to the foreign ministry . chinese officials appeared unimpressed by the japanese complaints . tokyo 's remarks are  utterly groundless and china wo n't accept them ,  yang said , observing that japan had set up its own air defense identification zone in the 1960s . he reiterated beijing 's claim to the disputed islands and said its determination to ensure sovereignty over them was  unwavering .  defense ministry officials have made  solemn representations  on the matter to the japanese embassy in china , he said . the south korean government also expressed regret sunday over the chinese announcement , saying the new air defense zone partially overlaps with its territory , the south korean news agency yonhap reported . ` misunderstanding and miscalculations ' the chinese defense ministry has said it began patrols of the air zone on saturday . japan 's defense ministry said two chinese planes came within miles of its airspace , prompting authorities to scramble japanese fighter jets . it 's the second time this month that japan has launched fighter jets , alleging chinese planes appeared to be closing in on its air space . u.s. secretary of defense chuck hagel called the move by china an attempt to destabilize the status quo in the region , saying it  increases the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculations .   this announcement by the people 's republic of china will not in any way change how the united states conducts military operations in the region ,  hagel said . u.s. and japanese forces are due to hold joint naval exercises this week off okinawa -- a few hundred kilometers from the disputed islands . competing claims . the long-running disagreement over who owns the islands intensified between japan and china in the second half of 2012 . protests erupted in china after japan announced it had bought several of the disputed islands from private japanese owners . the deal was struck in part to prevent the islands from being bought by the controversial tokyo governor shintaro ishihara , who had called for donations for a public fund to buy them . china was outraged , as were groups of its citizens who protested violently in several chinese cities , calling for boycotts of japanese products and urging the government to give the islands back . in december 2012 , the dispute escalated further when japan scrambled fighter jets after a chinese plane was seen near the islands . that situation has recurred repeatedly since , and china 's latest announcement makes it likely it will keep happening . at sea , chinese ships have frequently entered contested waters despite warnings from the japanese coast guard . china says its claim extends back hundreds of years . japan says it saw no trace of chinese control of the islands in an 1885 survey , so formally recognized them as japanese sovereign territory in 1895 . japan then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers . the japanese surrender at the end of world war ii in 1945 only served to cloud the issue further . the islands were administered by the u.s. occupation force after the war . but in 1972 , washington returned them to japan as part of its withdrawal from okinawa . taiwan , which beijing regards as a breakaway province , also lays claim to the islands . explainer : why china 's new air zone incensed japan , u.s.", "summary": " the japanese prime minister says he is  extremely concerned  by china 's move .   china released a map and coordinates that identify its  air defense identification zone    the zone includes islands
