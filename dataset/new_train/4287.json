,  subtitled  the unexpected virtue of ignorance  -- which led to many multisyllabic mouthfuls during the oscar announcements -- stars michael keaton as a former superhero actor trying to revive his

the imitation game ,   the theory of everything ,   selma ,   the grand budapest hotel  and  whiplash .  complete list of oscar nominations . the rush of honors for  budapest ,  about the denizens of a european hotel in the years between the world wars , was somewhat unexpected , though the film had won best comedy/musical at the golden globes -lrb- defeating  birdman ,  among others -rrb- . the film was nominated for best picture and director -lrb- wes anderson -rrb- , along with original screenplay , cinematography , score and a host of other awards .  the imitation game  received eight nominations . the drama stars benedict cumberbatch as british mathematician alan turing , who helped break the germans ' enigma coding machine in world war ii and was a pioneer of computer science .

the golden globe for best drama , also performed well , earning six nods . director richard linklater picked up a nomination , as did supporting performers ethan hawke and patricia arquette . the movie follows the maturation of a child over 12 years and was filmed for a week or two each year so that audiences could see the actors age in real time . overlooked . a number of favorites were left off various lists . though civil rights drama  selma  did get a best picture nomination , actor david oyelowo was snubbed despite earning raves for his nuanced portrait of the rev. martin luther king jr. . director ava duvernay , who would have been the first african-american woman to receive a best director nomination , was also overlooked . jennifer aniston had received a golden globe best actress nomination for  cake ,  and had been widely expected to get her first oscar nomination . but she did n't make the list . critical and commercial hit  gone girl ,  adapted from the best-seller , did earn a best actress nomination for rosamund pike , but struck out in all other major categories . and then there were the lack of nominations for  the lego movie ,  one of the biggest hits of the year both with critics and audiences . widely seen as a favorite among animated films and a possibility for original screenplay , it earned just one nomination , for best song -lrb-  everything is awesome  -rrb- . the nominees for best animated feature are  big hero 6 ,   how to train your dragon 2 ,   the boxtrolls ,   the song of the sea  and  the tale of princess kaguya .  some surprises .

-lrb- steve carell -rrb- , supporting actor -lrb- mark ruffalo -rrb- and adapted screenplay . also exceeding expectations :  american sniper ,  director clint eastwood 's film based on the life of navy seal chris kyle . it earned nominations for best picture , actor -lrb- bradley cooper -rrb- and adapted screenplay . glen campbell picked up a nomination for best song ,  i 'm not gon na miss you ,  from the documentary  glen campbell : i 'll be me .  the musician is suffering from alzheimer 's , a battle depicted in the film . and though not really a surprise -- she 's been here many , many times before -- meryl streep earned her 19th acting nomination thursday morning . this one was for best supporting actress for her performance as the witch in  into the woods .  streep was the movie 's bright spot among the major categories , as  woods  missed out on a best picture nomination . the announcements of the nominees drew some inadvertent laughs when academy president cheryl boone isaacs mispronounced the name of cinematographer dick pope , nominated for his work on  mr. turner ,  as  dick poop .  the malaprop quickly became a twitter meme . the 87th academy awards will take place sunday , february 22 , at hollywood 's dolby theatre . neil patrick harris will host . the show airs on abc .", "summary": "  birdman ,   grand budapest hotel  lead all oscar nominees with 9
