{"text": "a bizarre green flurry of lights off the coast of bangkok left an astronaut baffled after he took a picture of it this week . astronaut reid wiseman posted the image yesterday tweeting : ` bangkok is a bright city . the green lights outside the city ? no idea . ' the baltimore native , who is on board the international space station , took the image from more than 200 miles -lrb- 320km -rrb- above the planet and the green glow was clearly visible . a green flurry of lights off the coast of bangkok left an astronaut baffled after he took a picture of it this week . theories ranged from aliens to nuclear waste and bioluminescent algae - but nasa claims there is a far more ` fishy ' explanation . it is thought the lights - the location of which would place them in the sea in the gulf of thailand - were in fact created by fishing boats . the offshore illumination comes from enormous arrays of bright green led lights used to attract squid and other sea life to the surface . according to an october 2013 article on nasa 's earth observatory site by michael carlowicz : ` fishermen from south america and southeastern asia light up the ocean with powerful lamps that attract the plankton and fish species that the squid feed on . astronaut reid wiseman took the image from 200 miles -lrb- 320km -rrb- above the planet and posted it on twitter . the offshore illumination comes from arrays of green led lights used to attract squid to the sea surface . short-finned squid live 260ft to 1,970 ft -lrb- 80m to 600m -rrb- below the surface feeding on shrimp , crabs , and fish . lights causes their food to be attracted to the surface of the ocean . this , in turn , attracts the squid to the surface where they are easier for fishermen to catch with jigging lines . scientists first noted such night-lighting of the seas in the late 1970s and early 1980s , while compiling the first maps of earth at night . ` the squid follow their prey toward the surface , where they are easier for fishermen to catch with jigging lines . ` squid boats can carry more than a hundred of these lamps , generating as much as 300 kilowatts of light per boat . ' scientists first noted such night-lighting of the seas in the late 1970s and early 1980s , while compiling the first maps of earth at night . ` these lights help reveal the full range , patterns , and night-to-night variability of these fishing activities in striking detail , ' said dr steve miller , a colorado state university scientist who works with viirs night time imagery . ` it 's just another example of how much information exists in night lights measurements and how unique they are for coupling human activity with the natural environment in a way that conventional visible imagery can not do . scientists first noted such night-lighting of the seas in the late 1970s and early 1980s , while compiling the first maps of the earth at night . in this image taken from space , over the course of nine nights , fishing boats shift positions while hugging the borders of the exclusive economic zones of argentina and the falkland islands .", "summary": " the image was taken this week by astronaut reid wiseman from the iss .   a flurry of green lights can be seen shining in the gulf of thailand .   theories ranged from aliens to nuclear waste and glowing algae .   but glow comes from lights used to attract squid to the sea surface .
