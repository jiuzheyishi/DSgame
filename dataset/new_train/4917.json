{"text": "a firm old english friend , an elderly one now , who lived through the blitz , told me this when i lived in london : there is a difference between government and state . the houses of parliament was government and did the work . the queen was state , and represented the government free of ideology , and therefore could be a living embodiment of neutrality and frosty maternal concern for all . i did n't see it while i lived there . i was a radical republican -lrb- anti-royalty -rrb- simply because i 'm an american . but in the years since we in the unites states have begun to cry  impeach  at the slightest grammatical slip of our leader , who happens to be head of both government and state , i have begun to see the practicality of a figurehead leader who has no political power , but is more eminent , always , than government . opinion : baby helps make a monarchy better . we have one too : she is called the statue of liberty . but she does n't give birth to a real human young . the statue of liberty is copper , and blind . the current old queen is blinkered , and human , and revered for her humanizing failings as well as her work ethic . there is so much about the royal family that does n't work , but one thing it does do well is prove is that generations of squabbling citizens can indeed survive their differences and continue , persevere as a nation . the royalty is a testament to longevity of the nation , if it is nothing else . and so now there is a new baby boy . by dint of holy ignorance , a newborn child can have nothing to do with the longevity of england . the child of catherine , duchess of cambridge , and her husband , prince william , makes immediate claim on our hope and our ability to splash out blessings simply because he is royal . but so too does any child : he or she declares the future for us . opinion : how to raise a royal bachildren , as my friend , the writer jill paton walsh , once wrote ,  stand in a different relationship to time  than we do . they have eternity where we have actuarial tables . this particular baby , with the lion and the unicorn hand-stitched into his nappies , this child too stands in for that nation 's hope for all children : that they will thrive , somehow , against all odds . by extension , because babies provide us older types a kind of vitamin nutrition we can get from no other source , we have to smile , too . we americans love our children as much as the british . we love to hope for their future , for all of them .", "summary": " gregory maguire : in uk , parliament is government , queen is ` state ' -- concern for subjects .   he says with fractious u.s. government , an eminent figurehead starts to look practical .   he says much wrong about monarchy , but it does show a nation 's continuity , cooperation .   maguire : will and kate 's new baby makes immediate claim on nation 's hope for its future .
