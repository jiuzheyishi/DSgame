{"text": "tokyo most japanese treat prime minister shinzo abe 's new economic program , dubbed  abenomics ,  with a heavy dose of skepticism . if there is a miracle cure for japan 's decades-long malaise , then it 'll have to be seen to be believed . and abe himself admits it will take time for salaries to rise and for the real economy to respond to treatment . but in tokyo 's central akihabara district , four young abenomics devotees dressed in giant glittery bow-ties and denim mini-skirts are handing out fliers . they chant :  we 're the street corner economists -- please come to our concert ' !  granted , it 's less the promise of massive public spending programs , the whirring of the monetary printing press or the slightly ambiguous growth strategies pulling in the punters here . it 's more about the girl band 's coquettish sales pitch .  when the economy is good the skirt lengths get shorter ,  says 20-year-old band member yuki sakora .  so when the nikkei goes below 9,000 we wear long skirts ; when it 's between 10 and 11,000 we go medium-length , and miniskirts when it 's 11 to 13,000 .  their signature tune  abenomics  has only been on sale a couple of weeks , but the audience seem to know it . an assortment of geeky 20-something males and the odd suited salaryman faithfully mirror the girls ' dance-routine , punching the air with glow-sticks when the refrain comes through . perhaps it 's because the nikkei 's wedged firmly above 13,000 , so they 're treated to the girls in bloomers . i ask yuki what abenomics means to her .  the weaker yen probably means prices will go up ,  she says without missing a beat .  but that helps exports . and i think companies will start to earn more and that will boost consumer spending .  that is the theory but it requires a shift in thinking .  our biggest problem is that the general public has been stuck with deflation -- in mind and heart -- for the past 20 years ,  japan 's finance minister taro aso told cnn 's jill dougherty recently .  people do n't buy things today because they think tomorrow it will be cheaper . unless this mindset changes and people start buying things , consumption , which is near 70 % of gdp , wo n't grow .  toru urayama set up an academy in 2007 to teach amateur traders how to make money on the markets . in the last few months of the nikkei 's meteoric rise he 's experienced a flood of applicants . but he tells them not to hold out hope that abenomics will do much in the long term .  it 's good for the stock market but not for the economy as a whole . it could lead to a bubble , though i do n't think it will be as bad as it was back in the 1980s ,  he said , referring to the spectacular crash that followed decades of soaring stock and real estate values in japan . megumi fukuzawa 's signed up because she made a bad investment in 2008 and is wondering what to do with her money now the market 's up . she 's hoping abenomics boosts her husband 's salary .  in the past i 've tried to save because his salary was low . but if things change then i might spend more , this stock market investment is part of that .  back on stage , the street corner economists finish their song in a blaze of multi-colored lights , before they settle in for a chat with the fans . everyone dutifully sits down . but when the girls ask whether anyone 's bought the single , there 's not much of a response . the appeal here is more show than substance . precisely what critics fear so-called abenomics will turn out to be too .", "summary": " prime minister shinzo abe 's new economic program is dubbed  abenomics    many are skeptical about whether this is the solution for japan 's malaise .   some fear the boost to the country 's stock markets could produce a bubble .   1980s collapse followed decades of growing stock , property prices .
