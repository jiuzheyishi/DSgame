{"text": "the safety of one of the most popular forms of ivf has been called into question after a study showed it doubled the risk of birth defects . researchers found that one in ten babies born through icsi suffered some form of abnormality . this compares with just over one in 20 of those conceived naturally . but what experts do n't know yet is whether the problems are caused by the treatment , or the fact couples having it are at higher risk of defects anyway . crucial moment : a single sperm is injected directly into an egg in icsi treatment . icsi -- or intracytoplasmic sperm injection -- is used to treat male infertility . it involves injecting a sperm directly into an egg with a fine glass needle . more than 23,000 procedures were performed last year and it represents just over half of all ivf treatments . it can help couples who were previously unable to conceive because the man 's sperm count was low or they were of too poor quality to swim up to the egg . in this latest study , published in the new england journal of medicine , researchers from the university of adelaide in australia looked at more than 300,000 births . they found that babies born via icsi were 57 per cent more likely to suffer some form of abnormality . questions and answers on ivf . these ranged from serious defects of the heart and digestive system to relatively minor abnormalities such as club feet that could be fixed with surgery . overall 9.9 per cent of babies born through icsi had a defect compared with 5.8 per cent of those born naturally . by contrast , standard ivf -- where semen containing thousands of sperm is placed in a dish with eggs -- was found to be no more risky than natural conception , once the couple 's age and other factors had been accounted for . experts are unsure whether it is the treatment causing the defects or the poor quality sperm of the men . lead author professor michael davies , from the university of adelaide , said : ` we know from the study that standard ivf is safe . but we also now know that with icsi , the risk is sky high . ' he pointed out that the technique involved implanting faulty sperm into an egg -- in nature these would be weeded out . dr allan pacey , fertility expert at the university of sheffield and chairman of the british fertility society , said : ` an important point to make is that we know that babies conceived naturally to couples previously diagnosed with infertility are also at slightly higher risk , which suggests that it may be something to do with the  infertility  rather than the  technology  used to conceive them . ` it should be stressed that the vast majority of babies born are healthy and the actual risks of any problems being detected are small . ' and professor peter illingworth , of the university of sydney , said : ` it may well be that the sort of families who have to use icsi have extreme sperm damage , and this may be the explanation as to why there is a higher rate of congenital abnormalities . ' only two years ago the inventor of icsi , andr√© van steirteghem , warned it was being overused . professor steirteghem -- who invented it in belgium in 1991 -- told a conference that it should only be used as a last resort as it may cause problems in children . since the news of this study broke a number of women have contacted the mail to say they have used the technique and had perfectly healthy babies . campaigners urged couples to speak to their doctors if they were concerned . clare lewis-jones , of leading patient charity , infertility network uk , said : ` ivf and icsi bring joy to tens of thousands of people every year -- last year there were around 60,000 cycles of ivf in the uk and without this many couples would never experience the joy of having a child of their own . ` if patients are concerned by this research , i would recommend they speak directly to their clinician who will be able to discuss their individual situation . ' case study . katy and david shiers used icsi to have their daughter grace after spending four years trying to conceive naturally . mrs shiers , 27 , had been diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome , which can lead to problems in becoming pregnant . her 26-year-old husband had arthritis and his treatment could have affected his own fertility . after one round of ivf failed , the couple , from waterlooville , hampshire , were offered icsi by the wessex fertility clinic in southampton . research plea : david and katy shiers with daughter grace as a bamrs shiers , who looks after grace full-time , said : ` when grace was in the neonatal intensive care ward , i would say about 80 per cent of the other babies there had been conceived using fertility treatment . ` at least two were definitely from icsi . there may well be something in that . ` i obviously do n't know whether grace 's problems are related to icsi . but i would have been happier if someone had spelled out the risks . i do n't remember that happening at the time . ` when you 're so desperate to have a family , as we were , someone could tell you it would be born with three heads and you would n't care . ` if someone said ,  there is a low risk your child could be disabled  , i 'd see that as a high chance the baby would be fine . ` having said that , i would 100 per cent back any move to issue parents doing this with more warnings about what the problems could be to avoid the shock we had . ` there needs to be so much more research .
