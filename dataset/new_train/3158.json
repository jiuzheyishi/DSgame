{"text": "thanks to mri scanners , doctors can see how our bodies work in unprecedented ways . but while they 're predominantly used to diagnose brain disorders , or discover what 's causing a persistent cough , for example , experts are also using them to learn more about more intimate movements . now a video has compiled the most insightful and interesting ways doctors have used these scanners to reveal what happens inside our mouths when we kiss , as well as the inner workings of of sex . scroll down for video . the kissing video , entitled ` the anatomy of kissing and love in magnetic resonance imaging -lrb- mri -rrb- scanner ' -lrb- grab pictured -rrb- was uploaded by youtube user randomhero - but the original source is not listed . the clip reveals the movement of the tongues as they enter the other person 's mouth , as well as their heart rates . the kissing video , entitled ` the anatomy of kissing and love in magnetic resonance imaging -lrb- mri -rrb- scanner ' was uploaded by youtube user randomhero - but the original source is not listed . the clip reveals what the video 's describes as the first time a french kiss has been captured in an mri scanner . it was recorded using a tesla field strength of three - a scale that determines how strong the magnets in the scanner are , ranging from 0.2 to seven . the clip reveals the movement of the tongues as they enter the other person 's mouth , as well as the heart rates of both members increasing throughout . in a separate clip , the vox video also reveals what sex looks like through an mri scanner , using a couple filmed in the missionary position . video courtesy of improbable research . this video was actually recorded during the 1960s by dutch doctor pek van andel in a hospital in groningen . both the kissing and the sex video were created using hundreds of still mri images stitched together to form a time-lapse . dr van andel , alongside gynaecology professor willibrord weijmar schultz , anthropologist ida sabelis and radiologist , eduard mooyaart , used the images as the basis of a scientific paper in 1999 called magnetic resonance imaging of male and female genitals during coitus and female sexual arousal . the purpose of the study was to discover whether imaging of the male and female genitals during coitus was feasible . they also wanted to find out whether ` former and current ideas about the anatomy during sexual intercourse and during female sexual arousal were based on assumptions or on facts ' . in particular , they wanted to address claims made by robert latou dickinson in 1933 that the penis formed an s shape when inside a female during sex . they also studied the claims that the volume of the uterus increases during sexual arousal , as proposed by william master and virginia johnson in 1964 . during a magnetic resonance imaging -lrb- mri -rrb- scan , -lrb- scanner pictured -rrb- subjects lie in a strong magnetic field with radio-frequency waves directed at their body . signals received by protons moving around the person 's body can be combined to create a detailed image of inner organs . during a magnetic resonance imaging -lrb- mri -rrb- scan , subjects lie in a strong magnetic field with radio-frequency waves directed at their body . the field strength of mri scanners is measured in tesla . typically , scanners operate at 1.5 , but systems range from 0.2 to seven . the body is made up of water molecules , which consist of hydrogen and oxygen atoms . at the centre of each hydrogen atom are protons that act like tiny magnets , and are sensitive to magnetic fields . when a person lies under the scanners magnets , the protons in their body line up in the same direction . short bursts of radio waves are sent to certain areas of the body , knocking the protons out of alignment . when the radio waves are turned off , the protons realign and , in doing so , send out radio signals , which are picked up by receivers . these signals provide information about the exact location of the protons in the body . they also help to distinguish between the various types of tissue in the body , because the protons in different types of tissue realign at different speeds and produce distinct signals . these signals are combined to create a detailed image of inner organs . source : nhs choices . as a result of their research , the team concluded : ` what started as artistic and scientific curiosity has now been realised . ` we have shown that magnetic resonance images of the female sexual response and the male and female genitals during coitus are feasible and beautiful ; that the penis during intercourse in the ` missionary position ' has the shape of a boomerang and not of an s as drawn by dickinson ; and that , in contrast to the findings of masters and johnson , there was no evidence of an increase in the volume of the uterus during sexual arousal . ' a year later , the team won an ig nobel prize . other everyday human functions revealed in the vox video include swallowing , talking in different languages , playing the trumpet , and defecating .", "summary": " the mri scanner footage was compiled by news site vox .   it details mri images of a couple kissing , as well as the inner workings of sex .   both the kissing and sex clips were created using scans stitched together .   kissing clips reveals the movement of the tongues as they enter the mouths .   while , the intercourse video reveals the shape and movement of a penis when a couple is lying in missionary position .   the mri sex footage won the ig nobel prize in 2000 .
