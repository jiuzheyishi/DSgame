{"text": "critique : damian green said ministers have failed to discuss immigration . a minister has criticised the ` failure of mainstream politics ' to discuss immigration as the government launched a three-pronged crackdown on illegal migrants . immigration minister damian green said for years it had been ` almost impolite ' for politicians to raise concerns about unprecedented numbers flowing into the uk , a silence which he said had allowed extremist parties , such as the bnp , to harvest votes . he spoke out as it emerged a university had become the first in the uk to be stripped of its right to educate foreign students . a uk border agency audit found numerous failings at london metropolitan university , including allowing students to take lessons without valid visas and failing to report that some who had been granted visas , then failed to enrol on or attend courses . meanwhile , home secretary theresa may launched a drive to stop abuse of the uk 's marriage laws which have allowed migrants to stay here illegally . ministers will change the rules so ceremonies can be delayed for investigations . last year a vicar was jailed for staging 300 fake weddings - including couples who did not speak the same language . mr green said the silence around the uk 's doors being thrown open was filled by extremist parties such as the bnp , who then harvested votes from those who were concerned . nearly 3.5 million immigrants arrived in the uk during labour 's 13 years in power between 1997 and 2010 , with the tide increasing when ten former soviet bloc countries joined the european union in 2004 . open borders : mr green said the immigration policies under labour were too slack and insisted the coalition get to grips with the situation . critics say public services , including schools , hospitals and transport , have struggled to cope with the influx , while some employers have been accused of using cheap , or illegal , foreign workers . in a radio interview with lbc radio , mr green said immigration had been like ` turning on a tap ' under labour . he added : ` on top of that , it was almost impolite to talk about immigration and the result of those two things happening at once was the rise of extremist politicians who scapegoated , really unpleasant parties like the bnp . ` you saw that they rose at a time when politicians were afraid to talk about immigration so it 's very important that mainstream , moderate politicians of all parties actual deal with it as a problem . ' home secretary theresa may wants to crack down on the abuse of uk marriage laws . he compared immigration under labour to ` an oil tanker steaming hard in the wrong direction ' but insisted the government was ` getting to grips ' with the issue . he spoke out as it emerged a controversial university had become the first in the country to be stripped of its right to educate foreign students . london metropolitan university 's licence will be revoked after the home office branded it a ` threat to immigration control ' . officials at the uk border agency identified so many failings at lmu , which has 2,600 students from outside the european union , that it could not be trusted to ensure foreign students did not become illegal immigrants . an audit found the university allowed students to take lessons without valid visas to stay in britain , did not report that some granted visas failed to enrol on or attend courses , and did not test students to check they could speak english . malcolm gillies , lmu 's vice-chancellor , said the university was ` disappointed ' by the news . he said in the past six weeks the university had ` done everything it could to demonstrate that it ... has worked to remedy past weaknesses ' . mr green said a national campaign to crackdown on foreigners who stayed in the uk after their student visas had expired had caught 2,000 . benefiting : the immigration minister said that the silence on the immigration issue has led to extremist parties such as nick griffin 's bnp gaining votes . he said : ` we find that a lot of those are . people who came here on a student visa , maybe did study for a year or . maybe did n't study at all , but they then hang around after their visa is . over and it 's clear that their main intention for coming here was to . work . that kind of abuse enrages people . ' mr green said : ` at the moment a registrar has the duty to marry someone if they ca n't see any legal impediment then they have to marry them . ` what we 're going to do is give the powers to say ,  actually i 'm not going to marry you , because this does n't look like a proper marriage to me  . ' in the third prong of the crackdown , migrants who falsely claim benefits after coming to britain to work , study or visit face being stripped of welfare payments , according to leaked documents . nearly 20,000 people who arrived from outside europe will be the first to be targeted in the new crackdown which will begin next month . they will receive a letter from the department for work and pensions -lrb- dwp -rrb- telling them to send back a photocopy of their passport or residence permit within 28 days , according to the sunday telegraph . if they can not , they must email the uk border agency -lrb- ukba -rrb- with a range of identifying information . in total , 370,000 people who came to britain as visitors , students or workers are now on work-related benefits . foreign-born claimants is understood to make up 6.5 per cent of the total 5.5 people on benefits in the uk .", "summary": " damian green said it has been ` impolite ' to discuss immigration .   he said ministers ' silence has allowed bnp to win votes .
