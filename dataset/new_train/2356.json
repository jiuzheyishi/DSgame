{"text": "it 's the biggest stage in the world of college football . the talented students from florida state and auburn who charge onto the field monday night in pasadena , california , will know that nothing in their lives may ever top this feeling . for the great majority of the seniors who wo n't go on to play professionally , this will be the last time in uniform . i 'm not referring to the football players . the florida state seminoles and the auburn tigers will be competing for the national championship , and their head coaches , jimbo fisher and gus malzahn , have been getting them ready for the game . but there are two other groups of students from those schools who also will step onto the bright green floor of the rose bowl on monday night . those squads are even larger in number than the football teams , and , although they draw considerably less national attention , they have been preparing just as diligently .  it starts with practices in the heat of the alabama summer ,  said corey spurlin , associate professor of music at auburn and director of the 380-member auburn university marching band .  just like the football players , our musicians are at the very peak of their abilities ,  said patrick dunnigan , professor of music at florida state university and director of bands , including the 400-member marching chiefs . with kickoff approaching , i got in touch with spurlin and dunnigan because the months of work put in by marching band members at schools across the country often gets overlooked . they are a major part of the pageantry of college football , but in recent decades the television networks have all but ignored them most of the time . if the performance of the marching bands at college games each saturday gets a few seconds on the tv broadcasts , they count themselves lucky .  generally , if we do get airtime , it 's very brief , minimal ,  said auburn 's spurlin .  we 'd love to be able to share what we do with more people .  florida state 's dunnigan said :  the kids in the band do n't know any different . i grew up in a world where the halftime shows were seen on tv , but that 's over .  the replacements on television have been studio shows with analysis , replays and highlights of other games ; the studio shows are lucrative revenue generators , attractive for commercial sponsors , and the switch away from the field at halftime is almost instant on most telecasts . still , the audiences inside the stadiums are massive . florida state 's home stadium seats more than 82,000 ; auburn 's seats more than 87,000 . the rose bowl , where monday 's national championship game will be played , seats more than 90,000 . few bands of any kind ever get to play in front of that many people . bruce springsteen and the rolling stones might even be a bit envious . the musicians , although they do their work on the same gridirons as the football players , are not recognized around campus the way the star quarterbacks or linebackers are .  with 380 musicians in the band , not many people can pick out their faces ,  spurlin said . and as far as the scholarships and perks that go with big-time college football programs : forget it . at florida state , dunnigan said , not only are there no marching band scholarships , but  the student musicians pay for the work they do -- the band is a one-credit class , so they 're paying tuition to be in it . we 're kind of proud that the members of the band are there by choice .  at auburn , spurlin said , the budget that is available for the marching band 's expenses goes only so far ; the university provides the band 's uniforms ,  but the members of the band have to pay for the cleaning ,  and they have to get their uniforms to the laundry after the games . the intangible rewards , however , are ample .  the individual challenge is to play the instruments as well as they can , to lock into the formations as well as they can ,  dunnigan said .  the big picture is when they look at the crowd , see the fans clapping , watch the football team waving at them . the feeling is being a part of something huge .  spurlin said the friendship and the time together is something irreplaceable , something the band members will take with them for the rest of their lives . very few members of the marching bands go on to careers as professional musicians .  some will go on to teach music ,  spurlin said ,  but for most , they bless us with their talent while they 're here , and then they graduate and do something else for a living .  dunnigan said :  i hope that , in 10 years , some who are in the band now will still play their instruments in church , or in a community musical group .  the physical challenges can be daunting :  we come onto the field in a high-step jog , with legs all the way up ,  spurlin said .  they 're wearing long-sleeved cadet-style uniforms , heavy hats , and carrying their instruments , and for a 1 o'clock game in alabama , it can be 98 degrees down on the field .  dunnigan and spurlin both said that , each year , there are some musicians who are supremely talented , but who just ca n't play their instruments well while marching quickly in formation . there also are some who are brilliant at close-order drills , but whose musicianship does not match their strutting skills . the directors have to tell them that they have n't made it onto the bands . with hundreds of band members on the field , if one musician hits a clunky note or takes a false step , the football fans up in the seats may not notice . but the other band members do , as do the band directors .  we 're all attuned to it , and we know ,  dunnigan said .  the accuracy of the notes , the formations to lock into , the crescendos -- we know right away when something 's off .  spurlin said :  our standards for ourselves are high . we teach a precise work ethic , a pride , that we hope will carry over to whatever the musicians do after they leave here .  as the seniors in both schools ' bands , like the seniors on both schools ' football teams , soon will do . but first there is monday night 's game . each band has been allocated six minutes to perform before kickoff , when , as they march , they will play their schools ' traditional fight songs . at halftime , each band gets eight minutes ; among auburn 's selections , spurlin said , will be music from stage shows that became popular movies . dunnigan said that the florida state band will also include movie music : the james bond theme , among other songs . and then , for the musicians whose final season this is , it will be over .  the value of all this will become more apparent to them as the years go on ,  dunnigan said . spurlin said that when graduating band members tell him that being on the squad has been the time of their lives , he tells them he hopes that turns out not to be true .  i thank them , but i tell them that i do n't really want that for them . i tell them that i hope they will have many , many special moments after they leave college . i tell them that i hope the times of their lives -- the spine-chilling , best moments -- are still ahead of them .  the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of bob greene .", "summary": " two other teams will take the field at monday 's college football championship game .   bob greene writes that it 's a big evening for the auburn , florida state marching bands .   greene : they likely wo n't be featured on tv , but their hard work deserves praise .
