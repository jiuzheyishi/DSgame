{"text": "chris aire is known as  the king of bling ,  the jeweler to the stars whose dazzling creations are worn by the likes of angelina jolie , 50 cent and shaquille o'neal . but although he might be regularly rubbing shoulders with hollywood superstars , famous musicians and elite athletes today , there was a time when the nigerian-born designer could only dream about approaching a celebrity . more than two decades ago , aire used to hang outside five star hotels and trendy bars in los angeles in the hope of showing his designs to a potential star client .  i had my little coach bag ,  remembers aire .  i had everything in it 'cause seriously i did n't know any of these guys . so walking up to them you really have just a minute -- if even that -- to say ` yo , this is what i 've got , '  he adds .  i had instances where people thought i was selling hot items -- ` this dude out here man , he 's got some stolen stuff . '  read this : africa 's first design museum . but after a year of frequenting celeb hotspots , exhausting his savings in the process , aire 's big break finally came following an l.a.-based encounter with gary payton , the nba star playing for the seattle supersonics at the time .  i was just hanging out at a hotel waiting for him because i knew he was going to be there ,  remembers aire .  and when he came down , the press rush that he had , he would have been justified in saying , ` hey man get out of my way .  instead , payton invited aire to go later that year to a charity event in miami and show him his creations . there was only one problem : aire had no money . undeterred , aire decided to max out his credit card and buy an airline ticket to miami , even though he could n't afford a return flight to l.a. . but when he got to florida , payton was so impressed with his designs that he immediately placed a $ 50,000 order , buying a platinum basketball pendant for himself and other jewelry for his friends .  that sale transformed my life ,  says aire .  not only did i pay for the flight ticket , i had enough to start building and doing a bunch of my own collection .  ` leap of faith ' the son of a successful nigerian businessman , aire grew up in the west african country 's ivue uromi region . his father wanted him to go into the family oil business , but instead aire left nigeria aged 18 to go to college in the united states . but while working on getting his education , aire had also to find a way of supporting himself . his first job was flipping burgers in a fast-food restaurant overnight . read this : tribal beauty of vanishing life .  i would work from 10 pm to 6 am in the morning and then i 'll go home , get a couple of hours nap and then go to school at nine ,  recalls aire .  i was at school from 9 until about 4 pm -- and then i went home , got ready and repeated that again , five days a week .  after graduating from college , aire tried his luck briefly as an actor and singer , before making his foray into jewelry with the help of a friend whose father was a jeweler . starting from the bottom , aire worked his way up , learning the craft and understanding everything about gold , diamonds and other colored gem stones . after six years of apprenticing under his friend 's father , aire had managed to save $ 5,000 . he then decided it was time to strike out on his own and form his own company .  it was a leap of faith and i took that leap of faith ,  says aire .  i was very confident in my faith because i believe whatever it is that puts the inspiration in your mind has within it its own fulfillment .  ` massive wealth ' since then , aire has managed to build a thriving company whose a-list clientele is a roll call of cinema and music superstars . in 2004 , aire made fashion history when he became the first jeweler to stage a runway show at new york fashion week . his sparkling creations include a diamond encrusted cuff -- priced at $ 1.7 million -- and a $ 500,000 diamond-coated guitar for hip-hop artist wyclef jean . but even though he mixes with the rich and famous , aire has not forgotten where he came from . he frequently visits nigeria and is optimistic about the future of both his country and his continent .  i think there is going to be a time when africa , starting with nigeria , becomes the envy of luxury market ,  he says .  there 's massive wealth here but the western impression of africa has always been a country of people in need of charity , in need of aid , but africa really is the last frontier .  aire also believes that people in the continent should support local designers and luxury brands , which in turn can speed up the growth of african businesses .  we have to embrace our own so that the next louis vuitton or chanel comes out of africa . so we are positioning ourselves to be that breakout brand from africa .
