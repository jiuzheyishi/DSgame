{"text": "dubai , uae many of the pilots assembled at the dubai airshow can boast breaking the sound barrier , but only one man in the world can say he 's done it both in the sky and on the ground . that privilege belongs to former fighter jet pilot royal air force -lrb- raf -rrb- wing commander andy green . as the driver of thrust ssc -- the fastest car on the planet -- he broke the sound barrier in 1997 with a world land speed record of 763mph . despite the roar of the display jets passing overhead , he remains focused on more terrestrial matters : the quest to drive a car over 1,000 mph with the bloodhound project .  as with everything i do in life , being able to do difficult things and do them well is hugely satisfying ,  he says from the roof of the eurofighter chalet at the event . read more : the bloodhound that wants to run at 1,000 mph . with a name that could be a code word for a covert second world war operation -lrb- it 's actually named after a missile -rrb- , the bloodhound project has plenty of challenges up ahead .  basically we 're trying to do what no one has done before ,  he says .  i 've got five supersonic runs , which is five more than anybody else . that gives me a unique perspective on the challenges facing the new car and how we 're going to take it a lot further .  the design of the car took years to perfect and while it still generally resembles a rocket on wheels , there are plenty of things that make it much more than just a fighter jet without the wings ; one of the biggest challenges is dealing with the shockwaves caused by the wheels traveling at such high speeds . something that the car does have directly in common with a fighter jet is the engine . it uses an ej200 engine normally found on a eurofighter typhoon jet . it was one of the test-and-development engines donated by eurofighter . it 's as close as green gets to a jet engine these days ; the 51-year-old flew missions over bosnia and iraq and was in charge of running the raf 's air campaign missions over libya in 2011 . during that campaign he says that the success rate of the engine was 97 % , which means he has no concerns about sitting in front of one and hurtling across the ground at previously unimaginable speeds . read more : 15 ways drones will change your life . thrilling though it may be for green , the greater aim of the bloodhound project is to inspire a new generation of engineers and scientists . the project is clearly quite attractive to the british scientific community as well , as it 's backed by the british government 's engineering and sciences agency , universities , the armed forces and a number of other organizations . in order to garner as much interest in science and engineering as possible , the project is mostly open-source -lrb- some technical points about engine performance are withheld -rrb- . it also aims to broadcast the test runs and record attempts live .  that 's almost as big a challenge as getting a car over 1,000 mph ,  says green . with a chassis built , the aim is to roll out the vehicle for its first tests at the aerohub in newquay , southwest england . if everything goes well , the car will be transported to the hakskeen desert in south africa where green and the team will test the vehicle and push it past the speed of sound .  the idea is to then go back in 2016 and get it above 1,000 mph .  it took three years to clear a 12-mile stretch of desert to make a test-run-ready track -- an enormous undertaking that perhaps reflects the ambitions of the project itself . green was finally given the green light this month . ironically , the fastest man on earth does n't have much time to actually sit back and appreciate the experience .  -lsb- when driving -rsb- , the ground is terribly close , going past terribly fast , and that 's just one of those background things where you have to say , ` yup , that should be a mind-blowing sensation . ' but i ca n't afford for it to be , i have to concentrate on doing my job .
