{"text": "travellers cleared from dale farm after a lengthy legal battle have said they want to replace it with a new site more than twice the size . they want to build more than 100 new pitches on the green belt land in crays hill , essex , which they say is now contaminated anyway . news of the plans comes just 15 months after basildon council and essex police spent # 7.1 m evicting around 80 families from the six-acre site . covered in rubbish : following the eviction , dale farm became a target for fly-tippers and is now covered in old mattresses , washing machines and rubbish . now the council , which had promised to restore it to greenbelt land , has been consulted by a campaigner for the travellers on what has been dubbed a ` supersite ' at dale farm . the new scheme would involve redeveloping all 51 demolished pitches and creating 20 temporary pitches along oak road where touring caravans are currently illegally parked . there would also be 40 upgraded neighbouring legal pitches . if approved , the site would be more than . twice the size of the illegal development which stood in the town for . more than a decade . today basildon council confirmed that . stuart hardwicke-carruthers , a campaigner for the travellers , had made . extensive enquiries into submitting the radical plan . a council spokesman said : ` mr . hardwicke-carruthers has requested the council 's opinion as to whether . an environmental impact assessment would need to be carried out prior to . the possible submission of a planning application for the proposed . development of a 111-pitch gypsy and traveller site on land he refers to . as being dale farm . battlefield in the green belt : this aerial photo shows what was europe 's biggest illegal traveller site shortly after it was cleared , with the legal site next door . popular site : following the eviction , many travellers simply parked along the lane leading to dale farm . ` it should be stressed that no planning application has been submitted . ` the council has three weeks from the submission date of the request to provide its opinion . ` the consideration of this request does not affect the planning position or green belt status of the land . ' mr hardwicke-carruthers , who advises the travellers ' legal team , claims that . concreting over the land and using it as traveller pitches is the only . viable option for the potentially-contaminated site . he said : ` because the land is now . contaminated with hazardous substances , the most sensible option will be . to cap it with a concrete base and the only real potential use becomes . another traveller site . ` this . will not only deal with the environmental problems caused by the . clearance , but also meet the shortage of sites in the borough . ' tony ball , leader of basildon council , described the possible application as ` ridiculous ' . he said : ` given the history of this site , and the number of legal challenges and decisions that have been made regarding dale farm , i find it ridiculous that mr carruthers could even consider submitting a planning application to redevelop the land . ` i , along with many local people , find it an insult that after a decade of persistent law-breaking and significant cost to the taxpayer to uphold the law , that this is even being suggested . ` he has learnt nothing from the dale farm issue , and this is clearly a publicity stunt that will just waste valuable council officer time . ` the site is within the green belt , and our green belt policy is clear , as is national planning policy . ` however , there is nothing the council can do to stop an individual submitting a speculative application whether they have a chance of implementing their plans or not . ' burning barricades : the eviction of dale farm in october 2011 involved police and council workers and cost taxpayers # 7.1 m . neighbour len gridley , 54 , whose house backs on to the illegal site , said : ` this is another ludicrous plan . ` there would be uproar if this got through and residents would make sure the whole council had to resign . ` because of the amount of money spent on the eviction , to reinstate it would be madness . ' the eviction , in october 2011 , involved more than 300 police officers , as well as bailiffs and council workers , and some of the residents had to be forcibly removed . many of the travellers who were evicted from the site in 2011 simply moved to a temporary camp 100 yards away . basildon council promised to turn the site back into greenbelt land , but more than a year on it appears as if nothing has been done , and fly-tipped rubbish covers the site . the results of an environment agency investigation into potentially dangerous pollutants - including asbestos and engine oil - allegedly dug up by council contractors during the eviction is expected within the coming weeks . last month basildon council approved an application by the irish traveller movement in britain -lrb- itmb -rrb- for a 15-pitch site in gardiners lane south , just a mile away from the dale farm site .", "summary": " six-acre site in essex 's green belt cleared 15 months ago in bitter scenes .   now same travellers plan to apply for new site twice the size of the old one .   campaigner for travellers says litter-strewn site is contaminated now .   leader of council describes new scheme as ` time-wasting publicity stunt ' "}
