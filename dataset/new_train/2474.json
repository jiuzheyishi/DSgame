{"text": "somewhere , dick nixon wants a royalty check . when new jersey gov. chris christie channeled his inner tricky dick and declared ,  i am not a bully ,  he did himself no favors . to be fair , christie faced a dilemma : either admit to creating a climate of bullying , intimidation and political payback that led to the george washington bridge scandal , or claim that his staff and appointees disrupted traffic on the world 's busiest bridge as political punishment without his knowledge . in the business we call it a choice between being a crook or a schnook . ladies and gentlemen , meet gov. schnook . a schnook , for those who do n't speak yiddish , is a dupe . a fool . a patsy . a schnook is a victim , and chris christie is not convincing playing the victim . he wants us to believe that gov. straight-talk , mister no-b.s. , credulously believed a pack of lies from his close aides . he wants us to believe that , as a former federal prosecutor , he thought his one-hour  investigation  of this operation , which yielded no confessions , was all that he could have done to unearth the truth . the governor clearly hopes that his press conference , his apology and his firing of one whole person will put this issue to rest . it wo n't . there 's a great old saying that battle-scarred scandal managers love :  the dogs bark but the carnival moves on .  it 's the crisis manager 's equivalent of  take two aspirin and call me in the morning ,  meant to reassure the scandal-plagued public figure that the media and the public have short attention spans , and that the next twerking episode will distract folks . but not with the chris christie bridge-closing scandal : this one 's gon na stick . how do i know ? three reasons : . 1 . it feeds a pre-existing narrative . this is the most important factor in determining whether a miscue becomes a scandal and whether a scandal becomes a permanent taint . any issue that advances a narrative that people already have is given greater credence and is more memorable . every public figure has a master narrative . in fact they have two : one positive , one negative . in the case of christie , his larger-than-life persona has been drawn both with bold strokes and in vivid color . the positive narrative is compelling -- and true : the straight-talking , forceful , blunt leader ; the no-nonsense take-charge guy who blasted as  stupid and selfish  his own constituents who did not evacuate a beach community before a hurricane . christie 's negative narrative is just as powerful , and just as true : bully . he burst on the national scene in youtube clips of town hall meetings where he berated critics . as the new york times reported , as governor , christie has a remarkable pattern of bullying : stripping former gov. richard codey of his security detail after codey called christie  combative and difficult ;  cutting funding to a rutgers university program run by a professor who sided with democrats on a redistricting panel , and more . if , as it appears , christie 's appointees and staff forced new jerseyans to suffer through a four-hour traffic jam because their mayor -- a democrat -- had the temerity to back the democratic candidate opposing christie 's re-election , it does n't just feed the image of a bully ; it cements it . 2 . there are ongoing legal and political processes . the democratic majority leader of the state senate , loretta weinberg , described herself as shocked by the scandal . more important -- and more ominous , for christie -- she declared ,  i am waiting -- and hopefully with the support of assemblyman -lrb- and deputy speaker john -rrb- wisniewski -- that the subpoena power will continue .  continuing subpoenas mean continuing revelations .  sooner rather than later ,  weinberg said ,  we 're going to hear the whole story of who knew what when .  there are almost certainly going to be lawsuits from aggrieved commuters , which will put folks under oath . and , most ominously , the u.s. attorney has said he is looking into the matter . if this becomes a federal case , the stakes rise immeasurably . 3 . it happened at the media epicenter . it 's not fair , but it 's true : the news media is based largely on the east coast and principally in new york . if the governor of south dakota closed the chief standing bear bridge , which connects south dakota to nebraska , most of the national media would not know or care . but this is the george washington bridge . journalists can cover this story , literally , on their commute . christie 's proximity to the media center has helped fuel his celebrity ; now it may fuel his downfall . the truth is there is not much christie can do about these three dynamics . he tried apologizing , but kept returning to the plea that he is truly the victim here : that he 's just a poor schnook who was lied to . it seems to me that is small comfort to the thousands of people who endured four-hour traffic jams , or schoolchildren trapped on endless bus rides , or the family of the elderly woman who died after emergency services were slow in getting to her . he tried blaming others , as if acting in a sopranoesque fashion is totally antithetical to his political style . soon he will return to attacking the press and democrats . none of it will work . if you believe bullygate is going away anytime soon , there 's a bridge in fort lee i 'd like to sell you . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of paul begala .", "summary": " paul begala : chris christie faces difficult choice between being seen as a crook or a schnook .   he says christie is not convincing playing the victim of his own staff .   begala says the scandal is likely to haunt christie because it fits perceptions of him as a bully .   the investigative and legal process will grind on , to christie 's detriment , begala says .
