{"text": "a prominent human rights activist whose 18-month house arrest in eastern china and dramatic escape attracted worldwide attention is in the u.s. embassy in beijing , a close friend said saturday .  when chen guangcheng first fled to beijing , we had to keep moving him from place to place to ensure his safety -- and we agreed the u.s. embassy is the only absolutely secure location in town ,  said hu jia , a fellow activist and one of the few people who 've seen him since he arrived in the capital .  i understand he 's now in a 100 % safe place and that place is the u.s. embassy .  quoting an anonymous source , texas-based nonprofit group chinaaid said chen is  under u.s. protection and high-level talks are currently under way between u.s. and chinese officials regarding his status .   because of chen 's wide popularity , the obama administration must stand firmly with him or risk losing credibility as a defender of freedom and the rule of law ,  said bob fu , the head of chinaaid . a u.s. embassy spokesman and chinese officials declined to answer questions about chen . u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton is scheduled to arrive in beijing next week for talks with chinese officials on strategic and economic issues . the activist , who is blind , was driven to beijing on sunday after evading his guards in a tiny village in shandong province , according to he peirong , a friend and fellow activist . chen addressed chinese premier wen jiabao in a video posted on youtube on friday , detailing  cruel  abuses he said he and his family suffered at the hands of authorities during more than 18 months of heavily guarded detention in their home .  they broke into my house and more than a dozen men assaulted my wife ,  he said .  they pinned her down and wrapped her in a comforter , beating and kicking her for hours . they also similarly violently assaulted me .  journalists and supporters were prevented from visiting chen during his house arrest . one of those supporters is hollywood actor christian bale , who was roughed up by security guards during such an attempt in december . after learning of chen 's escape , bale urged china to free his family , who were also under house arrest but did not escape with him .  while it gives hope that , for now , chen guangcheng is safe , his family is not ,  bale said in an e-mail to cnn saturday .  as a world leader , china must now show its wisdom and compassion , and remind the world of its rich cultural history , by permanently freeing chen guangcheng and his family and never allowing thuggery and corruption to tarnish china 's reputation again .  chen , 40 , is a self-taught lawyer who rose to fame in the late 1990s thanks to his legal advocacy for what he called victims of abusive practices , such as alleged forced abortions , by china 's family-planning officials . a local court sentenced chen to four years and three months in prison in 2006 on charges of damaging property and  organizing a mob to disturb traffic  in a protest , charges that his supporters called preposterous . since his september 2010 release from prison , he had been confined to his home along with his wife , mother and daughter . according to he , chen 's friend , chen prepared for his escape for months by lying in bed for long periods so guards would n't be suspicious if they did n't see any activity from him for a long time . fellow activist hu said chen scaled a high wall at night and hurt his leg after jumping off .  he stumbled and fell hundreds of times , and crossed a muddy creek -- it took him hours to evade layers of security ,  hu told cnn by phone .  as a blind man , his other senses are heightened ,  he added .  to him , night means nothing and darkness is protection .  hu , himself released from prison last june after serving 3Â 1/2 years for  inciting to subvert state power ,  has known chen since 2001 . his wife posted a photo online of the men 's reunion at an undisclosed location , showing both sporting black jackets and wide grins .  he called me ` brother , brother , ' and gave me a big hug ,  hu said .  he has a lot more gray hair and is sick , but his spirits are high .  chen 's high-profile breakout appears to have angered the local officials who were holding him captive , with supporters saying at least four members of his family already detained . in the friday video , the blind activist appealed to the chinese premier to investigate his case and expressed concern about the welfare of his wife , mother and daughter . their whereabouts were unknown saturday .  although i 'm free , my worries are only deepening ,  he said .  they have been persecuting my family for a long time , and my escape would only prompt them into a mode of revenge .  u.n. high commissioner for human rights navi pillay echoed those sentiments , saying in a statement released friday that she is  disturbed to hear reports that other family members ... have now been detained .  noting she has raised concerns about chen 's case before , pillay urged chinese authorities  to investigate the treatment of both him and his family , to ensure their physical integrity and to provide redress for any wrongdoing by local officials .  repeated calls seeking comment from the local authorities in shandong went unanswered . the authorities ' reaction also seems to have ensnared chen 's supporters , especially those suspected in helping him escape . after speaking to cnn , hu was taken away by police for questioning , his wife posted on twitter . chen 's friend he disappeared friday , shortly after cnn interviewed her via skype . the last message she sent out , said fu of chinaaid , was that state security agents had arrived at her home in the eastern city of nanjing .  i 'm not concerned about my own safety ,  she said during the interview .  i hope they 'll arrest me , not my friends .
