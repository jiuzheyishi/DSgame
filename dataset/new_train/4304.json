{"text": "monday 's cnn poll results just plain surprised , almost shocked me . when i saw the poll was due to be released , i expected the republicans to be taking a beating considering the terms president barack obama and his staff have been using to describe them over the past 10 days -lrb-  extremists ,   people with a bomb strapped to their chest  -rrb- and the unfair , derogatory press coverage of their position . the results are so dramatically better for republicans and worse for the democrats and obama than i expected that i was curious to see just how much better republicans are faring during the shutdown of 2013 -lrb- and how much worse the president and the democrats are faring -rrb- than in comparable polls of the 1995-96 shutdowns . what i discovered was revealing and runs against the entire media narrative of this year 's struggle over the continuing resolution and the debt ceiling . let 's start with the shutdowns during the clinton administration when i was leading house republicans . there were two : one in november 1995 and one in december '95 and early january 1996 . a cnn poll at the time showed americans blamed republicans over president bill clinton for the first shutdown by almost 2-to-1 , 49 % to 26 % . republicans fared only a little better in the second shutdown of the mid - '90s . a cnn poll after it began showed the american people preferred clinton 's approach to that of the republicans by 52 % to 38 % . sixty-two percent said they had negative feelings about the republican leaders during that conflict , compared with only 49 % about clinton . this is not to say the shutdowns were a strategic mistake . quite the opposite : the enormous progress we made afterward -- four consecutive balanced budgets , welfare reform , the first tax cut in 16 years -- was a direct result of republicans standing firm in 1995 and early 1996 . it proved to clinton , and more importantly to the country , that we were serious about the ideas we had run on in 1994 . as a consequence , we were the first re-elected republican majority in the house since 1928 . in the long run , in other words , the shutdowns did n't do us any damage , a fact gallup documented recently . but as the above poll numbers suggest , most americans were clearly frustrated during those shutdowns , and in the immediate term they blamed republicans . in retrospect i brought some of this on us because i was very firm and clear beforehand that we were prepared to close the government if that was what it took to get an agreement to balance the federal budget . in a sense , americans were right to blame -lrb- or credit -rrb- us with the shutdowns because we were in fact on offense , seeking a decisive change in government . as the first house republican majority in 40 years , we were feeling empowered , and we probably showed it too clearly . there was another big reason why the public gave clinton the benefit of the doubt , however . he was consistently willing to talk and to meet . people saw him as a reasonable guy trying to help get to a solution . and since republicans controlled both the house and the senate , the congressional democrats were not a big part of the public drama . because we were so openly pushing for a big change and clinton was so willing to be reasonable , the american people naturally attributed the shutdowns to us and gave clinton good marks for at least trying to negotiate . today the situation is radically different . virtually every republican has learned from 1995-1996 . republicans ' consistent refrain is that they do n't want to shut the government . they constantly say that they want to negotiate , to make a deal , and that they 're frustrated by obama 's refusal to talk . the president , on the other hand , has taken the hard-line position that he will not negotiate , repeating this on television practically every day . in addition , he has used his office to cause as much pain to the people as he reasonably can , including very public and unnecessary pain for our soldiers , veterans and small business owners . this behavior strikes most americans as offensive and unfair . i thought , however , that with the general bias of the press coverage -- the overemphasis on republican dissent , the almost complete avoidance of covering democrats who have split with their leaders to vote in favor of clean , piecemeal continuing resolutions to fund parts of the government , and the normal process of giving obama a permanent benefit of the doubt -- that monday 's poll results would have been better than 1995-96 but still clearly anti-republican . the results were vastly better for the republicans and worse for obama than i expected . when asked in the cnn poll whom they are angry at , 63 % said republicans , 58 % said democrats and 53 % said obama . that is a 10-point margin for the president and only a 5-point margin for democrats , compared with a 23-point margin in november 1995 . independents said they blamed all three equally -lrb- 60 % gop , 59 % democrats , 58 % obama -rrb- . this is so clearly within the margin of error that it is for all practical purposes a tie . after weeks of the media focusing blame on house speaker john boehner , sen. ted cruz and the house republicans , it is clear the american people are not buying it . there have been too many days of the president saying ,  i will not negotiate .  the country believes him . they can see he 's a big part of the reason the government is shut down . if house republicans continue to pass targeted , clean continuing resolutions to fund parts of the government and senate republicans demand day after day for the right to vote on these popular measures , the margin of blame may begin shifting from virtual parity to a solidly democratic problem . if the republicans repeat every day their willingness to negotiate and obama and senate majority leader harry reid repeat every day their refusal to negotiate , this may become catastrophic for the democrats .", "summary": " newt gingrich : in shutdowns of 1990s , gop was blamed much more than democrats .   he says a new cnn poll shows that most people also blame democrats this time .   gingrich says president obama 's refusal to negotiate is hurting his image .   he says gop strategy is winning .
