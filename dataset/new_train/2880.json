{"text": "as the world says goodbye to nelson mandela , the task of ensuring his legacy becomes the world 's responsibility . his life has been described as an evolution from militant freedom fighter , to prisoner , to unifying figure and eventual elder statesman -- in the process winning the hearts and minds of world leaders and average citizens alike . in his 95 years he accomplished what many thought impossible . held prisoner for 27 years and later becoming south africa 's first democratically elected president , he practiced reflection , negotiation and incredible stubbornness . his capacity for forgiveness and reconciliation made him one of the most remarkable and respected individuals of modern times . whether it 's battling racism , offering a helping hand or long-overdue forgiveness , here are several practical suggestions to keep mandela 's legacy alive . make the best of your current situation .  it is possible that if i had not gone to jail and been able to read and listen to the stories of many people . ... i might not have learned these things ,  mandela once said in 2000 during an interview with the christian science monitor . he said reading biographies helped him realize problems make some people , while destroying others . his mother and eldest son both died while he was imprisoned . while he had ample reason to remain bitter about his mistreatment , instead he wrote in  long walk to freedom ,  his 1995 autobiography ,  prison is itself a tremendous education in the need for patience and perseverance . it is , above all , a test of one 's commitment .  do n't judge a book by its cover .  i have been surprised a great deal sometimes when i see somebody who looks less than ordinary , but when you talk to the person and he -lrb- or she -rrb- opens his mouth , he is something completely different ,  mandela said in the same interview about how his prison experience taught him to respect even the most ordinary people . anthony f. lemieux , an associate professor of communication at georgia state university in atlanta said avoiding the temptation to put people in narrowly fixed categories is one of mandela 's greatest legacies .  people are complex and dynamic , capable of change and evolving ,  lemieux said . it would have been easy for mandela to become and remain jaded after what he had experienced , lemieux added . even for the people who kept mandela locked up , the former president said they were n't bad people .  mr mandela was at pains to point out that not every prison warder or apartheid official was bad . this view was underpinned throughout by his assertion that to get along in life one should see the good in all people ,  said a nelson mandela centre of memory statement on a collection of writings about his prison time . use your passion to persuade others .  if you have an objective in life , then you want to concentrate on that and not engage in infighting with your enemies ,  mandela continued during the interview .  you want to create an atmosphere where you can move everybody toward the goal you have set for yourself .  remaining focused on a goal despite adversity requires a deep level of commitment . ask anyone whose ever overcome great odds to achieve their version of greatness . lemieux said different situations are going to draw different things out people , but it 's never as simple as distilling the experience down to a  type of person .  practically none of us knows how we will react in complex situations and interactions . change yourself first .  one of the most difficult things is not to change society -- but to change yourself ,  mandela said in 1999 at a tribute to billionaire businessman douw steyn , who had made his johannesburg residence available to mandela as a retreat after his prison release in 1990 . while mandela clearly fought for change in the world he lived in , he also changed himself . while imprisoned , he reflected on his  wild man  behaviors . he also said he neglected to show any gratitude to those who had helped him when he was poor , after he experienced some success as a lawyer . lemieux points out his change from violence to peace was profound . throughout the violence and chaos , ultimately ,  it was n't the violent conflict that led to social change .  do n't be afraid to acknowledge weaknesses .  if you come across as a saint , people can become very discouraged . i was once a young man and i did all the things young men do ,  mandela told the christian science monitor .  in his twilight , mandela was at pains to publish and acknowledge his weaknesses and shortcomings in his family life , in his relationships with women and his first wife , evelyn ,  john battersby wrote for cnn .  he was keen to dispel any notion of sainthood that might be bestowed on him . to this day , mandela 's weaknesses , his turbulent youth and his sometimes tempestuous relationships with women can still detract from the iconic status that mandela achieved in his own lifetime .  but , the responsible airing of his weaknesses -- including his own acknowledgment -- in fact humanized mandela and focused on his extraordinary strength of character and commitment in overcoming both his weaknesses and adversity in his own lifetime . it augmented mandela 's greatness .  get educated -- educate others .  education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world ,  mandela said during a speech at the university of the witwatersrand in johannesburg in 2003 . mandela failed twice to complete his bachelor 's degree and readily admitted he was a poor student . eventually he earned a law degree . six weeks after being elected president in 1994 , mandela called on south africans to solve the country 's  profound education crisis ,  bloomberg reported this year .  the task to make south africa a learning and learned nation belongs to all of us ,  he said in a speech . but the country 's schools are near the bottom in international rankings . unqualified teachers , inadequate training and corruption are among the problems . still , officials say almost all south african children now attend school , bloomeberg reported . look people in the eye and shake their hands .  nelson mandela made such a common gesture something transcendent -- a greeting that crossed all societal barriers , a symbol of reconciliation , even a declaration of victory ,  wrote cnn 's tom cohen in his piece ,  nelson mandela : man of many handshakes .  before meeting visiting dignitaries or political adversaries in five-star hotel conference rooms , mandela made sure to approach the security guards , servers and other workers outside to shake their hands , cohen wrote . they went wild when mandela concluded his final statement during a conference by offering his hand to f.w. de klerk , south africa 's last apartheid-era president , as an expression of unity , saying that despite their differences , he was willing to work with his adversary . de klerk had little choice but to grasp it .  i look at not only how people treat me , but how they treat others ,  lemieux said .  sometimes this -lrb- how they treat others -rrb- is more important .  a simple handshake , lemieux said , can convey to others that the person making the gesture is demonstrating the belief that ,  this person has value , has a perspective .  maintain a sense of humor .  you sharpen your ideas by reducing yourself to the level of the people you are with and a sense of humor and a complete relaxation , even when you 're discussing serious things , does help to mobilise friends around you . and i love that ,  mandela said in a 2005 interview , published by the nelson mandela foundation . at election rallies in 1994 , cohen wrote , mandela repeatedly elicited trilling howls of ululation from women of all ages when he explained how voters should search their ballots for the picture of the  very handsome young man  -- referring to himself -- to mark their support for the anc . cnn 's robyn curnow examined mandela 's the importance of his ability to  charm and cajole .   the cult of mandela had become so pronounced that celebrities , world leaders and ordinary people often became tongue-tied and gibbering when they met him ,  she said .  self-mockery was a typically savvy mandela ploy to ensure that people would relax around him .  forgive .  it enables me to go to bed with an enriching feeling in my soul and the belief that i am changing myself -lsb- by reconciling with former adversaries -rsb- ,  mandela told the christian science monitor about his experiences with douw steyn . steyn was a white businessman who befriended mandela and began sharing his resources with the poor .  for someone who had been imprisoned , it -lrb- forgiveness -rrb- was a fundamentally transformative experience ,  lemieux said . he explained that people unable to forgive may experience an inability to move forward . johann lochner was a johannesburg police officer from 1986 to 1990 . in an essay submitted to cnn ireport , lochner describes responding to a shopping mall bombing scene and stepping over body parts .  we suspected that the deceased may have been affiliated with the umkhonto we sizwe , the militant arm of the african national congress ,  lochner wrote . he describes the police department , as well as the city , as  greatly divided .   mandela wanted to find a way to unite all the people of south africa -- something only the power of forgiveness could produce ,  he said .  to this day , i am so passionate about the role forgiveness played in madiba 's life . i remember so clearly how i had to personally take steps to overcome the ingrained apartheid mentality in south africa .   it 's almost like a miraculous , supernatural transformation had taken place in mandela 's life , and consequently , in the whole nation .  forgiveness freed madiba ,  lochner said ,  and forgiveness freed his country ,  nelson mandela from joel gautraud on vimeo . .", "summary": " simple changes in everyday behavior can honor mandela 's legacy .   forgiveness , compassion , humor used
