{"text": "at 10 friday morning , the russians will give frank hewetson the best holiday gift of all : a stamp in his british passport that will allow the greenpeace activist to leave the country and return home to his family . the exit visa will put an end to hewetson 's chilling saga that began in september in the icy waters surrounding an arctic oil rig . he was among 28 protesters and two journalists aboard the greenpeace ship arctic sunrise who were arrested by russian authorities and thrown in jail . hewetson , 48 , was on the helicopter deck of the ship , taking in a full moon and a sunset on that september evening . it was a sight to behold in the arctic . amid the breathtaking beauty , he saw on the horizon what looked like a little wasp buzzing around , getting bigger and bigger . suddenly , a massive helicopter swooped down , the monstrous gusts of winds knocking hewetson off his feet . russian paratroopers stormed the greenpeace ship . it was frightening and hewetson felt queasy , his just-eaten dinner barely digested . five days later , he found himself locked up in a russian prison that seemed a mix between a joke and a cold war-era novel by john le carre . it was dilapidated and rat-infested . some windows were broken and the central heating did n't work everywhere .  it was like stepping back in time ,  hewetson said . he 'd worked for greenpeace , perhaps the world 's best known environmental activist group , since 1989 and on campaigns across the world . he joined the mission to protest the rig owned by russian company gazprom because he firmly believed oil companies had to be stopped from drilling for fossil fuels in the arctic . suddenly , his life seemed severed from all that he loved -- his wife and two children in london , his dog pluto and his passion for ping pong . russia had not only jailed him but he , like the other arctic 30 , as they became known , were facing charges of piracy so serious that he was looking at a possible 15 years behind bars . at home in england , those kind of charges meant the authorities had a heap of evidence against the accused . he felt  pretty damn desperate ,  he said thursday .  that was a very hard night for me in prison .  the charges were later reduced to  hooliganism  which still carried a penalty of seven years in jail . each day , the minutes ticked slowly . hewetson passed time by reading , though it took a long time for the prison to receive books sent by family and friends and even longer to add them to the library . author terry pratchett 's light-hearted writing struck the right chord .  one had to pace one 's reading ,  he said ,  because staring at the ceiling lying in your bunk with nothing to take your mind off your immediate predicament was not a good place to be .  the cell was about 18 feet by 7 feet and contained three men -- hewetson and two inmates already there on criminal convictions . the floorboards had rotted out , the window , busted . a toilet was separated by thin , wooden panels -- a call of nature at dinner hour was not appreciated by other cellmates . the light was on 24/7 and the air was thick with cigarette smoke , something that bothered hewetson , a nonsmoker . hewetson got on famously with his two cellmates , a fact that is fundamental , he said , to enduring prison life . he discovered through a strange form of lingua franca the reason for incarceration of his cell mates . they played chess together once greenpeace managed to send across a set .  during these games i found out , quite slowly , that 's ' was in for double manslaughter and ` v ' was in for gangland violence ,  hewetson said , referring to his cellmates .  despite the differing reasons for our incarceration we became very close friends .  he spent 23 of 24 hours every day in that cell . he was allowed one hour a day of solitary exercise in a small pen . he dreamed of playing ping pong , a game he loves enough to list as a hobby on his greenpeace profile . another lifesaver was a russian human rights activist who visited him regularly . the british prisoners nicknamed her mrs. tiggy-winkle because she -lrb- rather unkindly , he said -rrb- resembled the hedgehog washerwoman in a beatrix potter tale . hewetson , like everyone else , lost a lot of weight during his imprisonment . the food , he said , was truly awful .  the evening meals quite often contained fish heads . this mainly got flushed away as it was unpalatable even when really hungry .  the ordeal ended last week , when a sweeping amnesty program in russia allowed the arctic 30 to go free . russian president vladimir putin has been generous with  get-out-of-jail free cards  of late . the amnesty law freed business executive mikhail khodorkovsky and two members of russian punk band pussy riot , jailed for a performance critical of putin . hewetson said he was relieved .  i think the russian olympics had quite a bit to do with it ,  he said about the upcoming 2014 winter games in sochi . hewetson hopes to leave for st. petersburg friday morning . in the meantime , some prison habits have been hard to shake . he does his own laundry , cooks his own noodles with a boiling ring in his hotel room and eats kasha -lrb- porridge -rrb- every morning .  such activity before prison would have been pretty alien to me ,  he said . despite prison , hewetson seems committed to greenpeace . he spoke thursday about how dangerous drilling for oil in the arctic is to the environment . but for now , he just wants to get back home to london , to his family . he wants to light a wood-burning stove and brew a good cup of tea . and take his dog for a long walk .", "summary": " hewetson was among 28 activists and 2 journalists arrested at an arctic oil rig .   he was
