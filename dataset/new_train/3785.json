{"text": "a devastating plagiarism scandal ended the career of a democratic u.s. senator on thursday as he announced he will not seek re-election to a full term in office this november . sen. john walsh , then montana 's lieutenant governor , was appointed in february to serve out the term of max baucus , a longtime lawmaker who stepped down to take the post of u.s. ambassador to china . but walsh 's few months in office will be his only foray into national politics , following accusations in late july that he lifted large portions -- as much as two-thirds -- of his 2007 master 's degree thesis at the u.s. army war college from other published sources . montana democratic sen. john walsh has decided to pull out of his november senate race amid allegations that he plagiarized a research paper in 2007 . awful timing : walsh was among the most vocal proponents of a bill , signed into law by president barack obama on thursday , aimed at improving medical care for military veterans . his decision came on the same day president obama signed into law walsh 's most impressive legislative achievement : a bill creating an independent commission to probe the department of veterans affairs following reports that it delayed medical care for thousands of war veterans . walsh received a master of strategic studies degree and then was named the adjutant general overseeing montana 's national guard and its department of military and veterans affairs . the new york times first exposed his alleged academic dishonesty on july 23 . ` most strikingly , ' the times report read , ` each of the six recommendations mr. walsh laid out at the conclusion of his 14-page paper , titled  the case for democracy as a long term national strategy ,  is taken nearly word-for-word without attribution from a carnegie endowment for international peace document on the same topic . ' walsh will remain in the senate until his term ends in january 2015 . republican rep. steve daines was already considered a heavy favorite to win the seat this fall . recent polls show he was holding a 13 point lead over walsh . the billings gazette reported on thursday that walsh wo n't be on the ballot . the montana democratic party has not announced a replacement candidate , and has until its august 20 nominating convention to sort out the mess . the times reported thursday that montana democrats said the party was leaning toward nominating nancy keenan , a pro-abortion activist who once led naral pro-choice america . ' i am proud that with your support , we held our opponent -lsb- daines -rsb- accountable for his hurtful record to privatize medicare , to deny women the freedom to make their own health decisions and to sell off our public lands , ' walsh said in a statement thursday , which did not acknowledge any wrongdoing . ' i know how important it is to continue the fight for these montana values , and it is time for us all to return to the real issues of this election . ' the army war college 's handbook describes punishments for academic cheating . among them , according to a tweet from one new york times reporter : past students who have been caught after graduation are to names their scraped off the school 's bronze plaques honoring successful degree recipients . harsh : a new york times reporter found that army war college policy is to remove sen. walsh 's name from plaques in its halls honoring past graduates if he is found to have cheated . walsh initially denied the times ' charges in july , and then briefly proposed an excuse for his actions seven years ago , saying that post-traumatic stress disorder linked to his national guard service in iraq had been a factor . but he later said he took ` full responsibility ' for his actions , leading to widespread speculation that he would either step down or leave the senate after november 's elections . montana democratic party chairman jim larson said thursday in a statement that walsh 's life ` has been and continues to be service to our nation and all montanans . from 33 years in the national guard , to serving as lt. governor to his time in the u.s. senate , john walsh has sacrificed significantly for our country and is to be commended . ' but the editorial board of the gazette was less sanguine , writing on sunday that ` sen. john walsh 's response to plagiarism has destroyed our faith in him . ' ` haunted by a serious lapse in academic honesty , walsh is finished as a u.s. senate candidate . '", "summary": " sen. john walsh will not stand for election following his appointment to the u.s. senate to serve out the term of ambassador to china max baucus .   the new york times found in july that walsh had plagiarized most of the master 's degree thesis he submitted to the u.s. army war college in 2007 .   republicans were already expected to pick up the seat in november .   among the punishments the college could mete out : scraping his name from the plaques that honor graduates .
