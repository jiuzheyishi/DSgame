{"text": "up to half the food we buy from supermarkets goes in the bin despite much of it being perfectly edible , a report reveals today . experts say a throwaway consumer culture that undervalues food is behind the colossal waste . they blame confusion over sell-by dates and retailers ' ` buy one , get one free ' offers that tempt shoppers into buying more than they need . waste : seven million tons of food , worth more than # 10billion , is wasted in the uk every year , according to a report by the institution of mechanical engineers . across the country seven million tons of food , worth more than # 10billion , is thrown away annually -- costing the average household # 480 each year . of the food binned by families , from fresh fruit and veg to tinned and packet produce , # 1billion worth is still within its sell-by date and good to eat . the report , by the institution of mechanical engineers , says that up to three quarters of vegetables grown in britain ends up never being eaten , with large amounts being left in the field or rejected by supermarkets for being too ugly . confusion : the report 's author places some of the blame for food wastage on special offers in supermarkets that result in consumers ` buying more produce than they need ' author dr tim fox , head of energy and environment at the ime , said that over a lifetime an average household will throw away up to # 24,000 worth of food . he said : ` between 30 and 50 per cent of food bought from supermarkets is thrown away . it gets home from the shops , placed in the cupboard or fridge , and then up to half of that food goes in the bin . ` one of the problems is the way supermarkets retail . consumers end up buying more produce than they need because of special offers . many of these items have a limited shelf life , so they end up being thrown away . ` and with much of our fresh fruit being imported from around the globe , it does not have the lifespan of locally produced food because it has already spent days travelling . ` there is also confusion over labelling and sell-by dates , with many people opting to throw away perfectly good food . ' the average british family spends only 11 per cent of its budget on food , which explains why it is not valued more highly , the report found . dr fox said : ` with the shift away from small shops on the high street to large-scale supermarkets , we have lost the sense of value of food . ' almost a third of vegetables are never harvested and are ploughed back into the field because of overproduction and for aesthetic reasons , according to the report , global food : waste not , want not . ` many farmers produce more than is necessary as back-up to meet the strict criteria in the supply agreements set by supermarkets , ' said dr fox . warning : author of the report dr tim fox said between 30 and 50 per cent of food bought in supermarkets is thrown away and warned that people had ` lost the sense of value of food ' with a further 30 per cent never . making it to the supermarket shelf because they are considered too ugly . to be sold , only half a farmer 's crop is likely to be sold . the . misshapen produce is either left to rot in the field , sold off to be . added to manufactured products such as soup , used as animal feed , or put . in composting . but , once consumer waste is factored in , up to three-quarter of vegetables never make it on to a family 's plate . dr fox said : ` it is remarkable that you get any food to the table at all . up to 75 per cent of the veg grown in the uk does n't end up being eaten . that 's the bottom line . ` with a lot of vegetables , it is simply the fact that it just does n't look right . the crop is not harvested simply because it will not sell , but apart from appearance they are perfectly edible . ` although schemes are in place to sell some of this veg in different outlets , not enough is being done to tackle this waste . ' the picture remains the same across the globe , with around half of all food produced -- two billion tons worth -- lost to waste . but in developing countries the issue is one of storage rather than profligacy . others have queried the report 's figures , with the food waste campaigners wrap saying only one fifth of all the food and drink we buy as consumers ends up unused in the bin . unused : food waste expert emma marsh said that preparing too much food was one reason for waste , while misunderstanding over labels was another factor . food waste expert emma marsh said : ` our research has shown that 7.2 million tons of food and drink waste is generated by households in the uk each year . of this , 4.4 million tons is avoidable food waste . this avoidable food waste has a value of # 12billion per year . ' she said that preparing too much food was one reason for waste , while misunderstanding over labels was another factor . andrew opie , director of food and sustainability at the british retail consortium , which represents retailers , said : ` using more of the crop to cut food waste and increase sustainable production is an objective for all retailers . this is how we are exceeding government targets for food waste . ` it was supermarkets that lobbied europe to relax strict marketing rules on fruit and veg to allow us to sell more misshapen produce . this has led to an enormous increase in the sale of  wonky  veg . ` we 'll continue to work with growers to use more british produce , cut food waste and give customers great value . it 's a win , win , win . '", "summary": " seven million tons of food worth # 10billion is thrown away every year .   of the wasted food # 1billion is still within sell-by date and good to eat .   three quarters of vegetables grown in britain never get eaten .   report by institution of mechanical engineers blames supermarkets .   says average household wastes # 24,000 worth of food in lifetime .
