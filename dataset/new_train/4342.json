{"text": "jerusalem the israeli government 's press division is apologizing for circulating a link to a video that mocks activists aboard a ship headed to gaza earlier this week that was blocked by an israeli raid .  due to a misunderstanding on our part , earlier -lrb- friday -rrb- we inadvertently issued a video link that had been sent for our perusal ,  according to a statement from israel 's government press office , which distributed the link to media outlets .  it was not intended for general release ,  the statement said .  the contents of the video in no way represent the official policy of either the government press office or of the state of israel .  the video , titled  we con the world  -- set to the tune of the 1985 hit ,  we are the world  -- was put together by caroline glick , a former member of the israel defense forces and columnist for the jerusalem post . in the video , up to a dozen members of the so-called  flotilla choir  -- some wearing a variation of traditional arab dress -- sing satirical verses , such as :  there 's no people dying , so the best that we can do is create the biggest bluff of all .  on her blog , glick , who briefly appears in the video , says ,  we produced a clip in english . there we feature the turkish-hamas ` love boat ' captain , crew and passengers in a musical explanation of how they con the world .   we think this is an important israeli contribution to the discussion of recent events and we hope you distribute it far and wide ,  she adds . nine turkish citizens were killed monday after violence erupted on one of six ships in a flotilla carrying humanitarian aid to the palestinian gaza strip . a number of other people were wounded . israel said the passengers initiated the attack ; the passengers blamed the troops . that incident drew widespread condemnation and cast a spotlight on the dynamics of the gaza crisis . on saturday , israel intercepted the final boat that was part of the flotilla , though the incident aboard the irish-owned mv rachel corrie ended peacefully about 22 miles off the gaza coast . israeli government spokesman mark regev dismissed the the video link , saying ,  the gpo sends out lots of articles . it does n't mean they like it .  regev said he first noticed the video on the new york times website .  i called my kids in to watch it because i thought it was funny ,  he said .  it is what israelis feel . but the government has nothing to do with it . the gpo distributes non-government items , things that we think that show our side of the story .  it was not the first time the israeli gpo stirred controversy with its public communications on the gaza flotilla . prior to the storming of the turkish ship , the gpo sent an e-mail to journalists sarcastically recommending that while covering  alleged humanitarian difficulties ,  journalists should dine at one of gaza 's few restaurants .  we have been told the beef stroganoff and cream of spinach soup are highly recommended ,  the e-mail said . the message included an internet link to an old promotional video for the restaurant . the e-mail drew criticism from the foreign press and pro-palestinian activists . in an interview with the jerusalem post , gpo director danny seaman defended the communication , arguing that foreign media coverage of gaza was not balanced . cnn 's kevin flower contributed to this report .", "summary": " new : e-mail sent by press office prior to ship 's storming also sparked controversy .   israeli press office sorry for distributing video mocking flotilla activists .    we con the world  video created by jerusalem post columnist .   israeli pm spokesman : video captures what  israelis feel  "}
