{"text": "vitamin e and other common supplements fuel lung cancer in smokers , researchers fear . they say that rather than preventing tumours , popular antioxidant pills may speed their growth and spread and hasten death . the experiments were done on mice , but the swedish researchers believe they are relevant to people . researchers warn that vitamin e and other common supplements -lrb- pictured -rrb- could fuel lung cancer in smokers . they say that rather than preventing tumours , popular antioxidant pills may speed their growth and spread and hasten death . vitamin e helps maintain cell structure by protecting cell membranes . antioxidants , such as vitamins a , c and e , are credited with protecting against a host of ills , including cancer . but this study finds vitamin e and other supplements fuel lung cancer in smokers . vitamin e and other antioxidants are credited with boosting health by mopping up harmful molecules called free radicals . but it is thought that if cancer has already started to develop , they may actually feed the disease by switching off the body 's natural defences . the scientists recommended vitamin and other antioxidants are ` used with caution ' by smokers and lung cancer patients . cancer research uk recently said that we should be able to get all the vitamins we need from a healthy diet , without resorting to supplements . antioxidants , such as vitamins a , c and e , are credited with protecting against a host of ills , including cancer . however , recent studies have hinted that in some cases they may actually fuel the disease . when the university of gothenburg researchers give vitamin e to mice in the very early stages of lung cancer , the disease grew and spread more quickly and the animals died twice as fast . experiments on human cells confirmed the finding . a second antioxidant , a drug used to treat smoking-related lung conditions , had a similar effect . vitamin e and other antioxidants are credited with boosting health by mopping up harmful molecules called free radicals , which are unstable and highly reactive so that in animal tissues they can damage cells . anyone can have small lung tumours that are yet to be spotted by doctors , but they are most common in smokers . a coloured x-ray of the chest of a 52-year-old female patient with secondary lung cancer is pictured . but it is thought that if cancer has already started to develop , antioxidants may actually feed the disease by switching off the body 's natural defences . although anyone can have small lung tumours that are yet to be spotted by doctors , they are most common in smokers . the researchers said the amounts of vitamin e used were similar to those found in supplements . they advised that the vitamin and other antioxidants are ` used with caution ' by smokers , lung cancer patients and people with bronchitis , emphysema and other smoking-related lung conditions known collectively as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . they said it is too early to give any advice to healthy people -- or to say if vitamins speed the spread of other cancers . vitamin e and other antioxidants are credited with boosting health by mopping up harmful molecules called free radicals -lrb- illustrated -rrb- . the warning , published in the journal science translational medicine , is unlikely to apply to vitamin-rich ` superfoods ' such as blueberries as they would have to be eaten in huge amounts to provide the levels of antioxidants contained in supplements . dr emma smith , of cancer research uk 's senior science communications officer , cautioned that the study was done on mice and it is not clear what it means for people . however , she added : ` there 's no strong evidence that antioxidants or vitamin supplements could reduce cancer risk , and some types of supplement can actually raise the risk . ` there have also been concerns raised that antioxidants may interfere with cancer treatments . ` we recommend that people stick to a healthy , balanced diet , which should provide all the nutrients you need without taking supplements . '", "summary": " swedish researchers made their findings in mice but believe the results are relevant to humans .   university of gothenburg researchers found cancer spread more quickly in mice with the early stages of lung cancer , that were given vitamin c .   antioxidants , such as vitamins a , c and e , are usually credited with protecting against a host of ills , including cancer .
