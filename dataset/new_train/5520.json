{"text": "former home secretary jacqui smith believes voters blame labour for the current deficit . labour risks being seen as the party of ` scroungers ' by opposing a squeeze on benefits , according to former home secretary jacqui smith . railing against her party 's position on welfare , the former minister said party activists were being told on the doorstep that labour was lacking ideas to cut the deficit . ed miliband has ordered his party to vote against freezing rises in benefit payments to 1 per cent for the next three years in the commons tomorrow , instead of the inflation rate which is currently 2.7 per cent . the labour leader has argued that most of those who will be affected are in work because the cap will also apply to tax credits . he called the policy an attack on ` strivers ' . but tensions within his party emerged last month when a senior labour figure had described the policy as ` politically suicidal ' and revealed a ` caucus of new labour figures ' were set against it . this is because it left the party open to charges that it sided with ` scroungers ' and was ` in denial over the need to cut the benefits bill ' . yesterday miss smith weighed in to the debate , saying : ` frankly you can count me into this ` caucus ' . it would include a large number of people -lsb- labour canvassers -rsb- who 've knocked on doors recently and been told the problem for labour is that they think we caused the deficit and they 're not yet convinced we know how we 'll solve it . ` the tories want to paint us as a party which cares more about those unwilling to work than those struggling in work . ' a number of polls showing high levels of public support for a cap have painted labour into a corner over its opposition to a freeze which would apply across the board except for carers benefits , some disability payments and the basic state pension . the treasury released figures yesterday showing that by opposing cuts to welfare spending , labour would have saddled every working family with # 5,000 of national debt by the next general election . they claim all welfare savings , including the move to aggregate most benefits into a universal credit , the 1 per cent cap , changes to child and housing benefit and council tax , and a crackdown on fraud and error in the system will save # 83billion by 2015-16 . however labour say 60 per cent of those who would be affected are in work and would be left struggling . ahead of the vote on the welfare uprating bill , david cameron said this argument was ` very odd ' as they had backed a 1 per cent pay freeze for public sector workers , who the prime minister said ` work hard and do absolutely vital jobs ' . prime minister david cameron told bbc 's andrew marr that labour opposition to a benefit freeze was a ` very odd argument ' mr cameron told the bbc 's andrew marr show : ` the labour party agree with the 1 per cent increase in public sector pay but they do n't agree with the 1 per cent cap on welfare . it 's a very odd argument to say people out of work , their incomes should be going up faster than people in work - we do n't think that is right . ' tory chairman grant shapps admitted there were probably ' a very small number ' of ` shirkers ' who preferred not to work . but he said the system under labour was ` blatently unfair ' and so complex it prevented people working more hours . liam byrne mp , labour 's shadow work and pensions secretary , said : ` this government are handing a # 107,000 tax cut to millionaires but hitting millions of soldiers , nurses , cashiers and electricians with a strivers ' tax that will cost them hundreds of pounds a year . ' benefit claimants in the north of england could be paid less than those in the south to reflect the lower cost of living , if the tories win the next election . it is one of the radical ideas for the next manifesto put forward by the influential 2020 group of conservatives mps , including cabinet ministers such as michael gove and justine greening . yesterday ed balls attacked the ` lies ' about benefit scroungers yesterday , saying two thirds of those affects are in work , on low or middle incomes and two thirds and these are women . the shadow chancellor also backed the government 's cap on benefits of # 26,000 per family to ` get a grip on the benefits bill ' , but that it should be higher in london , saying it could lead to homelessness if set too low . he said : ` there are people looking for work , who currently ca n't find work because the economy is in a bad state . these are n't the feckless , the work shy , people behind curtains whilst others go to work , these are striving people . ` and why should they see their incomes cut while our prime minister at the same time is cutting taxes for the richest people ?
