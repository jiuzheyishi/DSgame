{"text": "these intricate creations look like a church 's stained glass windows - but are actually layers and layers of carefully cut paper . the laser-cut sculptures are the work of artist eric standley , 45 , who stumbled across the idea by accident . ' i was working on another project that included laser cutting circle-based patterns into cheerios boxes , ' said standley , an associate professor of art at virginia tech . scroll down for video . it 's not a stained glass window , but hundreds of pieces of paper cut and layered by artist eric standley . the sculptures bind layers of paper together once an intricate cutting process has taken place . this piece , called demeter , is standley 's largest work so far at 134 layers deep . demeter took three months to complete , with each laser-cut sheet of paper stacked by hand . ` when i was leaving the laser lab one day i stacked a few cut pieces together and was blown away by the layered complexity of the different works . ' i took out my sketchbook straight away and wrote down a dozen questions that took about two years to work through , to enable me to come up with the finished idea . ' each piece takes about 80 hours of laser-cutting time , using 100 layers of coloured paper on average . the sheets of cut paper are assembled by hand then bound to reveal the finished work . one piece of artwork takes standley up to four months to complete . his largest work so far is called demeter and made of 134 layers of paper . looking into the sculptures reveals the scale of the stack of paper and the colours within . the works are finished by being bound into a flipbook . the orange cover frames the details in the centre of the books . professor standley 's foray into working with paper was accidental , he says . each designs takes between three to four months of work to become a finished piece . ` i 'm like a monk with a laser , ' standley told wired magazine . ' i give it everything - it 's not just pushing a button . you 've got to have faith in what you do - you ca n't fake faith . ' the projects are meticulously planned before the laser comes out . he said : ' i sketch a composition first , working out an overall goal . ` then i draw each layer in vector-based software . each layer is cut individually with a cnc laser . standley 's projects are inspired by gothic , islamic , and greek art motifs . this one looks like a window to the sea made of delicate loops of paper . standley began working with lasers on his own paintings before trying the technique on card and then paper . up to 80 hours is spent on the cutting of the paper alone . ` the work is then cleaned of chads -lsb- leftover bits of paper -rsb- , assembled and bound like a flip book . ` the . final stage of my process includes building a mount and frame that . holds the work , allowing for a degree of movement that is inherent with . paper . ' professor standley took inspiration different angles reveal more detail in each piece thanks to the way they are stacked . the plan for each design is sketched out by hand then drawn in vector-based software . the 3d pieces are often symmetrical to mimic ancient art motifs . the creations mimic the symmetry of his influences and reveal colours and shapes when explored from different angles . he said : ` i 've been fortunate in the . work 's reception . someone described my work as  otherworldly  . that rang . positively with me . ` truly . this work could not be done without the use of technology , although . whatever the reason , i 'm lucky enough to have the patience to do what i . do .
