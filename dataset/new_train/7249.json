{"text": "on the face of it , chairman mao , napoleon and the green cross code might seem like they have nothing in common . but despite that they have all used propaganda to bury themselves in people 's minds . whether used as a force for good or bad , propaganda is everywhere and a striking exhibition seeks to highlight just how prevalent it can be . the cult of personality : chairman mao and napoleon used striking portraits of themselves to impress the idea upon a nation that they were the undisputed leaders . icons : this painting on the left presented stalin , who was himself from georgia , exactly as he wanted to be seen : as a cultured , learned scholar . the fictional character uncle sam -lrb- right -rrb- who was used to encourage enlistment in world war i and ii , is now a cultural icon , instantaneously recognisable . this collection of posters , scarfs , playing cards and even fans curated by the british library highlight just how insidious , creative and humorous campaigns can be when trying to impress an idea on to its audience . the library 's exhibition propaganda : power and persuasion , in london , explores how cultures across the world slipped their message into people 's minds - whether it be sneakily subtle or unapologetically obvious . it is the first exhibit to bring chinese . dictator mao 's little red book and the terrifying drink-driving adverts . together in one exhibition , which will prompt the audience to question . just how much they are influenced by propaganda . curators have explored the myriad ways . different states have used propaganda to influence the thoughts and . feelings of a nation , whether the message it carries creates an enemy , . generates feelings of national pride or promotes a healthy lifestyle . this slogan on the left has been used in britain since world war ii . the nhs had a mission to improve health through the prevention of disease and campaigns focused on personal responsibility . those who failed to heed good advice were characterised as a public menace . the medical officer journal used striking images -lrb- right -rrb- to promote better public health . flies were held responsible for contaminating food and spreading diseases and anti-fly campaigns were held across britain and the united states . how to win the war : war bond stamps could be mass produced and circulated widely . liberty provided a symbol that would be understood anywhere in the united states -lrb- left -rrb- . the theme of ` freedom imperilled ' deflected from discussion of the rationale for joining the war . in world war i , the parliamentary war savings committee set about using raising funds from the british public . this poster encourages donations by using a simple design to show a direct link between savings and military success -lrb- right -rrb- . one of the exhibits shows a scarf . handed out by the british government during world war ii to boost weary . citizens ' morale after the country was heavily bombarded by aerial . attacks . the scarf , made in 1942 , showed a map demonstrating london 's endurance in the face of german bombing . winston churchill 's rousing ` we shall fight them on the beaches ' quote and american broadcaster , ed murrow 's , famous exultation ` london can take it ! ' , run alongside a map of bomb sites . messages that stressed the resilience of britain and of british character were used to rally and sustain support for the devastating war . an unusual method of propaganda was used by king george iii in the 18th century . after another bout of sickness , king george iii sought to re-establish his authority with a commemorative fan in 1789 . changing people 's minds : the ` violated ' belgians often featured in british wartime propaganda with great emphasis placed on the plight of women , children and the elderly . this helped sustain british moral condemnation of germany throughout the war , and was used to imply that a similar threat could face british families . in the soviet poster -lrb- right -rrb- , new york 's statue of liberty is parodied as a look-out tower for u.s police to observe its people , mocking the idea that it is a symbol of freedom . one way of getting your message across : this unusual commemorative fan -lrb- left -rrb- links the well-being of the nation with the health of the king using the phrase ` health is restored to one and happiness to millions ' . the cards handed out to u.s troops in the iraqi war -lrb- right -rrb- served a practical purpose - soldiers could identify iraqi leaders - but also sent a message about the extent and quality of the coalition 's intelligence , and its willingness to seek out the enemy . the green cross code man featured in comics , television advertising and public information films as part of a co-ordinated road safety campaign . it linked the well-being of the . nation with the health of the king by declaring the phrase ` health is . restored to one and happiness to millions . ' while . the power of persuasion can generate the idea of a common enemy for a . nation , it can also be used to impress upon citizens the idea of an . all-powerful leader . propaganda . has been used by leaders across the nations to stamp their authority - . convincing even the most cynical of their power and plans . chairman . mao 's image was used in a variety of ways - from badges , to books , to . posters - so that every citizen in the huge sub-continent country would . be in no doubt that he was their unchallenged leader . it can be argued that without this wealth of ways that was used to spread the message of his personality , it would have been very difficult to bring the population under his control . more than two billion mao badges , were produced during the cultural revolution , ensuring that mao was seen as the undisputed ruler across china . the badges became essential for demonstrating revolutionary zeal , allowing wearers to both avoid denunciation and elevate themselves above their peers . the badges even became an alternative currency used to barter for goods and services . napoleon also used propaganda to announce his rule - portraits were painted to inspire loyalty and intimidate critics at a time when the emperor 's power was declining and france was besieged on all sides . while many would argue propaganda plays an important part in winning wars - from boosting morale to encouraging soldiers to enlist - it was used in a completely different way int the 2003 iraq war . coalition commanders circulated packs of playing cards to the us-led forces invading iraq in 2003 to enable troops to identify and capture prominent members of saddam hussein 's regime . the cards served a practical purpose but also sent a message about the extent and quality of the coalition 's intelligence , and its willingness to seek out iraqi leaders . the tactic was first used during the american civil war -lrb- 1861 -- 65 -rrb- . propaganda could also be used to dismiss ideals embedded in other cultures - imperative if a nation wanted to indoctrinate its citizens into conforming to the government 's plans . in a soviet poster , new york 's famous . statue of liberty is parodied as a look-out tower for the american . police to observe its people , mocking the idea that it is a symbol of . freedom . the tufty club was set up in 1961 by the royal society for the prevention of accidents to encourage better road safety amongst children . cards and other material helped spread the message as tufty and his friends learned from mrs owl how to cross the road safely . the ` careless talk ' campaign aimed to discourage people from idly discussing war work and accidentally passing on secrets to enemy agents . more personal and mobile than a poster , the handkerchief and the humorous cartoons on it would have been a talking point in homes and workplaces . the government feared that continued aerial bombardment could lead to a collapse in the morale of british citizens . messages that stressed the resilience of britain were used to sustain support for the war . chairman mao badges became a symbol used to support the cult of mao 's personality . the poster attacks and subverts american propaganda that promoted the idea of the democratic freedom of the west . but the art of persuasion is n't just used to convince people of government ideals , or the importance of war - it has been used for far less dramatic purposes . the green cross code updated previous crossing drills as traffic became heavier and road layouts more complex - but it was with the help of a hero clad in green that the importance of road safety was impressed on people 's minds . the green cross code man featured in comics , television advertising and public information films as part of a co-ordinated road safety campaign . the 1976 media plan shows how various audiences were targeted by different media in order to maximise impact . following the 1967 welsh language act , national campaigns increasingly appeared in welsh as well as english . curated by jude england and ian cooke , curators of social science at the british library , the exhibition explores the different ways in which the state has used propaganda to influence the thoughts and feelings of a nation . jude england , head of social sciences at the british library , says : ` we want visitors to consider the role of propaganda in their own lives today , as well as look at the state 's use of propaganda throughout history . ` that 's why , as well as displaying iconic pieces of propaganda from the library 's collections , such as posters from both world wars , the cold war and vietnam , we 'll also be focusing on more surprising examples , such as the 2012 olympics and even twitter -- things you would n't necessarily associate with a word like  propaganda  ' . the exhibition runs until september 17 at the british library , london .", "summary": " exhibition explores the ways in which states use propaganda to influence the thoughts and feelings of a nation .   british library collection of posters , scarfs and fans highlight just how insidious and creative campaigns can be .
