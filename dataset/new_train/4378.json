{"text": "the government of the small mediterranean island of malta recently announced proposals to start selling citizenship of its nation to foreigners for $ 650,000 -lrb- about $ 888,000 -rrb- . but faced with rising criticism both in malta and other european union countries , the maltese government has temporarily halted the law 's implementation and will review its requirements . the european parliament is to hold a debate on the scheme on 15 january 2014 .  the citizenship scheme as adopted by the maltese parliament in recent weeks seems to be a clear abuse of eu citizenship and schengen rules , said european people 's party chairman joseph daul .  even if the maltese give in to reason , and drop this scheme , it remains important that the european parliament debates this issue .  but malta continues to defend the program , which is said to target affluent individuals in order to boost malta 's economy , but insists :  it 's not an over-the-counter sale of citizenships , said kurt farrugia , head of communications for the maltese government .  applicants have to go through a thorough due diligence screening process , he told cnn .  we are still discussing the details and regulations and there might be amendments made , for example to the fee of $ 650,000 ,  farrugia said . the unique program , would give holders of this maltese passport a tremendous amount of liberty . unlike other similar programs in the european union , applicants for program are not obliged to live in malta before being granted a passport . instead , if the application is successful and the applicant is wealthy enough to spare the large sum , he or she will get a maltese passport -- and therefore eu citizenship -- immediately . so , the applicant could theoretically live in any of the other 27 member states of the european union . malta joined the eu in 2004 ; it is a member of the schengen borderless travel area , and has a visa waiver agreement with the united states -- all perks that would come with maltese citizenship for foreigners . maltese citizenship already allows a holder to travel to 163 countries across the globe without a visa . malta 's prime minister joseph muscat has predicted that the scheme will bring in more than $ 41 million -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- annually , and help ease the country 's deficit , while also attracting  high value  people who could potentially invest in the island . henley & partners , an international firm specializing in international immigration and citizenship law , will administer the initiative .  of course malta is trying to raise capital with the program , but it is also opening its doors to a very beneficial segment of the world population , said eric major , the company 's ceo .  many people conduct businesses abroad , but they are restricted by the passports they hold to do international travel ,  he added . the change of plan means people can register their interest in the scheme with henley & partners , but can not officially apply until the maltese government reveals its planned amendments . once the law goes into effect , applicants will have to go through a 4-tier due diligence process . after filling out the application documents , the application is reviewed on online databases , this is followed by a background check and a risk assessment which examines the applicant 's nationality , job sector and where he or she conducts business . lastly the information is verified against government databases , including cia , fbi and uk police files . previous criminal convictions , misstating or fabricating information or issues with the applicant 's source of wealth could all lead to an application being refused . in the best case scenario , henley & partners expects the whole process , from filing an application to getting a passport , to take about four to six months .  malta is taking many thorough steps in the vetting process ,  said major . major says he expected between 200 and 300 people a year to be willing to stump up the estimated $ 1.2 million -lrb- $ 850,000 -rrb- cost of applying , once processing fees and other expenses are taken into account . whether anything can be done to stop the program 's implementation , still remains to be seen . the european union said it could not interfere with citizenship decisions made by individual eu countries .  member states have full sovereignty to decide how and to whom they grant their nationality ,  said tove ernst , press officer for the european commission .  the european court of justice has on several occasions confirmed the principle of international law , that it is for each member state to lay down the conditions for the acquisition of its nationality ,  he said . simon busuttil , leader of malta 's opposition nationalist party , called the program 's passage a  black day for democracy .  some critics also claim that the program favors the super-rich and provides a fast-track entry into the european union , while foreigners with no financial means are excluded from the program . neil falzon , director of the aditus foundation , a malta-based human rights ngo , said :  many people who desperately need to come to the eu simply can not do it and the boat tragedies out at sea are witness to this ,  he said .  we have men , women and children fleeing wars and persecution who are unable to obtain legal entry to the eu simply because no embassy will grant them an entry visa .  several european union countries offer residence permits that include free movement within the schengen area , in exchange for high fees and the requirement to invest in the country , like britain 's tier 1 investor scheme for non-eu citizens with # 1 million -lrb- $ 1.6 million -rrb- or more of private funds available for investment in the uk . in contrast to other existing immigration programs , the maltese version is an expedited citizenship program .  the program is aimed at cash-rich but time-poor people . there is a growing breed of individuals who do n't have the time to be in one country for more than four months , major said , praising malta 's pm as  a visionary who sees the benefits of globalization .  read more : europe 's golden visas lure rich chinese . read more : mediterranean becoming immigrants ' ` cemetery ' read more : how illegal immigrants get into the eu .", "summary": " malta planning scheme to offer citizenship for $ 650,000 to wealthy foreigners .   maltese pm predicts scheme will bring in more than $ 30m annually .   applicants have to go through 4-tier due diligence vetting process .   rising criticism leads malta to review and possibly amend plan .
