{"text": "uncontrollable : the internet watch foundation warned that once an explicit image is posted online it can be impossible to fully remove . tens of thousands of explicit self-portraits taken by teenagers are ending up on websites viewed by paedophiles . the naked or sexual pictures are often taken by girls at the request of boys in their classes and sent by mobile phone , in a practice known as ` sexting ' . but unbeknown to the girls , these photographs may end up being passed around the school and even shared on social networking sites such as facebook -- then stolen and published on websites used by paedophiles . an earlier investigation found boys and girls as young as 13 are routinely swapping naked self-portraits . now watchdog the internet watch foundation has warned that many of these pictures are ending up online . susie hargreaves , chief executive of the charity , said ` self-generated ' pictures of children are now a major source of images used on websites viewed by paedophiles . in a search lasting just 40 hours , one of her analysts found 12,224 self-generated images of teenagers on 70 paedophilic websites . given the speed of the investigation , the true number of stolen pictures is likely to be far higher . at a fringe event at the conservative party conference , miss hargreaves said she would like to see children taught about the dangers of sexting at school , so they understand that they might never be able to remove every copy of a picture or video that ends up online . ` from our perspective , the younger people know about the risks , the better for us , ' she said , adding : ` take the issue of sexting -- we do n't like the word , but we did a small piece of research last year . ` one analyst spent 40 hours -- that 's all , 40 hours -- and every time they came across a self-generated image which had been stolen and put on a paedophilic website , they counted it . in 40 hours they found 12,200 self-generated images . ` these are images one teenager had taken of themselves or another teenager shared , which had probably gone around the school and somewhere along the process had been stolen , uploaded and that 's it . ' miss hargreaves also warned that older teenagers could themselves be in contravention of child abuse laws if they send or receive naked pictures -- because the law says any such pictures of children under 18 can constitute abuse . she said : ` one of the things that older young people are not aware is that if you 're 16 or 17 you might think you are over the age of consent , but if you take an image it 's still child sexual abuse because it 's an image of someone under 18 . there are so many risks they 're not aware of . ' children told the iwf that sexting is now considered ` mundane and mainstream ' . one . girl said she was asked for naked pictures ` at least two or three times . a week ' . another said : ` one explicit image i took ... is coming up on the . first page of -lsb- search engines -rsb- , which could jeopardise any future . career i have or if any family or friends come across it . ' emma mcclarkin , a tory mep for the . east midlands , said : ` if your daughter allows one picture of herself to . get shared by a friend to a friend who then lets it go on , that picture . can get stolen on so many multiple sites that it 's impossible to ever . get it off . ' danger : a third of people who sent ` sexts ' said they went to people they had met only online , while 15 per cent had sent images to total strangers -lrb- posed by model -rrb- . nspcc chief executive peter wanless said : ` these images are illegal , as they effectively constitute indecent images of children , and it 's now becoming clear that adult sex offenders are getting hold of them . ` we urge all parents to discuss the risks with their children . ' the daily mail has been campaigning for an automatic block on online porn to protect children . over-18s would be able to see adult images only if they ` opt-in ' after going through stringent age verification .", "summary": " internet watch foundation warned how many explicit images are uploaded .   they are often self-portraits by schoolgirls under pressure from boys .   research by the foundation unearthed 12,000 images in just 40 hours .
