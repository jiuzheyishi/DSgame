{"text": "he is the face of terror . a ruthless leader with a twisted ideology . and the sadistic architect of a campaign of mayhem and misery . and yet , very little is known about abubakar shekau , the leader of boko haram . he operates in the shadows , leaving his underlings to orchestrate his repulsive mandates . he resurfaces every once in a while in videotaped messages to mock the impotence of the nigerian military . and he uses his faith to recruit the impressionable and the disenfranchised to his cause . he 's a religious scholar . shekau was born in shekau village that borders niger . he studied under a cleric and then attended borno state college of legal and islamic studies for higher studies on islam . that 's why he 's also known as ` darul tawheed , ' which translates to an expert in monotheism , or the oneness of allah . he 's a polyglot . he speaks several languages fluently : hausa , fulani , kanuri and arabic . but english is n't one of them . after all , he heads a group that rejects all things western . he 's elusive . even his age is unknown -- estimates range between 38 and 49 . the u.s. state department has shekau 's year of birth listed as 1965 , 1969 and 1975 . he 's a loner . analysts describe shekau as a loner and a master of disguise . he does not speak directly with members , opting to communicate through a few select confidants . he uses many aliases : abu bakr skikwa , imam abu bakr shiku and abu muhammad abu bakr bin muhammad al shakwi al muslimi bishku among them . he was an unruly no. 2 . boko haram was founded by mohammed yusuf , a charismatic , well-educated cleric who drove a mercedes as part of his push for a pure islamic state in nigeria . he was n't too effective as a leader and had a hard time keeping his second-in-command in check . shekau was more radical and had grander designs . ... and merciless as no. 1 . mohammed yusuf was killed in a security crackdown in 2009 , along with about 700 of his followers . that left shekau in charge . he vowed to strike back , and his group has spared no one : government workers , police officers , journalists , villagers , students and churchgoers . human rights watch estimates that in the past five years , more than 3,000 people have been killed . he 's come back from the dead . the nigerian military has touted shekau 's death several times , only to retract its claim after he appeared alive and vibrant in propaganda videos . they almost got him in september 2012 when they raided his home , where he had snuck in for his six-day-old baby 's naming ceremony , according to the international crisis group . he managed to get away with a gunshot wound to the leg ; his wife and three children were taken by the military . he uses islam to recruit and radicalize . the northeast , where boko haram has been most active , is economically depressed and among the least educated regions in nigeria . shekau has done a good job of convincing residents that the powers in abuja are corrupt and a better system of government would be a strict enforcement of islamic sharia law across nigeria . and his promise , coupled with a weapon and a license to plunder , has been enticing to hundreds of young men . ... and the government 's response is n't helping . the central government 's heavy-handed and frequently untargeted anti-terrorism campaign has just helped create more members to sustain boko haram . the country 's own human rights commission last year accused the military of arbitrary killings , torture and rape in its campaign against the group . this makes for fertile territory for boko haram . he 's exporting his brand of terror . there 's no firm evidence as yet that boko haram has ambitions beyond nigeria . but its campaign of terror has spilled into remote parts of cameroon and it appears to have informal links with militant islamist groups in mali and niger . he 's made good on his brutal threat . it was in may 2013 that shekau first announced in a video that boko haram would start kidnapping girls . the kidnappings , he said , were retaliation for nigerian security forces nabbing the wives and children of group members . the most horrifying instance was last month 's abduction of 276 girls from a girl 's school .  i abducted your girls ,  he taunted with a chilling smile in a new video that surfaced this week .  there is a market for selling humans . allah says i should sell . he commands me to sell .  there 's a $ 7 million bounty on his head . shekau has been on the radar of u.s. officials since he came to power in 2009 . last june , the united states put a bounty on him , offering a reward of up to $ 7 million for information leading to his location . ... but that 's yet to yield results . here 's why , says cnn 's chief international correspondent christiane amanpour :  -lrb- african warlord -rrb- joseph kony 's had a bounty for years and years . even with the ` stop kony ' video that went viral , nothing has happened to get joseph kony -- even though it 's about the only thing in africa that the united states has committed some forces and some intelligence to .  osama bin laden was not given up because of the $ 25 million bounty . and who knows whether this will be the case .  in nigeria , the mass abduction of schoolgirls is n't shocking . why terror group kidnaps schoolgirls , and what happens next . 6 reasons why the world should demand action .", "summary": " analysts describe shekau as a loner and a master of disguise .   when he came to power , he vowed to strike back against the military .   he uses islam to recruit the disenfranchised .   the u.s. has placed a bounty on his head .
