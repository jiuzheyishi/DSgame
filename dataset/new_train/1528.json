{"text": "in may 2009 euphoria swept through spain as fc barcelona won the uefa champions league . following this event , reports predicted the win would spark a baby boom in spain and now scientists have confirmed that the number of births in february 2010 did indeed rise , by 16 per cent . there was also an 11 per cent increase seen in births in march 2010 , which the scientists claim may have still been a knock-on effect of the win . spanish researchers analysed birth data at maternity centres in catalonia from before and after fc barcelona won the title in may , 2009 . it found a 16 % increase in february 2010 , nine months after the event , compared to births in february in previous and later years -lrb- marked by grey squares -rrb- . initial reports in spain claimed the birth rate following the champions league win had spiked by 45 per cent , which has now been disproved . following , the 1965 blackout in the northeast united states , the new york times published four consecutive articles reporting a 30 per cent increase in the birth rates of five hospitals in manhattan . however , in 1970 , research found that there had actually been a 20 to 25 per cent decline in births rather than an increase . following world war ii , reports claim that between 1946 and 1964 the number of annual births exceeded two per 100 women - which worked at approximately 2 per cent of the global population at that time . the children born during this time have been dubbed ` the iniesta generation ' , named after andres iniesta who scored the winning goal . the initial 45 per cent claims were considered to be so high , scientists at the althaia clinical center in the catalan region of bages wanted to confirm this . the researchers began by analysing birth data between 2007 and 2012 at two maternity centres in manresa , capital of bages . as well as being home to the clinic , bages was also the birthplace of josep guardiola who was the barcelona manager at the time of the champions league win . the researchers found that births in this catalan region rose by 16 per cent in february 2010 and 11 per cent in march , compared to previous and later years . however , other sporting wins did not generate such a boom . the researchers actually saw a drop . in birth rate towards the end of 2010 , despite the fact barcelona also . won the supercopa de espana in august 2009 and spain won the world cup in december . 2009 . the children born during this time have been dubbed the iniesta generation , named after barcelona player andres iniesta , pictured , who scored the winning goal against chelsea . initial reports in spain claimed the birth rate following this win had spiked by 45 per cent , which has now been disproved . this may have been caused by the economic crisis in the country at the same time , claim the authors . ` in summary , our results may have several different interpretations , ' said the researchers in their paper ` barcelona baby boom : does sporting success affect birth rate ? ' ` one is that human emotions on a large scale can profoundly affect demographic swings in populations , that national or regional events can reduce the weight of reason and increase the weight of passion . ` validation of our results could contribute to a better understanding of human behaviour , improve healthcare planning , and even aid government policy makers in stimulating or reducing birth rates . ` ideally , to bridge the gap between observational and trial data , it would help greatly if iniesta were willing to replicate his intervention -- although the cost of such a study could be prohibitive , not to mention harmful to the reference group -lrb- chelsea -rrb- . ' aside from the baby boom in february , comparative birth rates declined in the second half of 2012 . this was despite the fact spain also won the world cup in december 2009 . the researchers claimed this may have been due to the economic crisis in the country .", "summary": " in may 2009 , fc barcelona won the uefa champions league .   initial reports claimed that birth rates following this event rose by 45 % .   however , research from has now confirmed this increase was 16 % .   they compared the change in birth rates from 2007 to 2012 .   these children have been dubbed ` the iniesta generation ' after winning goal scorer andres iniesta .
