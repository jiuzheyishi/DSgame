{"text": "one of the problems with american politics is that it is falling prey to sideshows . issues that really do n't matter -- from the war on christmas to anything sarah palin said recently -- are given headline space above things that really do . and too often the things that do n't matter are about semantics ; someone says something innocent and the entire media explodes in horror . step forward megyn kelly , one of those hyper-glamorous fox anchors who deliver the news dressed for dinner . kelly hosted a segment in reaction to an article by aisha harris on slate , in which harris complained that a white santa is stigmatizing and suggested he be replaced by a race-neutral penguin -lrb- at the risk of excluding polar bears -rrb- . in the course of the fox segment , kelly addressed the audience directly and said ,  santa just is white .  she went on to assert ,  jesus was a white man , too . it 's like we have , he 's a historical figure that 's a verifiable fact , as is santa , i just want kids to know that . how do you revise it in the middle of the legacy in the story and change santa from white to black ?  the world went mad . accusations of fox starting a race war flew around . msnbc commentators pointed out that jesus was certainly not white ; one of them even wrote an emotional letter to santa pleading for more tolerance . saturday night live came up with the inevitable skit of an african-american santa saying he is  as black as hell .  opinion : santa 's color is n't the important thing . all of which need n't have happened if kelly 's critics had watched the video and cut her some slack . the segment is jokey and she opened it by speaking to the kids at home , which is why she repeatedly reassured the audience that santa is  real  -lrb- no one over 10 years old is that naive -rrb- . at first she dismissed harris ' argument as unnecessary and odd , but then actually came around to endorsing its sentiments , noting that it must indeed be painful to grow up in a culture surrounded by white idols . as for her assertion that santa is white , her point was that he is universally depicted that way in popular culture . so , too , is jesus , although it was ignorant of kelly to imply that this is historically verifiable . likewise , i suspect the entire segment would not have drawn such controversy if fox had bothered to invite a single person of color to appear on the panel . there was a gross lack of sensitivity on display . all in all , megyn kelly is guilty of using lazy language . the debate surrounding her remarks is a classic example of the u.s. media talking to itself , of point scoring against competitors dressed up as serious political debate . both the left and the right do it . teacher to student : you ca n't be santa -- you 're black . for example , al sharpton and bill o'reilly have a long-running grudge that erupted again last week when sharpton accused o'reilly of trying to  disparage  nelson mandela . on the right , of course , fox is no angel -- just take a look at the almost comical imbalance of its coverage of typhoon haiyan versus the problems facing obamacare . fox regularly obsesses about msnbc 's ratings , what its anchors say , as well as standard  liberals are trying to destroy the world  fare like killing christmas . often , there is an unwillingness to show charity toward opponents . when michelle obama suggested that sometimes it might be best if kids skip dessert , sarah palin parodied this as an authoritarian crackdown on liberty and openly fed her children s'mores on tv to make her point . palin misinterpreted obama 's advice as an order ; and much of the media misinterpreted palin 's joke as a serious statement . the original meaning and intent of the words that people used were largely forgotten in pursuit of a frivolous debate . the reality is that for millions of americans these issues do n't matter one bit . they 're too busy worrying about debt , taxes and the war on terror . the most common reaction to the  controversy  over santa 's skin color would probably be ,  i do n't care .  after all , he is not real . but unemployment , lack of health care , and terrorism , sadly , are real life issues . can we discuss something real , please ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of timothy stanley .", "summary": " fox anchor megyn kelly causes an uproar when she says santa is just white .   timothy stanley : can we discuss something real , please ?   he says issues that do n't matter are given headline space above things that do .   stanley : american media and politics fall prey to sideshows too readily .
