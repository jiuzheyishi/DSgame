'  his father told him he was talking about aeg live ceo randy phillips and his ex-manager , dr. tohme tohme , prince said . prince , 16 , began his testimony wednesday morning in his family 's wrongful death lawsuit against jackson 's last concert promoter , aeg live . his first 30 minutes on the stand were filled with videos and photographs of jackson with his children , but then the questioning by jackson lawyer brian panish focused on the last weeks of his father 's life . prince testified that phillips visited jackson 's rented los angeles mansion and spoke aggressively to dr. conrad murray the night before his father 's death .  he was grabbing his elbow ,  prince said .  it looked aggressive to me . he was grabbing by the back of his elbow and they were really close and he was making hand motions .  he could n't hear what phillips was saying to murray , he said . michael jackson was not there because he was at his last rehearsal , prince said . he called his father from the security guard shack telephone to let him know phillips was there . his father asked him to offer phillips food and drink . prince said that was his last conversation with his father .  sorry kids , your dad 's dead  prince recounted the day his father died four years ago . he saw his father  hanging halfway off the bed , his eyes were rolled back ,  when he ran into the bedroom where dr. murray was doing cpr in a futile effort to revive him , he said . paris followed him up the stairs ,  but we kept pulling her down the stair ,  he said .  she was screaming the whole time saying she wants her daddy ,  he said . at the hospital later , dr. murray told them  sorry kids , your dad 's dead ,  prince testified . prince was 12 when the pop icon died , but he said his father confided in him about whom he trusted and did n't trust and what he feared as he prepared for his comeback concerts . michael jackson 's three children -- prince , paris and blanket -- and their grandmother katherine jackson are plaintiffs in the lawsuit , which contends aeg live is liable in jackson 's death because the company hired , retained or supervised murray , the doctor convicted of involuntary manslaughter . murray told investigators he gave jackson nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat his insomnia . the coroner ruled the singer died of an overdose of the drug . aeg live executives allegedly created a medical conflict of interest that pressured murray to pursue the dangerous treatments so jackson would be rested for rehearsals , while ignoring warning signs that his health was failing , jackson family lawyers argue . aeg live lawyers contend that it was jackson who chose and controlled the doctor and that company executives had no way of knowing what treatments murray was delivering . prince jackson 's 16th birthday gift : a career . aeg live lead lawyer marvin putnam 's cross-examination of prince lasted just 25 minutes . it centered on trying to discredit his testimony about phillips ' visit to his home and about cash payments that prince said his father gave murray at times . prince stood by his story about the phillips and murray encounter , although he conceded it could have been two nights before his father 's death and not the last night . the toll of losing their father . prince 's testimony gave jackson lawyers a chance to show jurors the emotional toll suffered by jackson 's children , which they would have to put a dollar figure on if they conclude aeg live is liable in their father 's death .  i ca n't sleep at night ,  prince said .  i have a hard time sleeping .  the death left him  emotionally distant from a lot of people  for a while , he said . he 's missed sharing with his father  the first day of going to school , having the first girlfriend , being able to drive ,  prince testified . while paris jackson 's suicide attempt and hospitalization was not brought up in court -- and it is unclear if jurors learned about it in the news -- prince did speak about his sister .  i think out of all of my siblings she was probably hit the hardest because she was my dad 's princess ,  he said . prince said the questioning of paris by aeg live lawyers over two days in march was painful for her .  she had some problems before , after and , i assume , during ,  he said .  she definitely is dealing with it in her own way ,  her brother said . paris , who was 11 when her father died , is not available to testify in person in court because she is hospitalized for psychiatric treatment . while he and his sister no longer want to celebrate birthdays because  it 's not the same without  their father , blanket , now 11 , does , prince said .  right now , i do n't know if blanket realizes what he lost ,  he said .  he was so young . he is still growing up just like i am and he does n't have a father to guide him .  aeg live attempted to compel blanket , the youngest child , to testify , but the judge rejected its request after a psychologist said it would harm the boy . changing the world ? jurors watched a home video of michael jackson questioning his three children about how they planned  to change the world  when they grow up . prince testified that the video was made at christmas .  what 's christmas mean ?  jackson is heard asking his children .  love ,  blanket responded .  who 's blanket going to be to change this world ?  jackson asked .  i do n't know ,  blanket , who appeared to be about 5 at the time , answered .  what does paris want to do ? be honest search your heart ,

out as much as you can ,  prince said . the jury was shown video of jackson and his children at the neverland ranch where they lived until moving after jackson was acquitted in a child molestation
