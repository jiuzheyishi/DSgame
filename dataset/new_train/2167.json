{"text": "why the hell would anyone drink two liters of beer at 6 in the morning before running with wild animals through the streets of a strange city ? this was the first of many questions i posed to myself upon dusting off a journal from 1997 , the year i -lrb- kind of -rrb- ran with the bulls in pamplona , spain . i went looking for the journal after photographer clint alwahab and i were assigned to cover a rendition of pamplona 's famed festival de san fermin in conyers , georgia . this was n't pamplona . that was apparent as soon as we arrived at conyers ' georgia international horse park , a far cry from pamplona , where the  encierro  is run on a half-mile of cobblestone streets through town . there 's a good deal more pageantry in pamplona , as you might expect , with the rockets , or txupinazo , counting down to the running , the giants and big heads parade and afternoon bullfights . conyers had free beef jerky . but was it ever going to measure up ? relying on a journal from a seemingly constantly inebriated 22-year-old , i realized that outside of bulls and beer , the events are nothing alike . -lrb- author 's note : many of the revelations in the aforementioned journal were long forgotten by the writer until it was discovered in his home office last week . unless otherwise noted , all quotes are from the journal . -rrb- . the purpose . the great bull run is nakedly a for-profit event . it will visit nine more cities between now and august before returning to the atlanta area in october 2014 . upcoming locations . to merely spectate cost $ 10 , while running alongside the bovine herd cost anywhere between $ 45 and $ 75 . those enchanted by the experience could run again for $ 25 . this is n't to say pamplona is n't a moneymaker . there just is n't a fee for anyone bold/dumb enough to get in the street with bulls , but the encierro is still a major cash cow for pamplona -lrb- terrible pun intended -rrb- . pamplona 's infrastructure is so unequipped to handle its san fermin visitors , which can quadruple the city 's population , that makeshift shops and beer stands pop up all over town . the hotels are booked far in advance , so my cohorts and i  walked down to the park -lrb- vuelta del castillo -rrb- and found a nice corner under a tree where we 'd reside for the weekend .  the park was packed with revelers , most of them charming , but one who  was sniffing cocaine off of a paper plate  and another  bastard who tried to pick -lrb- my pal 's -rrb- pocket while we were sleeping .  taking in all the revelry was great fun , but sleeping in the park took its toll , as washing up in a plaza fountain over a long weekend left me feeling  like i 'd been dipped in mayonnaise .  but i digress . the purpose , as it were , for the festival is to honor the patron saint fermin . it dates back to the middle ages , as opposed to 2013 for conyers , and many locals told us at the time that fermin was killed and dragged through the streets of pamplona by bulls . it appears he was actually beheaded . which also sucks . getting there . traveling to conyers involved driving 25 miles east of the city in a saturn . done and done . pamplona , however , required a hellish trek after a language barrier resulted in us showing up two hours late for the express train . the slow train took 10 hours to make the 250-mile trip from salamanca , where i was attending school . fortunately , it had a bar car where we imbibed cruzcampos and carlsbergs before returning to our train car for a siesta . we continued our naps in the castejon train station , where during a two-hour layover , i awoke to find  a guy with a mohawk and a safety pin through his cheek who had decided to micturate on the floor of the train station .  on the last leg , we hopped a  train full of ... spaniards who sang all the way to pamplona ,  then caught a bus downtown to find  -lrb- expletives -rrb- partying like it was dec. 31 , 1999 .  the bulls . the conyers bulls were pansies . this is n't merely my observation . not only did they have the ends of their horns shorn off -lrb- the tips of a pamplonan bull 's horns resemble pitchforks -rrb- , but they 're also a good deal smaller than the spanish species .  more like running with goats ,  said a man named frankie , laughing and beer in hand .  i think if a bull hits me , i might do more damage to him .  glenn gentle , 72 , a retired navy diver who has been to pamplona eight times since 2000 , told me a bull broke three of his ribs in 2004 .  i just was in the way , i guess ,  he said .  it 's hard to escape over there .  after the conyers run , gentle seemed unfazed that the bridge of his nose was bloody and most of the skin was missing from one of his elbows . he said he did n't know whether a bull or the crowd ran him over --  it was awful hard  -- but he expressed relief he 'd taken a tumble on a horse track rather than pamplona 's cobblestone streets . still , the  adrenaline junkie  was unimpressed with the conyers bulls ' ferocity .  in pamplona , those bulls are bred at a special place in the south of spain to be mean and aggressive . the bulls there will look for you and run you down ,  he said . the actual running . as the bulls and their white-and-red-clad entourage galloped toward pamplona 's plaza del toros , the streets trembled . wooden fences separated the bulls from spectators , and red cross paramedics were stationed along them to tend to injured runners . as the bulls neared -- and i saw how big these beasts actually were -- i chickened out and sought refuge behind the fence , the crowd erupting in glee as they thundered past . once the bulls and runners blew by the clock tower where i was catching my breath ,  i jumped the fence to find my amigos . all of a sudden , everyone screamed and darted for the fence . a wee bit dazed , i turned around to see a million-pound bull standing 20 feet from me .  the sight apparently conjured my catholic upbringing as  i hit the wall of people like a battering ram , asking god 's forgiveness for all my sins , as i desperately tried to swim over the people and the red cross fence .  where pamplona 's streets were narrower , offering few options for escape , the conyers event was run on a wide , dirt track with several nooks in the steel gating . i jogged on the fringe of the conyers running , experiencing virtually none of the raw fear that had possessed me 16 years before . as the bulls neared , i dipped into one of the nooks and watched , amused , as the cattle passed . the grand finale . the conyers running was capped by an enormous tomato fight , which is reminiscent of another spanish festival , la tomatina in buÃ ± ol . i 've never been . they basically dumped 50,000 pounds of tomatoes in a parking lot and let attendees have at it . it was hilarious watching participants emerge , covered in seeds and red tomato excrement . the pamplona running happens every morning for eight days and culminates in a series of bullfights . the runners and bulls spill from calle estafeta into the stadium , where the bulls are corralled . runners scramble around the bullfighting ground tussling with smaller bulls , which were described to me as babies .  these were not babies . the baby had a three-foot rack and was flipping full-grown humans through the air with ease .  after watching the spectacle for about 20 minutes or so , we left the stadium and  found a nice plot of grass in front of the stadium to take a nap . when we woke up , we made our way to one of the makeshift bars and drank aguila .  conversely , in conyers , clint and i hopped in the saturn and drove back to atlanta . i made it home just in time for the auburn game .
