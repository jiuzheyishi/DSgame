{"text": "from the forest elephants of africa , to india 's tigers and even our own great white sharks , wildlife is losing the battle for survival all over the world . human activity has been blamed for the plummet in numbers , as the united states reports dwindling populations of bumblebees and polar bears - and one of the world 's biggest decreases in sealife . our ever-growing need for land and resources , coupled with hunting and poaching , has halved the number of wild animals in world in just 40 years , according to a shocking report . the living planet report by wwf and the zoological society of london has found that wildlife populations around the globe have declined by 52 per cent on average since 1970 . the authors compiled data on 10,380 animal populations , including 3,038 different species , as an index to judge how global wildlife is faring as a whole . in the us , fish have decreased by 83 per cent between 1970 and 2010 - the second largest drop after latin america which lost 86 per cent in the same period . american amphibians have also struggled in the modern world , with an overall decline of 73 per cent recorded , while the total number of reptiles dropped by 48 per cent nationwide . the great white shark is one of the united states ' worst-affected species , having lost around 50 per cent of its population in just 20 years , largely due to oil spills in the ocean . endangered : the population of great white sharks has decreased by around 50 per cent in just 20 years due to a number of factors including oil spills in the ocean . worldwide problem : the common sight of monarch butterflies could soon be a distant memory as the population has plummeted almost 90 per cent in just 20 years . little brown bats continue to plummet in numbers due to white-nose syndrome , which has killed seven million since 2006 . in some states , the population has decreased by 99 per cent . the syndrome infects the bat 's body causing its organs to go cold and its heart to slow . experts are still struggling to determine the cause . the number of rusty-patched bumblebees - crucial pollinators - haven disappeared from 87 per cent of their territory in the past 25 years , and monarch butterflies are down 90 per cent in the same period . the global picture is worst for freshwater creatures such as amphibians , river fish and mammals , with average population declines of 76 per cent between 1970 and 2010 , says the latest data available . land-dwelling animals declined by 39 per cent over the same period and sea creatures fell 39 per cent , the report found . the authors said the main threats to wildlife are loss or damage to their habitat and exploitation through hunting and fishing . closer to home : animals are dying out across the united states too , including the mountain yellow-legged frog , which has been threatened by farming on its habitat . crucial : the rusty-patched bumblebee is a key pollinator in the ecosystem but it has disappeared from 87 % of its territories due to disease and pesticides . they also warned that humans are using resources faster than the planet can provide , cutting down forests too quickly , overfishing and pumping out pollution faster than the world can cope with it . around 3.9 planets-worth of land and resources would be needed to sustain the typical american lifestyle as it is today for an extended period of time . kuwaitis had the biggest ecological footprint , meaning they consume and waste more resources per head than any other nation , the report said , followed by qatar and the united arab emirates . america came eighth in the list , behind denmark , belgium , trinidad and tobago , and singapore . professor ken norris , director of science at zoological society of london -lrb- zsl -rrb- , said : ` the scale of biodiversity loss and damage to the very ecosystems that are essential to our existence is alarming . this damage is not inevitable , but a consequence of the way we choose to live . ' david nussbaum , chief executive of wwf-uk , said : ` the scale of destruction highlighted in this report should be a wake-up call to us all . we all have an interest , and a responsibility , to act to ensure we protect what we all value : a healthy future for both people and nature . ' under the sea : the threat to our wildlife is not just limited to land animals - the short-nosed common dolphin and leatherback turtle are also dying out . mr nussbaum said consumers could reduce their impact on wildlife by choosing products which were sustainable , for example fish with the marine stewardship council and timber with the forest stewardship council certifications . he said that they could also look at reducing their meat and dairy consumption . professor jonathan baillie , director of conservation programmes at zsl , said people should think about everything they do , from recycling to putting pressure on political and industry leaders , and getting their children outside to reconnect with nature .", "summary": " mankind 's need for land and resources , combined with hunting and poaching , are causing our wild animals to die out .   wildlife populations around the globe have declined by 52 per cent on average since 1970 , a new report has found .   the likes of forest elephants , african lions and tigers are under threat , as well as american sharks .   lion numbers dropped 90 % in 40 years , tigers by 97 % in 100 years and elephants 60 % since 2002 , wwf reported .
