{"text": "chelsea fans might doubt whether fernando torres will have much of an impact on the coming world cup . but the spain centre-forward has made a habit over recent years - at international level at least - of proving his critics wrong . when atletico madrid 's diego costa was declared fit to make the final 23 man squad it seemed likely that torres , who is also now set to be replaced by costa at club level , would miss out on brazil . the now 30 year old was however included -- and now travels to try and win his fourth consecutive international tournament . point to prove : fernando torres -lrb- centre -rrb- goes into this world cup with question marks about his form . fancy footwork : torres -lrb- centre -rrb- tries to spectacularly flick the ball away from spanish team-mate koke -lrb- left -rrb- . practice makes perfect : torres shoots at goal during a break in training with spain this week . that is quite some record - especially considering that for many supporters in england torres has long been a busted flush . serious thigh and knee injuries meant he was already on the decline at liverpool before his move to chelsea in january 2010 . since then eight blues managers have tried - and failed - to spark a return to the form which persuaded roman abramovich to pay the huge 50 million fee . spain coach vicente del bosque has been more patient than most but even he had lost faith by february 2012 . torres - who had gone 20 chelsea games without a goal - was then dropped for spain 's final friendly before the squad was named for that summer 's european championship finals in poland and ukraine . a few months later the situation had changed again . del bosque 's first choice david villa had not recovered from a broken leg . torres had also scored at barcelona 's camp nou on the way to winning that season 's champions league . so ` el ni√±o ' went to poland and ukraine , . where he started just two games . but still scored four times and ended . the tournament with both another winners ' medal and the ` golden boot ' . lethal : torres scores past gianluigi buffon as spain beat italy 4-0 to triumph euro 2012 . this time around the story looks pretty similar . torres has not had a good campaign at club level , with current stamford bridge boss jose mourinho clearly not a fan . and the now 30 year old was not picked in any international squad during the 2013/14 season , with costa , fernando llorente , alvaro negredo and last summer 's big tottenham signing roberto soldado all rated better by del bosque . that was until fate again intervened - costa was hamstrung , negredo and soldado woefully off-form , and llorente not seen as a fit with spain 's tiki-taka style . leading the way : diego costa is expected to start up front for spain during the world cup . look away now : torres -lrb- right -rrb- has struggled for form and goals this season with chelsea . so torres returned for last friday 's warm-up friendly against bolivia in seville , where he snatched at a number of presentable goal chances , but also converted a penalty to move to 37 goals in 107 international caps . the following morning he was confirmed in spain 's squad for the tournament . it still seems most likely that cesc fabregas will be spain 's central attacker for their opener against holland in curitiba on june 13 . costa looks first choice should del bosque opt for a traditional number nine later in the tournament . but given past experience nobody should bet against torres making another mark at some point over the next six weeks .", "summary": " thirty-year-old chelsea striker has struggled for form this season .   torres faces competition from diego costa to start for spain .   proved critics wrong by winning golden boot at euro 2012 .
