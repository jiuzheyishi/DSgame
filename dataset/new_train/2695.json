{"text": "nothing says you 've made it in life or business quite like the glamor of a yacht or private jet . these extravagant toys of the rich and famous are perhaps the ultimate in status symbols , good for business and a comforting boost to the ego of their wealthy proprietors . the only problem is attaining one of these stylish items has traditionally required a shed-load of cash preceded by a healthy dose of success -- but that is n't necessarily the case anymore . an increasing number of people are pooling their resources to buy up and then share grandiose luxury products like yachts and private jets through fractional ownership initiatives .  it 's great to bring clients and business contacts on the boat because the boat is a place more small ... more intimate ,  yacht owner dino ballestra told cnn . ballestra previously owned his vessel outright but recently sold off a 75 % stake to other investors , keeping the remaining 25 % for himself .  because the costs of running a boat are very high i 'm looking to share the pleasure of the boat with a group ,  he explained . see also : are piloteless jets within reach . fractional ownership models like those employed by ballestra work upon the basic principle that things you do n't use all the time are worth splitting costs over . the concept was first introduced to the field of luxury travel in the 1980 's by forward-thinking firms such as netjets , who brought together buyers to purchase private jets using a time-share-like model . today , internet savvy companies such as flyvictor have constructed their own market-based version of the fractional ownership model .  we 're helping the industry to become more efficient by allowing owners to charter their aircraft through the victor platform and allowing people who want to charter a jet -- not own a jet -- and take all the benefits of flying private to and from destinations ,  explained flyvictor founder , clive jackson . flyvictor 's website acts as a forum where owners or co-owners can advertise their jets for charter or hire . those looking to fly solo or band together with fellow travelers meanwhile can browse to see what 's on offer . customers are never guaranteed to get exactly what they are after but if they 're lucky they may be able to pick up a bargain .  everyone likes to do deals , particularly the ultra high-net-worths , so if they can find an empty aircraft flying back for $ 50,000 dollars then why not , and if they ca n't they 'll book a full fare aircraft ,  said jackson . see also : luxury jet makers take the long view . these same principles of savings and efficiency are at the core of yachting company , monocle , which aims to bring fractional ownership to the high seas . according to monocle president , loren simkowitz , sharing guarantees the benefits of ownership without the hassle and expense of full management .  it 's the high cost ... that drives people out of yachting ,  he said .  most people use -lrb- a yacht they purchase -rrb- three to four weeks a year . the rest of the time it sits around as an idle asset depreciating . you spend more time managing the boat than your business ,  he added . with an increasing number of high-net-worth individuals looking to save money where they can , simkowitz believes those opting for fractional ownership plans will only increase in the coming years .  i think it 's the wave of the future ,  he continued .  people are much more fiscally prudent with their money . people do n't want to be tied down to an asset they use infrequently . they 're smarter than they were in 2000 ,  he added .", "summary": " fractional ownership initiatives are making some expensive luxury items more affordable .   the concept sees people pool their resources to share the likes of yachts and private jets .   flyvictor and monocle are two companies helping consumers to employ the concept .
