{"text": "way back when , relationships and friendships between co-workers were , not so common , a majority instead opting for the more professional dealings with their colleagues . but it seems times have changed and in a big way , as our private and professional lives become more intertwined , social media taking down the barriers as we connect with colleagues both online and offline outside of work . a nation wide survey by jobs platform oneshift has found that a vast majority of australian workers now do n't actually mind being friends with workers on social media . it found 79 per cent thought it was appropriate to be friends with their co-workers on facebook and instagram . a nationwide survey found 79 per cent thought it was appropriate to be friends with their co-workers on facebook and instagram . majority of people are becoming friends with colleagues at work . surprisingly , the majority , 63 per cent , said this did not affect what they posted about or the photos they shared , even if they were n't so work appropriate . 63 per cent , said having colleagues on social media did not affect what they posted about or the photos they shared . ' i think people are connecting in different ways , ' said founder and ceo of oneshift 's gen george . ` back then , there were no smart phones or social media but now it 's normal for people to skype , have 24/7 instant chats which allows for a lot faster pace environment . ' ` it 's not your usual 9 to 5 job anymore . ' ms george says 20 years ago the norm was people going to work , seeing their colleagues and then going home , living a very separate work life and personal life , but now everything is integrated . ` the more you look at gen y people , they are receptive to putting things on line , ' she said . ` it 's acceptable growing up with the connection of social media , colleagues have a different perception when they have n't grown up with it . ' but our affection for our colleagues extends far beyond social media with 64 per cent also saying they socialise with their co-workers outside of work . ` we are spending more time with colleagues and becoming more part of their life , we 're embracing it . ' and while there was always the advice of not ` going there ' while at work , it seems in many instances , affections between colleagues have become more than just platonic . more than 40 per cent have admitted to dating a co-worker and the good news for those wanting to jump into a work romance , it 's been found you wo n't be judged too harshly among your work peers . almost 80 per cent of those surveyed said they would n't feel uncomfortable if two of their colleagues were dating , although 10 per cent said they kept a long relationship with a colleague secret . more than 40 per cent have admitted to dating a co-worker and the good news for those wanting to jump into a work romance it 's mostly ok with work peers . a group of work mates getting together to run a marathon . some workplaces feel creating friends at work means people want to come to work more because they enjoy it . it was also found more than 6 in 10 australian workers like to have a drink with their colleagues . ms george , said the strong relationships formed at work are an inevitable result of a new work culture that no longer recognises the separation of our work life from our private life , but that this should n't be viewed negatively . ` if someone is expected to respond to emails on their smartphone or the company 's social media channel at 10.30 at night , then the office has already invaded the home , ' she said . ` it 's no surprise then that with those walls breaking down , we 're more comfortable socialising with colleagues outside of work , whether that 's online , at the local pub or cinema after work , or at the beach on the weekend . ' and while some would be hesitant to get too involved with their co-workers , ms george says a more social workplace should be encouraged . ` work life balance is key , but that concept is taking on a new meaning today . it 's all part of the attitude of working to live , rather than living to work . ' ` you should love what you do , and enjoy the people you work with . rather than aiming for that distinct separation of the two , we should be looking at how work fits into the rest of your life . ' a survey by oneshift has found our private and professional lives become more intertwined , social media taking down the barriers as we connect with colleagues both online and offline outside of work . almost 80 per cent of those surveyed said they would n't feel uncomfortable if two of their colleagues were dating , although 10 per cent said they kept a long relationship with a colleague secret . the showpo fashion team hanging out together outside of work . ` the friendships you have with your colleagues are important not only to your own success , but to the success of the business and should be encouraged by employers , ' said ms george . jane lu , founder of showpo fashion says her team at work are all facebook friends . ` our team supports everyone with extra curriculum lifestyles , we have nothing to hide form each other , ' she said . she says most people these days are well aware of what to post and what not to post . ' i think you 'd have to be stupid to chuck a sickie and post that you 're on the beach . ' with a small team of eight , she says that gets along so well people want to come to work , because otherwise they are creating more work for other people . the showpo fashion team even plan and take holidays together and spend plenty of time out of work hanging out . ` have friday night drinks every week , holidays together , get togethers , it 's important we have good relationships at work . ' ` people work better who enjoy coming to work , sometimes we take a long lunch but still get work done and people will stay back to do it .
