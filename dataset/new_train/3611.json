{"text": "crystal palace have been told to match blackburn rovers ' # 5million valuation of rudy gestede or forget about signing the striker in the january transfer window . the premier league club are offering # 3.5 m for gestede , but blackburn have warned that their refusal to accept hull city 's # 10m bid for his strike partner jordan rhodes in the summer is proof that they will not be forced into a cut-price deal . manager gary bowyer said : ` i think the owners have a valuation and until it 's met i do n't think he 'll be going anywhere . they proved that this season with jordan rhodes . blackburn rovers striker rudy gestede sat out his side 's draw with wigan athletic at the dw stadium . the forward is attempting to push through a deal with premier league club crystal palace . ` the conversation has been quite simple really : any offers that come into the club have to go to the owners and they will make the decision . we are no under no instruction to sell but we have to take any offers to them . ` obviously there 's been no deal done so in terms of both parties i think they are haggling over what 's the right figure for him . ' although gestede was said to have missed last weekend 's game against wigan athletic because he was not in the right frame of mind , bowyer insists the 26-year-old benin striker was left out because blackburn thought a deal was close . and he warned palace that the player will be in his squad to face swansea city in the fa cup on saturday . ` there 's been no question about the player 's frame of mind at all , ' he added . ` if you 'd seen him this morning throwing himself around in training , he 's in a good place . he 's a good person . he just carries on with his job . gestede -lrb- left -rrb- has bagged 24 goals in 43 league appearances for the championship side . ` we thought it might have progressed quicker than it did and that 's why he wasn ' t involved -lrb- against wigan -rrb- . there have been no further developments so he goes into the squad for saturday . unless anything changes before then he is looking at focussing on being involved against swansea . ` he 's conducted himself in a brilliant way . it 's not his fault people have not met the valuation put on him by our owners . all he can do is concentrate on getting ready for the game . ' bowyer gave a mischievous response to comments from gestede 's agent david wancier that ` the player really wants to sign for crystal palace but is also committed to blackburn ' . the rovers boss said : ` it would be interesting if another premier league club came in . there 's nobody at the moment , but that might make his agent think . ` you 'd have to take it up with him , i can only speak on rudy 's behalf and how he 's been . he has been fine with us and is committed to playing on saturday . ` his relationship with our supporters is fantastic and i 'm sure on saturday they 'll be chanting his name . there is no question of rudy not giving 100 per cent , that 's the type of lad he is .
