{"text": "a middle class couple are being investigated under noise nuisance laws after they installed a high pitched ` mosquito ' alarm to stop teenage vandals from loitering outside their home . royal mail manager scott smith , 39 , and his partner andrea riley , 43 , purchased the alarm which causes ear discomfort to people aged under 25 after suffering months of vandalism , abuse and even air gun attacks on their mini pom dog . now whenever the gang of vandals , who have also made racist comments to burmese miss riley , approach the couple 's home in royton , near oldham , greater manchester , they can activate the alarm which forces them to move out of its 40 yard range . but the device has now landed the couple . in trouble with their local council - after neighbours complained it . was hurting their children 's ears . scroll down to test your hearing . andrea riley , pictured left with her pom dog elle , installed a ` mosquito ' alarm outside her home in royton , oldham , greater manchester , pictured right by the couple 's bedroom window , to deter teenage vandals . last resort : miss riley and her partner scott smith purchased the alarm after months of being targeted by teenage vandals who damaged their cars and attacked their dog . the legal alarms have previously been used at shopping centres to disperse gangs of youths - as their high pitched frequency generally ca n't be heard by people aged over 25 . so after months of struggling to get rid of the teenage vandals , mr smith and miss riley forked out # 600 for a ` mosquito ' device of their own - and now turn it on from their bedroom if youngsters start causing trouble outside . but the couple 's neighbours have complained the device has forced them to get medical treatment for their children because of headaches , ear problems and even physical sickness caused by the ` mosquito ' alarm . the couple are being investigated by council environmental health officials for possible noise nuisance offences . mr smith said : ` there has been an ongoing problem and this is the only thing that seems to have worked . i 'm not a grumpy old man who hates children . michelle plevin , who lives next door to scott smith and andrea riley , claims her two-year-old son cason is suffering ill affects from the couple 's alarm . ` because andrea is maltese some of the children started making racist comments . there was damage to our cars because the kids kept hitting them with footballs . our dog got hurt . ` and they make a lot of noise when we have come home from working very long days . this device has been a miracle for us . ' mr smith and miss riley , a care worker who have lived at their house for 20 years , said the street had become like a ` council estate ' with his audi tt car being scratched and bumped . on one occasion , chip pan oil was even poured around miss riley 's fiat 500 . the couple also claim their mini pom dog , elle , has been attacked by children with air guns and miss riley has been subjected to racist rants . mr smith said : ` we were struggling to cope with the all the trouble we 've had and the police unofficially recommended this device to us . mcdonald 's and tesco use it so i could n't see a problem with us using it . ` we do n't leave it on 24/7 and we use it sensibly . it is legal to have and use in europe and it is no higher than a busy road and it is set to two decibels under the legal requirements . ` there is nothing wrong with kids playing , but it escalates and they get rowdy and they start screaming and swearing . we fear as though we are the bad guys when we have nothing but problems with some kids . they climb in and out of the windows , kick doors in , sometimes we have it until 11.30 pm and they will throw things over the fence . ` we are worn out with it and it is putting tension on our relationship whilst dealing with stressful jobs . we are pushed to the limit but when we first used the device , it shifted them on and we even gave each other a celebratory hug . ` we thought it was worth the price but to be honest i would have even paid # 5,000 for it . it 's on show , we are not hiding it at all and it seems to be a deterrent . ` we are the victims . they are saying the children are on medication and are having headaches but it is a totally legal device . you just switch it on - even the police use it . deterrent : the mosquito alarm can be seen by the second left top window outside the couple 's home in royton , oldham , greater manchester . ` we are in work all day and we do 50-60 hours a week and we dreaded coming home so we are making excuses to stay at work longer . ` we had the conservatory done only two years ago and spent over # 30,000 on our house and yet we ca n't sit there and enjoy it anymore . we have even tried sitting out with earphones on but they are still throwing stuff . they run riot . ' miss riley added : ` we feel as though no one is helping us , we understand that the police are on cutbacks and have limited resources but we are fighting a losing battle . we just want a quiet life . ` we had 15 years of pure bliss where we could just hear the birds and it was a proper neighbourhood with people working like ourselves . but because of the current climate it has changed , people ca n't afford to rent so the social takes the house and we get people like that . the last thing i expected was to have problems with neighbours . the ` mosquito ' alarm emits a screeching noise , similar to nails down a blackboard , at 17.5 kilohertz . . the range of human hearing declines with age , so although teenagers can hear the noise , it 's too high for adults aged over 25 . human conversation is usually at around eight kilohertz , but can range up to 16kilohertz . most people do n't report problems with their hearing until they can not hear conversation . the device does n't affect family pets . ' i feel really harassed . i feel as . though i am being pushed to the limits and i 'm very stressed . they all . congregate around my wall and i am at my wits end . the kids all shout . ` paki woman paki woman ' at me over and over . they taunt me . ` if you give me the golden ticket i will be out of here . we have worked hard all our lives to avoid living on a council estate and that 's what our street has turned in to now . ' but their neighbour , mother-of-four michelle plevin , 27 , a hairdresser who lives next door to the couple said : ` the alarm is on for twenty minutes at a time and whenever it comes on the children know about it straight away . ` they ca n't play outside anymore because the noise bothers them so much . my youngest has problems with his ears as it is and the alarm has made him physically sick before . he cries and says it hurts and there is nothing i can do to help him . it 's awful . ' i understand that they do n't want kids on their property or near their cars but my children keep themselves to themselves . they just play together and i do n't see what is wrong with that . ` they only ever play in the garden because they 're not allowed to play on the road . i know they make a bit of noise when they 're on the trampoline but that ca n't be helped . ` they are children and they should be able to play in their own garden without being bothered by this horrible alarm . ' labour councillor steven bashworth from oldham council said : ` officers from the environmental health department have visited the steet and spoken to the owner and local residents . we are carrying out a thorough investigation and can not comment further . ` oldham council is committed to investigating any noise complaints and we will always take the appropriate action .
