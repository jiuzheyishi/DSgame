' the mccanns , of rothley , leicestershire , have been kept closely informed of scotland yard 's review -- codenamed operation grange -- over the past two years . a spokesman for the couple said : ` they have been encouraged from the moment the review started and are now greatly encouraged that police have drawn up a short list of people who they believe are of interest to the inquiry . ' a source close to the couple said : ` while they do n't want to raise their hopes too much , they are buoyed up by these revelations .
