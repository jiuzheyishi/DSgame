{"text": "ronald smith , 59 , from south bents , near whitburn , south tyneside , died after breathing in fumes from an airbag during a car crash in january 2011 , an inquest heard . a husband involved in a minor car crash died months later after breathing in the ` noxious ' contents of an airbag . ronald smith 's wife june was relieved when he arrived home apparently uninjured following the six-car shunt , an inquest heard . however he told her the airbag had been torn open by a shard of glass as it inflated and he had inhaled the gases it contained along with a large amount of white powder . grandfather mr smith , a 59-year-old marine engineer who had been extremely fit and active , began to suffer chest and breathing problems . after several weeks he went to hospital where he was placed on a ventilator . however , three weeks later mr smith died of bronchial pneumonia . south tyneside coroner terence carney recorded a verdict of misadventure on mr smith , from marsden , south shields . he said : ` this man died as a result of this incident -lrb- the car crash -rrb- and more pointedly because of the explosion of his airbag ... and exposure to noxious substances . ' outside court mr smith 's son , lee , 36 , said : ` it 's the verdict i was looking for . ever since it happened we wanted an investigation to see if anybody was to blame and i 'm happy with what the coroner has said . ' it is believed to be the first time a driver has died after inhaling the contents of an airbag , and mr smith 's widow spoke her shock and devastation that something designed to save life had actually taken it . ` i knew from the very beginning that it was the airbag , ' she said . the accident that led to mr smith 's death happened in november 2010 as he was returning home through hartlepool . the aa says when airbags ignite they produce nitrogen , which inflates the airbag and should not be hazardous -lrb- file picture -rrb- . he drove into the car in front at the same time that another went into the back of his vauxhall insignia . his head was flung forward by the impact and he inhaled the contents of the torn airbag , the inquest at south shields was told . the aa said the motoring organisation had no record of similar deaths . a spokesman said : ` in the event of a crash , sensors in a car , behind the bumper for example , measure the rate of deceleration . ` if the impact is severe enough , an explosive device triggers the inflation of the airbag . in some systems a sodium azide tablet is fitted inside , and this is ignited electronically . ` when it ignites it produces nitrogen , which inflates the airbag . nitrogen already makes up 78 per cent of the air we breathe so it 's not hazardous . ` as soon as the bag has fully inflated it starts to deflate - once it 's taken the force . ' a lot of powder is also released . this is mainly talcum powder , which manufacturers use as a lubricant to help the airbag slide into the correct position during assembly . ` some systems use canisters of a cellulose-based gas to inflate the airbag , but this is n't regarded as toxic either . we have checked our records and can not find any similar cases , but this death is very sad . ' ` he told me about the white powder straight away , ' said mrs smith . ` he said there was so much of it he could n't see . ` i just thought that the white powder had got into his lungs . i thought his body would get rid of it by itself -- i did n't think it would be permanent . ` not long after that i noticed that he was n't right , he would become breathless walking up the drive . ` ronnie has never smoked so that was very worrying . he started to cough a lot as well . it was n't normal because he was n't like that , he never got colds . ` he had always been so healthy and was extremely fit . i knew from the beginning that it was the air bag but other people would look at me as if to say ,  do n't be silly  . ' on january 5 the couple went to south tyneside district hospital and mr smith was immediately given oxygen and admitted . ` he could barely move , ' added his widow . ` it was a very cold winter , and he was really struggling . we used to walk everywhere and he was always out every night with the dog , but he got so bad that he could n't even walk a few steps without my help . ' forensic pathologist dr stuart hamilton told the inquest that mr smith 's lungs were both extremely ` heavy and firm ' . the aa said it had no record of similar deaths . a spokesman for vauxhall said the company planned to investigate the matter but did not wish to comment at this stage .", "summary": " ronald smith died two months after car accident .   his wife noticed his face reddened after breathing gas .
