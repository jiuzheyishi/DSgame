{"text": "jerusalem two attacks carried out against palestinians in recent days , one in jerusalem and the other on the west bank , have prompted some uncomfortable questions in israel about racism toward arabs . in one incident , jamal julani , a 17-year-old palestinian from east jerusalem , was beaten unconscious by a group of teenagers in west jerusalem . he spent several days in the hospital recovering from his injuries . on the same day , august 16 , a taxi carrying a palestinian family close to the israeli settlement of bat ayin on the west bank was firebombed . all six family members were injured , one badly . three children , ages 12 and 13 , have been arrested on suspicion of throwing the gasoline bomb . seven minors , as well as an adult , were indicted in the jerusalem case tuesday . among the charges they face are incitement to racism , incitement to violence and aggravated assault , and motivated racism . the youth of the alleged perpetrators and the fact they appear to have targeted their victims because of their race , and in the west bank case possibly also as a result of tensions between settlers and palestinians over land , have shocked many in israel . some believe an environment of conflict and lack of tolerance have combined to create dangerous behavioral instincts in the youth on both sides , undermining the chances of a peaceful resolution to the conflict . jerusalem city councilor laura wharton , who grew up in the united states but has lived in israel for many years , wrote in her blog that  apart from sorrow i can only express my shame that such a thing could happen in my country .  in the wake of the attacks , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu issued a strongly worded statement expressing the government 's  complete opposition to racism and violence .  but some , wharton among them , say this is not enough to tackle the deeper issues at stake . jamal julani 's cousin , 18-year-old nu'oman julani , described to cnn how the pair were in west jerusalem to shop for eid when they ran into a group of about 50 israeli settler youths shouting racist slogans in zion square . nu'oman julani said they tried to avoid the group , splitting off in different directions .  all of sudden , i saw a group of these extremist jews run after my cousin and start beating him up ,  he told cnn .  i followed to stop the fight and i was personally beaten as well , but not as much as my cousin , who was knocked unconscious to the ground when he sustained a direct hit to the chest and heart .  the beating continued until the police arrived on the scene .  i thought that my cousin was dead because i saw his eyes rolled backwards and he looked blue , but a man helped in resuscitating him ,  nu'oman julani said .  i have one question , why is this happening ? what did we do to deserve this ? i hope they get the highest possible punishment for this crime they did .  an israeli ambulance service spokesman confirmed to cnn that one of its operatives had helped to resuscitate the teenager , whose heart had stopped beating . he said the teenager was taken to hospital but that the lack of visible injuries led medical staff to believe he was suffering from a heart complaint not caused by the incident . speaking from his son 's hospital bedside , abu akram julani said he was relieved that jamal had regained consciousness , and that he did not remember what had happened that night . police spokesman micky rosenfeld told cnn an incident of a sexual nature between a 15-year-old jewish girl and an arab israeli a few weeks earlier had been a factor in the disturbance . the girl had told her friends about that incident , he said ,  and that 's what stirred up all of the tension , and then they started walking the streets and cursing the arabs and then a brawl and a fight broke out .  the indictment filed with the jerusalem court describes how on that night a large group of boys had started shouting racist abuse and  pushing , punching and kicking  some arabs who passed them . when they spotted julani and three other arabs near zion square , they started to run after them , it says . the accused then beat julani  until he lost consciousness and his breathing and his heart stopped , so he needed resuscitation and needed hospitalization for several days .  netanyahu 's statement condemning the attacks came five days later , after a weekend in which the story gathered steam in the media .  in the state of israel , we are not prepared to tolerate racism ; neither are we prepared to tolerate the combination of racism and violence ,  he said .  this is something that we can not accept -- not as jews , not as israelis . this is not our way ; this goes against our way , and we condemn it in word and deed . we will quickly bring to justice those responsible for this reprehensible incident .  vice prime minister and strategic affairs minister moshe ya'alon also condemned the firebombing as a  terrorist act  that ran counter to national values , according to israel 's haaretz newspaper . the hate crimes  are intolerable , outrageous and must be firmly dealt with ,  he is quoted as saying . wharton , of the left-wing meretz party , told cnn wednesday the statements from netanyahu and others condemning the violence are welcome -- but the government seems unlikely to take on the deep-rooted issues behind the attacks . she believes the incidents are a symptom of three highly concerning trends .  one is a question of racism , which is definitely on the rise in israel and is very worrisome to , i think , just about everyone except for a worrisome combination of extreme right and extreme religious groups ,  she said . a second is the issue of rising violence in israel , particularly among the younger generation , she said , in contrast to a tradition of low levels of violent crime despite the threat of terrorism . the third has to do with a growing number of ultra-orthodox youth who drop out of school but whose highly religious education and upbringing have left them unable to adjust to regular society , wharton said .  those kids , they leave these schools and they are suddenly exposed to a whole world they have n't seen before . they do n't know how to behave , they get involved in drugs or crime ,  she said . at the same time , racism is also increasing in mainstream schools , she said , in part as a by-product of israel 's long history of conflict and the distrust built up following scores of attacks by palestinian militants . she believes more must be done in schools to emphasize the need for peaceful coexistence , in line with traditional jewish values , and to warn against stereotyping and violence . on a more hopeful note , several hundred people joined an event in zion square two nights after the attack on julani to demonstrate against racism , wharton noted in her blog . naomi schacter , an associate director of shatil , an initiative of the new israel fund , echoes the sentiment that words of condemnation from politicians are not enough to tackle the problem .  with racism rising in this country , and chants and graffiti calling for ` death to the arabs ' becoming a distressingly common event , it is clear that such reactive public statements are not sufficient ,  she wrote in an opinion piece in the times of israel following the assaults .  not only swift and vigorous action against the perpetrators of such criminal attacks , but also a paradigm shift in public rhetoric , are necessary to halt the trend .  the responses posted below her piece attest to the divisive nature of the debate . the latest assaults are not the only incidents to prompt soul-searching in israel in recent months . a number of so-called  price tag  attacks -- a term frequently used to describe acts of vandalism by radical israeli settlers exacting a  price  against palestinian targets or israeli security forces in response to actions by the israeli government -- have targeted palestinian mosques and property . high-profile incidents involving intolerance toward african immigrants , some of whom have entered illegally after fleeing conflict in sudan and eritrea , have also sparked internal debate about whether the country is facing growing racism . while some israelis accuse the illegal african immigrants of increasing levels of crime , suffocating the infrastructure and changing the fabric of israel , others ask how a country founded by jews trying to escape persecution can turn against anyone trying to escape danger in their own lands . the government is seeking to deport tens of thousands of the migrants to their homelands , despite fears for their safety there . at the same time , the thorny issue of whether israel 's ultra-orthodox community , known as the haredim , should serve in the military or in civil service has come under the spotlight . netanyahu 's government last month lost its main coalition partner , centrist political faction kadima , over failed attempts to agree on an alternative to the law that exempts ultra-orthodox men from serving in the israeli army . the prime minister had hoped to reach a consensus with the haredim , who oppose changes to the law . his likud party has traditionally aligned with the ultra-orthodox factions as coalition partners . controversy over attempts by some in the haredim to enforce a strict form of gender segregation and rules of modesty on females outside of their community also exercised many israelis this year . the haredim , who make up approximately 10 % of the country according to government figures , are the fastest growing segment of the population -- and tensions between israel 's different communities seem unlikely to go away just yet . this story is based on reporting by enas muthaffar and paul colsey in jerusalem . it was written by laura smith-spark in london .", "summary": " two recent attacks on palestinians have
