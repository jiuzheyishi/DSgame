{"text": "davos , switzerland dmitry medvedev made a strong pitch for foreign investment in russia wednesday as he gave his first special address as russia 's prime minister at the world economic forum in davos . he painted a picture of a strong economy that is open to those who are  ready to be partners  and invest in russia . follow the action live on cnn.com . this year davos , a picturesque swiss ski resort , is hosting nearly 40 world leaders and more than 2,000 executives . the world 's top policymakers gather annually to discuss global issues , and are this time meeting under the banner of  resilient dynamism .  medvedev sought to position himself as a reformer in a country that is moving determinedly forward .  russia is an open country , whatever they might think or say ,  he said , referring to critics of its record on corruption and governance issues . russia 's unemployment rate , at a little over 5 % , is the lowest among developed countries , he said , and it also has an extremely low level of foreign debt . quest : u.s. economy to dominate davos .  we need to see investment growing by 10 % annually ,  he said .  therefore we are interested in attracting large-scale foreign investment .  that amount of investment expansion is needed to push russia 's economy beyond 4 % growth , he said . but medvedev acknowledged that russia needs to do a much better job of attracting foreign direct investment . russia ranks very low in global corruption indices , which has held back investment despite a sizable population of 142 million . medvedev said his government 's priority is to improve public governance . but , he said , this is not a problem unique to russia . is the rise of china creating conflict ?  it 's nothing new -- humanity has been facing these problems for centuries , if not millennia ,  he said .  the more law and order , the more thieves and robbers . in that sense , little has changed .  medvedev stressed that russia is an open market now and pointed to membership in the world trade organization as a indication of that . the country 's next priority is to gain membership of the organisation for economic co-operation and development , composed of the world 's industrialized nations , he said . interactive : europe 's tale of boom and bust . the prime minister suggested this sends a strong message to the world , even though both structures  are not perfect ,  in his view . he also spoke of the need to create an equal playing field for all businesses and to create a  single economic space  with russia 's neighbors , stretching from the atlantic to the pacific . but the prime minister dismissed suggestions that this is an effort to somehow recreate the soviet union , saying russia wants to play in the global market . interactive : how 's your economic mood ?  there is no going back to the past ,  he said . executives have not been convinced in the past that medvedev and russian president vladimir putin are on the same page . but the prime minister stressed that russia has a global outlook and will continue dialogue with its european friends and partners .  we are building our cooperation ,  he said , acknowledging that unilateral action could have  dire implications .  medvedev said the g-20 , which brings together the world 's major economies , is becoming increasingly efficient and that this has helped limit the extent of the global economic crisis .  we need to use modern technologies , crowd sourcing ,  he said .  those technologies change the status and enhance the legitimacy of decisions made in government .  davos 2013 : new year , same old problems ? the speech echoed one medvedev gave at davos as his country 's president in 2011 , when he also pushed foreign investment in russia while acknowledging that reforms were needed . russia last month assumed the rotating presidency of the g-20 .  the russian presidency 's main task will be to focus the g-20 's efforts on developing measures to stimulate economic growth and create jobs ,  putin said at the time . few are likely to dispute medvedev 's comments on the need for russia to prioritize governance issues . russia ranked 133 out of 174 in transparency international 's 2012 corruption perceptions index . ahead of the world economic forum , the non-governmental group 's chairwoman , huguette labelle , called on countries and businesses to change the way they work , for everybody 's sake .  future prosperity will always be undermined by corruption , excessive risk-taking , a lack of transparency and other unethical practices ,  she warned . pavel khodorkovsky , the son of jailed russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky and president of the u.s.-based institute of modern russia , also wrote an open letter to those at the world economic forum in which he highlighted the plight of his father . mikhail khodorkovsky , who backed an opposition party , has been in jail since 2003 and was convicted in 2005 on charges of tax evasion and fraud . russia has faced wide criticism over his treatment , with the united states and others accusing it of  selective prosecution  and abuse of the legal system . his son , in his letter to policymakers at davos , called on them to raise the issue of the former yukos chief executive 's continued imprisonment and urge support for the rule of law in russia .  ending corruption is not just a human rights issue ,  pavel khodorkovsky said .  the proliferation of corruption remains a huge impediment to direct foreign investment .  both u.s. and russian officials have publicly acknowledged russia 's weak property rights and rampant corruption are reasons to avoid doing business in russia . this is thwarting job creation and starving russian businesses of the capital they need to grow .  medvedev 's comments come amid frosty relations with the united states after putin signed a law in december prohibiting americans from adopting russian children . the move by russian politicians was widely seen as retaliation for a law that u.s. president barack obama signed december 14 . that bill , called the magnitsky act , imposes u.s. travel and financial restrictions on those it considers human rights abusers in russia .", "summary": " new : son of jailed russian tycoon khodorkovsky urges a focus on tackling corruption .   dmitry medvedev : russia wants to attract large-scale foreign investment .   tackling poor governance is the country 's priority , medvedev says .   russia ranks low in global corruption indices , which has held back investment .
