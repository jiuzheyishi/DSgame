{"text": "beirut , lebanon at least four people were killed and 77 injured when a car bomb exploded in a residential neighborhood in southern beirut on thursday , lebanon 's state-run national news agency reported . the explosion caused significant damage , lebanese broadcaster al manar tv said . video from al manar showed people gathered around smoking cars , and others bringing hoses to put out the flames . thick clouds of dust rose as buildings collapsed after the blast . the district , haret hreik , is known as a hezbollah stronghold . the blast was strong enough to be felt in nearby neighborhoods of the capital , nna reported . a source with knowledge of the security situation told cnn that the car bomb exploded near al-jawad restaurant , about 50 meters -lrb- 55 yards -rrb- from a building used by hezbollah . there has not yet been any claim of responsibility for the blast . lebanon 's armed forces , in a statement published by nna , urged people not to gather in the area in case of further explosions . experts are gathering forensic evidence from the scene , the statement said . the explosion comes less than a week after a car bomb exploded in downtown beirut , killing half a dozen people and injuring dozens . among those killed in that blast was mohamad chatah , a former lebanese finance minister and ambassador to the united states . he was an outspoken critic of hezbollah and the syrian regime . hezbollah , a lebanese-based , iranian-backed shiite militia that is better equipped than lebanon 's army , has been supporting government forces in neighboring syria 's civil war . this has led to increased tensions in lebanon , where sectarian divisions reflect those in syria . ` opened the doors of hell ' outgoing prime minister najib mikati warned that worse is to come if the lebanese people do n't overcome their political differences and engage in dialogue , nna said . a member of the future bloc , a political group opposed to hezbollah , condemned the bombing . hezbollah 's involvement in the syrian crisis has  opened the doors of hell to lebanon ,  said ammar houry , quoted by nna . syrian information minister omran al-zoubi condemned the bombing , which he labeled a  terrorist act ,  syrian state news agency sana reported . in an online statement , derek plumbly , the u.n. special coordinator for lebanon , expressed his  outrage that this is the fourth bomb to have exploded in beirut 's southern suburbs since july .   it is deeply distressing to have to condemn yet another appalling act of terrorism , the latest in the number which have killed and injured so many innocent people in this country ,  he said . plumbly called for those responsible to be held accountable . car bombs in the same area of beirut in july and august killed dozens and injured hundreds . and in november , a suicide bomb attack outside the iranian embassy , close to the neighborhood where thursday 's attack occurred , killed two dozen people and injured about 150 . earlier this week , lebanese state media reported that saudi arabia had pledged $ 3 billion to strengthen the lebanese army . the money will allow lebanon 's armed forces to buy weapons from france . it 's been seen as a move to counter the strength of hezbollah , but many analysts are doubtful because of the time it will take to equip and train the lebanese armed forces , in a period when tensions and violence are increasing day by day . hezbollah still enjoys wide backing in lebanon , but some groups have been angered by its support for syrian president bashar al-assad 's forces . ` proxy war ' beirut-based middle east analyst rami khouri told cnn the recent surge in violence in lebanon was part of larger , regional turmoil .  we are seeing the greatest proxy war of modern times playing itself out in lebanon and syria and iraq , that have now become really one battlefield in which two great ideological camps are fighting to the death like gladiators ,  he said . political divisions and ideological tensions in lebanon go back several decades , khouri said , but they have been reinforced by the emergence of radical islamist terrorist groups , linked to al qaeda , following the u.s.-led invasion of iraq . the situation has been aggravated by the civil war raging on lebanon 's doorstep in syria , khouri said , but that is not its cause . it 's not clear who is behind the bombings , he said , adding that the violence is not from ordinary sunnis and shiites attacking each other , but a more complex picture of extremist ideologies . hezbollah was designated as a terrorist group by the united states in 1995  for a long history of terrorist attacks against american citizens and officials , including the bombing of the u.s. embassy and marine barracks in lebanon during the 1980s ,  the u.s. state department website says . the u.n.-backed special tribunal for lebanon is due to begin the trial this month of four hezbollah suspects in the 2005 assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri . he was also killed in a car bomb attack . cnn 's mohammed jamjoom reported from beirut and laura smith-spark wrote in london . cnn 's nic robertson , mohammed tawfeeq and larry register contributed to this report .", "summary": " new : at least four people are killed and 77 injured in a large blast in beirut , state media say .   u.n.
