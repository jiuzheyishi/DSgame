{"text": "there is nothing terribly surprising in apple 's refreshed line of tablets , but that 's ok . we spent some time testing and touching the new ipad mini and ipad air after tuesday 's press conference . as promised by apple executives , the new devices were lighter , thinner and seemingly faster -- just like many incremental product upgrades from the past . ipad air . there were no major new features , such as the fingerprint scanner or camera upgrade that came with the iphone 5s . the most unexpected news of the day was a new name for the $ 499 fifth-generation ipad , which is now the ipad air . the ipad line has been a bit wishy-washy with names . it began by counting each version , but then dropped the number and asked only to be know as  ipad ,  like cher . the ipad 2 kept its number and a spot in stores , where its slightly lower price tag -lrb- now $ 399 -rrb- might appeal to someone considering a cheaper android or windows tablet . physically , the ipad air is indeed lighter and thinner than its predecessor . it 's 20 % thinner than the third generation ipad , measuring in at a slight .29 - inch . an ad shown at the press conference showed an ipad air lying flat on a tablet , hiding discretely behind a no. 2 pencil . it has also dropped a bit of weight and the wi-fi version is now exactly 1 pound -lrb- the cellular version is 1.05 pounds -rrb- . unfortunately , i did n't have an older ipad on hand to do a weight comparison , and i 'd picked up an ipad mini first . nothing makes a regular ipad feel hefty like holding an ipad mini . you ca n't unfeel a mini ; it 's just so delightfully wee . the ipad air has a 64-bit a7 processor , the same chip recently introduced in the iphone 5s . the a7 should benefit graphics heavy programs such as imovie and iphoto , and phil schiller claimed it would double the performance of the previous chip . it is difficult to judge speed increases during a few minutes in a crowded room without proper tests and an equally empty previous generation device to use for comparison . fresh apple products always feel zippier than previous generations . part of that is the steadily improving processors inside , but its also the benefit of working on a new device that has n't been gradually slowed down by pages of apps , hundreds of cat videos and the latest operating system upgrade . ipad mini with retina display . the ipad mini got its first upgrade since it was first launched one year ago . physically , the device is a dead ringer for the original . fire it up , and you 'll see that it addresses one of the biggest complaints about the first version by upgrading the screen to a 2048-by-1536 display that packs in 326 pixels per inch , a big jump from the previous 163 pixels per inch . a number of apple products already have the retina display : the iphone 4s and up , the fourth generation ipod touch , the 10-inch ipad and some macbook pros . -lrb- apple says retina display is so good that the human eye ca n't spot out individual pixels on the device -rrb- . like the ipad air , the ipad mini with retina has the a7 chip inside . previously the mini was a generation behind its larger ipad sibling in processor speed . but this upgrade and the new display put the devices on the same level , so picking a smaller screen no longer means opting for the inferior product . the smaller tablet size is a competitive market , and the ipad mini with retina display is finally apple 's premium offering for the 7.9-inch size . the $ 399 tablet is now in a better position to take on products such as google 's nexus 7 , samsung 's galaxy tablets and amazon 's kindle hdx . though other products can usually be had for much less , any hands-on time with apple products remind you that one of their greatest selling points is solid , high-quality construction . the missing upgrade . shaving off excess bulk and swapping out faster processors is de rigueur for any product update these days . other companies might throw in price drops , but apple is comfortable in its spot at the high-end of the consumer market . it wo n't start slashing devices for its flagship devices . instead , the company keeps older models available , though even those are priced somewhat high . unfortunately , there is one key feature where all the tablet makers seem to have stalled : battery life . faster processors gobble up more battery power , so maintaining 10 hours of battery life from an old tablet to a new tablet probably requires battery improvements . both new ipads have the same m7 motion co-processor that handles sensors , such as the accelerometer and gyroscope , saving battery power by not using the main processor . other than an hour here or there , mobile devices makers seem stuck at the half-day mark , a frustrating limitation for people who have adapted by carting around chargers and scrambling to re-up anytime they spot an empty outlet at a cafe , airport or friend 's house . for now , apple is comfortable enough with the competition to just iterate on its well-designed , popular products , making the usual round of improvements and throwing in the occasional flashy feature to grab attention , such as fingerprints on the iphone 5s . it may not be as much fun for tech fans who were used to splashy new products and well-kept secrets , but it 's probably a solid business decision . according to forrester analyst sarah rotman epps , replacement tablet sales are growing faster than new new tablet sales worldwide . manufacturers need to compete to keep the customers they already have who are considering upgrading from an old model . all the tablet makers are competing with what are essentially the same minor tweaks . the competition will stay close until the first company breaks out of the usual faster , thinner , faster upgrade cycle and solves the battery problem .", "summary": " the new ipads from apple do n't hold a lot of surprises , but the regular improvements are solid .   the renamed ipad air is thinner , faster and lighter than the previous generation .   with a new processor and better screen , ipad mini catches up to the full-size ipad .
