{"text": "washington president barack obama signed a two-month extension of the payroll tax cut friday , ending what had been a heated political stalemate and sealing a hard-fought win for democrats on an issue -- taxes -- that has historically favored the gop . earlier in the day , the measure cleared the democratic-controlled senate and the republican-controlled house of representatives by unanimous consent , a procedural move allowing the measure to pass even though most members of congress were already home for the holidays .  this is some good news just in the nick of time ,  obama said shortly before departing the white house for hawaii . but  we have a lot more work to do . this continues to be a make-or-break moment for the middle class in this country .  among other things , the $ 33 billion bill also includes a two-month extension of emergency federal unemployment benefits and the so-called  doc fix ,  a delay in scheduled payment reductions to doctors who treat medicare patients . congress will consider a longer extension of all three measures when it reconvenes in january . obama also signed a separate appropriations bill funding the government through september 2012 , wrapping up a legislative year marked by repeated partisan brinksmanship and declining public approval of a seemingly dysfunctional congress . political analysts believe the showdown over the payroll holiday extension has eroded republican strength on the party 's core issue of lower taxes . while gop leaders first questioned the merit of the tax holiday and then complained that a short-term extension would be more trouble than it 's worth , obama used the standoff to portray the republicans as defenders of the rich with a callous attitude toward the burdens of the middle class . the episode also called into question speaker john boehner 's control over the house republican caucus . the speaker , according to multiple accounts , initially favored the two-month extension , which had passed the senate with an overwhelming bipartisan majority . he was then apparently forced to retreat from that position last weekend in the face of a tea party-fueled revolt in which freshman conservatives in particular demanded an immediate 12-month extension . in a virtual party-line vote , the house on tuesday passed a measure calling for the creation of a house-senate conference committee to consider ways to pay for an immediate year-long continuation . but congressional democrats and administration officials , noting previous legislative maneuvering over the issue and a looming december 31 deadline , called the house 's terms unrealistic and refused to budge . top senate republicans were also enraged by the actions of their house counterparts , believing that house gop leaders had backed out of a deal to support the temporary two-month plan . senate minority leader mitch mcconnell , r-kentucky , was among those who ultimately called for house republicans to relent . facing rising republican establishment fears that the gop was squandering its political advantage on taxes , the speaker again reversed himself on thursday , this time essentially consenting to the senate 's terms . according to gop sources , boehner held a conference call thursday afternoon with his fellow house republicans in which the speaker refused to allow any members to ask questions or raise objections . one republican house member on the call described the speaker as  tired and ticked off .  boehner , in announcing the deal to reporters later in the day , insisted the house gop 's prior opposition to the senate plan was the right thing to do , even if it turned out to be politically questionable .  it may not have been politically the smartest thing in the world ,  the ohio republican conceded , but the end result was  we were able to fix what came out of the senate .  boehner also acknowledged the pressure he was under , saying :  i talked to enough members over the last 24 hours who say we do n't like the two-month extension and if you can get this fixed , why not do the right thing for the american people even if it 's not exactly what we want .  the final bill is virtually same senate proposal house republicans rejected earlier this week . house republicans were given slim political cover through the addition of legislative language designed to ease the administrative burden on small businesses implementing the plan , as well as a commitment to continue negotiations on a one-year extension of the tax cut and other benefits . under the deal , the payroll tax will remain at the current 4.2 % rate instead of reverting to the 6.2 % rate it was at before the cut enacted last year . without congressional action , the higher rate would have returned in 2012 , meaning an average $ 1,000 tax increase for 160 million americans . the typical worker 's take home salary would have been reduced by about $ 40 per pay period without the tax cut . analysts said boehner had little choice but to back down .  it became increasingly obvious he had to fold ,  said cnn senior political analyst david gergen , using poker terminology . boehner was under  intense pressure from senior republicans  over a situation that  became so botched ,  he said . darrell west , the vice president and director of governance studies at the brookings institution , said the issue has worked in the favor of democrats because they had republicans  seemingly willing to accept a tax increase  by opposing the senate extension of the payroll tax cut . the conservative wall street journal , in an editorial earlier this week , warned that house republicans had lost the political advantage of advocating tax cuts to obama and the democrats . some tea party republicans , however , are now livid that boehner backed down .  the house has caved yet again to the president and senate democrats ,  freshman rep. tim huelskamp , r-kansas , said in a written statement .  we were sent here with a clear set of instructions from the american people to put an end to business as usual in washington , yet here we are being asked to sign off on yet another gimmick . no wonder the american people are left with a bad taste in their mouths when it comes to congress .  asked about boehner 's performance , huelskamp later told cnn he was  disappointed in our entire leadership team .  while the congressman told wolf blitzer he did n't anticipate a conservative revolt against boehner , he did expect  a lot of discussion  about what the gop stands for . a number of republicans have said the party should have declared victory after winning an agreement by obama -- as part of the larger tax cut package -- to make a decision within the next 60 days on whether to proceed with the proposed keystone xl oil pipeline from canada to the gulf of mexico . republicans and some democratic union leaders say the controversial pipeline will create thousands of new jobs ; critics question its environmental impact . cnn 's jessica yellin , ted barrett , dana bash , kate bolduan , lisa desjardins , matt hoye , xuan thai , brianna keilar and deirdre walsh contributed to this report .", "summary": " obama signs 2-month payroll tax cut extension .   house gop 's defeat raises new questions about boehner 's leadership .   the house and senate passed the bill by unanimous consent .   the procedural move allowed the measure to pass even though most members have left town .
