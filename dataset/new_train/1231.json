' another . reads : ' a large room on the upper floor with 34 boxes , two packages . containing carpets , eight packages of books ... one room on the ground . floor containing an additional 13 boxes owned by mr gurlitt . ' most of . these boxes contained pictures and drawings . pictured : . the munich apartment where officials discovered the hidden paintings which could be worth # 1bn . gurlitt , they wrote , was ` an art collector from hamburg with connections within high-level nazi circles . he acted on behalf of other nazi officials and made many trips to france , from where he brought home art collections . there is reason to believe that these private art collections consist of looted art from other countries . ' gurlitt was described as an ` art dealer to the führer . ' cornelius gurlitt , who would go on to . inherit many of these treasures , was 12 at the time and living in the . castle with his father . hildebrand was quizzed by the americans in june . 1945 and they noted he seemed ` extremely nervous ' as if he was not . telling them the truth . ` sitting . woman ' by henri matisse and a formerly unknown painting of french . artist marc chagall were both discovered among the # 1bn artwork that is . believed to have been plundered from jews during wwii . ` it . was during those days that gurlitt , the ` art dealer to the führer , ' reinvented himself : as a victim of the nazis , a man who had saved . precious artworks from destruction and someone who had never done . anything malicious , ' said spiegel . gurlitt . said : ' i had to decide between the war and the work for museums . i . never bought a picture that was n't offered to me voluntarily . as i . heard , laws were also enacted in france so that jewish art collections . could be confiscated . but i never saw it with my own eyes .

' linz was to the be the city where hitler intended to build the world 's biggest art museum after the war . hermann voss , a museum director from . wiesbaden , ran the art-buying programme for the linz project from 1943 . onward . gurlitt worked for hitler through voss , who served as a . middleman . one . painting he bought at a rocket bottom price was by the bulgarian painter . jules pascin called ` the studio of the painter grossmann . ' in . fact , gurlitt bought the pascin in 1935 for 600 reichsmark , much less . than it was worth , from a jew called julius ferdinand wollf , who would . later commit suicide . after originally confiscating it the americans . gave it back to gurlit in 1950 . under . hitler , gurlitt was tasked to sell modern art - ` degenerate art ' it was . called by hitler - abroad to bring in hard currency for the regime . one man he fleeced out of drawings by adolf menzel was erns julius . wolffson , a jewish doctor in hamburg . control : hitler only liked classical art and held exhibitions of modern ` dissident ' pieces to show german people what not to like . many of those paintings that appeared in those shows have been found in gurlitt 's collection . spiegel also discovered gurlitt senior struck up a relationship with cornelius müller hofstede , a nazi in german silesia , now poland , appointed to appraise the collections of persecuted jews to sell on the open market . ` it was also müller hofstede who . obtained the max liebermann painting ` two riders on the beach ' for . gurlitt . a few weeks ago , the work was one of the first pictures from . the confiscated gurlitt collection in munich to be shown at a press . conference . the nazis had confiscated it from sugar refiner david . friedmann , who died in 1942 . friedmann 's daughter was killed in a . concentration camp in 1943 , ' said spiegel . gurlitt . also bought a painting at a knock down price from a jewish couple . called the kaims from breslau who were later sent to the warsaw ghetto . and then to the gas chambers at treblinka . the . magazine also discovered he bought millions of marks worth of paintings . under dubious circumstances from collectors in france . in 1950 , . gurlitt 's art was restored to him and he also made off with treasures he . had hidden in an old water mill . spiegel . said of him : ` there are many examples of works that gurlitt acquired . under questionable circumstances . there are also a number of pictures . hanging in german museums today , from hanover to wiesbaden , that were . bought from gurlitt . there are even pictures that gurlitt bought for . hitler 's museum in linz , which , because of their unclear origins , became . the property of the state .
