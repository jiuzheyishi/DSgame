{"text": "the oldest working fish smokehouse in london is facing closure after the owners were told they can only use smoke-free wood because of a single complaint from a neighbour . walter purkis & sons has been serving customers with smoked fish at the back of its crouch end shop for 130 years , prepared in a victorian smokehouse . but haringey council say the practice must stop until issues with the smoke are resolved , after a neighbour in a modern apartment block lodged a complaint . family business : pictured in 1941 , sam purkis , walter 's great uncle , ran a fish shop in woodford , north-east london . angry : john purkis -lrb- pictured -rrb- , who runs walter purkis & sons in crouch . end , north london is disappointed that he can no longer smoke fish in the . smokehouse . walter purkis and his son john , who were handed the notice on december 21 , face a fine if they do not comply . they believe booming house prices and over-development in what had previously been a down-at-heel area of town was killing off its history and traditions . six years ago , flats were built above a nearby supermarket and during the summer last year , a wooden studio-type building was put up next to the shop 's chimney . the council now claims the property - which had it chimney knocked off during the blitz by a luftwaffe bomb - is in breach of the environmental protection act 1990 and the clean air act 1993 . the family believe the complaint to the labour-run haringey council in north london had originated from someone living in the apartment blocks . john purkis , at the entrance to the fish smokehouse , which is in the backyard of his fishmongers shop . not in stock : empty spaces in the shop counter where the smoked fish used to be sold before the traders were ordered to stop smoking it . referring to the residents , mr purkis , 65 , said : ` we have never had a problem and we have been here 130 years . these flats are only six years old . ` we have been doing this the same way for five or six generations back , and so did the people who had shop before me , they also did it for five generations . ` if we ca n't do this anymore we will have to pack up . ' his son john purkis , 42 , added : ` it 's really disappointing . i have been here 20 years and no one ever said anything about health inspections so this was a shock . ` the last e-mail we got was yesterday from haringey council . ` we smoke with oak chip , which is pure wood . but they are saying it 's an unauthorised fuel and they want us to use a smoke-free wood , which is chemically enhanced . ` but if it 's smoke free , it 's not smoked fish . there is no product . ` we use nothing but natural wood with no chemicals added . this goes against our principles . ` to do what they are suggesting , we would need to have a completely different system put in . ' john at work in his shop , although he is no longer able to use his smokehouse -lrb- pictured right -rrb- . hidden away : the smokehouse , which prompted a complaint from a resident of a nearby property , is situated under the building with the green roof . mr purkis ' father added the cost of the new equipment was in the region of # 48,000 , and even then he was not sure the council would approve its installation . the family bought the shop in 1982 from the green family and also have a branch in muswell hill . not happy : councillor david winskill for crouch end is fighting the case for the now unused smokehouse . john purkis said he were initially unaware that council officers had started to monitor the business since october , leading to the ban beginning on december 21 . he added he had no idea how the monitoring had taken place , and they had not received any data . the family were able to complete their christmas orders , but the ban has lost them 40 per cent of their turnover . ` to afford the rents and rate , we have got to have our turnover , ' mr purkis added . ` we employ local people and have got six staff working for us . we are local people ourselves . ' he added little smoke was emitted anyway as it was contained in the smokehouse so that it could be absorbed by the fish . customer martin bailey was also furious . he said : ' a supplier of excellent , healthy , locally-processed , traditional foods - commended by rick stein and popular across north london - is being put out of business without consultation by ill-judged council action that can only be described as heavy-handed . ` and , not so far away , near the olympic park , a big new smokehouse has recently been opened . ` but that was in a different borough , where perhaps  pollution  means something different . ` what next ? a haringey ban on summer barbecues ? will firework parties fall foul of officialdom ? ' crouch end councillor david winskill has also backed the business , and is campaigning for the practice to be allowed again . traditional : inside the front of walter purkis & sons , where smoked fish used to be for sale . the furious liberal democrat said : ` i 'm going to be working with mr purkis and officers to make sure there is a speedy resolution to this and to see whether the order which has been served actually reflects the intention of the law . ' a council spokesman said advice on appropriate smoking appliances and approved fuels had been provided to the owner . he said : ` we are working closely with them to resolve the issue . ` until then the owner has been asked not to use the smokehouse . ' lance forman , of h forman & son , has a smokehouse in east london and uses oak logs . he said : ` we have a special system that prevents smoke from being emitted into the atmosphere . ` the system is closed when we are producing the smoke . ' not on the menu : thanks to a council ban , smoked kippers are not . currently served at the family-run walter purkis & sons fish shop -lrb- file picture -rrb- . fish has been smoked throughout . history for the purpose of preservation , although the invention of . fridges means the practice is mainly used just for flavouring in . developed countries . the market for smoked fish underwent a major change in the mid to late nineteenth century . the . use of transport by railways and steam ships from the 1840s allowed the . transportation of perishables , so large quantities of fresh fish could . be moved from one place to another . this caused a decline in the popularity of heavily smoked products . in . the same period -lrb- the mid-1800s -rrb- , the smoked fish products recognisable . in today 's market came into being . these are mildly smoked and dried . and contain minimum salt as condiment . the kipper , for example , was invented in 1843 after considerable experiment , and remains popular today . traditional smokehouses served both as meat and fish smokers and to store the food afterwards . they are usually small enclosed outbuildings with a vent , a single entrance and no windows . inside them , smoke is absorbed into the meat during a process that lasts between five and six hours .", "summary": " haringey council said the historic custom of fish-smoking at a north london shop must stop until problems with the smoky smell were resolved .   a complaint was made from a resident of a nearby modern apartment block .
