{"text": "a new york times report on the september 11 , 2012 , attack that killed four americans -- including ambassador j. christopher stevens -- in benghazi , libya , calls into question much of what republicans accusing the obama administration of a cover-up have said about the incident . the three main points of contention have been whether the attack was planned , whether it was sparked by an anti-muslim video , and whether al qaeda was involved . however , the times says , the administration 's version , focusing on outrage over the inflammatory video , and first delivered by then-ambassador to the u.n. susan rice on sunday morning talk shows five days later , is n't exactly right , either .  the reality in benghazi was different , and murkier , than either of those story lines suggests . benghazi was not infiltrated by al qaeda , but nonetheless contained grave local threats to american interests . the attack does not appear to have been meticulously planned , but neither was it spontaneous or without warning signs ,  according to david d. kirkpatrick 's article in the times . it 's a conclusion that cnn has drawn in its previous reporting . the attack at the benghazi diplomatic compound has become a political flashpoint in a long-running battle between the white house and republicans , who accuse the obama administration of not bolstering security before the attack , of botching the response to it and of misleading the public for political gain less than two months before the november election . the gop suggests the administration removed specific terror references and stuck to the explanation advanced by rice -- later proved untrue -- that the attack was the result of spontaneous demonstrations over the u.s.-produced film  innocence of muslims ,  which contained scenes some muslims considered blasphemous . the white house and its allies in congress have said any confusion and conflicting information in the early hours and days after the assault stemmed from the  fog of war ,  not any deliberate effort to mislead the public . the white house had no comment when cnn requested a response to the times article . after reading it , obama 's former national security spokesman tommy vietor unleashed a series of tweets , including these , condemning republicans who 've spent more than a year lambasting and investigating the beghazi incident : . --  if rs spent 1/50th as much time as @ddknyt learning what really happened in #benhazi , we could have avoided months of disgusting demagoguery .  --  republicans inflated the role of al qaeda in #bengazi to attack obama 's ct record . they were wrong , and handed our enemy a propaganda win .  --  credit to @ddknyt but also disconcerting that his #benghazi article offered more insight into what happened than all congressional hearings .  the times ' article , which includes interviews with several libyan militia leaders who helped bring down col. moammar gadhafi 's dictatorship in 2012 , says no evidence supports speculation about al qaeda 's involvement in the benghazi attack . to the contrary , the times reports that the diverse and fractured opposition militias , many of whom were at least somewhat friendly toward u.s. interests , most likely contributed to the attack . that dovetails with the findings of the state department investigative panel report on benghazi .  the benghazi attacks also took place in a context in which the global terrorism threat as most often represented by al qaeda -lrb- aq -rrb- is fragmenting and increasingly devolving to local affiliates and other actors who share many of aq 's aims , including violent anti-americanism , without necessarily being organized or operated under direct aq command and control ,  the report said . the times report zeroes in on militia leader abu khattala as well as the like-minded islamist militia ansar al sharia . in a recent interview with cnn 's arwa damon , khattala acknowledged being at the benghazi mission after the attack but denied any involvement . damon spent two hours interviewing khattala at a coffee shop at a well-known hotel in benghazi . he allowed damon to use an audio recorder to tape the conversation , but refused to appear on camera . khattala 's narrative of the events that night was sometimes unclear and , at times , seemed to be contradictory , damon said . he admitted to being at the compound the night of the attack , but denied any involvement in the violence . asked about allegations he may have masterminded the attack , khattala and two of the men he brought with him to the interview  burst out laughing ,  damon said . khattala told cnn that he had not been questioned by either libyan authorities or the fbi . the militia leader was one of those whom u.s. prosecutors charged in the attacks , as cnn first reported . ansar al sharia is more a label than an organization , one that 's been adopted by conservative salafist groups across the arab world . the name means , simply ,  partisans of islamic law .  in benghazi , ansar al sharia was one of many groups that filled the vacuum of authority following the overthrow of gadhafi . the group 's central belief is that all authority is derived from the prophet mohammed , that democracy is un-islamic and that other branches of islam , such as the sufi , are heretical . there do not appear to be organizational links between ansar al sharia and al qaeda , but there is solidarity . among the group 's benghazi membership is mohammed al-zahawi , who fought to overthrow gadhafi and praised al qaeda leader ayman al zawahiri in a bbc interview . he said al qaeda 's statements  help galvanize the muslim nation , maintain its dignity and pride .  a different ansar al sharia is affiliated with al qaeda in the arabian peninsula in yemen , and budding franchises are said to exist in tunisia , morocco and egypt .", "summary": " new york times article says competing storylines about 2012 benghazi attack likely are both wrong .   the report says contrary to gop assertions , al qaeda was probably not involved in the attack .   the article suggests independent libyan militias played a key role instead .   report : anti-muslim video may have sparked the violence , but not solely , as suggested by obama administration .
