{"text": "cherie booth qc will be among the judges to benefit from the supreme court ruling . taxpayers will have to pay a massive # 2 billion to thousands of part-time judges after ministers lost a seven-year court battle to stop them claiming the right to a pension . more than 8,000 sitting and thousands more retired part-time judges will be entitled to a public-sector pension for the first time after the decision by supreme court judges . among the beneficiaries will be cherie booth qc and millionaire tory mp stephen phillips qc . but none of the lawyers , many of whom have earned millions of pounds in legal aid , will have to contribute to their ` free ' pension -- meaning the treasury must find extra cash to settle the bill while at the same time cutting pay and pensions across the rest of the public sector . mps , public-sector workers and taxpayer groups last night condemned the decision . liberal democrat mp john hemming described the pensions payments as paying ` silly ' money to lawyers , adding : ` it strikes me that there is a conflict of interest if judges are sitting in judgment about the amount of money in their own pensions . ' matthew sinclair , chief executive of the taxpayers ' alliance pressure group , said : ` this judgment will cost taxpayers a huge amount of money at a time when they can least afford it . ' harry fletcher , assistant general secretary of the probation union napo , added : ` everyone else who draws a pension has paid into the relevant pot and the same should apply to part-time judges . ` it 's clearly not fair if someone can draw a pension when they 've not contributed to it . ' until now part-time judges , who are paid up to # 800 a day , were excluded from the government 's generous pension deals reserved for full-time members of the judiciary . a typical final-salary pension for a part-time judge who has served 25 years will be worth about # 125,000 -- or # 5,000 a year over 25 years . but some fee-paid judges who sit almost all year long could be entitled to pensions valued at more than # 1 million . hundreds of part-time judges who have retired have launched legal action against the government to get back-dated pensions . the . government said it was justified in excluding part-time and fee-paid . judges on the basis of fairness and cost , but the supreme court judges . rejected that argument . most . part-time judges are wealthy barristers and solicitors who have made . millions out of the legal aid system , have had successful careers at the . bar and already have their own separate private pensions . lib dem mp john hemming , left , described the pensions payments as ` silly ' . tory mp stephen phillips qc , right , will be among the beneficiaries . the decision to award them additional retirement payouts comes after a seven-year legal battle by a leading qc , dermot o'brien , who claimed the judicial pension scheme for salaried full-time judges discriminated against those who worked part-time . mr o'brien , 73 , retired as a part-time recorder in 2005 . the barrister earned hundreds of thousands of pounds during his 27 years of judicial service , but argued that under european law it was unfair to deny him an additional pension . the ministry of justice said : ` the recent court judgment in the o'brien case on the employment status of fee-paid judges is complex and its implications need to be considered in full . it remains subject to further legal proceedings so the final outcomes and costs remain highly uncertain . ' it added : ` the department has estimated that in the worst-case scenario the maximum possible exposure to the judicial pension scheme could be up to # 2 billion . there is no immediate cost to the taxpayer , and any future liabilities would be met over a period of several years . ' paul epstein qc , of barristers ' chambers cloisters , which represented mr o'brien , said : ` mr o'brien illustrates the importance for both public and private sector employers of ensuring that pay differentials are not discriminatory . ` the government had argued that for a number of different reasons the differentials in pay between part-time and full-time judges were objectively justified . ` the court decided in the end that all those reasons came down to cost , and that cost can never objectively justify discrimination . ' he told the mail on sunday : ` so although in the current financial crisis there is often a limited budget available to employers , and it is up to employers to decide how much of that budget to use to pay employees , employers can not discriminate between employees when fixing pay from that budget . ' many people think judges are out of touch . this astonishing pension grab proves they are greedy as well . for an already highly affluent clique to insist on their legal entitlement to as much as # 2 billion in extra pension perks -- money which does not exist , and will have to be taken from future taxation -- is an insult to the public they are supposed to serve . britain is already convulsed by the financial consequences of having promised too much in pensions to too many civil servants . not only has the cost become unsupportable , especially for an economy that is not growing , but the issue sparks division and resentment . there are the public-sector workers on the one hand with enviable , inflation-proofed pensions underwritten by the treasury , and then there is everyone else battling to save for retirement when interest rates are the lowest in history . judges sit in splendour at the very top of the pensions pile . their entitlements are lavish beyond the dreams of the average saver . and the cost to the taxpayer is eye-watering . currently , judges need to work for just 20 years to retire on the equivalent of half their final salary , which they can collect along with a handsome one-off sum . for a high court judge , that could mean retiring on about # 90,000 plus a # 200,000 cash payment . compare that to an average 65-year-old man wanting to buy an inflation-linked pension today from an insurance company . to obtain similar benefits to those enjoyed by the judge , he would have had to amass # 2 million in his pension fund . if he were self-employed or a private sector worker , he would have had to contribute most of that himself . the government is rightly seeking to cut back judges ' pensions along with those of other public-sector workers . but the profession has so far proved highly resistant . this case , involving part-timers , suggests judges are hell-bent on taking everything to which they and their legal allies in the courts can argue that they are entitled to . the financial crisis has thrown up many cases where bankers and others have tried to prove legal entitlements to vast pensions and payoffs , but where shareholders and the public have furiously disagreed . a court may approve these payments to judges -- but that does not make them right .", "summary": " more than 8,000 sitting and thousands .   more retired part-time judges will be entitled to a public-sector .   pension for the first time after the decision by supreme court judges .
