{"text": "our understanding of what lies underneath the world 's biggest ice sheet has just grown exponentially . scientists at nasa have used decades of research and data from the british antarctic survey , images from the ice , cloud and land elevation satellite plus results from years of flyovers by specialized aircraft measuring changes in the thickness of sea ice , glaciers , and ice sheets , to create the most detailed rendering of the earth 's surface beneath the ice of antarctica ever . the new model , bedmap2 , is an update of bedmap , which was made more than 10 years ago . the new images are a significant improvement on the previous map , containing 25 million additional data points and surface and sub-ice features that were too small to be seen in the previous data-set . scroll down for video . what lies beneath : this image is part of bedmap2 , and shows the surface of the earth in antarctica without its usual coating of ice and snow . the new map of the ice-covered landmass is important for scientists studying the effects of climate change because antarctica plays a pivotal role within the global climate system , affecting ocean currents and raising sea levels . its influence will increase as the globe continues to warm . researchers previously used a variety of methods to attempt to predict how antarctica will react to a changing climate , but the limited information about the depth of the ice and the surface of the bedrock made it imprecise . remote : it 's no wonder people have never seen what the surface of the earth beneath antarctica 's snow looks like - in some places , the ice is three kilometres thick . now with bedmap2 , researchers can use the detailed map and its new data on average bedrock depth , deepest point and ice thickness to more accurately predict how the continent will react to future climactic conditions . from a distance : the antarctic ice sheet covers 98 per cent of the continent and contains more than half of the world 's fresh water . the more accurate the map , the better . scientists can understand the impact that melting ice from antarctica . will have on the rest of the planet . antarctica 's ice is n't static but constantly flows outwards . version 2.0 : bedmap2 , seen here contrasted with bedmap which was created in 2001 , has 25 million measurements more than its predecessor . ` ice sheets grow because of snow , and like honey poured on a plate , spread outward and thin due to their own weight , ' sophie nowicki , an ice sheet scientist at nasa 's goddard space flight center in greenbelt , maryland , told nasa.gov . knowing the shape of the bedrock beneath the ice and the thickness . of the ice itself allows scientists to simulate the movements of the ice . and predict how it will move in the future . ` it will be an important resource for the next generation of ice sheet modelers , physical oceanographers and structural geologists , ' said peter fretwell , british antarctic survey scientist and lead author of the project .", "summary": " using decades of research , scientists at nasa have created the most accurate map of antarctica 's landscape ever .   the map shows the bedrock beneath antarctica 's ice and snow as well as the thickness of the continent 's ice sheets .   scientists say the map will enable them to more accurately predict how antarctica will react to climate change in the future and the effect it will have on rising sea levels and ocean currents .   ice sheets cover 98 per cent of the continent and in some places are three kilometers thick .
