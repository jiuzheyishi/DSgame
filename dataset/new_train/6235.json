{"text": "derek warwick , the british steward who cleared nico rosberg of cheating at the monaco grand prix , has urged lewis hamilton to ` man up ' over the decision and move on . hamilton was angry that rosberg slithered off the track at the mirabeau corner in the dying minutes of qualifying . it caused yellow flags to be waved , preventing hamilton from finishing his final lap and leaving rosberg in pole position . rosberg went on to win the race , with hamilton insinuating afterwards that data he saw showed his mercedes team-mate had acted deliberately . not happy : lewis hamilton -lrb- left -rrb- was unimpressed by the behaviour of his mercedes team-mate nico rosberg -lrb- right -rrb- during qualifying for the monaco grand prix . leading the way : rosberg -lrb- right -rrb- pulls away from hamilton -lrb- left -rrb- in monte carlo on sunday . but warwick , who is president of the british racing drivers ' club , silverstone 's owners , and a veteran of 146 formula one races , said : ` i understand that lewis was upset . possibly he would have gone faster than nico on that lap . arguably the incident cost him the grand prix . ` i do n't want to give him advice really -- he has won umpteen races and a world championship -- but if i were to say anything it would be to man up and concentrate on the next race in canada . ' speaking about the stewards ' decision for the first time , warwick told sportsmail : ` you could argue that as president of the brdc i would have a reason to come to a decision that would have favoured the british driver , but obviously that is not how i would approach it . i am there to be independent . ` it is a big decision to make when you are deciding to move a driver to the back of the grid . it was doubly important to get it right because it could affect many things -- probably the outcome of the race and possibly of the world championship . ` we had all mercedes 's data , including lewis 's data to overlay on nico 's . we had the fia data . we had onboard shots , overhead shots , circuit shots . we had throttle traces , braking traces , everything we needed to make , hopefully , the right decision . time to move on : hamilton has been urged to concentrate on this weekend 's canadian grand prix by steward derek warwick . no regrets : rosberg was cleared of any wrongdoing by the fia 's team of stewards . ` it was not black and white . it took a long time . we wanted to be sure and thorough . ` the driver is a massive component in what we end up deciding . so nico was in the stewards ' room for a long time with the team manager -lrb- ron meadows -rrb- . i would n't say i interrogated him ; i interviewed him . i made sure i asked him all the right questions . ` i have been around a long time and seen people try to pull the wool over my eyes . did i i have doubts in my mind , of course i did . but he gave me the answers i needed . ` i know there are conspiracy theories but you will not find a more honest driver in grand prix racing than nico . he said himself that he made a mistake , came in too fast , braked too late and locked up his rear tyres . ' the fia brought in former drivers as stewards -- of whom warwick is one of the most respected for his sense of fairness -- to help the panel make informed decisions . there was unanimity among the four stewards in this case . not laughing now : hamilton claimed he is not friends with rosberg in the aftermath of the monaco grand prix .", "summary": " hamilton was angered when he was prevented from finishing his final lap in qualifying because of yellow flags being waved .   rosberg started in pole position and won the monaco grand prix .   warwick has advised hamilton to move on and concentrate on this weekend 's race in canada .
