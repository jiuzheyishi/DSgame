{"text": "what is it with juries in high-profile cases in southern california ? over the years , they 've become a national joke . but no one is laughing . instead , with each travesty of justice and every acquittal that should have been a conviction , you 're left wondering just what trial these 12 folks were watching and questioning whether we should have higher standards for who sits on a jury . sometimes , the juries in local and state courts get it wrong , and the justice department must step in and make it right . think back to the acquittal in april 1992 of four los angeles police officers who , one year earlier , savagely beat motorist rodney king . they walked out of a courtroom in simi valley , california , as free men -- sparking days of rioting , looting and violence . at the time , the conventional thinking on newspaper editorial pages and on talk radio was the jurors in that largely white suburb of los angeles , which was itself home to many active-duty and retired police officers , saw the police force as their line of defense against undesirables like king . so naturally , the argument went , they would cut them some slack . the officers were tried again , and convicted in federal court of violating king 's civil rights . justice was finally served . here we go again . there has n't been much civil unrest over what happened to kelly thomas , the homeless and mentally ill man who -- on july 5 , 2011 -- was beaten to death by a swarm of police officers in fullerton , california . but now that the verdict is in , literally , on the two former officers who were charged in his death , there is plenty of outrage on talk radio , online and in other public forums . another 12 people who swore an oath to consider the evidence and the law and make sure that justice is served appear to have gotten it terribly wrong . this week , that jury in santa ana , california -- a city about 30 miles southeast of los angeles -- produced a wave of gasps in the courtroom when it announced that it had found manuel ramos , who had been charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter , and jay cicinelli , who was charged with involuntary manslaughter and excessive use of force , not guilty on all counts . what ? the beating was caught on a surveillance tape . when you watch those 33 minutes of footage , assuming you can stomach the experience , it 's hard to believe that anyone could declare the perpetrators  not guilty .  the surveillance camera footage shows thomas being beaten and stunned with a taser by police until he was unrecognizable and unconscious . you see a defenseless and compliant young man screaming in pain , saying he 's sorry and pleading for help from his father . his words will haunt you ,  daddy , help ! they 're killing me !  according to prosecutors , the young man suffered brain injuries , facial fractures , broken ribs and extensive bruises and abrasions . he wound up lying in a pool of blood . he died five days later . this was not a by-the-book case of police officers using all necessary force to subdue a suspect who was resisting arrest -- a suspect , by the way , who had committed no crime . this was not , as ramos ' attorney claimed , a case of police offices simply  doing their job  with  no malice in their heart .  check the video . early on in the confrontation , ramos appears to tell the young man who is sitting on the ground :  you see my fists ? they 're getting ready to f -- you up !  another officer is heard telling a comrade :  we ran out of options so i got to the end of my taser and i ... smashed his face to hell .  there is the malice . this was abuse of power and an instance of bullying behind a badge . it happens more than we 'd like to think in america . but this time , it went too far . and a man died , and a family was shattered . yet , the jury somehow missed all this ? how does this happen ? in los angeles , people are saying that the mentally ill are the new rodney king . in the same way that the jury in simi valley was inclined to back the officers who it saw as protecting them from people like king , now the jury in santa ana is backing the officers who it counts on to prod people like thomas to move along , leave the streets , and get out of sight . it 's a plausible explanation . human beings are n't perfect , and sometimes those who sit on juries are plagued by their own prejudices -- in this case , against those who behave in erratic ways which we do n't understand . this much we can understand : cops are supposed to protect the weak , not prey on them . just like they 're supposed to protect all of us . the tragedy of kelly thomas raises a question : when police officers lose control and go from public servants to violent bullies , who will protect us from them ? in this case , there is only one answer and one place left that can right this wrong : the justice department . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of ruben navarrette .", "summary": " ruben navarrette : too many high-profile cases in california produce travesties of justice .   he says jury acquitted two ex-cops in malicious beating death captured on video .   he says case showed abuse of power , bullying behind badge ; happens too often in u.s.   navarrette : only one place left that can right this wrong : the justice department .
