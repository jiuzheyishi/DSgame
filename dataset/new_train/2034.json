{"text": "piers morgan likes to talk the talk but how did the cnn anchor fare when he had to walk the walk and face a cricket ball coming towards him at 150 kilometers an hour ? morgan , who likes to tweet from the lip , has been one of england 's most outspoken critics over the past few weeks following the team 's embarrassing capitulation against australia in the fiercely contested ashes series . and from the cosy surroundings of his u.s. home , morgan took to twitter to criticize england 's wretched batting in the first three ashes tests -- matches in which australia cruised to victory . but on friday in melbourne , where england are playing australia in the fourth test , morgan got a taste of what the touring batsmen have had to contend with over the last few weeks , though none of them were dumped onto their backside -- unlike the cnn anchor . facing former australian fast bowler brett lee , a man who took 310 wickets in 76 tests , morgan was pummeled during a six-ball blast . with lee not holding back , morgan gave the appearance of a rabbit caught in the headlights as he backed away from nearly every delivery . watch morgan 's ordeal on youtube . on four occasions the englishman was hit on the body , while he was also clean bowled by lee much to the amusement of the watching crowd of 2,000 , which included australian cricketers mitchell johnson and peter siddle .  he got hurt but he did n't get maimed , so that 's a positive step ,  lee told the sydney morning herald .  you have to give full credit to the guy -- he 's going to be really sore tomorrow .  but he kept on going , so you have to take your hat off to the guy .  the biggest smile around the ground was from mitchell johnson i think . i looked over at mitch and he gave me a wink , he was quite chuffed .  if the 48-year-old morgan was bloodied , he remained unbowed after his bruising experience .  it 's made me reassess what you need out here on an ashes tour and that is courage , fortitude and a churchillian spirit of never giving in despite overwhelming odds ,  he said . cnn digital writer chris murphy plays amateur cricket with morgan , so what was his analysis of his teammate 's performance ?  having played cricket with piers on numerous occasions , it 's well known he has two shots : a forward defense and a heave to the leg side ,  said murphy .  sadly , he was n't able to exhibit either .  charging down the wicket at someone bowling nearly 150 kph is n't brave , it 's just plain stupid . but piers deserves full marks for the guts he showed in the face of a relentless barrage from brett lee .  the sight of any batsman backing away from his stumps is a sign he 's troubled by the pace of the bowler , but in this case it was probably a wise idea to prevent his chin being shattered .  a still head , straight bat and balance are the fundamentals of batting -- sadly for piers , none of those elements were on show in melbourne . thankfully though , he is still alive to tell the tale .  the england players who were the subject of morgan 's twitter angst did at least return to form friday to take control of the fourth test at the mcg . their nemesis johnson took five wickets to leave england 255 all out , but the visitors hit back to have the home side reeling on 167 for nine at stumps and facing the prospect of defeat after three earlier easy victories . in south africa , fast bowler dale steyn put on a display that lee at his best would be proud of , taking six wickets for 100 runs as india were all out for 334 in their first innings in durban . retiring legend jacques kallis became only the second man in test history to take 200 catches during the course of the second day .", "summary": " cnn anchor piers morgan went head to head with australian bowler brett lee .   morgan left flat on his backside at melbourne cricket ground .   the 48-year-old anchor hit four times in six deliveries .   england fight back in fourth test to take control on second day .
