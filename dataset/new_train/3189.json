{"text": "tory mp kris hopkins claimed muslim men were fundamentally sexist towards women . a tory mp has sparked controversy after claiming ` gangs of muslim men are going round and raping white kids at this moment in time ' . kris hopkins , mp for keighley , said the extraordinary claim was a ` fact ' and urged government agencies to tackle the problem . but he has been criticised by muslim leaders in his constituency , who said he overstepped the mark during a commons debate . mr hopkins , a former leader of bradford city council , also claimed muslim men were ` fundamentally ' sexist towards women , and politicians had to challenge behaviour and culture . speaking in a parliamentary debate on child sexual exploitation , mr hopkins claimed mainstream parties had failed by not speaking out about the racial and cultural aspect to some abuse cases and extremists groups had filled the vacuum . he told mps : ` the british national party will use grooming as a key element of its campaign in the rotherham election campaign , which will start soon . ` not all british pakistani men are abusing white kids . there is a minority , though . the media coverage gives long lists of notorious abusers - including vicars , priests and celebrities - who are all white and non-muslim . ' the ` vast majority ' of child abusers in this country are white , he added . ` but we should not get away from the fact that gangs of muslim men are going round and raping white kids at this moment in time . ` that is an horrendous thing to say , but it is the fact of what is happening . i want to explore some of the state 's agencies ' behaviour towards that , and some of the community 's associated behaviour and culture . ' mr hopkins conceded that his friends in the commons and ` back home ' would not like what he was saying , but he felt it had to be said . ` fundamentally , there is a sexist behaviour by muslim men towards women , ' he said . ` we talk about institutions and commissions and all the rest of it . fundamentally , as leaders , we need to challenge the behaviour that is going on . ` we need to do that from a point , though , of not being racist . we are friends who want those people to be successful in our society . they are part of british society , but there is behaviour that is unacceptable . ' bradford council for mosques said mr hopkins had overstepped the mark . a spokesman said : ` all of us , muslim or non-muslim , are equally appalled by the activities of criminals amidst our society . ` to suggest that the muslim community does not care is grossly libellous . kris hopkins is right to draw the attention to the activities of the criminals and the plight of the victims but he has overstepped his remit , ' he told the bradford telegraph and argus . ` he has the right to be angry but , equally , a man of his position should be more discerning in what he says and how he says it . he should not overlook the fact that he went around pleading for votes from the same muslim faith institutions that he so arrogantly dismissive of .
