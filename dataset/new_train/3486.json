{"text": "the world 's first mobile team to administer euthanasia in patients ' homes will be launched next month . units will be dispatched when family doctors refuse to administer lethal drugs on ` ethical ' grounds . they are expected to send the number of euthanasia cases in holland soaring , with pro-campaigners claiming they will end the lives of an additional 1,000 patients a year . no way back : the units will euthanise patients by administering a strong sedative to put them in a coma , followed by a drug to stop them breathing . officially , 2,700 dutch people a year choose assisted suicide , but critics say the real figure is far higher . the launch of the first unit , which will consist of at least a doctor and a nurse , was confirmed on radio netherlands by the country 's right to die association . the group confirmed the unit in the hague will be the first of six that will target borderline cases in which family gps are reluctant to administer euthanasia . it is likely to be used with mentally ill patients or those with early dementia , involving the patient 's gp only ` if possible ' , the association has said . the group has previously claimed that 80 per cent of people with dementia or mental illnesses were being ` missed ' by the country 's euthanasia laws . but the federation of dutch physicians fears the teams may end the lives of people who could be treated . ` in the worst cases , people could die who perhaps could have received some other help , ' a spokesman said . in britain , phyllis bowman of right to life said she was ` absolutely appalled ' by the development . ` this is a real tragedy when you consider that in the second world war the dutch refused to implement the nazi euthanasia programme . ' she added : ` people here should be warned that if we allowed euthanasia they might have a mobile unit at their door at some time . ' the units , which are backed by the dutch government , must conform to the 2002 law that made holland the first country in the world to allow euthanasia since nazi germany . value of life : archbishop of canterbury dr rowan williams said this week that it would be a ` disaster ' if assisted suicide was legalised in britain . this law stipulates that a person can only quality for euthanasia if their suffering is lasting and unbearable . the units were first revealed by health minister edith schippers in the dutch parliament late last year . she said that units ` for patients who meet the criteria for euthanasia but whose doctors are unwilling to carry it out ' was worthy of consideration . in holland , euthanasia is carried out by administering a strong sedative to put the patient in a coma , followed by a drug to stop breathing and cause death . the dutch government insists ` the greatest care ' is taken to offer euthanasia only to patients ` who are suffering unbearably with no prospect of improvement ' . the archbishop of canterbury , dr rowan williams , said in a general synod debate this week that it would be a ` disaster ' if assisted suicide was legalised in britain . ` to change the law on this subject is , i believe , to change something vital in our sense of the value of life itself , ' he said .", "summary": " teams will end the lives of additional 1,000 a year .   2,700 dutch people a year choose assisted suicide .
