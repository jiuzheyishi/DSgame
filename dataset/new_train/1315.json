{"text": "it does not take kevin pietersen long to get the heavy roller out in his latest book , which is not so much an autobiography but his version of the often troubled episodes that marked his final years in international cricket . you get the idea very early on , in the first few pages , as he recounts the meeting with alastair cook , paul downton and james whitaker when he is informed that his england career is effectively over .  the three wise men have decided that the disastrous ashes tour was all my fault ,  he declares . it can not , of course , be true that they believed it was all down to one man , and over the next three hundred pages we are invited to make our own minds up about whether he was treated fairly or not . kevin pietersen poses for pictures outside the bbc studios in salford before appearing on breakfast tv . by the very end of kp : my autobiography , he admits ` there should have been more cricket in these pages ' , and he would probably have helped his own cause if that were to be the case . the theme of persecution runs through it like letters through a stick of blackpool rock , as does the often very personal criticism of coach andy flower . there is too much of both , but it also leaves you to conclude that pietersen has been sinned against as well as sinning . the overall effect is to bestow a sense of melancholy as much as anything , for with a little more understanding of the human condition on both sides the most exciting england batsman of his generation might not be lost to the team , as he surely is now . there is something faintly tragic when he almost pleads in the final chapter  i hope it might not truly be over  with reference to england . there is admirable self-awareness , and the tacit admission that being a twenty20 freelance can never replace being a fully-fledged international , when he says in the preceding paragraph :  any player who has been to the top mourns the excitement when it ends .  pietersen is heavily critical of former england head coach andy flower -lrb- right -rrb- throughout the book . that helps make this book is a fascinating read , expertly and colourfully ghosted by journalist david walsh , and it will have an appeal well beyond the boundaries of the cricket constituency . when the smoke clears from all the vitriol and insults , there is much to glean for any follower of any sport . for instance the truism that success often only hides divisions in a dressing room , and that it is not necessarily the product of harmony behind the scenes . this effect is always exaggerated in cricket , which shoehorns players together for longer periods than any other pursuit . you are also reminded that even glamorous and gifted superstars of sport are as needy and insecure as anyone else , often more so . they are traits which abound in pietersen , although he is a complex man of many parts . i got to know him relatively well in the early part of his england career as we used to collaborate on a column for sportsmail together . many of the things i recognised at the start of his journey are still recognisable throughout this book : he is someone of immense drive and ambition , likeable in many ways , intelligent and good company , polite and with some strong values . he could also , sometimes unwittingly , be quite rude and selfish . pietersen takes in the applause after his famous century in the 2005 ashes test at the oval . you can understand him being upset by the attitude of what he terms the bowling clique of james anderson , stuart broad and graeme swann , who it is quite possible to imagine being a fairly malevolent force as a collective , if not as individuals . the business of the spoof twitter account directed at him clearly wounds him more deeply than anyone would imagine , and exposes his more vulnerable side . he also had to cope with what seems the general mistrust in our country , not just in cricket , of maverick exceptional talents . he could , unquestionably , have been handled better by the ecb and andy flower in particular . yet his brutal analysis of flower -- you may have read by now his description that 95 per cent of the time the coach was ` f *** ing horrendous ' -- simply does not stand up to scrutiny . flower 's methods could not have been so crude as clearly they worked for most of the time with outstanding results , and any fair-minded observer could hardly quarrel with what he and andrew strauss achieved . pietersen 's treatment of the coach , with whom the whole ipl question was evidently a constant bone of contention , is unnecessarily vicious . some of the ridicule heaped on matt prior is plain amusing , some of it surely unwarranted . his condescension towards alastair cook as a captain , who he almost describes as some sort of sergeant wilson figure from dad 's army , is a case of damning with the faintest praise , but may ring more true . flower and pietersen regularly clashed over the batsman 's desire to play in the ipl . it is hard to disagree with swann 's assessment on monday that he has soft-pedalled on some figures in order not to jeopardise the possibility of a return one day . one example of how pietersen has managed to alienate people through his career is a particularly gratuitous swipe at the undeserving nottinghamshire batsman james taylor , who he does not especially rate on account of his height . he refers to taylor 's father being a jockey , and suggests the son might be more suited for that profession . but ultimately you can not argue that pietersen deserves his say , he has clearly been misunderstood to a degree and , to his credit , he does acknowledge that he has made plenty of mistakes . he is not as bad as some would portray him , but not as pure as he would portray himself . that is like so many autobiographies , but it would be wrong to paint this as any off-the-peg account of a sporting career . it is much better than that , and an essential read .", "summary": " kevin pietersen 's book , ` kp : my autobiography ' was released on monday .   pietersen gives his version of the events that led to his england exile .
