{"text": "london with her lashings of butter and flirtations with the camera , celebrity chef nigella lawson has charmed her many fans by turning everyday cooking into a more sensual experience . as she 's licked her fingers while talking viewers through her recipes , she has earned nicknames such as  domestic goddess  and the  queen of food porn  in the british media . but her successful cooking career has not been mirrored in her recent personal life . her 10-year marriage to millionaire art collector charles saatchi collapsed after photos of the couple having an argument at a restaurant emerged in june . in the photos -- which were splashed across the front pages of national newspapers at the time -- saatchi has his hand around lawson 's throat . saatchi accepted a police caution for assault , and the couple announced they would divorce soon after . since then , the trial of the couple 's two former personal assistants -- who were cleared friday of defrauding lawson and saatchi of hundreds of thousands of pounds -- has gripped the media . this has mainly been thanks to revelations of drug use by lawson and insights into her troubled marriage to saatchi . during the trial , the two former assistants , italian sisters francesca and elisabetta grillo told the court they believed the celebrity chef repeatedly used drugs . saatchi had said in an e-mail that lawson had used drugs regularly , but in his testimony before the court last month , he backed off that claim . the court heard that none of the witnesses had seen her take drugs . in her own testimony , lawson , 53 , confirmed she had taken cocaine half a dozen times , during two periods of her life , and used cannabis in the past . but she denied being a habitual user , saying ,  i did not have a drug problem , i had a life problem .  ' i am not a chef ' her admission of limited drug use may cause some surprise because of lawson 's connections with the british political establishment . born in london , she is the daughter of nigel lawson , a former conservative party british chancellor of the exchequer , or finance minister . her brother dominic was formerly editor of the spectator , a british conservative political magazine . in the 1980s , before lawson married him , saatchi ran saatchi & saatchi , a leading global advertising agency , with his brother . its campaigns included the promotion of the conservative party under then-prime minister margaret thatcher . after studying at oxford university , the celebrity chef began her career in publishing before moving into media , writing restaurant columns . she met her first husband , john diamond , while working at the sunday times newspaper . the couple had two children . in 2001 , diamond died after a battle with throat cancer . lawson went on to contribute to various uk newspapers before writing books . in 1998 , she brought out  how to eat ,  in which she stated how food was an early love .  i am not a chef . i am not even a trained or professional cook . my qualification is as an eater ,  she wrote . her second book --  how to be a domestic goddess ,  in which she taught readers how to feel just like that while baking muffins or cakes -- came out two years later and won her the british book award for author of the year . lawson went on to release a string of other successful cookbooks and host numerous cooking television shows , such as  nigella bites  in britain . in the united states , she 's been a judge on the abc show  the taste ,  which is due to air its second season starting in january . she also launched a successful kitchenware line and once oversaw a lunch menu for former british prime minister tony blair and former u.s. president george w. bush . lawson lists her recipes on her website and posts them on her twitter account .", "summary": " fans call nigella lawson the  domestic goddess  and  queen of food porn    trial of ex-assistants gripped media , thanks to disclosure of her drug use and marriage woes .    i did not have a drug problem , i had a life problem ,  lawson told the court .   her marriage to millionaire charles saatchi ended this year .
