{"text": "sao paulo paulo henrique machado shares pictures of some of his most cherished memories : the first time he saw the beach , a formula one race and a party from his childhood when all his friends dressed as clowns . and yet he has lived the last 43 years -- almost his entire life -- in brazil 's biggest hospital . as an infant , he contracted polio and was left paralyzed from the waist down . he breathes with the help of a respirator . it was the 1970s , before vaccines eradicated polio in brazil , and machado was sent to live in the polio ward with eight other children .  it was a wonderful time . i 'll never forget it ,  he said during a recent interview from his hospital bed .  even though most of our friends are no longer with us , i never stopped dreaming about them .  his mother died two days after he was born and the rest of machado 's family soon stopped visiting . he points to a black and white picture of a boy in a pointy hat and clown makeup curled up in a wheelchair .  that 's pedro ,  he says .  back then , it was him and me , we were very close . he was my friend .  over the years many of the children died , including pedro .  it was december 26 , the day after christmas ,  he says .  everything that i planned with my friend , life did n't have the same meaning . but it made me stronger .  the children were given little chance of surviving past the age of 10 , but two people did : machado and his lifelong friend and roommate eliana zagui . they still live together in a room tucked inside the intensive care unit of sao paulo 's clinicas hospital .  we 're like brother and sister and we look after each other ,  machado says . zagui suffered paralysis caused by polio when she was a ba i 've been here since i was 1 year and 9 months old ,  she tells us .  i learned to write , to paint , to use a cell phone , a computer , things i like .  they were both encouraged to push beyond their physical limitations . more polio cases confirmed in syria , who says . zagui recently wrote a book about her experience growing up in the hospital . she also discovered painting , patiently dabbing at the canvas with a brush taped to a tongue depressor . the wear and tear on her teeth meant she had to limit herself but she has n't stopped . machado trained as a computer animator and wrote a screenplay for an animated series . with the help of crowd-funding and a group of animators , the series is coming to life .  they 're inspirational ,  says dr. nuno da silva , a physician who has worked in the icu since 1988 . he says that when they have patients who have been paralyzed in car accidents they take them to spend some time with machado and zagui .  they 're examples to show it is n't the end of the world ,  he says . still , they both wish they could visit , or even live , in the outside world .  when i turned 10 , the hospital tried to convince my relatives to take me in ,  says machado .  but that 's not what happened . so we stayed here .  machado 's biggest passions are movies and videogames , opportunities to escape his own world .  i like to live outside my reality ,  he says .  to get out of reality i play games , because in the games i can go where i want without suffering any pain .  there was a decade of freedom when machado used an electric wheelchair to come and go with relative ease . but then post-polio syndrome set in , causing gradual weakening in muscles that were affected by the original infection . it became impossible for him to straighten his legs enough to sit in a wheelchair -- so travel is now only done lying down in hospital beds . but that has n't stopped him . on one of our visits he invites us to join him on an outing to a big videogame convention . moving around is complicated -- he travels in an ambulance with medical technicians paid for by donations . another complication : the respirator . machado does n't need it 24 hours , but he feels more secure , having it just in case . but once inside the videogame convention , we enter machado 's world . he laughs with excitement as a group of medical technicians and friends roll him around on a mobile hospital bed . then he tries his hand at a few games .  you do n't pay attention to anything else around you ,  he says .  it 's great , you just want to discover more .  for a day , at least , the tubes , the respirator , the hospital bed , they all fade into the background , and machado becomes invincible .", "summary": " paulo henrique machado has lived most his 43 years in a sao paulo hospital bed .   machado contracted polio as an infant ; his mother died soon after his birth .   machado and his roommate , eliana zagui , have become inspirations to others with paralysis .
