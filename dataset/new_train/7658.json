{"text": "excited members of an expedition in michigan believe they may have found the underwater grave of the griffin , the first european ship to traverse the upper great lakes before disappearing mysteriously 334 years ago . divers this weekend opened a pit at the base of a wooden beam that juts nearly 11 feet from the bottom of lake michigan , believing it could be a section of the vessel , the rest presumably entombed in mud . they picked up the pace monday with more powerful equipment after a weekend of probing showed that whatever is buried is deeper than sonar readings indicated . u.s. and french experts insist it is too early to say whether there 's a shipwreck - let alone the griffin . but anticipation is building at the prospect of solving a maritime puzzle that 's more than three centuries old . scroll down for video . expedition : french underwater archaeologist olivia hulot jots notes while inspecting a timber jutting from the bottom of northern lake michigan that experts believe could be part of the long-lost ship the griffin . lost : the disappearance of the griffin -lrb- or ` le griffin ' -rrb- in 1679 when it traversed the upper great lakes has been one of the great maritime mysteries . built on orders of legendary french explorer rene robert cavelier de la salle , the ship ventured from niagara falls to lake michigan 's green bay but disappeared during its return in 1679 . ` after we get done for the day , everybody calls or comes to the house and they 're like ,  what did you find ? what did you see ? can you tell me anything ?  ' said local commercial fisherman larry barbeau in an interview sunday aboard his ship , the viking , which holds crucial expedition equipment , including ` umbilical ' cables that supply oxygen to divers . ` people are really interested and they 're excited to see what it is . ' his neighbors are n't the only curious ones . the roughly 40-member expedition team consists of archaeologists , historians , boat pilots , divers , an underwater salvage crew and assorted helpers . when not on the water , they stay in cottages and tents by the lake in the unincorporated village of fairport , in one of the most remote corners of michigan 's upper peninsula . some are relatives or longtime friends of mission chief steve libert , who has sought the ship for three decades . while researching the griffin long ago , libert ran across mike behrens , a milwaukee sheet-metal worker whose grandfather had searched the lake for chests of gold that legend says smugglers lost during the civil war . ' i came up here one year to witness what steve was doing , and i asked if i could dive with him , ' said behrens , 54 . ` been doing it ever since . ... i 've never met anyone as good at research as him , and he 's a very ethical guy . if he says it 's the griffin , i absolutely believe him . ' others have come aboard more recently , including three archaeologists from france who arrived over the weekend . explorer : the griffin was built on orders of legendary french explorer rene robert cavelier de la salle , who was not on board when the ship disappeared . wreck : crews are digging a pit at the base of a beam in lake michigan to see if it 's attached to a buried ship . the hands-on excavation work is being handled by a three-man crew from great lakes diving and salvage , a michigan company that ordinarily deals with mundane tasks : repairing pumps or scraping zebra mussels off intake pipes . ` we 're basically underwater janitors , ' said tom gouin , vice president of operations . the griffin , he said , is ` like a play job for us . we 're loving it . ' the team has had to adjust its strategy , as the excavation is proving to be a bigger-than-expected challenge . sonar scans in years past had suggested that an object similar to the griffin 's reputed size rested about 2 feet beneath the lake floor . but commercial divers on friday found the bottom caked with a thick layer of invasive , fingernail-size quagga mussel shells . after tunneling through mussels , the divers began sucking away gravel and sediments , never hitting anything solid . by sunday night , the hole reached about 8 feet below the lake bed and it was n't clear how far down the wooden beam extended or what it might be attached to , said ken vrana , the project manager . but as more is exposed , the post . appears increasingly likely to be part of a ship , said michel l'hour , . director of france 's department of underwater archaeological research . ` we . never saw a timber standing like this one , ' he said . ` so it 's . impossible to imagine it otherwise , so one can expect that there is a . hull . ' play : excited actors who in 1976 re-enacted la salle 's journey across the great lakes and down the mississippi river , reunited in fairport , mich. , near the griffin 's potential shipwreck . archaeologists rob reedy , of morehead city , n.c. , and misty jackson , of leslie , mich. , sit on the viking and sift through material that was found in the sediment , watching for artifacts , from bronze cannons to axes or knives - ` anything man-made ' that would help identify a ship , reedy said . thus far , the only candidate has been a slab of blackened wood about 15 inches long with characteristics suggesting it might have been fashioned by human hands . its origin remains unknown . visitors inspired by the long-lost ship have drifted into the area during the search , including a 9-year-old who wrote a school paper about the griffin and men in period costumes and handmade canoes who in 1976 re-enacted la salle 's journey across the great lakes and down the mississippi river . carl behrend , a folk singer and self-described ` pretty-soon major movie star ' who lives 90 minutes north on lake superior , performed an impromptu concert outside the food tent sunday night . he said he 's composing a song about the griffin . ` it 's rattling around in my head , ' he said .", "summary": " divers are exploring the area around a wooden beam at the lake 's bottom .   some believe the beam is part of the griffin , built by legendary french explorer rene robert cavelier de la salle .   the griffin disappeared in 1679 after being the first european ship to traverse the upper great lakes .   experts say its too soon to tell if the beam is part of a ship .   for more videos of the dive click here .
