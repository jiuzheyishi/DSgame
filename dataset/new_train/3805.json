{"text": "australian scientists have developed a pair of anti-shark wetsuits that make divers appear invisible by camouflaging their bodies in the sea and trick sharks into thinking surfers are poisonous . a team of researchers from the university of western australia joined forces with designers from shark attack mitigation systems -lrb- sams -rrb- to create the suits . the blue pattern of the elude suit ca n't be seen by the shark because the fish are colour blind . while the stripes on the diverter suit mimic the colours of poisonous fish to warn the sharks off . scroll down for video . the elude wetsuit -lrb- pictured -rrb- with its unusual design of jagged blue shapes , conceals divers from sharks by exploiting the predator 's colour blindness . scientists and shark experts took two years to develop the wetsuit which acts like an invisibility cloak underwater in a bid to keep swimmers safe . a surfer -lrb- left -rrb- and a diver -lrb- right -rrb- wear the two styles of wetsuits with the surfer holding a surfboard . the technology was designed by sams in collaboration with the oceans institute at the university of western australia . the creators claim the suits could save lives . the elude wetsuit is designed to be used by swimmers and divers and are covered in a jagged blue pattern , which works to conceal divers from sharks . the predators were recently found to be colour blind . while sharks are known to have a keen sense of smell , scientists believe that they rely heavily on their vision in the final - often deadly - phase of a shark attack . the pattern uses disruptive coloration and shaping , which is difficult for a shark to see and also blends in with background colours . the combination of contrasting colours and differing sizes of the shapes on the elude wetsuits -lrb- pictured -rrb- ensures optimal effect at various depths and distances , ' according to sams . the company believes that while a shark might smell or sense a person in the water , it is much less likely to attack if it can not see the target . the new wetsuit designs , aimed at making a surfer look less like a seal - a favorite food for sharks - have been launched and tested in perth . this combination of contrasting colours and differing types and sizes of the shapes ` ensures optimal effect at various depths and distances , ' according to sams . the company believes that while a shark might smell or sense a person in the water , it is much less likely to attack if it can not see the target . scientists at sams and the university also developed a wetsuit called diverter that works in the opposite way . it is designed to scare off sharks . the diverter wetsuit has navy and white stripes that are seen on some poisonous animals and fish to make the shark think they diver is dangerous . the designers have also created matching surfboard stickers . according to sams , years of anecdotal evidence . suggests that a stripe pattern acts as a deterrent or repellent to . sharks . but the scientists found that very . specific contrasting colours , shapes and dimensions work together for . maximum effect . the reflective spectrum or light . reflective properties of various colours that change at different water . depths were of huge interest to the scientists . ` diverted altogether , or at least delayed , allowing time for evasive . action , ' sams said . the diverter wetsuit -lrb- pictured -rrb- is designed for surfers and has bold navy and white stripes that mirror nature 's warning signs to present the wearer as something poisonous or unpalatable . according to sams , years of anecdotal evidence suggests that a stripe pattern acts as a deterrent or repellent to sharks . the team undertook extensive research to examine how sharks see and hunt underwater to create the wetsuits -lrb- pictured -rrb- . scientists used molecular biology techniques to study the genes responsible for coding the retinal visual pigments found in sharks ' eyes to help them develop the patterns . the team undertook extensive research to examine how sharks see and hunt underwater . professor shaun collin and . professor nathan hart from the university used molecular biology techniques to study . the genes responsible for coding the retinal visual pigments found in . the eyes of selected species of large sharks . they wanted to isolate the effect that certain colours and shapes have on sharks ' sensory systems as well as if certain combinations were particularly conspicuous or unrecognisable to the underwater predators . they modelled various underwater light fields to determine the spatial resolving power , spectral sensitivity and light gathering ability of the shark visual system by using specialist research software . their findings led to the development of a patterned surface that seems either unrecognisable or dangerous to sharks - which is a lot more useful that the reflectance of a traditional wetsuit . sharks such as the great white -lrb- pictured -rrb- are some of nature 's most feared predators . the # 300 wetsuits were developed by scientists in a bid to protect people from deadly shark attacks . there have been five fatal attacks off the coast of western australia in the last 12 months . using their findings , they tested the patterns on computer models where divers swam at different depths , to determine the optimum . contrasting stripe width and spacing . talking about the diverter design for surfers , professor collin told the guardian : ` many animals in biology are repelled . by noxious animals -- prey that provide a signal that somehow says ` do n't . eat me ' -- and that has been manifest in a striped pattern . ` we are using a lot of nature 's technology , based on high-contrast-based banding patterns . ` the wearer will be obvious , and the idea is the shark will see that as an unpalatable food item and swim right by . ' it is hoped that the wetsuit can reduce the number of people who are fatally attacked by sharks . western australia has suffered five fatal attacks in the last year , which gave the state its unfortunate reputation of shark attack capital of the world . the wetsuits took around two years to develop and cost around # 300 -lrb- $ 495 -rrb- from radiator wetsuits . sams has also developed stickers for surfboards -lrb- pictured -rrb- that are designed to be shark repellant in an effort to keep surfers safer .", "summary": " australian scientists have developed wetsuits that prevent shark attacks .   the elude suit conceals divers by exploiting the shark 's colour blindness .   the striped diverter suit tricks sharks into thinking the surfer is poisonous .
