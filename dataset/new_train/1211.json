{"text": "young : ivor perl was sent to hitler 's camps when he was just 11 years old . in this picture , taken after he was liberated , he is 14 . in february of 1945 ivor perl , 13 , was standing in the snow cold , hungry , desperate , and dimly aware that under normal circumstances it would be time for his bar mitzvah . but instead of a celebration , ivor , staring through the fence of allach , a nazi concentration camp , had been put to work for months on end with nothing more than thin prison clothes to protect him from the bitter winter , and a slice of bread a day to sustain him . remembering his desperation , ivor , now 81 , recalls : ` the camp was in the middle of the forest , and a fence ran through the trees . i was praying to god  help me , if you let me get out of this place , i shall not ask anything else of you in my life .  ' but his liberation was not to come for months , when the american soldiers would sweep into germany and , horrified , stumble upon the hellish camps where ivor and millions like him were held . so ivor , suffering not only from terrible deprivation and could , but a typhus infection , worked on through the winter . the gruelling regime hit him especially badly as , having pretended to be older than he was to avoid being killed , he had to do the work of an adult to keep up the act . ivor , a hungarian , was imprisoned in 1944 , after his country had been occupied by the nazis for attempting to defect to the allies . transported : ivor was forced on to a crowded railway car and transported to auscwitz in awful conditions -lrb- file picture -rrb- . he , his parents and his eight siblings were sent first to auschwitz , where women and children would be separated from men , and killed . ivor was saved because he mother ordered him to join the adults despite still being a boy . the decision saved his life , as his mother and seven of his siblings died in the camps . ` of course at the start , i ran over to my mother 's side , with the children and the women ' , ivor says . ' i told her :  i want to come with you , mum .  she said :  no , do n't come here .  ' he pleaded but gave in and joined one of his brothers in the other line . however , even then he was almost sent back to die by the notorious auschwitz camp dr josef mengele . ' i could see a german officer with white gloves ' , ivor says , ` who we heard later on was dr mengele . he was pointing left and right . and as he came to me , he suddenly stopped and said  how old are you ?  ` remembering what i was told , i said i was 16 . fortunately i was big for my age . ` i 've often , even now after all these years , i can remember his eyes as he was thinking to himself which side he should put me to . he must have thought that if i 'm lying i wo n't be strong enough so it does n't matter . ' in allach for the bitterest months of the year , ivor 's strength was sorely tested . an average meal in the camp was a slice of bread , a cup of hot water and , perhaps , a dab of margarine . to protect them from the weather , prisoners had only the infamous black-and-white striped prisoner underclothes and a thin cotton overcoat . desperate : these jewish survivors , mostly children , were photographed when auschwitz was liberated -lrb- file picture -rrb- . skeletal : children were kept in horrible conditions inside the camps . alongside hundreds of others , he was put to work on gruelling projects such as digging underground bases for military equipment with only rudimentary tools . order was kept with a combination of fear and extreme force . when nazi guards realised some prisoners were hiding in a cave to avoid work , they thought nothing of throwing grenades in after them . when a register of prisoners was taken in the morning , everyone faced an agonising decision of which group of labourers to join . some tasks were easier than others -- and the hardest work could easily drive struggling prisoners to death . one day ivor made a different choice to his brother , and did n't see him for three weeks . while his brother was posted to a farm , and allowed to eat decently for a time , ivor grew so emaciated and ill that his older sibling did not recognise him . marched : hungarian jews , marked with a star of david , queue on their way into auschwitz in 1944 , the same time ivor was taken to the camps -lrb- file picture -rrb- . work : children are seen behind barbed wire in auschwitz . indeed , at one point ivor 's typhus , which was ubiquitous in concentration camps , grew so bad he was referred to the camp hospital . ` the hospital block was laughable ' , ivor recalls . ` twice a day -- in the morning a camp doctor would come along , you would uncover yourself , he 'd see how much flesh you had on you , whether you were able to work . ` those who were not considered workable were pointed towards , and those people had to be taken away to be killed . all of us would push our stomach out to pretend we were more healthy than we were . ' with the help of his brother , ivor sneaked out of the hospital , where there was clearly no prospect of getting better . haunting : a recent images shows a wintery auschwitz as it is now , with the infamous slogan ` arbeit macht frei ' written above the gate . but outside , in the camp , things began to change , as the noise of allied war planes gradually began to fill the air . but for those still inside , it was n't a symbol of hope . ` they said the worse the germans treated us the more we were losing the war , ' ivor remembers . and indeed , the worst was yet to come . after weeks of restlessness in the camp , the order was given that it be abandoned . ivor and his brother were told that they must march , for days , to a larger camp . recollection : ivor perl , pictured recently , was able to start a new life in britain . they were given a single loaf of bread to sustain them for several days , and warned that if they finished it too soon there would be nothing else . part way through this gruelling journey , with a pace so uncompromising prisoners would die on their feet , it became too much . ` we were walking along in the mud and suddenly my brother and i accused each other of taking bigger bites than we should have done , ' ivor remembers . ` we started fighting and wrestling in the mud . ' ` and as we were fighting in the mud suddenly i could see a pair of army boots and the butt of a gun on the floor . ' the two thought -- with good reason -- they would soon be brutally punished . ` then suddenly we heard this soldier talking to us in hungarian ' , ivor says . ` he said  do n't fight , because you 'll soon be liberated and then afterwards you 'll be sorry you fought each other .  ` that was about the only kindness that i experienced in my camp life . ' even this was only a blip in the otherwise unrelenting suffering of ivor 's year under nazi persecution . but , as he marched towards dachau , where he would soon be liberated by the american forces , it was a sign of better things to come . after the war , ivor was granted a visa to come to the uk . he spent his working life in fashion retail , married and has four children and six grandchildren . ivor perl shared his story in conjunction with the holocaust memorial day trust . visit www.hmd.org.uk for more information .", "summary": " ivor perl , a hungarian jew , was sent to a ghetto aged 11 .   was sent to auschwitz in 1944 with his parents and eight siblings .   he pretended he was 16 to be sent to a labour camp instead of killed .   was sent to allach and forced to work on nazi projects in the snow .   ivor was liberated by allied forced in 1945 and moved to england .   only he and his brother survived the holocaust .
