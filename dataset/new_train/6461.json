' and treva , who out of desperation to become a woman once took victoria 's contraceptive pills , said : ` telling victoria i wanted to change sex was the hardest thing i 've ever done . it is such a relief that she is standing by me . ' white wedding : trevor and victoria on their wedding day . victoria is now helping treva to live as a woman . today victoria and treva even share a wardrobe . ` we both have a huge passion for shoes , ' says victoria . we often swap clothes -- we have the same tastes . we both love casual clothes although treva is more girly than me . she prefers to wear full make up every day and always has her nails perfectly manicured . ' and treva has even undergone plastic surgery to make herself look even more feminine . ` telling victoria i wanted to change sex was the hardest thing i 've ever done . it is such a relief that she is standing by me ' - treva askey . the pair took out a # 4,500 loan before treva underwent plastic surgery to make her nose smaller . brow surgery at a cost of # 3,500 to make treva 's forehead less prominent is also planned . victoria was just 13 when she first met trevor , 15 , at school . then , there were no signs that trevor was anything but masculine . ` trevor was known as a tough bloke who everyone looked up to and no-one would cross , ' she says . ' i developed quite a crush on him and for a few weeks we had a typical teenage romance with a few stolen kisses . ' but within a few weeks trevor had disappeared . in fact he 'd gone to serve in the royal engineers , where over the next 23 years he became a lance corporal , fighting in bosnia , kenya and the falklands . during the next two decades the pair kept in touch -- but as trevor was in the army , they went their separate ways . ` during these years i married and had my first son , now aged 21 , ' recalls victoria . transition : treva has undergone plastic surgery to make herself look more feminine . victoria also helps with her make-up . ` and when that marriage ended i met someone else and went on to have two more children now aged ten and six . meanwhile , trevor also had various girlfriends and when aged 24 , also married . ' but the couple never forgot one another . ` trevor would suddenly ring out of the blue and when he was back on leave , we 'd sometimes meet up , ' she says . ` sometimes years went by when we did n't see one another . but when we did the attraction was always incredibly strong -- but nothing happened because each time one of us was with someone else . ' however , in september 2006 victoria suddenly got an email from trevor that rocked her world -- confiding he wanted to become a woman . brave : former soldier trevor served in war-torn bosnia -lrb- pictured -rrb- and the falklands . victoria emailed back to ask if he was joking . ` but when he sent me photos of painted nails , i knew it was for real . ' treva said : ` ever since i was a teenager i 'd always felt something was n't right because i did n't seem to fit with men or women but in those days there was no information about men who wanted to become women . so i kept any feelings to myself -- there was no way i could have confided them at the time to any army colleagues . ` we both have a huge passion for shoes . we often swap clothes - we have the same tastes ' - victoria askey . ` i 'd always had a secret stash of women 's clothes . my wife had no idea but when she went out i 'd sometimes dress up in them and just sit around the house . ` in hindsight it was the only time i felt truly comfortable . after that shocking revelation the emails between victoria and trevor dwindled and for three years they lost contact . treva admits she worried the revelation had ruined her relationship with victoria forever . but by may 2010 trevor 's 15-year marriage had ended and when he emailed victoria out of the blue victoria 's relationship with her youngest children 's father was also on the rocks . treva said : ` i 'd never been able to get victoria out of my mind and she 'd always been the one person i could confide in . ' victoria recalls despite his revelation a few years earlier , she was thrilled to be back in touch with trevor . ` talking with him i realised it did n't matter he still wanted to be a woman . he was my first love , a soulmate . i 'd never forgotten him .

' within six months she moved with the children to live near trevor , who was still living as a man at his army base in water beach , cambridgeshire . the pair were married in a small registry office in september 2011 . ` on our wedding day trevor was still as a man -- and we made love as man and wife . no-one knew our secret but i already knew that i 'd support him through his transition . ' shortly after trevor retired from the army and for the first time began dressing as a woman full time . she said : ' i could immediately see how much happier trevor was as a woman . as a man he was a typical quiet reserved british man but as treva she was much more outgoing , chatty and relaxed . ' the first step for treva 's transformation was to get rid of her body hair . ` that took a whole day , ' admits victoria . ` and she began taking my contraceptive pills , which i 'd researched on the internet could help male to female transsexuals . the female hormones helped her start to grow breasts , softened her skin and thickened her hair . ' ` talking with him i realised it did n't . matter he still wanted to be a woman . he was my first love , a soulmate . i 'd never forgotten him ' - victoria askey . then the pair went shopping with victoria helping treva choose clothes to flatter her slim 5ft 7in figure , and helping her apply make up . meanwhile , the couple visited the children 's school to tell teachers about treva . ` we were honest with the children -- we simply told them that trevor felt he was a woman trapped in a man 's body and was going to now live as a woman . ` the school have been completely supportive and the children , who still regularly see their dad who has remarried , have accepted treva , ' she says . despite this , victoria admits she and treva do sometimes get some odd looks and stares when they go out together . ` we decided it was because some of treva 's facial features were still quite masculine . ` she had a large nose for a woman and we both decided her nose would look more feminine if she had cosmetic surgery to make it smaller . ' happy together : treva admits she worried the revelation had ruined her relationship with victoria forever . today , instead of the pill , treva now takes women 's hormones , which victoria has sourced online . as well as breasts she has a more womanly shape with hips and a smaller waist , ' she says . treva now hopes to undergo surgery to create bigger breasts and to be accepted onto the nhs waiting list for gender reassignment surgery . the couple admit many friends and family were initially shocked . ` trevor was the last man anyone would ever imagine would want to become a woman , ' says victoria , ` but now people have got to know treva , they are more understanding and in fact some of our friends are old army colleagues . ` they still call treva her old army nickname -- arthur askey -- but no-one bats an eyelid now .
