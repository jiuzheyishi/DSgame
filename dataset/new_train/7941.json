{"text": "nigel evans has a healthy parliamentary majority in ribble valley of over 14,700 -- but should his arrest trigger a by-election , it could still present a huge headache for david cameron . even before nigel farage 's ukip emerged as the ` fourth force ' in british politics last week , the constituency had a history of causing difficulty for conservative prime ministers . in 1991 , mr evans was the tory candidate for ribble valley when cabinet minister david waddington was elevated to the house of lords -- triggering a poll in which the party 's majority of 19,528 turned into a liberal democrat majority of 4,601 . despite nigel evans 's -lrb- left -rrb- healthy majority in his ribble valley constituency , a by-election could still pose a headache for david cameron , right . although mr evans won the seat back for the conservatives at the next year 's general election , the party is still scarred by the memory of the liberal democrats -- then just three years old as a party , and ukip 's predecessors as the natural ` party of protest ' -- increasing their share of the vote by a whopping 27 per cent . it was one of the largest swings in by-election history . mr evans has not been charged with any offence , but if he subsequently chose to stand down from parliament in the wake of the allegations , ukip would regard it as the perfect opportunity to secure their first westminster mp . at the last election , mr evans took 50 per cent of the vote ; labour were in second place , on 22 per cent , with the liberal democrats third on 20 per cent and ukip fourth , with just under seven per cent . waiting : mr evans has not been charged with any offence , but if he subsequently chose to stand down from parliament in the wake of the allegations , nigel farage 's ukip would regard it as the perfect opportunity to secure their first mp . however , if the party could match the surge it managed in the eastleigh by-election earlier this year , when it increased its share of the vote by eight-fold to 28 per cent , then victory would be within its grasp . although nigel farage says in an interview with today 's mail on sunday that he will not consider standing for parliament himself until after the 2014 european elections , his party 's stunning performance in last week 's council elections -- taking 139 seats and securing 23 per cent of the vote -- would still give his party the ideal springboard . ribble valley , which was created as a constituency in 1983 , is a wealthy , rural area which is traditionally more right-of-centre in its voting patterns than the rest of lancashire . in last week 's council elections labour finished just four seats short of outright victory on the county council . the party was holding discussions with the lib dems over the weekend to oust the conservatives from power . ukip did not gain any seats , but was blamed by conservative councillors for cutting into their share of the vote . in the wake of the results , the council 's conservative deputy leader , albert atkinson , said : ` i blame david cameron for this . ` he needs to listen . ' sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .", "summary": " mr evans 's constituency saw one of the biggest swings in history in 1991 .   a by-election saw a tory majority of 19,500 turn into a lib dem majority .
