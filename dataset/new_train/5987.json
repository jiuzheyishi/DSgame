{"text": "an electronic voting machine in pennsylvania has been removed from service after it changed votes for president obama into those for mitt romney . an 18-second clip posted onto youtube shows a voter 's finger repeatedly pressing the button for obama , but the check mark instead comes up next to romney 's name . this is the latest in a flurry of voting glitches across the country today from west palm beach in florida where ballot counting machines broke down , to vast swathes of new jersey where text alert systems for residents sent them to the wrong polling stations . scroll down for video . the youtube video clearly shows the voter 's finger touching the screen to vote for barack obama -lrb- left -rrb- but lighting up for mitt romney instead -lrb- right -rrb- . in comments attached to the clip , . the anonymous user named ` centralpavote ' said that ` all the other . buttons worked fine ' and asked voters either side if they were . experiencing similar problems - which they denied . nbc news has reported that since the clip was posted to reddit this morning , it spread across the internet and the offending machine has been retired from service . the video which was filmed on the youtube users android phone shows the potentially serious malfunction affect only a vote for the incumbent president . a vote for any other of the candidates for the presidency and vice presidency resulted in a successful choice - it was only a vote for president obama that caused the machine to change to mitt romney . ' i initially selected obama but romney was highlighted , ' said ` centralpavote ' on the introduction to his video on youtube . christie tipton casts her ballot using an electronic voting machine similar to the one in pennsylvania that refused to cast a vote for barack obama . a school in philadelphia has been asked to cover up a mural of barack obama that was on display in front of voters today . they were criticised for only using three pieces of paper to cover the mural - leading to accusations of bias from republicans . ' i assumed it was being picky so i deselected romney and tried obama again , this time more carefully , and still got romney . ` being a software developer , i immediately went into troubleshoot mode . ' i first thought the calibration was off and tried selecting jill stein to actually highlight obama . nope . jill stein was selected just fine . ` next i deselected her and started at the top of romney 's name and started tapping very closely together to find the ` active areas ' . ` from the top of romney 's button down to the bottom of the black checkbox beside obama 's name was all active for romney . ` from the bottom of that same checkbox to the bottom of the obama button -lrb- basically a small white sliver -rrb- is what let me choose obama . ` stein 's button was fine . all other buttons worked fine . ' the voter reported the problem to an electoral official who declared it a non issue . ' i then called over a volunteer to have a look at it , ' said ` centralpavote ' / . ` she . him hawed -lrb- sic -rrb- for a bit then calmly said ` it 's nothing to worry . about , everything will be ok . ' and went back to what she was doing . ' i then recorded this video . ' however , . far from evidence of electoral fraud , experts have weighed in with the . theory that this is a calibration problem specific to the machine . ` it 's a concern but not because of . fraud ... that 's an obviously miscalibrated ivotronic -lrb- es&s -rrb- voting . machine , ' said jospeh lorenzo hall , senior staff technologist at the . center for democracy & technology to gawker . ` we would recommend that poll workers would recalibrate the machine and everything would be fine . bob warhola casts his vote at a polling place inside a residential garage , tuesday , nov. 6 , 2012 , in forest city , pennsylvania . ` also , with some models of voting system if you place a thumb on accident while resting on the machine it can ` bias ' the calibration of the touchscreen up towards the errant thumb . ` that could be happening to , if it 's only for this one voter . ' further controversy over voting . continued at a polling place in a philadelphia school where workers . ignored a judge 's order to cover a mural of president obama ` in its . entirety ' . the art work . which is positioned behind voting machines contains the words ` change ! ' and ` hope ' together with a quote from the president and a painting of . him . however , electoral . poll workers only covered up the mural with three pieces of paper - . leaving the obama logo and quote from the serving president in full view . of all prospective voters . seeing an attempt to influence the votes of those attending the polling place in ward 35 , republicans were outraged . a poll worker assists a voter with the voting booth curtain before voting during the u.s. presidential election at the penrose recreation center in philadelphia , pennsylvania today . ` it . is an absolute disgrace , ' said shannon royer , deputy secretary for . external affairs and elections in pennsylvania to fox news . ` election . materials and electioneering inside the polling place are prohibited this can be interpreted as trying to influence voters inside . the polling place . ' i am told discussions are going on now about covering the mural . ' however , even though the voting machine whistle-blower . has kept their anonymity , other better known individuals are unwittingly . breaking the law by posting pictures from the ballot box online . talk show host sean hannity did n't surprise anyone with the contents of his ballot when he tweeted a photo of it . what may be a surprise is that very act appeared to break the law . the ballot that the fox news channel host tweeted showed him voting for mitt romney on the conservative party line , and continuing to vote for conservatives across the undercard . yet new york state law says that it 's illegal for someone to reveal the contents of a prepared ballot , perhaps a pre-social media era statute designed to guard against voter intimidation . it 's a misdemeanor that would be up to a district attorney to prosecute , said john conklin , spokesman for the new york state board of elections . fox news host sean hannity apparently tweeted pictures of his ballot today . this may be a misdemeanor under new york state elections law which prohibits voters from showing a ballot after it is prepared for voting . voters cast their votes using electronic voting machines during the u.s. presidential election at a voting location in valley city , ohio today . the idea of showing off a completed ballot on twitter , instagram or some other social media site was n't considered by the founding fathers . but it was a hot topic for discussion online early tuesday , and the website gizmodo.com published a guide of how individual state laws might affect such an act . in fact according to new data from pew research 22 percent of registered voters in the united states have indicated on facebook or twitter who they voted for today . however , the question of whether using your smartphone to photograph your ballot is illegal depends entirely on the state in which you are voting . some states such as florida , georgia , kentucky , michigan , nevada and texas , ` expressly prohibit the use of photographic and recording equipment inside polling places .
