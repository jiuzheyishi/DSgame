{"text": "david cameron 's election guru believes that tory chairman grant shapps and chancellor george osborne are ` liabilities ' who will cost the party votes in this week 's crucial town hall polls , it was claimed last night . tough-talking lynton crosby has had a series of clashes with fellow campaign chiefs shapps and osborne , according to insiders . they say that australian-born mr crosby , recruited by mr cameron to revive flagging tory ratings , regards mr shapps as ` ineffective ' . and he reportedly believes mr osborne 's abysmal personal popularity means he is driving voters away in large numbers . ` liability ' : chancellor george osborne has been criticised by david cameron 's election guru , nicknamed the ` wizard of oz ' the divisions in the tory high command emerged amid reports that rebel conservative mps may use big losses in thursday 's town hall elections to launch a fresh assault on mr cameron 's leadership . mr crosby last night strongly denied criticising mr shapps and mr osborne saying : ` it is not true . they are doing a splendid job . ' in a separate development a conservative mp warned the prime minister he faces losing out to the anti-eu ukip in the polls . basildon mp john baron urged mr cameron to use the last few days of campaigning to pledge a tougher stance on europe -- or see ukip leader nigel farage make big gains . the tory drive to halt the ukip bandwagon has been hit by tensions between new arrival mr crosby and mr shapps and mr osborne . one official said : ` lynton can not see the point of shapps . he does n't think he has much to offer by way of campaign skills or as an effective frontman for the party . ' tough talking : australian election campaigner lynton crosby has been hired by david cameron to lead his election campaign . mr crosby is also said to have had a number of heated exchanges with mr osborne about tactics . ` george loves to show off his encyclopaedic knowledge of elections , arguing that this or that tactic was proved to be a disaster in an election campaign in america in days gone by , ' said a source . ` until now , no one has challenged him but lynton knows as much about elections as george and will tell him he is wrong -- and why . george does n't like it . ' mr crosby was dubbed ` the wizard of oz ' after being credited with helping australian prime minister john howard win four elections . however , he is a controversial figure . he invented ` dog whistle politics ' -- so-called because it is too high for the human ear and can be used to send hidden messages to voters -- which focus on cracking down on immigration , welfare and crime . in december , the mail on sunday revealed that as a then adviser to london mayor boris johnson , he used the phrase ` f ****** muslims ' in a diatribe about winning ethnic minority votes . with fears the tories may haemorrhage votes to ukip , right-winger mr baron urged mr cameron to ` beef up ' his pledge to hold a referendum on britain 's membership of the eu if the tories win the general election , due in 2015 . mr baron said the prime minister should make an immediate commitment to introduce legislation on a referendum before the general election . it was the best way to counter ukip claims that he was not fully committed to a referendum -- and would spike ukip 's guns . mr baron called on the prime minister to heed the calls already made by more than 100 fellow tory mps . he said : ` we have to prove we are serious in our commitment for an eu referendum . that 's why we must bring forward legislation in this parliament regarding the referendum in the next . if we did that , it would beg the question : why would anyone bother to vote for ukip ? ` ineffective ' : conservative party chairman grant shapps has not impressed lynton cros' tory party strategists are attempting to ` manage expectations ' by predicting the conservatives will lose 300 of the 2,400 local authority seats being contested . the prime minister 's aides are pessimistic because the seats were last fought in 2009 when gordon brown 's government was at rock-bottom . now it is mr cameron suffering from a mid-term fall in support , with polls putting the tories eight points behind labour . critically , ukip , which is consistently running at double figures in the polls , is fielding 1,734 candidates -- up from 560 last time . although ukip is not expected to win a large number of seats , by appealing to tory voters on issues such as pulling out of the eu and opposing green belt development , the party could deprive the conservatives of victory in dozens of areas.out the seats being contested , 1,477 are held by the conservatives , 255 by labour , 480 by lib dems and 197 by other parties . if mr cameron manages to hold on to 1,200 seats -- pegging losses to fewer than 300 -- he will present it as a vindication of his leadership strategy . but if he loses more than 350 seats , his backbenchers will become restive . more than 500 would be regarded as a disaster . ed miliband will need to add at least 350 seats to present the poll to his backbenchers as a success . nick clegg 's lib dems are steeled for the loss of up to 100 seats . ukip 's difficulty will be converting votes into seats : in 2009 , despite averaging a vote of 16 per cent in the areas where its candidates stood , they secured just eight seats . as most of the seats are being fought in southern england , where the main battle is between the tories and the lib dems , mr farage could siphon votes away from both parties without adding significantly to his haul . commentators expect ukip 's total gain to be in the ` high teens ' , while claiming 50 seats or more would be classed as a ` wow ' result . election expert john curtice , professor of politics at strathclyde university , said : ` some tory losses are inevitable . the seats up for grabs were last contested four years ago during the darkest days of gordon brown 's premiership . ` what will be crucial for mr cameron is the scale of the losses . he would love the figure to be less than 300 . that would mean he has hung on to some of the gains his party made in 2009 . ' yesterday jesse norman , the tory mp appointed as one of mr cameron 's new policy advisers , warned against a shift to the right to meet the ukip challenge .", "summary": " election guru lynton crosby has criticised osborne 's personal unpopularity .   thursday 's town hall elections may show big tory losses .   crosby has had heated exchanges with george osborne over tactics .
