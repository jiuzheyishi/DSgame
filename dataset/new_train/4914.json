{"text": "washington a contrite head of the federal protective service took the blame wednesday for security lapses that allowed covert investigators to sneak bomb components into 10 federal government buildings . a gao report cites lax security in federal buildings after investigators got bomb components past guards . the government accountability office , which conducted the tests , testified that they showed the service to be  an agency in crisis .  plainclothes investigators testing the effectiveness of private contract guards at federal office buildings were able to smuggle in bomb components in all 10 attempts . only one investigator was stopped and questioned , but he was allowed to pass with the components of a liquid bomb . once inside the facilities , the testers assembled the bombs in restrooms , put them in briefcases and  walked freely  into government offices , according to the government accountability office . watch undercover agent smuggle bomb  asked point-blank at a senate hearing wednesday why the security guards had failed , protective service director gary schenkel said ,  it 's purely a lack of oversight on our part .  he added ,  i take full responsibility . i am the director of the organization .  schenkel , who assumed his post in early 2007 , said the police force was hampered earlier this decade by major budget cuts , which forced the agency to reorganize how it protects 9,000 federal facilities nationwide . although police officers formerly protected federal buildings , the agency now uses a core cadre of 1,200 sworn federal officers or  inspectors  to oversee a small army of about 13,000 private security guards who man the x-ray machines and magnetometers at building entrances . department of homeland security put out an official statement wednesday focusing on steps the federal protective service is taking to improve the situation , but schenkel was at times more negative , outlining some of the problems the agency faces . the service , he said , used a  stubby pencil  system to keep track of guards , and it would take a  full year , i believe  for changes being made now to have an effect .  when i came here , i made an analogy that we were a ship , and it takes 38 miles at sea to turn a ship , an aircraft carrier . i think we are probably on mile six , but we 've certainly initiated the turn ,  he said . mark goldstein of the government accountability office testified about the investigators ' operations .  we brought in all the components that we needed to make a real bomb ,  he said , though the concentration of explosives was  below the trigger point  for safety reasons . investigators obtained the components at local stores and over the internet for less than $ 150 , the report says .  in a number of the locations -- three or four of them -- the guards were not even looking at the screens that would show materials passing through ,  goldstein said .  if a guard had been looking , they would have seen materials that are ordinarily not brought into a federal building , and should have stopped our investigators and asked , ` why are you bringing these kinds of things into a fed building , and what is your purpose ? ' but in really no case did that occur .  in only one instance did a guard ask about something that an investigator was carrying , -lsb- and -rsb- after a brief explanation , that guard let it go through ,  goldstein said . the covert agents then assembled bombs in the bathrooms , he said .  in some cases , bathrooms were locked , but federal employees let us in ,  he said . having assembled the bomb , typically in less than four minutes , the agents placed it an a briefcase  and walked around a variety of federal offices -- both legislative branch offices and executive branch offices in the four cities we went to ,  goldstein said . he blamed the lapses on an  antiquated approach  to security , saying federal building security is directed in part by the buildings ' tenants , who form a committee to determine the appropriate level of security . so decisions are made  by people who , frankly , ought not be making them ,  he said . he also said security is  budget-driven ; it 's not risk-driven .  but he shied away from recommending that the contract security jobs be federalized , a move the government took for airport security screeners following the september 11 terrorist attacks . that would be a policy decision , he said . but he said the protective service was lax in assuring that security standards it set were followed by the private contract guards . of 663 randomly selected guards , 411 , or 62 percent , were missing some form of required certification , such as an up-to-date firearm qualification , background investigation or cpr or first aid training . included in the government accountability office report is a photograph of a guard asleep at his post . the report also detailed an instance in which a woman placed an infant in a carrier on an x-ray machine while retrieving identification . because the guard was not paying attention and the machine 's safety features had been disabled , the infant was sent through the x-ray machine , according to the report . the protective service dismissed the guard , who sued the agency for failing to provide x-ray training . the agency lost the suit because it could not prove that the guard had been trained , the report says . in one region , the service  has not provided the required eight hours of -lsb- x-ray -rsb- or magnetometer training to its 1,500 guards since 2004 ,  the report says . it report also says the service does not have a national guidance on how often its inspectors should check on the contract guards . in several instances , when inspectors have checked on guards , they found  instances of guards not complying with post orders .  in one case , the report says , a guard was caught using government computers to manage a for-profit adult web site . all of the buildings involved in the bomb smuggling test were  level iv  buildings , meaning they house more than 450 federal employees and have a high volume of public contact . the government accountability office has declined to identify the specific buildings  because of the sensitivity of some of the information ,  the report says . after the report was obtained by cnn late tuesday , ahead of its release wednesday , sen. joseph lieberman , i-connecticut , chairman of the homeland security committee , called the test results  simply unacceptable .  added sen. susan collins , r-maine ,  in this post-9 / 11 world that we 're now living in , i can not imagine how security lapses of this magnitude were allowed to occur .  both lieberman and collins said they were putting the federal protective service on a list of  high-risk  agencies and asked schenkel to provide them with details of how he would fix the security lapses . although the investigators ensured that bombs assembled in the buildings would not explode , they later videotaped the detonation of several of the devices at a remote site to demonstrate the their destructive power .", "summary": " report questions effectiveness of federal protective service .   plainclothes investigators test security at 10 federal buildings in 4 u.s. cities .   gao agents able to assemble components in restrooms , enter offices .   agency chief says changes made but effects wo n't be felt for months .
