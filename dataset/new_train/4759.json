{"text": "an ocean at least as large as lake superior lies below a thick layer of ice on a moon of saturn , new data from nasa 's cassini spacecraft suggests . the results , published in the journal science , support earlier signs that this small moon has liquid water . that means saturn 's sixth-largest moon could have been -- or could now be -- hospitable to life . this discovery puts enceladus in an exclusive club of extraterrestrial worlds in the solar system that appear to have a subsurface water ocean . the others are titan , another moon of saturn , and europa , a moon of jupiter . callisto and ganymede , also moons of jupiter , may also have oceans under ice .  as far as whether one should go first to europa or enceladus , i look at this as a kind of a cornucopia of habitable environments in the outer solar system ,  study co-author jonathan lunine of cornell university said in a press conference wednesday . what we think is there . the north pole of enceladus has a thickness of ice around 30 miles , with solid rock beneath it . but at the south pole , there may be only 18 to 24 miles of ice covering a subsurface ocean that itself is 5 to 10 miles deep . this ocean appears to be a  lens-shaped reservoir  that 's deepest at the south pole and thinner further afield . the ocean appears to sit on top of a rocky core and  may extend halfway or more towards the equator in every direction ,  said study co-author david stevenson , professor of planetary science at california institute of technology , in a press conference . also noteworthy is that the north pole is heavily cratered , while the ice on the south pole is smoother , meaning it has been resurfaced and softened . measurements from the new study and previous cassini data suggest the moon 's south pole has an ice layer on top of water on top of silicate rock . if that 's true , water circulating through the rock would pick up elements such as phosphorous , sulfur , potassium and sodium into the liquid . these elements are essential for making molecules that life needs , lunine said . with respect to the ocean being on top of rock , the gravity data from enceladus  makes the base of the ocean very much like the base of our own ocean on the earth ,  lunine said at the press conference . enceladus is a small moon , with a diameter of only about 310 miles . in 2005 , cassini found that fractures called  tiger stripes  in the south polar region emit water vapor jets rich in salt , lead author luciano iess of sapienza universit√† di roma in rome , italy , said in a press conference wednesday . cassini has also detected organic molecules , which can come from biological or nonbiological sources , near the tiger stripes and in dust grains in the region . a moon of saturn may have ` tropical ' lakes . how do we know ? no one has actually gone to enceladus and seen this ocean under the thick ice layer . but scientists have strong evidence that it is there , based on gravity measurements made with cassini . when the spacecraft flies by enceladus , the gravity of the moon changes the probe 's speed . scientists can measure those changes back on earth by detecting fluctuations in the frequency of the signal that cassini sends back . if the spacecraft 's speed does n't change , the frequency would remain the same . but depending on where cassini flies , the frequency of the signal changes in particular ways . this allows scientists to learn more about the moon 's subsurface features . scientists had already known about the presence of a depression or  dimple  at the south pole of enceladus ,  as if there is some amount of , effectively , missing material ,  lunine said . but in this new study , the change in gravity associated with the depression was not as dramatic as expected .  there must be some higher density layer that 's underneath the ice , and that has to be a liquid water ocean , because there 's really nothing else plausible that can explain that offset to what we would expect for the gravity signature of this depression ,  he said . it is possible that this ocean has been sending out the plumes that cassini first observed in 2005 , but this has not been verified . how can we look for signs of life there ? sending a probe to enceladus with a drill would n't be entirely practical because the liquid water is so far under the ice that it would be hard to access , lunine said . instead , a spacecraft with instruments more sophisticated than cassini could fly through the plumes of material being ejected from fractures in the ice . cassini has already detected the water vapor and organic molecules in these plumes , using a device called a mass spectrometer . but a more advanced , more sensitive version of the same instrument could better test for the  menu of molecules  associated with an advanced biological system , lunine said . detecting these molecules could be  the smoking gun for whether in fact there is life down there or not ,  he said .", "summary": " enceladus is a small moon of saturn .   new data suggest a subsurface ocean under its south pole .   gravity experiment inferred that there must be liquid water there .   miles of ice likely cover a subsurface ocean that itself is 5 to 10 miles deep .
