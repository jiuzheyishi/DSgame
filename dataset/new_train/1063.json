{"text": "private eyes : simon cowell is on the list drawn up by soca . simon cowell is on an explosive list of blue-chip firms and individuals who used rogue private detectives , it emerged last night . the music mogul is among the 102 names on the list drawn up by the serious organised crime agency -lrb- soca -rrb- that the commons home affairs committee is threatening to publish on monday . the list is dominated by big law and finance firms and high street solicitors , but also contains two individuals -- one of whom is multi-millionaire cowell . soca has stressed that the presence of a name on the list does not amount to evidence of wrongdoing . officials say many clients of rogue investigators did not commission information-gathering activities or will not have been aware that the private eyes broke the law to obtain information . following a threat last week by keith vaz , chairman of the home affairs committee , to publish the list , senior mps lined up with establishment figures yesterday to demand that it remain secret . in what appeared to be a co-ordinated campaign , other commons committee chairmen backed britain 's most senior anti-terror officer , the information commissioner and cabinet minister andrew lansley to insist the plan to publish the list be shelved . it has raised the stakes even higher in a long-running row over whether the list drawn up by the serious organised crime agency -lrb- soca -rrb- should be made public . mr vaz has given soca an ultimatum to publish the dossier by monday -- or see mps do it themselves . he said it gave an appearance of ` injustice ' for law firms , insurers and other big businesses on the list to remain secret while journalists have been relentlessly pursued for links to phone hacking and other illegal practices . but yesterday , soca director general trevor pearce rejected this request and , in a strongly worded letter , called on mr vaz to think again . the committee was bombarded with letters from senior figures saying it would do great harm to publish the list of 102 law firms , insurers , financial companies , banks and individuals who were clients of corrupt investigators . they included warnings from mr lansley , who is leader of the commons , the information commissioner sir christopher graham , and sir alan beith and james arbuthnot , the chairmen of westminster 's justice and defence select committees , respectively . secrecy : home affairs select committee chairman keith vaz , left , and cabinet minister andrew lansley , right . mr pearce also said that he had the support of met assistant commissioner cressida dick , who is in charge of terrorism . the onslaught alarmed mps , with one senior committee source commenting : ` this is very suspicious . it seems there is some sort of co-ordinated operation going on to prevent us from publishing what could be very embarrassing information . ' mps were given two reasons for secrecy . mr pearce and the information commissioner claimed publication might compromise inquiries into whether those on the list could be prosecuted . sir christopher said : ` it 's not clever to start a criminal investigation by publishing the names of everyone and everything you 're investigating . mr lansley and the two committee chairmen took a different line , pointing out that when mr vaz received the list from soca in july he gave an undertaking it would be kept confidential . mr lansley said that , if mr vaz broke his word , future inquiries by mps could be refused access to confidential documents . mr vaz now faces tense talks with fellow committee members . they have so far insisted it is vital the public know the truth about relations between big firms and corrupt detectives . mr vaz told mr pearce last week : ` we 've taken legal advice and we believe it 's important that this should be done . ' tory member michael ellis said : ` there do n't seem to me to be any issues of national security or other issues pertaining to the wider national interest .
