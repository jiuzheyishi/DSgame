{"text": "he 's helped save a rhino 's life , spoken at major tech conferences , won several awards and created an online community of thousands of users -- and he is just 16 years old . teenager nadav ossendryver is the founder and developer of latest sightings , a crowd-sourcing website that provides real-time updates on animal sightings in kruger national park , south africa 's largest game reserve . founded in november 2011 , the site harnesses the power of social media to enable kruger visitors to share the whereabouts of animals with other holidaymakers , thus increasing their chances of spotting the diverse wildlife that 's populating the vast park -- from lions and cheetahs to leopards and elephants . read : new monkey discovered .  wow ! what a way to end the day !! 3 lioness and 9 cubs ! thank you for this wonderful page ,  reads one comment posted on latest sightings .  you are a legend !! thank-you ! thank-you ! most amazing experience at kruger ... wild dogs so close !!  says another . it all began last year after one of nadav 's numerous visits to the world-famous kruger , a stunning wildlife haven stretching out over 7,500 square miles .  whenever we came here i used to beg my parents to stop every car passing and ask them what they 'd seen ,  remembers nadav , who is currently a grade 10 student .  after a while they got irritated , so i was thinking , what 's an easy way of getting people to share their sightings without having to stop every car ?  when he returned to his johannesburg home , the bright teenager put his mind to the task and after two weeks of non-stop work he created his first wildlife-tracking iphone app . a little over a year later , nadav says , the crowd-powered site has grown to win fans all over the world , helping wildlife enthusiasts enhance their safari experience .  all together on facebook , twitter and the website , we 've got over 33,000 people ,  says nadav .  when i started i thought i wo n't even get 100 people . i never thought they 'll be more than 100 people that like kruger enough to actually follow the sightings but now there are 33,000 people , it 's just unbelievable .  read : last of the bush trackers on the trail of a dying art . nadav remembers the case of an american couple visiting kruger on a mission to see a leopard for the first time in their lives . the solitary , elusive cat is one of the most difficult animals to spot in the wild , but thanks to the site , nadav says , the couple got lucky on their first day at the park .  people go there for years and do n't even see a leopard and they saw two leopard cubs in one day ,  he says .  they said they could have gone home that afternoon and still be so happy . and when they got home finally , they told all their friends of how they had such an amazing time in kruger .  but while members can report movements of any wildlife whilst scanning the open savannah , there is one animal whose whereabouts is banned from the site .  we do n't ever share rhino sightings because of the poaching ,  explains nadav .  it 's a huge problem , there 's poaching more or less every day .  rhino poaching rates have soared in recent years in south africa -- according to the country 's officials , more than 450 rhinos have been killed this year . latest sightings carries telephone numbers where people can directly report rhino poaching , says nadav , who encourages his followers to keep an eye out for hunters . earlier this year , he was informed by a member about an injured rhino caught in a poacher 's snare in kruger . nadav immediately passed on the details to a park ranger in order to prevent the animal , which was bleeding around its neck , from becoming an easy target for hunters . the ranger rushed to the scene and managed to save the stricken animal .  if you see any suspicious activity then you can share it to us and we create awareness ,  says nadav . read : wildlife puts tanzania on the tourist map . the 16-year-old schoolboy , who wants to pursue career in it in the future , was born in israel in june 1996 and moved to south africa when he was eight years old . like many teenagers , he also loves soccer and tennis and plays drums in his school band . his remarkable feats have not gone unnoticed by the world -- nadav has held meetings with google executives and has been invited to speak about mobile applications and the internet at some of the biggest technology events in the continent , including the tech4africa conference . his numerous accolades include being named the youngest virtual honorary ranger from sanparks , south africa 's national parks service , as well as an eco ambassador for the endangered wildlife trust . looking ahead , nadav says he 'd like to expand the service to other game reserves so that he can improve the wildlife safari experience for tourists and help protect endangered species .  i love every second of it ,  says nadav .  i just love knowing about all the sightings , seeing and helping animals especially , creating awareness , trying to end poaching and learning more about kruger -- i love every single second of it .
