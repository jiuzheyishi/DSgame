{"text": "the power of any pastor over his or her parishioners is derived from their  calling  to minister the gospel from god , or as some call it , the anointing by the holy spirit . but the role of a pastor -- the bible speaks to being a shepherd of a flock -- also comes from the belief that it is their moral standing as the earthly representative of god to lead their congregations spiritually . if you read the writings of paul in 1 timothy 3 -lrb- new international version -rrb- , he offers the following instructions :  here is a trustworthy saying : if anyone sets his heart on being an overseer , he desires a noble task . now the overseer must be above reproach , the husband of but one wife , temperate , self-controlled , respectable , hospitable , able to teach , not given to drunkenness , not violent but gentle , not quarrelsome , not a lover of money . he must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him with proper respect . -lrb- if anyone does not know how to manage his own family , how can he take care of god 's church -rrb- ... he must also have a good reputation with outsiders , so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil 's trap .  as we witness the salacious and troubling sex allegations leveled this week against atlanta megachurch pastor bishop eddie l. long , it is clear that many are confused to hear four young men come forward and allege that the man of the cloth , the husband and father , sexually coerced them and used the power of his prophetic position to engage in sex with them . it is even more shocking considering long has preached with conviction against homosexuality and gay marriage . the details outlined in three lawsuits -- a fourth man stepped forward on friday -- have rocked the christian community . bishop long is n't just a preacher with a storefront church . he oversees a massive 240-acre complex in lithonia , georgia , just outside of atlanta , a congregation of 25,000 members , schools , and an international ministry that is seen on tbn , daystar , the word network and online . he is widely respected as a strong man of god who ministers annually to fellow pastors , men , youth and a mega women 's conference . his influence is tremendous and far reaching , even in the areas of education and politics in georgia . with all that said , and i fully understand that he has vigorously denied the allegations , there is no doubt in my mind that for the sake of the church , long and his family , he needs to remove himself from the pulpit as the leader of new birth missionary baptist church in order for the issue to be resolved to its conclusion . in an interview with me on thursday on the tom joyner morning show , long 's attorney , craig gillen , said his client would speak for the first time on sunday at 11 a.m. and address the issue before his congregation . while i disagree with waiting five days since the allegations were revealed -- if someone accused me of doing this and i know in my heart i did n't do it , i would be screaming from the top of georgia 's stone mountain -- long first and foremost owes an explanation to his personal family , and then his church family . if he does indeed stand before the new birth family , long should be honest and forthright , not mince words or engage in double talk . and after whatever he says , he should take it upon himself to  sit himself down .  in the christian church , when a pastor is accused of wrongdoing , going through a divorce or violating the biblical call to be above  reproach ,  the senior pastor orders them to be  sat down .  that means they do n't carry out their ministerial duties . the point is to protect the integrity of the word of god , as well as to allow that pastor to get his or her affairs in order . as the leader of new birth , there is no human authority above long . but he has a heavenly father that he has to answer to , and he must not allow his personal travails to interfere with the good and expansive works of the church . souls still need to be saved , people still need to be healed , the sick still must be cared for , and the naked clothed . yet i also hope that when long speaks , he does one of two things : if in his mind and heart he has done no wrong , he will launch a vigorous defense of his name and integrity and vow with every fiber in his body to fight the charges , even if that means spending every dime he has and not settle the lawsuits . but if he is guilty of what is alleged , i pray that long does n't stand before his church as its spiritual father and continue the charade of saying  i did n't do it  and tear into his accusers . god , long and those young men know what took place , and as someone who has listened to many of his sermons and read his books , long has often talked about the need for christians , especially men , to be accountable for their actions and confess their sins . if guilty , and if he truly cares about his enormous flock , he will stand before them and admit to the error of his ways , and not put them through more pain and heartache . he is a charismatic pastor who has always been known to preach an uncompromising word , unwilling to say what folks want to hear , but instead , what they need to hear . bishop long , your congregation and the world do n't want to hear excuses . they do n't want ambiguity . your motto at new birth for years has been  taking authority .  this is the time for you to live that credo out before your flock , no matter what the outcome will be . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of roland s. martin .", "summary": " four lawsuits have been filed against bishop eddie long .   roland martin says bishop long has tremendous influence in the black church and beyond .   he says bishop long should step down to deal with the allegations .   martin : he should vigorously defend his name or admit the misdeeds if they happened .
