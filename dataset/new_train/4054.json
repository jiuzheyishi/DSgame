{"text": "no new gun laws . the national rifle association has made its position clear , even amid america 's most recent gun debate . it says enforce the gun laws already on the books . it 's well-known that the organization has actively lobbied to prevent new legislation limiting guns . but making this happen is more nuanced than just rallying its supporters and lobbyists every time a new law is proposed . since the 1990s , the powerful pro-gun nra has targeted the heart of what most legislation is based on : studies about the effects of gun violence . last year , the nra used its influence in florida to push through legislation that would punish doctors if they asked patients whether they owned a gun . and buried inside president barack obama 's signature health care legislation is a little-known provision that prevents the government and health insurers from asking about gun ownership . the nra says it is simply ensuring that taxpayer money is n't being used to promote a political agenda .  if gun control groups ... -lrb- and -rrb- individuals want to further their research , we 're not saying they should n't be able to do it ,  nra spokesman andrew arulanandam told cnn .  we 're just saying they should n't be using public funds to do it .  but public health experts say it 's all part of an attempt by the nra-led pro-gun lobby to hamstring lawmakers .  if a bunch of people do research and generate solid evidence that suggests firearms policy should be reformed and either firearms or people who used them should be regulated in new ways , -lrb- if i 'm a gun-rights advocate , -rrb- i 'm not going to like that ,  said dr. garen wintemute , head of the violence prevention research program at the university of california at davis .  so , i 'll simply prevent the evidence from being collected in the first place . it 's a brilliant strategy , and -lrb- the gun lobby -rrb- succeeded .  a lightning bolt and a chilling effect . it was n't a lot of money -- $ 2.6 million -- but it represented the bulk of the nation 's research on firearms safety in the mid-1990s .  with regards to gun research , it was enormous ,  said stephen teret , the founding director of the johns hopkins center for gun policy and research . in the 1990s , this small portion of the centers for disease control and prevention 's budget went to a program headed by dr. mark rosenberg that funded two high-profile studies that concluded the risks of having a loaded gun in the home outweigh the benefits .  that was demonstrated if you counted dead bodies ; it was demonstrated if you counted individuals shot but not killed ; and tallied up the good guys versus the bad guys ,  said dr. arthur kellermann , who led the research teams under rosenberg 's national center for injury prevention program . opinion : let 's take politics out of gun research . kellermann said the studies were not politically motivated but simply a way to give homeowners information to make informed choices . but the studies created what teret described as  the lightning rod that started the bolts of lightning from the pro-gun side .  in 1996 , it all ended . flexing its political muscle on capitol hill , the nra successfully pushed for legislation that effectively ended rosenberg 's program . to underscore its point , congress -- in a move led by jay dickey , a former gun-rights advocate and republican legislator from arkansas -- added this language to the agency 's appropriation :  none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the centers for disease control and prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control .  at the time , critics in congress accused the researchers of pursuing an anti-gun agenda and said the cdc 's work was redundant . the provision remains in place today . the language created what teret called  a chilling effect  for nearly all gun-related work at the cdc . though the agency continues to track gun deaths and injuries , it does little work on how to prevent them . many years later , the national institutes of health funded a similar study that triggered the same lightning-bolt response . in 2009 , the nih study concluded that a person carrying a gun was nearly 4.5 times more likely to be shot in an assault than someone who is unarmed . two years later , congress added the same restrictive language it had imposed on the cdc to all agencies of the department of health and human services , including the nih . today , the nra maintains its position that government research into gun violence is not necessary .  what works to reduce gun violence is to make sure that criminals are prosecuted and those who have been found to be a danger to themselves or others do n't have access to firearms ,  the nra 's arulanandam said ,  not to carry out more studies .  unanswered questions . so why are government studies on gun violence necessary ? rosenberg , who left the cdc in 1999 , explained that many of the questions that his group was seeking to answer remain open . for example , he said , it 's not clear whether registering and licensing firearms lowers gun violence ; whether allowing people to carry concealed weapons increases or lowers the risk of gun deaths ; or how letting people carry weapons in places such as shopping malls or schools or bars or parks affects the number of deaths .  these are very big questions that we need to know the answer to ,  said rosenberg , who is now president and ceo of the task force for global health . there are other private agencies and even partly federally funded programs that have researched these issues . but none was as far-reaching as what rosenberg 's program did in the 1990s . the cdc 's website still keeps track of the toll of gun violence -- or , as the cdc sometimes calls it ,  lethal means .  yet , the federal agency does little of the epidemiological research it once did that might offer guidance to lawmakers . now that gun violence has been thrust into the forefront of issues on capitol hill after last month 's mass shooting at a newtown , connecticut , elementary school , the focus has turned to the medical community 's role in the debate . last week , the washington post reported on a little-known provision added to the 2010 affordable care act -- better known as obamacare -- limiting what doctors can ask their patients about firearms in the home . while the provision does n't forbid doctors from asking about guns , it prohibits health care workers from collecting that information , documenting it and using it for research . democratic leader behind obamacare gun provision . a similar law in florida went a step further and would actually penalize doctors if they ask their patients about whether they own a gun , in most cases . a federal judge overturned the law , but gov. rick scott has vowed to appeal . gun-rights advocates , including the nra , have raised concerns about tracking this data , including the possibility that acknowledging legal gun ownership could bring higher insurance premiums . with these restrictions and the revived gun debate , doctors should become active participants in the discussion about gun violence and gun policy in this country , according to the american college of physicians . after all , the group said in a recent publication , physicians take a stand on other public health issues , such as smoking , air pollution , drunk driving and vaccinations . examining gun violence is n't a political issue to most physicians , one florida doctor said .  physicians basically want two things : they want continued research so we can find out what is happening along the lines of firearms and health care ,  dr. carolyn mcclanahan told cnn 's sanjay gupta .  and the second thing , though , is we want to provide basic gun education . studies have shown if you ask parents , especially pediatricians ask parents , ` do you keep your gun locked , unloaded , keep the ammunition separate from the gun ? ' that decreases the chance of a death from a firearm .  where things stand now . when adam lanza unleashed a hail of bullets inside an elementary school on december 14 , ending the lives of 20 young children and six staff members , the debate over america 's gun laws reopened . days later , obama announced that a task force led by vice president joe biden would create  real reforms right now .  that could include a revival of the assault weapons ban , something that sen. dianne feinstein , d-california , has said she plans to introduce . it could also result in executive orders that would bypass the legislative process , biden said wednesday . the nra will participate in the task force meetings this week , mostly to  hear what they have to say ,  arulanandam said . whether the effort in washington results in significant changes to america 's gun laws is n't clear . what is clear , according to kellermann -- who led research with the now defunct cdc program -- is that the nation has lost valuable time .  democracy is not served by ignorance and by excluding certain topics ,  he said .  i think that 's been the real loss in this case . ", "summary": " in the 1990s , the nra actively quashed a federal program to research firearms safety .   the nra says it opposes publicly funded research that could result in gun control .   the gun control debate has been reignited after the newtown school shooting .   this week , the nra will attend vice president joe biden 's task force meetings on gun control .
