{"text": "under then-secretary hillary clinton , the u.s. state department repeatedly refused to add the nigerian al-qaeda affiliate group boko haram -- the organization responsible for the recent kidnapping of more than 300 young girls -- to its official list of terrorist organizations . in november 2013 , current secretary john kerry did what clinton would n't . boko haram is the group that has claimed responsibility for kidnapping hundreds of girls in nigeria , promising to sell them into slavery . the daily beast reported thursday that in 2011 , after the group 's mass-murderers bombed the united nations building in abuja , nigeria , obama administration agencies and more than a dozen members of congress begged clinton to add it to its official list of designated terror organizations -- but the state department fought it and did nothing . former secretary hillary rodham clinton offered tepid condemnation of boko haram on wednesday night , hours before it emerged that her state department refused to designate the group as terrorists . clinton jumped on the hashtag bandwagon on sunday but has n't addressed why the mass-murdering organization was n't named a terror group on her watch . the urging came from the justice department , the central intelligence agency , the federal bureau of investigation and the head of the u.s. military 's africa command -lrb- africom -rrb- . now with boko haram in the international spotlight and clinton positioning herself for a presidential run , she has forcefully demanded u.s. government action to fight against the islamist group . ` access to education is a basic right & an unconscionable reason to target innocent girls . we must stand up to terrorism , ' she tweeted on sunday . ` boko haram ' is a loose translation of the hausa-language phrase ` western education is sinful . ' she said wednesday night during a ford foundation event in new york city that ` the government of nigeria has been , in my view , somewhat derelict in its responsibility for protecting boys and girls , men and women . ' ` they need to make it a priority to do everything they can to try to bring these girls home safely , ' clinton said , ` and that , i believe , requires assistance from others including the united states . ' that tepid condemnation , a day after she called the kidnappings ` an abominable ... act of terror , ' stands in sharp contrast to those of some who served with her in congress . ` these kidnappings are barbaric and gutless , ' new york democratic sen. chuck schumer told the new york post . ` boko haram is a particularly evil and vicious component of the islamic terrorist network , ' added new york republican rep. peter king . heartbreak : members of the all nigeria confederation of principals of secondary schools are protesting the nigerian government 's failure to rescue the abducted school girls . ` hypocrisy ' : clinton , now ramping up for a possible white house run , is urging the u.s. government to do what she would n't just a few years ago . sen. james risch , an idaho republican , told the daily beast that clinton missed the opportunity to enable the u.s. government to do more -- a possibility that designating boko haram as a terror group would have opened up . nigerian president goodluck jonathan said thursday that his government considers the abduction of hundreds of schoolgirls a turning point in his fight against islamist terror groups . ` for years , boko haram has terrorized nigeria and western interests in the region with few consequences ,  risch said . ` the u.s. government should have moved more quickly to list them as a terrorist organization and brought u.s. resources to track and disrupt their activities . the failure to act swiftly has had consequences . ' the online news outlet quoted an unnamed former senior u.s. official taking the suddenly alarmed clinton to the woodshed even more strongly . ` the one thing she could have done , the one tool she had at her disposal , she did n't use , ' the official reportedly said . ` and nobody can say she was n't urged to do it . it 's gross hypocrisy . ' in a march 2012 letter to clinton , rep. king and fellow republican pat meehan explained that the group had ` intensified its campaign of terrorism , including detonating a vehicle borne improvised explosive device -lrb- vbied -rrb- at a catholic church during christmas day mass . ' ` the group also conducted a series of attacks in january 2012 throughout nigeria that killed dozens , ' they wrote . ` these attacks follow the august 26 , 2011 bombing of the u.n. headquarters in abuja that killed 23 and injured 100 . ' ` according to human rights watch , boko haram has killed more than 900 people in the last two years . the brazenness and sophistication of these attacks are hallmarks of al qaeda tradecraft . ' meehan , along with democratic rep. jackie speier , published a scathing report on boko haram in november 2011 . it found that the vicious organization ` has quickly evolved and poses an emerging threat to u.s. interests and the u.s. homeland . ' ` boko haram has the intent and may be developing capability to coordinate on a rhetorical and operational level with al qaeda in the lands of the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- and al shabaab , ' it reported . this week the group massacred hundreds in a northeast nigerian town .", "summary": " cia , fbi , doj and more than a dozen members of congress begged her to add the group to state 's official list of designated terror organizations .   a suddenly alarmed clinton is now looking hypocritical , voicing her anger at boko haram after it kidnapped hundreds of nigerian girls .   john kerry , the secretary of state who followed clinton , did designate boko haram as a terror group , but clinton fought it all the way .   members of congress describe the al-qaeda-linked group with words like ` vicious , ' ` evil , ' ` gutless ' and ` barbaric ' "}
