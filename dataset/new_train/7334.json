{"text": "amateur film-makers will soon be able to give footage an age rating when posting it on youtube . a project - which will have three traffic light classifications of green , amber and red - is aiming to cut down on the amount of harmful and inappropriate content that can be seen by children online . when amateur film-makers post clips online , they will be able to give them ratings corresponding to british board of film classification levels - grouped into the three sets of u/pg , 12/15 and 18/r18 . protecting children : videos such as this one filmed during the london riots of 2011 may be subject to an ` amber ' rating because they could be distressing for younger viewers . dangerous : videos of extreme sportsmen or stunt artists suffering harm could be given red ratings , comparable to the 18 certificate received by the jackass u.s. series . video websites - not restricted to youtube - would also be able to allow viewers to comment on how films were rated , which could alert users and national authorities to any serious mistakes . the idea of a do-it-yourself rating system for uploaded videos was formed though discussions between the bbfc and classification bodies in italy and the netherlands , reported the observer . ` this is a service we want to offer , ' bbfc policy spokesman david austin told the newspaper . ` we already classify some 10,000 videos and films that are submitted to us for release every year . ` we will be using much the same classification model in the pilot for user-generated content . ' the extraordinary number of videos uploaded to youtube and other video sharing websites every day has made it impossible for any regulatory board to watch all the footage themselves . no problems : innocent videos on youtube , such as the famous ` charlie bit my finger - again ' from 2007 , would most likely be given a green -lrb- universal or parental guidance -rrb- rating by the person uploading them . but the idea for an online questionnaire about the content uploaded by an amateur producer was formed after conversations with the dutch film regulator , reported the observer . the bbfc said that the questionnaire results will mean ` different things in different countries ' - such as users in the netherlands not worrying so much about bad language , compared to the british . it is expected that the system will be tested from this summer . access that children can get to inappropriate online content is a concern for many parents . the mail is campaigning for internet providers to automatically block access to porn , with an optional opt-in , rather than parents having to rely on software to limit access . last week research revealed one in four children who try to get around parental controls on internet use are looking for pornography .", "summary": " film-makers will give ratings for videos corresponding to bbfc levels .   they will be grouped into green -lrb- u/pg -rrb- , amber -lrb- 12/15 -rrb- and red -lrb- 18/r18 -rrb- .   video website users will also be able comment on how films were rated .
