{"text": "rory mcilroy believes his renowned ability as a frontrunner will land him the dubai desert classic title despite seeing his lead cut to a single stroke at the halfway stage friday . mcilroy was unable to reproduce his first round heroics when he shot a 63 , but followed it up with a two-under-par 70 for a two-round total of 11-under 133 . unheralded american brooks koepka was his nearest challenger after a sparkling second round 65 while world number one tiger woods struggled to a one-over 73 to make the cut by one shot on three-under . england 's danny willett matched koepka 's 65 to share third place on eight-under with ireland 's damien mcgrane and frenchman julien quesne . defending champion stephen gallacher , who played in the same group as mcilroy and woods , was among seven players a shot further back , which included last year 's european number one henrik stenson of sweden . mcilroy struggled from the outset with a bogey on his opening hole but recovered to card three birdies to the turn . on the easier back nine he would have expected to pull further clear but instead made two bogeys , canceled out by birdies at the 10th and 18th . the 24-year-old remained optimistic he could build on his slender lead at the weekend and land his sixth european tour title .  i will just go back tonight and regroup and realize that i am still leading the tournament ,  he told the official european tour website .  i hit a couple of loose drives which i have n't done the last couple of weeks but i still feel like i 'm playing well enough to go and win the tournament .  mcilroy has won a number of events , including the 2009 dubai desert classic after leading for much of the way and believes it will hold him in good stead .  i have led from the front quite well in tournaments that i have won . i feel like i am still playing well , i know the course as well as anyone else and i expect to go out there and shoot two good scores over the weekend and hopefully lift the trophy .  koepka , who won three events on the secondary challenger tour last season , carded seven birdies to earn his chance of pairing with mcilroy saturday .  i 've never played with rory , so it 's going to be fun . i know him a little bit from seeing him around , so hopefully i 'll be able to play as well as i did today ,  he said . stenson , who topped the money lists in both the pga and european tours last season , looks to pose the biggest threat to mcilroy .  i think there is still a little way to go but today was the best i have putted for a long , long time ,  said the swede . woods , who missed the cut in his opening event of 2014 , was wayward off the tee and found the fairway just twice from 10 attempts when using his driver . the result was a three-bogey round that left him tied for for 44th , but still not out of the running if he could produce an inspired round at the weekend .", "summary": " rory mcilroy leads at halfway of the dubai desert classic .   cards a two-under 70 for a two-round total of 11-under 133 .   brooks koepka nearest challenger a shot further back .   tiger woods eight off the pace after a disappointing 73 .
