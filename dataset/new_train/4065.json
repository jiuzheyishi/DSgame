{"text": "brigette mccoy described how she was raped on her first military assignment , two weeks before her 19th birthday . she described how , later that year , she was raped by another soldier in her unit . then came sexual harassment by two officers -- including one who requested that she be moved to work directly for him , she said wednesday . testifying before lawmakers , the former army specialist described the  anguish  and  entrapment  she felt , and the horror of the ordeal that followed .  i no longer have any faith or hope that the military chain of command will consistently prosecute , convict , sentence and carry out the sentencing of sexual predators in uniform without absconding justice somehow ,  she told the senate armed services committee 's subcommittee on personnel .  it even starts at recruitment ,  she said .  we have quite a few of our men and women that are being raped and sexually harassed during the recruitment process .  mccoy was one of four alleged victims who testified wednesday about a problem the military has acknowledged . about 19,000 men and women suffer sexual assault each year in the military , former defense secretary leon panetta said , though he noted that only about 3,200 assaults were reported . about 10,700 of those cases -- 56 % -- involved male victims in 2010 , based on anonymous reporting collected by the military . in painful , dramatic testimony , three women and one man , all of whom have left the military , described their suffering -- and explained why , in some cases , they never filed reports . they helped paint a picture of the military as a place where victims are often pressured to remain quiet or endure having their reputations and careers tarnished for coming forward . high-ranking representatives from each military branch also gave statements , each one saying how brave they thought those troops had been in telling their stories openly . they stressed that special victims ' units have been established along with training to recognize , investigate and prosecute cases involving rape . maj. gen. gary patton , the director of the pentagon 's sexual assault prevention and response office , said that in his five decades of service , he 's seen massive cultural change in the military , including racial tolerance and increasing acceptance of gay and lesbian troops . changing attitudes toward sexual assault will be no different . only when rape within the military is treated with the same revulsion as friendly-fire will he believe a shift has actually occurred , he said . ` chaplain told me the rape was god 's will ' rebekhah havrilla was sexually harassed by a team leader to such an extent that she needed mental health care and medication , she said .  one week before my unit was scheduled to return back to the united states , i was raped by another service member that had worked with our team .  initially , i chose not to do a report of any kind because i had no faith in my chain of command , as my first sergeant previously had sexual harassment accusations against him , and the unit climate was extremely sexist and hostile in nature towards women ,  she said . later , she filed a restricted report against her rapist and the team leader . a year later , the former sergeant testified , she bumped into her rapist in a store , who told her he had been moved to her new location .  i was so re-traumatized from the unexpectedness of seeing him that i removed myself from training and immediately sought out the assistance from an army chaplain who told me , among other things , that the rape was god 's will and that god was trying to get my attention so that i would go back to church ,  she testified .  again , i did not file an unrestricted report against my rapist .   six months later , a friend called me and told me they had found pictures of me online that my perpetrator had taken during my rape .  so she turned to the army investigation division , which carried out a full investigation , she said . an investigator had her describe in detail what was happening in each of the photos . after months passed , she said , she was told that her rapist had told investigators that he had had consensual sex with havrilla . the command did not pursue adultery charges , and the case was closed .  the military criminal justice system is broken ,  havrilla said . later , after the hearing , havrilla posted a message on twitter :  i have your name , chaplain . sweat in your britches .  sen. richard blumenthal of connecticut told military leaders that he appreciated their comments but criticized them for giving  lawyer-like  statements . the problem of sexual assault in the military is a problem that demands a more immediate response . he called  sexual assault  as an  immensely destructive force ,  likening the assaults to the problem the military first grappled with years ago over strengthening its insufficient body armor so that the armor could withstand ied blasts . male victim : ` the culture of victim blaming must end ' male service members are victims , of course , and brian lewis reminded senators of that wednesday . lewis told senators he felt  humbled  to be  the first male survivor to testify in front of congress on this very important issue .  after enlisting in the navy in 1997 , he was raped by a superior officer during his first tour , he said .  i was ordered by my command not to report this crime .  then , he said ,  i was misdiagnosed with a personality disorder  and was discharged . that remains on his record , he said .  the military has shoved many survivors out the back door with inaccurate , misleading , and very harmful , almost weaponized , medical diagnoses like personality disorders that affect their benefits and future employment opportunities ,  he said . mccoy also said many victims are let go with  less than honorable discharges and personality disorders on their records , further hindering them from applying for medical treatment and medical claims .   the culture of victim blaming and retaliation while failing to punish the perpetrator must end ,  lewis said .  we also need to ensure that prevention efforts are inclusive of male service members . ... we can not marginalize male survivors and send a message that men can not be raped , and , therefore , are not real survivors ,  the former officer said . but , as senators pointed out , there are few convictions made in the military . according to a 2010 defense department study , only 8 % of sexual assailants are referred to military court , compared with 40 % of similar offenders prosecuted in the civilian court system . military ` desperately needs to be shown the next steps ' anu bhagwati , director of the service women 's action network , was the fourth victim who testified . she said that in her years as a marine officer , she  experienced daily discrimination and sexual harassment ,  which included rape jokes and  commercial sexual exploitation of women and girls .  while stationed at an infantry school ,  i witnessed reports of rape , sexual assault and sexual harassment swept under the rug by a handful of field grade officers .  perpetrators were promoted , were transferred to other units without punishment , while victims were accused of lying or exaggerating their claims in order to ruin men 's reputations .  she called on congress to grant  convening authority over criminal cases to trained , professional , disinterested prosecutors . commanding officers can not make truly impartial decisions because of their professional affiliation with the accused , and oftentimes with the victim as well .  she also called for civil courts to be opened to military victims .  congress must ensure that men and women in uniform can access the remedies available to all other aggrieved individuals under the federal tort claims act and the civil rights act . given the prevalence of retaliation against service members who report incidents of sexual assault and harassment , the absence of these remedies for military personnel is especially shameful .   we are looking ,  she said ,  at an institution that desperately needs to be shown the next steps forward .
