' i hate that man obama more than any man i 've ever met , more than any man who ever lived , ' said bill clinton to a friend after obama suggested he was a racist in 2008 according to klein 's book , excerpts of which appear in the new york post . indeed , despite president obama bringing hillary into his cabinet as secretary of state after his storming victory in 2008 , her presence only proved to antagonize relations between the two couples . scroll down for video . gossip and teasing : according to edward klein , michelle obama likes to make fun of hillary clinton over a glass of wine at the end of the day . no love lost ; despite having her in his cabinet as secretary of state , president clinton is wavering over his endorsement of hillary clinton -lrb- both seen here in 2011 -rrb- for the 2016 nomination . according to an account of klein 's explosive allegations in the new york post , michelle obama would sit in the evenings with her trusted adviser , valerie jarrett to gossip and make fun of hillary over a bottle of chardonnay . they nicknamed hillary the ` hildebeest ' , in reference to the ugly and sturdy gnu that is often seen wandering the serengeti . in the run up to the 2012 election , president obama 's campaign team advised the sitting president that he needed to utilize the sure-touch of bill clinton if he wanted to secure a second term . controversial : edward klein 's new book lays bare the anger and hatred at the heart of the relationship between the clintons and the obamas . loathe to do this , president obama finally asked the former president to play a round of golf with him in september 2011 , to ask for his help . ` i 'm not going to enjoy this , ' bill told hillary according to klein . ` i 've had two successors since i left the white house -- bush and obama -- and i 've heard more from bush , asking for my advice , than i 've heard from obama . i have no relationship with the president -- none whatsoever , ' clinton said . ' i really ca n't stand the way obama always seems to be hectoring when he talks to me . ` sometimes we just stare at each other . it 's pretty damn awkward . now we both have favors to ask each other , and it 's going to be very unpleasant . but i 've got to get this guy to owe me and to be on our side . ' the golf game was petty , tetchy and not without incident . president clinton . immediately tried to claim the upper hand by reminding obama that he . presided over an economic golden age , while obama was struggling to . affect any change during the great recession . hammering . home his point , bill clinton told president obama that obviously he and hillary . would be running for president in 2016 and that his wife would be ` the . most qualified , most experienced candidate , perhaps in history . ' this rankled with president obama , acutely aware of any attacks on his relative inexperience on walking into the white house . ` and . so bill continued to talk about hillary 's qualifications . . . and the . coming campaign in 2016 , ' writes klein as featured in the new york post . deal : according to edward klein , bill clinton agreed to fully campaign for barack obama on the proviso he supported his wife in 2016 . ` but . barack did n't bite . he changed the subject several times . then . suddenly , barack said something that took bill by complete surprise . he . said , ` you know , michelle would make a great presidential candidate , . too . ' ` bill was speechless . was barack comparing michelle 's qualifications to hillary 's ? ` bill . said that if he had n't been on a mission to strike a deal with barack , . he might have stormed off the golf course then and there . ' a deal was struck nonetheless . bill delivered a barnstorming speech to the democratic national convention , which threatened to upstage the president himself . however , the clintons both felt that the president was wavering in his commitment to endorse hillary for 2016 as his side of the bargain . in an effort to smooth over the rising tensions , the obamas hosted the clintons on march 1 , 2013 at a dinner - the day that the $ 85billion ` sequester ' budget cuts went into effect . the meal could go down as the moment that all bets were off in the two couple 's political marriage of necessity . according to klein , who spoke to those with knowledge of the dinner , bill could n't help hectoring the president about his handling of the economy . hillary , attempting to change the subject asked michelle if it was true she might copy her and run as a senator , in illinois , after her husband left office . michelle demurred to answer and allegedly bill was stunned that hillary would have shown her hand so openly . the back-and-forth between the four grew steadily more icy . tetchy : the two democrats endure an icy relationship which is not helped by their enduring animosity towards each other . bill suggested that the president turn over his much-vaunted social media enabled campaign know-how to the democratic party at large . ` you have to use your organization to aid the candidate in 2016 , ' bill pressed obama . ` really ? ' replied a sarcastic obama , according to klein . things deteriorated as president clinton continued to lecture the table as the president began to ignore his guests and check his blackberry . according to klein , hillary tried to change the subject again and asked if barack obama was happy he would n't have to campaign again , especially because he did n't seem to like it . ` for a guy who does n't like it , ' obama replied , ` i 've done pretty well . ' marriage of necessity : the clintons fear that the obamas will renege on their promise to support hillary in 2016 . ` well , ' bill said according to klein in the new york post , ' i was glad to pitch in and help get you re-elected . ' the after-effects of that meal are still being felt . the clintons have become convinced that obama will not back hillary for 2016 and that he is seeking to endorse vice-president joe biden or a new , young politician , just like he was . ` he 's convinced himself he 's been a brilliant president , and wants to clone himself -- to find his mini-me , ' says bill clinton to chelsea according to klein . ` he 's hunting for someone to succeed him , and he believes the american people do n't want to vote for someone who 's been around for a long time . he thinks that your mother and i are what he calls  so 20th century  . he 's looking for another barack obama .
