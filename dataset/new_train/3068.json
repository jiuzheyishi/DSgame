{"text": "andy burnham roused deflated labour activists yesterday with a pledge to put the brakes on healthcare privatisation -- despite a warning from the head of the nhs that it would be impossible . a day after ed miliband 's lacklustre speech to his party 's conference , the shadow health secretary received a series of standing ovations as he promised a ` rescue plan for a shattered service ' . but it emerged yesterday that nhs england chief executive simon stevens had thrown a spanner in the works by writing to mr burnham to dismiss labour 's call to block all new contracts between hospitals and the private sector . scroll down for video . shadow health secretary andy burnham had tears in his eyes after 91 year old harry smith attacked david cameron in a speech at the labour conference . mr smith told labour activists about his childhood growing up in a ` barbarous , bleak and uncivilised ' barnsley slum . members of the audience were visibly moved by the emotional section of the conference dedicated to the nhs . embarrassingly for mr burnham , mr stevens told him that rules introduced by labour itself in 2006 meant there must be competition over who provides services . in another blow for labour , it was revealed that mr miliband 's pledge of a cash boost for the nhs actually amounts to less than the budget increase granted by margaret thatcher every year she was in power . on tuesday , the labour leader announced a new # 2.5 billion fund to pay for 20,000 more nurses , 8,000 extra gps , 5,000 careworkers and 3,000 midwives . but the money amounts to an increase of just 2.2 per cent on the # 111 billion budget planned by the government . while mrs thatcher was prime minister , the lowest cash increase was 6 per cent -- and between 1949 and 2010 , the average annual growth in nhs spending was 4 per cent . mr burnham used his speech to pledge that , if labour wins power , carers will be given better support with funding for breaks and annual health checks . and there will be a new promise that everyone who wants to die at home rather than in hospital should be able to , if clinically possible . but much of the barnstorming address was an attack on what he claimed was the tories ' creeping privatisation of the nhs -- even though he signed off on increased use of private firms to provide care when he was health secretary . catherine atkinson , who is standing to become a labour mp in erewash , took her baby jacob on to the stage . she was seen holding her son while trying to get conference organisers to let her address the audience . shadow cabinet sources claim mr burnham has toughened up his position on privatisation to win support from the left of the party in anticipation of a leadership bid . ` andy 's on manoeuvres , ' said one . in his speech , mr burnham said : ` the party that created the nhs in the last century today sets out a plan to secure it in this . a rescue plan for a shattered service . miss atkinson said she did not want jacob to grow up ` saying ` we used to have an nhs for all ' ` but more than that . a vision for a 21st-century nhs there when you need it , personal to you and your family , with time to care . ' a national health and care service based on people before profits . today we place that proud labour plan at the centre of our election campaign . ' mr burnham said that days into office in 2010 , ` the tories set about dismantling your nhs ' . ` and the plan that dared not speak its name before the last election is now plain for all to see : run it down , break it up , sell it off , ' he said . ` so today we serve notice on cameron and clegg : thursday , may 7 , 2015 -- your day of reckoning on the nhs . ' mr burnham added : ` our ten-year plan for the nhs is founded on people before profits . we will free the nhs from cameron 's market and , yes , repeal his toxic health and social care act . ` we will ask hospitals to collaborate once again and reinstate the nhs as our preferred provider . the public nhs , protected with labour . not for sale . not now , not ever . ' labour insists the government 's restructuring of nhs commissioning , which came into force in 2013 , has led to privatisation by the back door . ` but use of the private sector by the nhs doubled in the last four years of labour , a far bigger increase than under the coalition . since 2010 , a further 1.3 per cent of the nhs budget is spent in the private sector , with the total standing at about 6 per cent . in a letter to mr burnham , seen by the daily mail , mr stevens flatly rejected his call for a moratorium on any new deals with the private sector as impossible . a labour spokesman said : ` david cameron 's reorganisation forces the tendering of contracts , not the eu . ` we still believe these large contracts should be halted until there 's an nhs debate at the election . ' shadow health secretary andy burnham gave a passionate defence of the health service , urging labour activists to ` battle for the soul of the nhs ' mr burnham 's barnstorming speech stole the show at the manchester central conference centre . the positive reaction from activists came as the party was left reeling by ed miliband 's meandering speech , in which he forgot whole sections on the deficit and immigration . to promote his promise of # 2.5 billion for the nhs , mr miliband visited salford royal hospital today , but faced more questions about what he left out of his speech .", "summary": " bookies cut the odds on shadow health secretary becoming labour leader .   but health supremo simon stevens warns pledge is ` impossible '   receives standing ovation for passionate plea to save the ` soul of the nhs '   reaction was in marked contrast with ed miliband 's lacklustre speech .   labour promising # 2.5 billion fund to hire 36,000 more doctors and nurses .   amounts to a 2.2 % annual increase , less than when thatcher was pm .
