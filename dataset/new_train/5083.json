{"text": "bbc veteran michael buerk was criticised last night for describing tess daly as ` a pneumatic bird-brain from strictly come dancing ' . while many agreed with his view that bbc coverage of the queen 's diamond jubilee river pageant was ` cringingly inept ' , they said it was wrong to single out presenters rather than bosses . others took to the internet to describe his remarks in a mail on sunday article -- which saw him call the presenters ` airheads ' -- as cruel and accused him of being grumpy . ` ashamed of the bbc ` michael buerk called presenter tess daly ' a pneumatic bird-brain from strictly ' in an end-of-year comment piece , the 66-year-old former newsreader argued that the spectacle of the queen 's diamond jubilee was ` betrayed ' by the bbc 's dumbed-down coverage . ` the one enduring british institution -lsb- the monarchy -rsb- was mocked by another that had shamefully lost its way , ' he wrote . ` on the screen , a succession of daytime airheads preened themselves , or gossiped with even more vacuous d-list  celebrities  . with barely an exception , they were cringingly inept . ' he then focused on miss daly 's talent as a news presenter . he said : ` the dunkirk little ships , the most evocative reminders of this country 's bravest hour , were ignored so that a pneumatic bird-brain from strictly come dancing could talk to transvestites in battersea park . ` i was so ashamed of the bbc i would have wept if i had n't been so angry . the worst thing was that it was deliberate -- planned that way to be  light  and  inclusive  . ' some critics said while they agreed with his analysis , they objected to what they saw as a personal attack on miss daly . just not good enough : michael buerk was highly critical of the bbc 's coverage of the diamond jubilee - which included tess daly . one wrote on the bbc 's points of view message board : ` i did agree ... but was mystified as to why it was mainly aimed at the indians instead of the chiefs . ' another said while it was ` generally agreed ' the bbc ` failed miserably ' in the coverage , to turn it into an attack on the presenters rather than those in charge was ` wrong ' . one responded on twitter : ` there is no need to be cruel about tess daly . ' but there was a lot of support for his view that presenters such as miss daly and fearne cotton had not been right for the event . in an interview with another sunday paper , bbc presenter clare balding admitted the ` light entertainment ' feel of the river pageant had been wrong . ` we want to be informed and interested , we want presenters who are well-prepared and know their stuff , ' she said . ` yes , the bbc should entertain , but in doing so they 'd moved too far from their remit to educate , too , and viewers did n't like it . ' miss daly was unavailable for comment yesterday .", "summary": " bbc veteran criticised for ` personal attack ' on strictly presenter tess daly .   mr buerk slammed bbc 's coverage of the queen 's diamond jubilee river pageant in a mail on sunday article calling it ` cringingly inept ' "}
