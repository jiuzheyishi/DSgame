{"text": "president obama called it  the defining issue of our time  in his 2012 state of the union , but he did so without ever uttering the phrase  income inequality .  perhaps that 's because income inequality is one of those alliterative word pairs everyone 's heard by now but few fully understand . instead of wonking up his speech with terms that may confuse some , obama focused on the more familiar american dream . that 's  the basic american promise ,  as he put it ,  that if you worked hard , you could do well enough to raise a family , own a home , send your kids to college , and put a little away for retirement .  the defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive ,  he continued .  no challenge is more urgent . no debate is more important .  but what , exactly , is income inequality , and why does it matter so much in modern america that you would vote on it as one of the top social justice issues of our time ? here 's a snack-sized primer : . a definition of income inequality . income inequality refers to how evenly or unevenly income is distributed in a society . the united states has a relatively high level of income inequality because the very richest people take home a large share of the economic pie -- and there is a relatively large gap between them and some of the poorest people in america . scandinavian countries have lower levels of income inequality because , overall , prosperity is more broadly distributed there , instead of being concentrated in the hands of a few . there are other variations of inequality , too . some economists think  wealth inequality  is a better measure of what 's happening in the united states , since the super-rich are even farther away from the rest of us when you consider their assets , not just their incomes . some prefer the broader term  economic inequality .  how is income inequality measured ? the most popular measure of inequality is called the gini coefficient . that coefficient , or index ,  measures the extent to which the distribution of income or consumption expenditure among individuals or households within an economy deviates from a perfectly equal distribution ,  according to the world bank . a rating of 0 means the society in question is perfectly equal -- or everyone has the same income . a rating of 100 means that one person takes home 100 % of the income . the united states has a gini rating of 45 , according to the cia world factbook . sweden , the most-equal country , gets a rating of 23 . lesotho , in southern africa , has the highest gini coefficient on the cia 's list with a rating of 63.2 . there are other ways to measure inequality , too , such as looking at the income held by the richest 20 % and comparing it to that held by the poorest 20 % . all of the different measures try to answer the question : how is money distributed in this place ? what 's the trend in the united states ? the reason the president and others keep talking about income inequality -- with or without calling it that -- is because the income gap in america has been growing since the late 1970s . experts disagree on exactly why , but most say it has something to do with cutting taxes on the very richest americans and the growth of the finance industry . technology also likely contributes to the shift , as many middle-class workers have seen their jobs taken by machines . meanwhile , the very richest people are taking home a larger share of income than at any time since the late 1920s . is more income inequality necessarily bad ? pretty much no one these days thinks everyone in the united states should have exactly the same income . but many economists and philosophers say extreme income inequality -- and many would argue that 's what we have -- is a problem . the economist joseph stiglitz argues income inequality is  holding back  our recovery from the recession . the epidemiologist kate pickett says high income inequality is associated with all sorts of bad things -- from obesity to high incarceration rates and violence . the philosopher thomas pogge told me societies can become so economically divided that people stop seeing each other as equals -- and a sort of classist ,  downton abbey  dynamic develops . others argue income inequality hampers economic mobility -- meaning it 's less likely that that american dream is actually a reality for people . think of the economy as a ladder , former u.s. labor secretary robert reich told me . if the rungs of the ladder are super far apart , how can you expect a person to climb ? more-conservative thinkers argue that income inequality is necessary for a capitalist society to thrive -- that income gaps encourage competition , innovation and hard work . how is the use more unequal than nigeria ? if you look at the cia 's list of the most equal and unequal countries , the united states ranks below a whole host of nations that most americans probably would n't want to move to . they include : iran , uganda , nigeria , russia , senegal , nicaragua , mali , mauritania , vietnam , yemen , mongolia . i could go on and on . it 's important to keep in mind that , in this case , the gini coefficient is being used to measure inequalities within a given society . south africa has a very high rate of income inequality because it does have both very wealthy and very poor people . there are n't many rich people in niger , another country that 's more equal than the united states . if everyone is more or less poor -- a country still could be relatively equal . so , that 's a caveat . but there still is research to support the idea that very high levels of income inequality tear at the fabric of society , regardless of its overall wealth . the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of john d. sutter .", "summary": " income inequality has been growing in the united states since the late 1970s .   john sutter : the topic is pervasive but relatively little-understood .   obama argues against income inequality without using the term .
