{"text": "a massive catering operation that served up thousands of pounds of meat to feed the builders who made the famous giza pyramids has been unearthed in egypt , it emerged today . archaeologists found the ancient remains at a site believed to have been a village used to house workers about 1,300 ft south of the sphinx . it is thought the workers , who occupied the site for around 35 years , were building the pyramid of pharaoh menkaure , the third and last pyramid on the giza plateau . the site , which has been studied for several decades , is also known by its arabic name , heit el-ghurab , and is sometimes called ` the lost city of the pyramid builders ' . catering operation : the site known as the old kingdom corral , with the giza pyramids in the distance . researchers note that it was large enough to hold 55 cattle with feeding pens . the great sphinx and one of the pyramids at giza , which is now a unesco world heritage site , near cairo , egypt . so far , researchers have discovered a nearby cemetery with bodies of pyramid builders , a corral with possible slaughter areas on the southern edge of the workers ' town and piles of animal bones . based on animal bone findings , nutritional data , and other discoveries at this workers ' town site , the archaeologists estimate that an average of more than 4,000 lbs of cattle , sheep and goat meat were slaughtered every day to feed the pyramid builders . this meat-rich diet , along with the apparent availability of medical care , shown by skeletons found with healed bones , show the workers enjoyed relatively good conditions . richard redding , chief research officer . at ancient egypt research associates , a group that has been . excavating and studying the workers ' town site for about 25 years , told livescience the builders were looked after . he said : ` people were taken care of , and they were well fed when they were down there working , so there would have been an attractiveness to that . ` they probably got a much better diet than they got in their village . ' the site believed to have been a village used to house workers about 1,300 ft south of the sphinx . redding estimates he has identified about 25,000 sheep and goats , 8,000 cattle and 1,000 pig bones , he wrote in a paper published in the book proceedings of the 10th meeting of the icaz working group - archaeozoology of southwest asia and adjacent areas . around 10,000 workers helped build the menkaure pyramid , with a smaller work force present year-round to cut stones and complete preparation and survey work , the aera team estimates . this smaller work force would have ramped up for a few months starting around july of each year . redding , who is also a research scientist . at the kelsey museum of archaeology and a member of the faculty at the . university of michigan , added : ` what they would do is , for about four or five months a year , they would bring in a big work force to move blocks , and they would do nothing but move blocks . ' the great pyramid of giza is the oldest of the seven wonders of the ancient world and the only one to remain largely intact . it is thought to have been built as a tomb for an ancient egyptian pharaoh over a period of around 20 years up to 2560bce . the . pyramid was originally covered by highly polished white casing stones . that formed a smooth outer surface , but centuries of erosion mean the . structure 's stepped underlying core is visible today . it is thought to be made up of around 2.3 million limestone blocks believed to have been transported from nearby quarries . originally towering at 481ft , the great pyramid was the world 's tallest man-made structure for over 3,800 years . today . it stands at 455ft tall , and is dwarfed by the 2,717 ft burj khalifa in . dubai , which currently holds the title of world 's tallest building . the workers would need at least 45 to 50 grams of protein a day , redding said . half of this protein would likely come from fish , beans , lentils and other non-meat sources , while the other half would come from sheep , goat and cattle , he estimated . milk and cheese were probably not consumed due to transportation problems and the cattle 's low milk yield during that time , redding said . redding estimates that around 11 cattle and 37 sheep or goats were consumed each day in addition to supplying workers with grain , beer and other products . it is estimated that in order to maintain this level of slaughter , the ancient egyptians would have needed a herd of 21,900 cattle and 54,750 sheep and goats just to keep up regular delivery to the giza workers . a settlement located adjacent to the workers ' town , dubbed ` eastern town , ' was n't as rigidly planned as workers ' town , and its residents were eating a considerable number of pigs , the researchers found . evidence also suggested the people in eastern town were trading with people in workers ' town for hippo-tusk fragments . these findings suggest that the residents of the eastern town were not as directly involved in pyramid building and had a special relationship with the pyramid workers . ` they were not provisioned ; they were not given their meat and food every day , ' like those in the workers ' town were , redding said . ` it 's more of a typical urban farming settlement , and there was a symbiotic relationship between the two - probably . ` what we think now is - and this is something we 're going to be coming out with in the next little while - is that , more likely , it was a large portion of the work force , the more skilled laborers -lsb- living at workers ' town -rsb- , and that there were temporary camps up by the pyramids where the temporary workers who came in would be housed , ' he said . ` they probably -lrb- did n't -rrb- need much in the way of housing ; they would need more shade than anything else . they would n't need any kind of warmth because it would n't be winter . ' future studies will look for the remains of the workers ' towns of khufu and khafre , the two other pharaohs who built pyramids at giza . a dump area , investigated in the 1950s , may hold them ; seal impressions found at the dump have the rulers ' names on them . ` what we think was going on was that menkaure came along , he establishes his reign , he leveled that whole area and he took all the levelling debris , took it to the top of the hill and threw it over the back in a big dump , ' redding said . ` that dump on the back side of the ridge may represent a remnant of khufu and khafre 's construction 's town , ' redding said , adding that he hopes new excavations will begin on the dump in the next year or two .", "summary": " cattle , sheep and goat meat served up every day to feed builders .   remains found at a site about 1,300 ft south of the sphinx .   it is thought the workers were building pyramid of pharaoh menkaure .
