{"text": "follow @@ philduncanf1 . lewis hamilton and nico rosberg 's attempts at maintaining a friendly rivalry are well and truly over after the german 's controversial victory at the monaco grand prix resulted in a podium ceremony laced with barely-disguised contempt . hamilton believes rosberg was guilty of underhand tactis in order to beat him in monte carlo , but if so he is only following in the footsteps of many of f1 's all-time legends . but as the pair 's boss at mercedes - the great niki lauda , no less - said : ` you have to be a b ****** if you want to win in formula one . ' here , we remember f1 's ultimate b ******* -lrb- who also happen to be hugely successful -rrb- . just look at his face : lewis hamilton -lrb- left -rrb- was clearly furious at nico rosberg -lrb- centre -rrb- in monte carlo . michael schumacher . formula one 's ultimate anti-hero , with his thin-lipped smile . the most significant black marks against his reputation were his crashes with title rivals damon hill and jacques villeneuve in the deciding races of the 1994 and 1997 seasons . but perhaps his lowest act of skulduggery was parking on the racing line at rascasse to deny fernando alonso pole position at monaco in 2006 . he had ice in his veins , never more so that putting the car on pole at san marino in the spring of 2003 . he went back to see his seriously ill mother elisabeth that evening in germany and returned back to race . by the time he started , she had died -- but he still won . always controversial : michael schumacher reacts before and after qualifying in monaco in 2006 . underhand : schumacher and damon hill crash in melbourne in 1994 as the german sealed his first world title . nelson piquet . for sheer rudeness nobody , surely , can match piquet . he called nigel mansell , his 1986 and 1987 williams team-mate , ` an uneducated blockhead with a stupid and ugly wife . ' he dismissed enzo ferrari as ` senile ' and asked whether he or ayrton senna -lrb- whom he had previously insinuated was gay -rrb- was a better driver , replied : ` i 'm still alive . ' rude and crafty : nelson piquet -lrb- right -rrb- , with frank williams and nigel mansell at brands hatch in 1986 . he could also be crafty . he kept secret from mansell the fact he was using a new differential , which helped him win the 1986 hungarian grand prix . years later , he was involved in disclosing renault 's part in crashgate -- the fixed race in singapore -- involving his son nelson jnr , who hardly lacked confidence himself . fernando alonso . alonso is synonymous with ruthlessness in modern formula one . the ` most complete driver ' is a kinder way of putting it . even in his championship-winning years at renault he was tetchy if giancarlo fisichella , an ideal no 2 , was ever perceived to be given even half-favourable treatment . this trait continued at mclaren , where he joined the rookie lewis hamilton . there must be some sympathy for alonso , for hamilton was a product of the team 's development programme and the darling of the sport . but there was no excuse for snitching to the fia about mclaren 's role in spygate because he was denied outright no 1 status . and what about crashgate , the singapore race he won after his team-mate nelson piquet jnr crashed ? he knew nothing about the team orders ... or so he said . ` crashgate ' : nelson piquet jnr deliberately wrecked his renault under team orders in singapore in 2008 . butter would n't melt : fernando alonso -lrb- centre -rrb- was the chief beneficiary , winning the race after a safety car . niki lauda . the rat-featured austrian was a clever and meticulous driver . he said of his relations with alain prost at mclaren : ` i hated the guy . honestly . he 's a difficult character . ` let 's put it that way . when he started to blow me off all the time in practice , because he was better at handling this 1200hp thing than i was , i changed my strategy . but i never told him any more what i was doing to the car . if i was more clever setting up my car why should i give him the advantage of it ? ' and who was in charge of mercedes when they sneaked in an extra tyre test last year ? the old calculating niki lauda . all for show : niki lauda and alain prost appeared united on the podium at estoril in 1984 , but all was not well . james hunt . a different kind of b ****** . ` master james ' was the usually debonair , sometimes boorish british icon . but he can not be left off the list : the sheer scale of his hedonism is too great to ignore . at times it was amazing that he could even drive straight such was the cocktail of excess he had taken the night before . sometimes he could not , and his spin at brands hatch during the british grand prix was one such occasion . hash , cocaine , acid or alcohol may have had something to do with it . at other moments he had a queue of british airways stewardesses outside his door . he was ruthless and brave , characteristics that made him drive through the rain to win the 1976 title . ladies ' man : james hunt with his first wife , suzy miller , in 1974 -lrb- left -rrb- and partying with barry sheene -lrb- right -rrb- . ayrton senna . when lewis hamilton threatened to ` take a leaf out of senna 's book ' ahead of sunday 's race , he could have been referring to a number of incidents involving the ruthless and calculated three-times world champion . indeed , for all his brilliance behind the wheel of a formula one car , senna could be quite callous in the cockpit , displaying a win-at-all-costs mentality which the sport had never seen before . the most damning came at suzuka in 1990 when senna , aggrieved with starting from pole on the dirty side of the track , rammed his great rival alain prost off at the very first corner in order to win the title . senna explaining away his behaviour replied simply : ' i am senna ' . ruthless : ayrton senna takes out prost at the japanese grand prix in 1990 to clinch the world championship . lewis hamilton . there is an air of entitlement to lewis . that was clear in the concocted evidence he gave to the stewards in australia in the incident known as ` lie-gate ' , even if the team told him what lines to say . but his most gross act of bad behaviour was tweeting confidential mclaren telemetry . a firmer boss than martin whitmarsh would have severely reprimanded him or even sacked him . as well as this , he complained bitterly about mclaren 's strategy at monaco in 2007 , his rookie year , saying : ` i 'm not a no 2 . ' fast forward seven years and we learned that he ignored team orders not to put on the overtaking mode during the closing stages of the spanish grand prix earlier this month . naughty boy . painted smiles : alonso and hamilton were team-mates at mclaren in 2007 but soon fell out . sebastian vettel . the german became a pantomime villain last season after he was jeered and taunted en route to his record-breaking fourth consecutive title . the ill-feeling surrounded his conduct at the malaysian grand prix - a race in which he ruthlessly ignored an order from his team - that of ` multi 21 ' - to hold station behind mark webber . despite the outpouring of negativity towards him , vettel said he would be prepared to ignore team orders again : ` i 'm not sure i can give a proper answer because in the moment it might be different but i would probably do the same . ' civil war : sebastian vettel -lrb- left -rrb- did n't play fair with former red bull team-mate mark webber -lrb- right -rrb- . nico rosberg . the more cerebral type of b ****** ? with his germanic iciness , five languages and engineering background , he is the sort of villain who strokes a white cat on his lap . the only problem with his inclusion is that we do n't know for sure that he meant deliberately to disrupt hamilton 's flying lap at monaco last weekend . if it was planned , it was the perfect crime , for the stewards cleared him and he drove on to win . either way , he is working hard to find an engineering edge over hamilton . that is ruffling hamilton ; rosberg is unperturbed . did he mean it ? rosberg took pole position in monaco last weekend after a controversial aborted lap . alain prost . the pint-sized professor had sights on winning world titles , not friends . paranoid with fear that his own mclaren team were conspiring against him to win the 1989 title , he appeared to cause a deliberate collision with rival senna at the decisive race in japan . prost jumped out of his car only to watch senna win the race and the championship . prost paid a visit to see his countryman , ally and fia president jean-marie balestre and senna was later stripped of the victory , a loophole in the regulations deemed senna had re-joined the track illegally . prost was subsequently crowned champion . arch rivals : prost -lrb- left -rrb- in a typically frosty moment with mclaren team mate senna -lrb- right -rrb- in 1988 .", "summary": " lewis hamilton and nico rosberg battle is latest in long line of f1 feuds .   hamilton believes rosberg deliberately crashed at monaco grand prix qualifying in bid to scupper his bid for pole position .   niki lauda , the pair 's boss at mercedes , said that ` b ******* ' succeed in f1 .   ayrton senna , michael schumacher , sebastian vettel and more have all been involved in controversy in past .
