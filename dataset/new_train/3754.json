' at the preliminary hearing , a section from mr davies ' claim was read out that said : ' i have continuously witnessed colleagues making offensive comments about travellers .

' instituionalised : he claimed the term had been ` institutionalised ' at the force over the 20 years he has worked there , and was a discriminatory reference to his own ethnicity . however , jack feeny , representing mr davies , said : ` if everyone in the office is using the word ginger to describe celtics that would be direct discrimination because they are attacking celticism through a code word . ` there will be evidence to show that the use of the term ` traveller ' by thames valley police is synonymous with an ethnic group . ` those police officers were not referring to new age travellers when they made the comments that the complainant complained about . ' mr arnold claimed that as soon as officers gave evidence that they did not know the term traveller related specifically to romany people , the case would collapse . mr davies is seeking compensation for injuries to his feelings by racial discrimination . nine colleagues of pc davies who have had allegations against them and expert witnesses on the use of the word traveller , were expected to be called to give evidence at the full 10-day hearing , which is due to start on june 30 .", "summary": " jim davies claims thames valley police staff call romany people ` pikeys '   insists the term ` traveller ' is an offensive reference to his own ethnicity .   the speed enforcement officer is now suing force for ` racial discrimination ' "}
