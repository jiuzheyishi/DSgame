{"text": "in the midst of the contentious debate over the common core state standards , many critics have lost perspective on its purpose . why did so many governors , educators and policymakers across both parties join together to create the standards in the first place ? a brief look at common core 's history would help explain its significance and counter some of the criticisms . in 1983 , then secretary of education terrel bell commissioned the seminal report ,  a nation at risk ,  which highlighted american students ' falling sat scores and awakened the nation to its educational malaise . among many of the report 's recommendations , which eventually became a platform for modern education reforms , were calls for  more rigorous and measurable standards .  american students were victims of low expectations and inconsistent learning goals . but despite the report 's warnings and billions of dollars more spent on education , not much has changed . thanks to benchmarked national and international exams , like the national assessment of educational progress -lrb- naep -rrb- or trends in international mathematics and science study -lrb- timss -rrb- , we know that american students continue to fall short . -lrb- there 's one sliver of good news : for a number of reasons there have been dramatic improvements in some individual states like massachusetts . -rrb- . these exams highlighted how the performance of american students differed widely between states and districts . some states had high internationally competitive standards ; others were far too low . in fact , some states were dumbing down standards and exams in order to hide the poor performance of their students . for example , new york state rated 87 % of its fourth graders proficient in math , according to its own state testing in 2009 . that would be astounding -- if true . but naep results calculated that only 40 % of the state 's fourth graders were proficient or better in math . educational performance in many districts and states resembled lake wobegon -- the fictional place in garrison keillor 's  a prairie home companion  where  all the women are strong , all the men are good looking , and all the children are above average .  but reality is different . local control has always been an essential right of education in america , but there was a growing problem : when different states with different standards and different tests proliferated , we ended up with unreliable measures of how our children are really doing . a wide and disparate variety of education standards promotes chaos and deception . realizing this , in 2009 , a collaborative involving the national governors association and council of chief state school officers began to discuss the need for common standards and accountability . the end goal is that an  a  in math in new jersey should be equivalent to an  a  in math in louisiana , or in california , and so on . so began the coordinated effort from governors , educators and legislators to compose benchmarked standards that would be the same across state lines . the product became the common core state standards . its genesis was local and its purpose was to lift education performance through state , not federal , collaboration . this was the original intent of the common core . it is a worthy and necessary idea . unfortunately , outside forces have interfered with or distorted the idea , obscuring its real merits . federal intrusions such as the race to the top grants have not been helpful . common core is n't without its problems , but some of have been exaggerated and some have been made up out of thin air . we ca n't lose sight of the original intent . should common core fail , the movement -- decades in the making -- toward rigorous , common standards would be dealt a serious blow . while various questions about common core and its implementation persist , such as how to handle data privacy or concerns that some of the standards may not be rigorous enough , individual states have the right and ability to craft their own supplemental solutions . for example , this year ohio passed hb 487 to protect the confidentiality of student data and florida altered its common core standards to include more advanced calculus standards . some of the criticisms leveled against common core stem from mistakes made in local implementations -- not from a uniform federal mandate . it is ironic that the very thing which many of common core 's critics value the most -- local control -- has often resulted in curricula , subject matter , readings , and exercises in local classrooms that are objectionable , substandard , or politically tendentious . if common core fails , education reform will regress and american students ' flat or falling test results in learning will continue . it must be noted that many of common core 's critics still lack a persuasive alternative or any alternative at all .", "summary": " william bennett : critics of common core have lost perspective of its purpose .   bennett : the problem is how to address american students ' flat or falling test scores .   he says lack of common standards means inconsistent and unreliable learning results .   bennett : some of its problems stem from local implementations , not federal mandate .
