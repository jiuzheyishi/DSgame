{"text": "blues singer rita chiarelli has played every kind of venue during her award-winning career : nightclubs , music festivals , concert halls . but of all those locales one remains unforgettable : the louisiana state penitentiary at angola . chiarelli , an ontario native , went to angola with the intention of playing solo for the prisoners , but wound up performing and recording with inmates , an experience she says changed her .  i had no idea that i would be so moved and that my heart would be opened up so much from spending time with these guys ,  she said . chiarelli 's unlikely collaboration with angola 's prison musicians is documented in the film  music from the big house .  she is touring north america , showing the film and performing for audiences . chiarelli said she arranged to get a tour of angola a decade ago after learning of its rich musical history . the legendary blues/folk artist huddie william ledbetter -lrb- better known as leadbelly -rrb- plied his 12-string guitar from behind the walls of angola . his music came to light through the efforts of folklorists john and alan lomax , who recorded leadbelly and other inmates .  i saw where leadbelly was probably incarcerated ,  she said . angola  haunted me , you know , the mississippi river flowing through it and ... i was just haunted by these images . and that all this music had come from this place .  chiarelli said she began to wonder whether there were any musical inmates currently serving time at angola . the answer was a resounding yes .  we have 10 or 12 bands  comprised of prisoners , warden burl cain confirmed to cnn . he said he did n't hesitate when chiarelli pitched him on the idea of performing with the inmates , and having a documentary crew film it .  when she talked about a blues concert , that got our attention . we were excited about that ,  cain said .  it was a real morale booster for the inmates in the -lrb- music -rrb- program . she stood for the blues and we like that music here .   i think that the wardens trusted me ,  chiarelli said .  i met with them several times and i convinced them that my aim was true . honestly i felt that it was really important historically to once again document music that was going on at angola .  the documentary shows her working intensively with musicians in three bands in a variety of styles -- blues , country and r&b .  they were really great -lrb- musicians -rrb- . a few of the vocalists -- i was very , very impressed ,  chiarelli said .  i mean they just have so much soul and they give it when they 're performing .  as they rehearsed for a concert in the prison chapel , chiarelli developed a close rapport with her bandmates , a bond that is evident in the film . some of them reveal on camera how their lives got off track , putting them behind bars .  they opened up and told us their stories , which was the wondrous part of the film ,  chiarelli said .  it 's really moving to see a fellow that 's in there for murder tell his story , tell his circumstances , realize that there 's victims -- that a lot of people have been hurt through his actions . it 's emotional .  most of the musicians -lrb- singers ray jones , albert patterson , emanuel lee , bassist laird veillon and drummer calvin lewis , for instance -rrb- are serving life sentences without the possibility of parole .  ninety-five percent of them are going to die here ,  cain said .  it 's really important to give them encouragement and hope . ... you can do the time if you have hope .  for many , hope comes in the form of playing in a prison band .  it 's something that 's really kept me going ,  jones told filmmakers . he 's been locked up in angola for 32 years . chiarelli said her documentary reveals  how these inmates feel when they 're performing ... and the release of anger and frustration and everything that happens through the power of music .  she said making the film made her mindful of not only the victims of the crimes committed by the men , but also of the prisoners ' capacity for redemption .  through the film we see the humanity of these folks and realize that sometimes it 's not always bad people that do bad things ,  she said .  sometimes good people zig instead of zag and end up in a situation where something horrible happens .  chiarelli said her experience  moved me deeply and just opened my heart to realize that sometimes people need to be forgiven , that maybe , you know , some people have a right to be forgiven .  she is aware that 's a controversial proposition , one she is prepared to let audiences debate . so far she is encouraged by the reaction .  a lot of them -lrb- moviegoers -rrb- come out of -lrb- screenings -rrb- and are moved to tears ,  she said .  and i think a lot of them , their outlook is changed .
