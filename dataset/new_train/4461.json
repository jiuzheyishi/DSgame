{"text": "there were no genetic tests 400,000 years ago , so our ancient relatives did n't know as much about themselves as we know about them now . scientists have reconstructed a nearly complete mitochondrial genome of an ancient human relative , whose remains were found in sima de los huesos -lrb-  pit of bones  -rrb- in northern spain . it is the oldest dna to be recovered from an early humanlike species , authors of a study wrote in the journal nature . the ancient species that has revealed some of its genetic secrets , via bone fragments from a femur , is probably not directly linked to your family tree though .  it 's quite clear that this is not a direct ancestor of people today ,  said svante paabo , a biologist at the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology and senior author of the study . instead , he said , this representative of an early humanlike species , called homo heidelbergensis , could be an ancestor of both neanderthals and another group called the de nisovans . the genetic relationship to denisovans , discovered through this dna research , is surprising because the homo heidelbergensis remains found in the cave have many neanderthal-like features . the only remnants of denisovans come from siberia -- a long way from spain .  it 's sort of an open question really what this means , and i think further research into the nuclear genome of these hominins will address that ,  paabo said . how they did it . paabo and colleagues used a new method for sequencing ancient , degraded genetic material to put together the 400,000-year-old specimen 's mitochondrial genome . it is the oldest dna ever found outside permafrost conditions -- in other words , it was not permanently frozen .  the retrieval of such ancient human dna is a major technical achievement , and promises further recovery of such material from other fossils in this time range , both in the sima and elsewhere , where we would not previously have expected it , or looked for it ,  said chris stringer , researcher at the natural history museum in london , who was not involved in the study . mitochondria are structures in cells that convert food energy into usable forms . dna stored in the mitochondria is passed to children through the maternal line only -lrb- i.e. , only moms can pass it on -rrb- , so it 's only a small snapshot of inherited genes . genetic material in the cell 's nucleus comes from both parents and gives a fuller picture of genetic heritage . to study genetics of our ancient predecessors , researchers have an easier time studying mitochondrial dna because there are hundreds of times more copies of it in each cell .  it 's a much bigger chance to find some fragments of this preserved ,  paabo said . the method that researchers used involves separating the two strands of the dna double helix . they then make a  library  from each of the two strands . if part of one strand is damaged , its analogue on the other strand -- which is made of complementary genetic partners -- may be intact .  that is sort of the big trick involved ,  paabo said . after sequencing the mitochondrial dna , researchers then compared the result with genetic information about neanderthals and denisovans . since nuclear dna encompasses more information about a person 's inheritance , a nuclear genome sequence from homo heidelbergensis may reveal even more clearly how it is connected to other ancient humanlike species , he said . but retrieving the nuclear dna sequence will be challenging , study authors wrote . just to get the mitochondrial dna sequence , it took about two grams of bone -- less than 0.1 ounce -- even though hundreds of copies of this dna are in every cell . still , paabo said , the sequencing technique his group used  opens a possibility to now do this at many other sites , and really begin to understand earlier human evolution .  relationship to other species . researchers thought initially the mitochondrial dna of the homo heidelbergensis specimen would share a common ancestor with neanderthals . neanderthals lived in europe beginning as much as 300,000 years ago , paabo said . -lrb- homo sapiens , our species , first appeared in africa between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago . -rrb- . instead , researchers discovered through the dna that this specimen is closer to the denisovans , a group related to the neanderthals . a likely explanation is that in eastern eurasia this species gave rise to denisovans , and in western eurasia they were the ancestors of neanderthals , paabo said . but more research needs to be done to verify that theory . humans , neanderthals related to yet another group . little is known about the denisovans . although some of their remains were found in southern siberia , their genetic signature is only found today on islands in the pacific . paabo was also the senior author on a 2012 study in the journal science analyzing the denisovan genome . that research suggested that human ancestors and the denisovans ' ancestors must have branched off from one another as much as 700,000 years ago -- although that number is vague . still , it seems that the denisovans must have mated with indigenous people in papua new guinea and australia , paabo said . about 3 % to 5 % of the dna of people from melanesia -lrb- islands in the southwest pacific ocean -rrb- , australia and new guinea as well as aboriginal people from the philippines comes from the denisovans . on the other hand , everyone who lives outside africa today probably has some neanderthal dna in them , paabo said in 2012 . the bottom line , paabo said , is that the relationships between these early human relatives -- homo heidelbergensis , neanderthals and denisovans -- are not clear-cut .  it 's going to be a more complex history that one will eventually clarify with the help of dna ,  he said . elizabeth landau is on twitter at @lizlandau .", "summary": " homo
