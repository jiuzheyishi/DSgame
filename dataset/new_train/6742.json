' lundberg , whose previous wins came in the russian open in 2005 and 2008 , parred the first two holes but then birdied the next four in succession to move into a four-shot lead . the 40-year-old from helsingborg , who failed to record a single top-10 finish last season and had to regain his card for the third successive year at the qualifying school , dropped his first shot of the day after a clumsy chip on the eighth . and although he holed from 30 feet for birdie on the 12th , that proved to be his last one of the day as he missed from three feet on the next . ` the greens were slightly softer at the start of the round , so that made life a little bit easier for us , ' lundberg said . ' i hit a lot of good shots early on and managed to make some putts , so that got my confidence up . personal best : lee slattery 's only other european tour victory came at the 2011 madrid open . swede dreams : mikael lundberg leads the field , despite failing to register a top 10 finish last year . ` it 's a nice feeling when you get your distance control right with your wedges because it takes a lot of pressure off your putting . ` but it got tougher and tougher the longer the round went on because the course got really firm and fast towards the end . so whilst it may look and feel easy , it never is . ` i 've been doing some great work with my new coach , neil jordan , over the last few weeks , and my game is feeling a lot more solid as a result . ` so while i did n't maybe expect to play this well here , it 's not a complete shock to me either . ' paraguay 's fabrizio zanotti is two off the pace on seven under after a 68 , with korea 's sihwan kim six under after also shooting 68 and defending champion joost luiten another stroke back following a flawless 67 . ` i 'm very happy with five under , ' the 28-year-old ryder cup hopeful said . ' i made some nice saves for par and that 's what you have to do around this course . local boy : bernd wiesberger needs a win at his home tournament to qualify for the us open . ` you are going to be out of position sometimes and you have to play smart and try to save par . ' i am right back in there and that was the goal today , to try to make some ground on the leaders . we will see what happens and we have still 36 holes to go . ' home favourite bernd wiesberger , who needs to win to secure his place in the us open next week - second place might also be good enough depending on results elsewhere - is six off the pace after a round of 70 marred by a three-putt bogey on the last . the best recovery of the day had come from australian brett rumford , who played his first four holes in five over par but the remaining 14 in seven under to return a second round of 70 and finish one under par .", "summary": " lee slattery moved to within one shot of the lead at the lyoness open .   english golfer shrugged off shoulder injury caused by a ` soft pilow '   swede mikael lunberg leads the field by one shot after the second round .
