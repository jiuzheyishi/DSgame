{"text": "beijing , china -lrb- cnn -rrb- hu mingming lands spin-kicks and splits with ease , but her hands are shaking too much to tie a bow . she is a student at the famous henan shaolin martial arts school . in recent years , their gravity-defying brand of kung fu has become a staple of the annual televised lunar new year gala .  last year i watched my classmates perform on stage and i felt nervous for them . now it is my turn ,  says hu . she has a right to be nervous . the gala , a variety show broadcast on state television since 1983 , is a cultural phenomenon and a key propaganda tool of the chinese communist party . it 's also a ratings juggernaut . combine the viewers of the oscars , emmys , american idol finales and mtv video music awards -- then throw in the super bowl ratings for good measure -- you are not even close . organizers like to say that more than 90 % of chinese families tune in . last year , it drew more than 700 million viewers .  there is a huge amount of pressure ,  says zhang hu , hu 's coach , who has also performed in the gala .  and each rehearsal is like an inspection .  just days before the real deal and after months of practice , the producers are still cutting segments to fine tune the show to around 36 acts . at saturday 's rehearsal , performers hustled backstage near studio doors manned by security guards in white gloves . chinese opera singers adjusted their elaborate headgear ; 5-year-old acrobats swarmed around movie stars and a group of glamorous dancers posed for selfies . in pictures : lunar new year 2015 . on the sidelines of the mayhem , the acrobats , crooners and pop starlets all had the same mantra for me : this year the gala is going global . they are impressively on message . in recent months , state broadcaster cctv has touted business deals with youtube , google and twitter to reach out to a global audience with coverage of this year 's gala . never mind that all of those websites are blacked out by communist party censors inside of china , provoking widespread ridicule by chinese netizens .  different countries have different internet regulations . it 's not up to us ,  said jing chunhan , a spokesman for cctv , adding that the chinese have plenty of ways to watch inside china . cctv has even rented a video billboard in the heart of new york 's time square to plug the show . some academics see it as an unusually overt push to win hearts and minds amongst the some fifty million chinese in the diaspora .  this aggressive push for chinese soft power is new ,  says tao xie , a professor of international studies at beijing foreign studies university .  the approach in the past used to be cautious and low profile .  for soft power to work , though , the gala needs to stay relevant . when it began more than three decades ago , there was n't much else on offer for entertainment in china . now , even the heavily censored chinese internet is stiff competition . last year , young chinese started a meme online with photos of their relatives sleeping through the gala on the couch . but watching the program is still a force of habit for many chinese . xu baoyu , a college senior at the university of iowa , says she used to watch the show because it was  just there .  on wednesday , she says she will be watching the gala on youtube from her off campus apartment in iowa city .  the spring festival just does n't feel complete without the gala ,  she told cnn by phone .  although i do like to mock the show while my mom is watching in china .  cnn 's serena dong and shen lu contributed to this report .", "summary": " china wants its annual lunar new year gala to go global .   it has made deals with youtube , facebook , twitter and google .   gala organizers say 700 million viewers tuned into the show last year .
