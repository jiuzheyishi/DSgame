{"text": "news alert : some things you read on the internet are not true . as obvious as that may seem , and as savvy as you 'd think we 'd be a decade after deposed nigerian princes began e-mailing us with the promise of vast riches , 2013 has turned out to be the year of the online hoax . and , guess what ? most of us seemed to love every minute of it . in just the past week or so , the web has been duped by the viral rise of a snarky thanksgiving day airplane spat , a not-so-poor poverty blogger and a twitter feud between a comedian and a salsa company . and it 's no accident . media experts say there are multiple factors at work when these sweet little lies rocket across the web in what feels like mere minutes . first , the obvious . to be too good to be true , a story has to be good .  sometimes , with these stories , we all want them to be true ,  said brian stelter , cnn 's senior media correspondent and host of  reliable sources ,  on cnn 's  newsroom  tuesday .  and we forget , maybe , the first rule -- trust , but verify . check it out first .  so , when a pastor claims to teach his congregation a lesson by disguising himself as a homeless man , or a pistol-packing granny unloads on young punks playing  the knockout game ,  some of us are so enamored of what the tale says about our world that we miss the warning signs . but there 's more to it than that . fun little internet stories , it turns out , have become big business .  there really is a virality industry , with websites that are in the business of finding these things and blowing them up with slide shows and stories ,  stelter told cnn 's brooke baldwin . he named buzzfeed , huffington post and upworthy as just a few of the many sites that thrive , at least in part , on that model . many news sites seek to verify viral content before publishing it , although some of us occasionally get burned . in september cnn and other sites published a video of a girl appearing to catch on fire during a twerking mishap before the clip was revealed as a prank by jimmy kimmel 's talk show . there 's obviously an appetite for these sorts of viral stories . so finding them , pulling them together quickly and relaunching them on social media within minutes equals page views . and online , page views make advertisers happy . and advertisers mean money .  there 's a million-clicks reward for being the first to pick up on it ,  wrote time 's james poniewozik , referring to elan gale 's live-tweeting of his thanksgiving day airplane  feud .   and hundreds of follow-up , aggregations , commentaries and counter-commentaries get posted before anyone gets around to seeing if the flight data added up .  here are just some of the fake viral tales that have swept the web so far this year . we 're willing to bet they wo n't be the last . manti te'o 's  girlfriend  this one 's almost a year old and still kind of confusing . as his notre dame fighting irish were playing their way into the bcs national championship game , all-american linebacker manti te'o broke hearts when he told reporters his girlfriend , a 22-year-old stanford university student , had died of leukemia within hours of his grandmother 's death .  i miss 'em , but i know that i 'll see them again one day ,  he told espn after leading the irish to an improbable 20-3 victory over michigan state . except , the girlfriend never existed . te'o would later say he 'd never met lennay kekua in person , that their relationship had formed online and that he was the victim of what he called a  sick joke  and what notre dame dubbed  an elaborate hoax .  the homophobic non-tip . it had all the right ingredients to stir up web outrage . it was n't enough for customers to refuse to tip waitress dayna morales , a 22-year-old marine corps veteran , who describes herself as  out , open and proud .  someone in the family of four also had to leave a note saying  i 'm sorry but i can not tip because i do not agree with ... your lifestyle and how you live your life .  that 's the story morales told media outlets , including cnn , last month , and the web responded in kind . more than $ 2,000 flowed in to a paypal account set up by her employer , gallop asian bistro in bridgewater , new jersey . she said she 'd donate the gifts to the wounded warrior project and the restaurant planned to match the donations , giving to a local gay-and-lesbian support group . but then , a local television station displayed a receipt from a family showing an $ 18 tip on a bill of $ 93.55 -- the same amount on the one morales had originally shared on the facebook have a gay day group , and a credit card statement with the same total value , $ 111.55 , to back it up . this week , morales was suspended at the restaurant , while it completes an investigation of exactly what happened . the poverty blogger . give linda walther tirado this : she can write .  you have to understand that we know that we will never not feel tired ,  she wrote in one of many heartbreaking blog posts about living in poverty that were picked up by the huffington post and others .  we will never feel hopeful . we will never get a vacation . ever . we know that the very act of being poor guarantees that we will never not be poor . it does n't give us much reason to improve ourselves .  but here 's the problem . she 's apparently not all that poor . a houston press investigation last week revealed that tirado owns her home , has worked as a political consultant , attended a private boarding school and is married to a u.s. marine . but by the time that story was out , tirado had already raised more than $ 61,000 in donations via gofundme . in an update on the gofundme page , tirado wrote ,  you have to understand that the piece you read was taken out of context , that i never meant to say that all of these things were happening to me right now , or that i was still quite so abject . i am not . i am reasonably normally lower working class ...  she says she 'll use the money to collect her writing into a book and maintains that her writing was misinterpreted by readers who thought she was always describing her current living conditions . #rip celebrity-who-is-still-alive . it 's been more than four years since jeff goldblum  died  on twitter . but , in 2013 , the social media platform was still killing off celebrities with regularity . celine dion . tom cruise . cher . chloe moretz . all , to the best of our knowledge , still alive . but all mourned this year on twitter where bad information , whether planted intentionally or accidentally , can spread fast . it 's gotten so bad that when word of actor paul walker 's death in a car crash broke late saturday , many fans remained skeptical even after legitimate news sources were reporting it . diane in 7a . a reality tv producer just made something up . who would have thought ? elan gale , a producer on abc 's  the bachelor ,  captivated twitter with his thanksgiving day story about a fellow passenger who was rude to flight attendants on his flight to phoenix . gale came to the rescue with a cheeky note , a glass of wine and , ultimately , some lowbrow insults . within a day , the web had split into two camps . team elan cheered a champion who delivered instant karma to someone being nasty to hapless service-industry folk . team diane declared gale just as bad , if not worse , for preying upon someone clearly in distress and insulting her in crude language . gale declared both teams losers a couple of days later when he returned to twitter to share a  photo of diane  -- an empty chair . comedian vs. salsa . fresh on the heels of elan vs. diane , comedian kyle kinane over the weekend started poking fun at what looked like an automated twitter feed for pace picante sauce that would  favorite  anything he wrote about the salsa -- no matter how derogatory or crude . what followed was a hilarious and cringe-worthy back-and-forth in which pace employees offered kinane free salsa to stop writing bad things about them , argued amongst themselves and generally made a mess of things . the main problem being that pace picante sauce does n't have a twitter feed , says its owner , the campbell soup co. . kinane says he was himself pranked by other comedians who created the fake account .", "summary":
