{"text": "childrenswear retailer babies ` r ' us is refusing to remove a range of kardashian kids clothing from its stores - despite an intensive campaign from a group of mothers who insist the designs are too ` sexualized ' for their children . kansas-based mother amie logan started an online petition earlier this week asking the retailer to remove the ` damaging ' garments after seeing the new collection , which is designed for baby girls aged zero to 24 months , on shelves and online . but despite the overwhelming amount of support that the petition has received - it currently has more than 2,500 signatures - the retailer revealed to mailonline that it will not be removing any of the offending clothing from any of its stores . leading the charge : kansas mother amie logan started the campaign to remove the inappropriate designs . fashion faux pas : many parents are outraged by the ` sexualized ' nature of the designs . appropriate ? the kardashian kids collection includes this $ 23 pleather mini skirt . a spokesperson for babies ` r ' us said : ` we have no plans to stop selling this collection . ' the news will no doubt come as a blow to amie and her supporters , many of whom have promised to boycott the retailer until they agree to take action . the campaign comes just one week after babies ` r ' us ' sister store toys ` r ' us agreed to stop selling a line of breaking bad action figures , after parents accused the retailer of promoting drug use through the sale of the toys . ' i do n't want my child to grow up to be a sex tape star , ' amie wrote at the top of her petition , which is posted on change.org . ` you pulled the breaking bad toys because they promoted drug use . you should pull this clothing line because it promotes bad behavior as well . ` the madness has to stop . if the toys are damaging so is the clothing . ' the collection , which is an extension of kim , khloe and kourtney 's globally-successful kardashian kollection for adults , includes a $ 25 leatherette mini skirt - with ` attached diaper cover ' - a $ 33 fur faux animal print vest and a $ 23 leatherette skirt . motherly instincts : both kim , 34 , and kourtney , 35 , have young daughters of their own . ` damaging ' : the designs , such as this pair of gold lurex pants , have been deemed completely inappropriate for young children . ` disgusting ' : the collection includes a number of short skirts and tight-fitting lurex trousers . each of the designs , while not necessarily the personal handiwork of kim , 34 , khloe , 30 and kourtney , 35 , have all been given the seal of approval by the sisters which is perhaps all the more disturbing given that kim and kourtney both have young daughters of their own . kourtney welcomed her daughter penelope , her second child with long-term partner scott disick , in july 2012 , while kim and kanye west 's daughter north was born on june 15 last year . at the time of writing , the petition , which is just a few days old , has already been signed more than 2,000 times by eager supporters , many of whom wholeheartedly agree with amie 's thoughts about the offending clothing designs . kardashian controversy : while khloe , kim and kourtney did not design each of the garments themselves , each item of clothing has been given their seal of approval . car crash clothing : while the kardashians ' clothing collections have proved incredibly popular with adults , they seem to have missed the mark with their unsuitable childrenswear designs . ' i would never spend my money on it ' : the petition has now been signed by more than 2,000 people , many of whom have children and grandchildren of their own . monique smith from greensboro , north carolina , wrote : ` babies do n't need to look like porn stars ' while liz thomas from gainesville , florida added : ` breaking bad toys are nowhere near as damaging to a young psyche as sexualization at such a young age . ` these people should be ashamed . ' the campaign has also convinced some people to boycott the store entirely , with one mother commenting on the petition : ` disgusting . i had no clue . i was just looking at starting my baby registry at babies r us last night . i am so glad i saw this first . ` babies are innocent ' : one mother claimed that she will not shop at babies r us until the offending garments are removed . gilded garments : these gold lurex trousers retail for $ 33 . stop the madness : kansas-based mother amie logan is demanding that the kardashian 's ` damaging ' baby clothes be removed from all babies ` r ' us stores . 's **** s and babies just do not go together . babies are innocent , kim is a s *** k , any questions ? ' and it 's not just parents who have taken offence at the inappropriate clothing collection . jenny chavez , a grandmother from chula vista , california , said of the designs : ' i am a grandmother and shop at babys r us . ' i find the kardiashian kids clothing line completely inappropriate and would never spend my money on any kardashian merchandise that promotes their stardom from a sex tape .
