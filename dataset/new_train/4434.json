{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- as further proof that you can now 3d-print anything , a company called natural machines has introduced a 3d printer for food . the  foodini ,  as it 's called , is n't too different from a regular 3d printer , but instead of printing with plastics , it deploys edible ingredients squeezed out of stainless steel capsules :  it 's the same technology ,  says lynette kucsma , co-founder of natural machines ,  but with plastics there 's just one melting point , whereas with food it 's different temperatures , consistencies and textures . also , gravity works a little bit against us , as food does n't hold the shape as well as plastic .  the barcelona-based startup behind the machine says it 's the only one of its kind capable of printing a wide range of dishes , from sweet to savory .  in essence , this is a mini food manufacturing plant shrunk down to the size of an oven ,  kucsma said , pointing out that at least in the initial stage the printer will be targeted mostly at professional kitchen users , with a consumer version to follow , at a projected retail price of around $ 1,000 . in principle , the foodini sounds like the ultimate laziness aid : press a button to print your ravioli . but natural machines is quick to point out that it 's designed to take care only of the difficult and time-consuming parts of food preparation that discourage people from cooking at home , and that it promotes healthy eating by requiring fresh ingredients prepared before printing . nevertheless , the company is working with major food manufacturers to create pre-packaged plastic capsules that can just be loaded into the machine to make food , even though they assure these will be free of preservatives , with a shelf life limited to five days . the printing process is slow , but faster than regular 3d printing . other than being capable of creating complex designs , such as very detailed cake decorations or food arranged in unusual shapes , the foodini can be useful for recipes that require precision and dexterity , like homemade pizza or filled pasta . currently , the device only prints the food , which must be then cooked as usual . but a future model will also cook the preparation and produce it ready to eat . the idea also comes with a social element too .  there 's a touchscreen on the front that connects to a recipe site in the cloud , so it 's an internet-of-things , connected kitchen appliance ,  said kucsma . users will also be able to control the device remotely using a smartphone , and share their recipes with the community . that is , if people do n't balk at the idea of eating printed food .  we have done tests and everybody liked the food ,  explains kucsma .  take the microwave oven , for example : in the 70s , people were a bit fearful about it , they thought food could be poisoned with radiation or something , but fast forward 30 years , and there 's one in every household . this is real food , with real fresh ingredients , it 's just prepared using a new technology .  the company is completing a round of financing and plans to begin mass manufacturing in the second half of 2015 . read more from make . create , innovate : . meet the world 's first 1,000 mph car . digital nose can sniff out cancer . the race is on for flying cars .", "summary": "  foodini  is a machine that uses 3d printing technology to create meals .   it uses normal ingredients that must be loaded into stainless steel capsules .   it is controlled via a touchscreen device that connects to the internet .   it will be available in late 2015 with a price tag of around $ 1,000 .
