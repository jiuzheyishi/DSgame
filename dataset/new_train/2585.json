{"text": "not surprisingly , the munich security conference last weekend saw heated debates on ukraine and its current political crisis . yet while government and opposition representatives faced off with their well-known positions , the real news was an apparent change of minds among western leaders . thus , european union commissioner stefan fule stated that  if we are serious about helping this part of europe to transform , the association agreement is only the first step ,  admitting in effect that only the eu 's  most powerful instrument  , membership , will help in the long-term . eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton added that europe and the u.s. are  developing a plan -- a ukrainian plan  , whose numbers  wo n't be small  , to provide urgently needed short-term funding to ukraine 's battered economy . and u.s secretary of state john kerry stressed that  nowhere is the fight for a democratic , european future more important today than in ukraine  . taken together , the three statements may signal a major shift in western policy vis-a-vis ukraine . this much-needed reset comes after months of inaction by both europe and the u.s. . when back in november , ukrainians rose against their government 's decision to abandon closer ties with the eu , senior european leaders were quick to arrive in kiev to show their solidarity with the protesters . the enthusiastic response that met them at the euromaidan , however , faded quickly when european concerns remained lip-service . the u.s. acted even more half-heartedly when its secretary of state avoided a possible visit to kiev , sending a deputy instead to hand out buns to freezing democrats . western indecision clearly played its role in aggravating the political crisis in ukraine , as it emboldened the government of victor yanukovych while driving protesters to despair . as a result , the former essentially attempted to legalize dictatorial rule and , when this prompted further demonstrations , resorted to violence by riot police . the latter , in turn , have only become more resolved but find it increasingly hard to retain unity , moderation and non-violence . within a few weeks , this has brought ukraine to the brink of civil war , and any further escalation will have unforeseeable consequences not just for ukraine but for the entire region and europe itself . this must have finally dawned on western leaders . immediate truce . however , the measures indicated by fule , ashton and kerry are neither enough nor even the most pressing ones . as a first step , europe and the u.s. must make sure of an end to violence and demand an immediate truce among all conflicting parties . this suspension of open conflict must also involve restraint on part of the kremlin , yanukovych 's main sponsor , who should be reminded that covert operations by russian operatives or threats of a military intervention are as disruptive and unacceptable as moscow 's economic stranglehold on ukraine . secondly , a long-term monitoring mission of the organization for security and cooperation in europe , of which ukraine and russia , all eu countries and the u.s. are members , must be installed swiftly . the mandate of this mission should be the observation of the ceasefire , ongoing euromaidan protests , police actions and possible provocations , enquiries into recent violence , deaths and disappearances , and regular reporting on findings to the international community . thirdly , the west should impress upon all sides involved that only a genuine national dialogue can pave the way for a political solution of the crisis . such a roundtable must include president yanukovych personally and key opposition figures , the leaders of the euromaidan and ukraine 's oligarchs , as well as representatives of churches , civil society , media and the country 's diverse regions . the eu may volunteer a senior leader to facilitate this dialogue . in an accompanying measure , fourthly , the eu and the u.s. should prepare a credible set of sanctions against anyone that hinders the truce , international monitoring , or national dialogue . any obstructions of this process , whether by government representatives , law enforcement officials , oligarchs , provocateurs or radical protesters , need to be systematically recorded and answered with visa bans , asset freezes , embargoes against businesses , and criminal persecution . once these immediate steps have been taken , and hopefully prevented ukraine from further sinking into civic strife , the west must provide ukraine with a long-term perspective of development and assistance . along with commissioner fule 's recognition last weekend , the eu must give ukraine a clear prospect of membership , dependent only on the country 's commitment to democracy , rule of law , and market economy . ` ukrainian plan ' in order for necessary reforms to start and succeed , the eu and the u.s. have to swiftly roll out a  ukrainian plan  , as alluded to by baroness ashton . a comprehensive aid package must combine emergency funding to prevent an impending default of ukraine , compensations for a likely economic retaliation by russia , and assistance for broader market reforms . both these ingredients have long been missing from western offers to ukraine , and it is partly for this reason that the country 's government turned its back on europe . by adding them now , the eu and u.s. would substantially improve their proposal . this should make it much easier for ukraine 's elites and society to agree on a democratic and european future for their country . such a consensus would go a long way towards ending the current conflict . for this , however , ukraine needs the west to act swiftly and decisively
