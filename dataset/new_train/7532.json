' ` it is not my intention to pick a fight with all of those who have put pen to paper on the subject of the life and times of stuart hall . ' victim 1 : susan harrison , formerly melville , who waived her right to anonymity . met hall aged 16 at an awards day in 1967 . he later touched her under her skirt while giving her a lift home from bbc studios . victim 2 : 17-year-old who met hall during early 1970s filming of it 's a knockout . he pushed her against a hotel door and fumbled her until she fought him off . victim 3 : kim parker , formerly wright , who waived her right to anonymity . met hall in blackpool in 1974 when she was 16 or 17 . he touched her breasts as she worked on an exhibition stand . victim 4 : aged 17 when she was pushed against a wall and had her breasts groped by hall while at a family friend 's house . victim 5 : a 13-year-old who met hall at a party at the house of his family friends . she got drunk and he carried her to the bathroom where he assaulted her in a ` frenzied maul ' . victim 6 : was 15 when she met hall as he worked on bbc north west tonight . he kissed her in her home and on a later date approached her with a battery-powered massager which he asked to use on her private parts when she used his dressing room to get changed . victims 7 , 8 and 9 : an 11-year-old , 14-year-old and another girl aged 13 or 14 who attended elocution lessons together at hall 's home . he dressed them in men 's shirts and fondled them as he wore only small white underpants . victim 10 : was aged 10 when her family was given tickets to it 's a knockout . he invited her to swim in his outdoor pool and bought her steak and champagne before fondling her in the bathroom . victims 11 and 12 : girls aged nine and 13 who hall knew through family friends . he indecently assaulted the younger girl as she lay half-asleep in her home . he forced the elder girl to kiss him after suddenly pulling over while taking her home from a tennis centre . victim 13 : was aged 10 or 11 and was offered an elocution lesson by hall at his home . he took her to his bedroom and told her to take her clothes off , where he held a tape measure around her chest as she practised saying sentences . mr aylett said that his client - later jailed for 15 months - had been arrested ` as a consequence ' of the investigation into jimmy savile ` who used young girls on a scale that is simply staggering ' . he referred to the 1,300 complainants in that case and said : ` instead , in the dock today is a frightened and bewildered 83-year-old man answering for the touching - no more , no less - of all of 13 , not 1,300 , victims over a quarter of a century ago . ' he said many years had passed since the last offence and that hall had led an ` unblemished life ' over those years , doing charity work and with the support of his loving family . the barrister said the defendant had pleaded guilty and that there was ` very little evidence ' of sexual arousal on the part of the defendant . ` inevitably some of the victims were . more affected than others . in the main victims appear to have kept their . undoubtedly unpleasant experiences in proportion to the actual abuse . they suffered . ` in many . cases this appears to have manifested itself in them being revolted ' referring . to the victims who were assaulted during hall 's ` elocution lessons ' mr . aylett said they had expressed a ` degree of ambivalence in regard to . what happened to them ' . he . said one victim told police the assault was ` not a serious indecent . assault ' and she was thankful that nothing worse happened . mr aylett said many of the victims had . the similar ` refrain ' in that they told police they had come forward . out of concern that the defendant may do the same to others , or . something more serious than what happened to them . the . barrister also said that many of the victims had told their parents . about the abuse at the time but that they had taken no action . he said with the exception of two of . the complainants , all the victims who were under 16 had told an adult . and none of them had contacted police or sought to take it up with the . defendant . mr aylett said he was not criticising ` any of those adults ' or saying that ` standards were different in the 70s ' . but . he said it did ` reflect on the minor nature of the abuse ' - with the . one exception of the 13-year-old girl hall attacked in a bathroom , which . he conceded was a more serious assault . mr . aylett said that even at the ` height of his fame ' hall took the time to . write to fans , many of them ` elderly and lonely ' and that hall still . had the ` love and support of his family . ' the . barrister rubbished claims in a newspaper that hall had spent years . ` laughing in the faces of his victims ' and said that it was hall 's . ` celebrity ' which had brought him to the attention of the police . he said ` but for his celebrity ' the offences ` would never have seen the light of day .

' ' the judge called these remarks ` disgraceful ' . mr aylett said the nature of fame had changed over the years and that in the 60s and 70s it was a ` different world ' . he said hall was 83 and would find prison very hard , adding : ` one can only begin to imagine the defendant 's fear as the cell door slams shut on that first night . ' the nspcc posted the following statement on its official twitter site : ` we 'd like to clarify that the nspcc did not supply a character reference for stuart hall . ` the views were of a volunteer speaking in a personal capacity and do not in any way reflect the views of the nspcc .
