{"text": "watching blue peter after school was a rite of passage for generations of children who dreamed of being awarded one of the show 's iconic badges . but now the days of learning to make toys and games using ` sticky-back plastic ' and toilet rolls appear to be on the way out . the numbers watching the show have fallen by two-thirds since it was relegated from bbc1 to the corporation 's ' dedicated children 's channel cbbc last year . hugely popular : john noakes , valerie singleton and peter purves in the early 1970s . losing its appeal : the show 's current presenters helen skelton and barney harwood . blue peter , which was once watched by eight million and celebrates 50 years of handing out its iconic badge today , now attracts an average audience of just 100,000 viewers . this compares to more than 340,000 who tuned in for each episode in 2012 when it was still being shown on the bbc 's main channel . the decision to drop the much-loved show from bbc1 sparked controversy at the time . filming had already moved from television centre , the london home of blue peter 's famous garden , to salford , and critics claimed the show was being watered-down . last year the programme , which first aired in 1958 , was also cut to just one show per week hosted by two presenters . it has previously had four presenters and was broadcast three times a week . last night , valerie singleton , 76 , who presented the show for a decade from 1962 , told the mail on sunday : ` i have n't understood many of the decisions the bbc has made in the past few years -- including the move to salford . ` it is sad but all good things come to an end eventually and maybe it 's finally time to say that blue peter has had its day . mainstay : former presenter valerie singleton , centre , suggested it may be time for blue peter to end . ` everyone has such fond memories of the show but i just think kids have got so many other things to distract them these days . ' peter duncan , 59 , who was a blue peter presenter for five years over two spells in the 1980s , added : ` blue peter was the first programme that had this wonderful idea of interaction -- it was n't about phoning a telephone line to give a quid to simon cowell . the show was interacting with children with its appeals . ' the bbc sparked controversy in december 2011 when it announced that blue peter , now presented by barney harwood and helen skelton , would be aired first on cbbc and then repeated on bbc1 a day later . the corporation risked further fury by stopping screening repeats on bbc1 altogether last year . last night a bbc spokeswoman said that only 57,000 children aged six to 12 watched the show when it was aired on bbc1 , but now it is screened on cbbc more children in that age group watch it . she said : ` far from being in decline , blue peter is growing in popularity with children and we 're delighted by its success . ` and children are finding even more ways to interact with the show -- 80,000 visit the website each week and we receive about 2,000 letters and emails every week .
