{"text": "if you 're confused about whether the iran deal is an awe-inspiring breakthrough or a cataclysmic disaster , let me help you : the answer is it depends . it depends on what happens in the coming six months . and not just six months from now , but what happens between now and then : a period during which iran and the world powers are supposed to abide by the deal they made in geneva last weekend and work to hammer out a permanent agreement . if the geneva deal in its current form becomes permanent because the two sides ca n't get to a final resolution and drag out its current terms -lrb- the six-month period is  renewable by mutual consent ,  says the so-called joint plan of action -rrb- , then what occurred this weekend will mark a calamitous turning point , triggering a chain of events that brings about the very developments that obama -- and most of the world -- want to avoid . if the accord indeed proves to be temporary , as president obama maintains it is , to be followed by a much more stringent agreement that brings a verifiable and credible end to iran 's pursuit of a nuclear weapons ' capability , then we can rightly call it a historic turning point , a milestone to progress . then , obama and his secretary of state will deserve enormous credit for their achievement . for now , however , hold off on the awards . the deal has some positive points , but it also has many deeply troubling elements . remember : tehran has a track record of dragging out negotiations ; negotiations started more than a decade ago . and if the six months start to slip , an arms race in the middle east is sure to start . the arab countries of the persian gulf , including saudi arabia and the united arab emirates , fear a nuclear iran even more than israel does . arabs and persians are historic rivals , even enemies . iran 's revolutionary regime has a stated purpose of spreading revolution , in direct opposition to the stability and survival of the ruling gulf regimes . the gulf states will not sit idly by while iran continues enriching uranium , especially after the world has repeatedly discovered iran operating secret nuclear facilities in the past . once saudi arabia and iran engage in a nuclear arms race , others will jump in . qatar has a rivalry with saudi arabia ; egypt looks askance at qatar , and turkey will not want to be left behind . the entire region will be swept up in a feverish pursuit of nuclear technology . if you think adding a nuclear arms race to the extremist ideological maelstrom of the middle east is like adding fuel to flames , you are wrong : it is like adding dynamite to a raging fire . many people incorrectly describe the joint plan as a freeze on iran 's nuclear program . but it is not . the deal reverses some parts of the program , it freezes others , but it allows progress to continue in two areas . the three most significant achievements of the interim deal are the dismantling of the stockpile of 20 % enriched uranium , the stoppage of work in the arak heavy water reactor that could produce plutonium -- another path to nuclear weapons -- and the introduction of more intrusive monitors by u.n. nuclear inspectors . but the accord does not open up the parchin facility , where u.n. monitors have already said they suspect iran is testing ways to weaponize nuclear materials . and the deal , most significantly , allows iran to continue enriching uranium up to 5 % purity . iran maintains this will become permanent . washington has given mixed signals on the issue . that is one of the two massive concessions made by the major powers . the u.n. security council had demanded that iran stop enriching uranium . now the united states and the other five countries have implicitly allowed enrichment to continue in violation of u.n. resolutions . in addition , they have started a rollback of the painstakingly built sanctions ' regime . the final comprehensive agreement with iran will come only if iran truly has decided to give up on what most of the world believes was a goal of either developing nuclear weapons or getting close enough that it is able to do it in quick order , what is known as  breakout capability .  iran 's new president . hassan rouhani , most certainly has presented a much more conciliatory face to the west . but the real power rests with the supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , whose rhetoric remains caustic . just last week , as talks got started in geneva , khamenei lashed out at the united states and said israel is  doomed to annihilation .  is iran now ready to give up what most countries believe is a nuclear weapons program after decades of investment and after enduring enormous hardship to build it ? if so , a deal can certainly be reached . has iran perhaps reached a more limited objective , with significant but not complete progress ? in that case , it will likely try to bring an end to sanctions while holding on to much of the progress . if that is the case , negotiations will prove enormously difficult , even impossible . or , will iran try to cheat ? whatever the answer , it is imperative that the united states be prepared to call out iran if it finds any violations to the agreement . otherwise , obama and the united states risk becoming apologists for the islamic republic . diplomacy requires negotiating with foes , and this is no exception . the iranian regime is a serial violator of its own people 's rights . it is a state sponsor of terrorism , and it is the principal sponsor of extremist militias , such as hezbollah , and the brutal regime of syria 's bashar al-assad . if the united states can prevent iran 's dangerous regime from achieving nuclear weapons capability -- and not just in the short term ; if it can prevent an arms race in the region , and it can do so without military action , then the geneva deal will have proved a triumph . we will find out over the course of the next six months . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of frida ghitis .", "summary": " frida ghitis : whether iran deal a breakthrough or disaster depends on next 6 months .   she says if deal is extended beyond then , it will trigger chain of events obama wo n't want .   she says arab persian gulf nations threatened by prospect of iran nukes .   ghitis : if u.s. can bring deal to a final resolution , it can forestall regional arms race .
