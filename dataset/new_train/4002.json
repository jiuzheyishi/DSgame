{"text": "south africa may be the dominant force in africa 's wine economy , but as the continent 's middle class emerges and disposable incomes increase , entrepreneurs in some unlikely destinations are making inroads in the fine wine industry . as the world 's eighth largest wine producer , south africa 's wine trade contributed 26.2 billion rand -lrb- $ 2.4 billion -rrb- to the country 's economy with exports increasing by more than a quarter in 2013 , according to the south african wine industry information and systems . matome mbatha , market manager at wines of south africa , said that wine is becoming increasingly popular on the continent but the industry is still in its infancy outside south africa . he added :  the process of production and sustainability of wine in african nations , other than south africa , still has a long way to go in order to be competitive in the global market . we are still to see another african country produce wine at the level and quality of south africa .  by opening vineyards and chateaus across the continent , some of africa 's lesser known winemakers are hoping to challenge that assertion and south africa 's 350-year dominance of the region 's wine business . from fruity chenin blancs to rich-berry cabernet sauvignons , cnn takes a look at the next generation of  new world  wines from some of africa 's lesser-known producers . charlevale -lrb- zimbabwe -rrb- . nestled in a plush zimbabwean valley on the nyamasanga river , the bushman rock estate is one of the country 's most prominent vineyards , producing a range of fine wines . the charlevale is the winery 's flagship tipple . a dry , oaked white wine blend of semillon , sauvignon blanc and muscat , the charlevale has hints of fresh gooseberry and an acidic , lemony finish . bushman rock manager jonathan passaportis said a combination of high-altitude vineyards , hot summers and cool nights make land-locked zimbabwe an ideal location for wine growing . he added :  whilst great wines are being made from zimbabwean vineyards , some of which have received awards in international competitions , there is still room for growth in both quality and quantity .  passaportis said that zimbabwean wines are gaining recognition on the international stage as tourists visit the country 's vineyards .  our wines have more in common with traditional european wines and yet , as is the way with our wonderful continent , the old world grape varieties have been altered by our conditions , resulting in a truly zimbabwean wine .  visitors to the bushman rock chateaux can take away a case of charlevale and stellagalen , a classic red bordeaux , for $ 25 . leleshwa sauvignon blanc -lrb- kenya -rrb- . a light and tropical blend with a summery aroma , the leleshwa sauvignon blanc is the rift valley winery 's flagship vintage . the wine is produced high up in kenya 's rift valley , thousands of meters above sea level , and is owned by the kenya nut company . emma nderitu , a spokesman for the winery , said : leleshwa is  unique in the sense that it is thought impossible to grow vines in this region . more than that it is thought that it ca n't be a good quality wine .  with a growing consumer base and plans to expand around africa , the rift valley winery , which sits on the equator , is proving that good quality wine can be produced in extreme climates , according to nderitu . but she added that the winery does not have enough volume to export to european and u.s. markets yet :  we are currently intensively expanding our vineyards to cover 250 hectares ... we have received requests to export here but we are still at our expansion phase .  a leleshwa sauvignon blanc retails in local supermarkets for about $ 6 and the brand 's red wine for $ 7 . dodoma wine -lrb- tanzania -rrb- . tanazania 's dodoma region produces three wines -- dry white , red and  natural sweet .  khadija madawili , technical manager at sabmiller tanzania , said the red wine has a smooth , rounded taste and is best with  nyama choma ,  a local delicacy of roasted spiced meat , while the  natural sweet  wine is the perfect complement for light salads or simply enjoyed as an aperitif . the dodoma region is home to a number of varieties including chenin blanc , shiraz , cabernet sauvignon and makutupora , a local dry red . madawili added that the dry earth and sandy soil , combined with low humidity , is perfect for producing dry white and red wines in dodoma . she said :  we have two harvests seasons a year , in march and august/september . after harvest the farmers leave the plants to rest for only one month .  ifrikia rouge reserve -lrb- tunisia -rrb- . with a deep maroon color and sweet aroma similar to port , ifrikia rouge reserve is a cabernet blend with a smooth flavor and a rich tangy aftertaste with hints of raspberry . ifrikia rouge reserve , made by domaine atlas in tunisia , is produced in the foothills of the atlas mountains , a series of peaks that run through northwest africa . just 10 kilometers from the sea , the vineyards are located in the middle of cap bon , a peninsula in the northeast of the country , which boasts a mediterranean climate with wine-growing conditions similar to parts of spain and italy . and at $ 7 dollars a bottle , ifrikia competes on cost with many of its european counterparts . tej -lrb- ethiopia -rrb- . for something very different , but very traditional , tej is an east african honey wine , primarily consumed in ethiopia . the white wine , which can be either sweet or dry depending on the amount of honey used , also includes gesho , which is a buckthorn shrub native to the horn of africa nation . harry kloman , an expert on tej and ethiopian cuisine , said that there are very few , if any , wineries that produce tej as the wine tends to be homemade or served in a  tej bet ,  a bar that specializes in the wine . araya selassie yibrehu is one of the producers to have mastered the art of tej brewing over the years . he said :  unlike other wines my tej and tej-based wines are all ` happy drinks ' that have a delicate taste and are thirst quenching . it 's a great stimulating aperitif and complement to most dishes or desserts .  yibrehu added that sales of tej wine are increasing internationally as social media and international wine competitions raise awareness of alternative african wines . he said :  it has also taken tremendous effort to bring these ethnic , but ancient wines to the 21st century recognition ... obviously , my goal is to keep producing these delicious tej wines .  tej costs between five to 15 ethiopian birr -lrb- 26 cents to 78 cents -rrb- locally .", "summary": " south africa is continent 's biggest wine producer , but other countries also make wine .   tanzania , ethiopia , zimbabwe all hoping to compete with south africa .   kenya 's rift valley has a unique climate for its vineyards .   non-south african wines still have a way to go , says one expert .
