{"text": "it may seem hard to believe that such an unusual looking animal has remained hidden for so long . but scientists have only just discovered a new species of elephant shrew -- or round-eared sengi - in the remote deserts of south western africa . while it is the smallest known member of the 19 sengis in the order macroscelidea , the small creature is in fact genetically more closely related to an elephant than a true shrew . cute : scientists have discovered a new species of elephant shrew - or round-eared sengi -lrb- pictured -rrb- - in the remote deserts of south western africa . the etendeka round-eared sengi , or macroscelides micus , was found in a remote part of the namid desert in south western africa . it is the smallest of all elephant shrews or sengis . the animal is the third new species of sengi to be discovered in a decade . it has rust-coloured fur , a large , hairless gland on the underside of its tail and lacks dark skin pigment . genetic analysis showed important differences between this specimen and close relatives . sengis are restricted to africa and despite their small size , are more closely related to elephants , manatees -lrb- known as sea cows -rrb- and aardvarks than they are to true shrews . the etendeka round-eared sengi , or macroscelides micus , was discovered by scientists from the california academy of sciences . it is the third new species of elephant shrew to be found in the wild in the past decade . the diminutive animal is smaller than other sengi and has rust-coloured fur , a large , hairless gland on the underside of its tail and lacks dark skin pigment , according to the study published in the journal of mammalogy . its unusual appearance attracted the attention of experts jack dumbacher and galen rathbun , who noted it looked different from any museum specimens they had encountered . elusive : the etendeka round-eared sengi , or macroscelides micus -lrb- pictured -rrb- was discovered by scientists from the california academy of sciences . it is the third new species of sengi to be found in the wild in the past decade . mapped : found in a remote area of namibia , on the inland edge of the namib desert -lrb- mapped -rrb- at the base of the etendeka plateau , scientists believe this new species went undescribed for so long because of the challenges of doing scientific research in such an isolated area . genetic analysis showed important differences between this specimen and close relatives . together with experts from the national museum of namibia and the republic of namibia ministry of environment and tourism , they scoured museums for similar animals and conducted more genetic tests , before confirming that they had found a new species . ` the differences between this and all other known species are very subtle , ' said dr dumbacher . ` genetically , macroscelides micus is very different from other members of the genus and it 's exciting to think that there are still areas of the world where even the mammal fauna is unknown and waiting to be explored . ' elephant shrews are restricted to africa and despite their small size , are more closely related to elephants , manatees -lrb- known as sea cows -rrb- and aardvarks than they are to true shrews . nimble : the diminutive animal is smaller than other sengi and has rust-coloured fur , a large , hairless gland on the underside of its tail and lacks dark skin pigment . found in a remote area of namibia , on the inland edge of the namib desert at the base of the etendeka plateau , scientists believe this new species went undescribed for so long because of the challenges of doing scientific research in such an isolated area . yet it is precisely this isolation and the unique environmental conditions in the region that have given rise to this and other endemic animals . ` with only about a dozen new species of mammal discovered in the wild each year , it is amazing that the academy has been involved in describing three new sengis in the last decade , ' said dr rathbun research associate . ` there are new and exciting insights into biodiversity awaiting discovery , even in a group as familiar as mammals . '", "summary": " scientists from the california academy of sciences discovered macroscelides micus in the remote deserts of namibia , south western africa .   it 's the third new species of sengi - or elephant shrew - to be found in the wild in the past decade .   creature has rust-coloured fur and is smaller than other elephant shrews .   scientists compared it to other elephant shrews and analysed its genetics to confirm it is a completely new species .
