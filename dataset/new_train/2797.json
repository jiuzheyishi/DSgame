{"text": "new york in the midst of wall street 's agonizing slide last week , there was at least one place in manhattan where the liquor was flowing , the cigar smoke was billowing and the theme of the evening was simple : work hard . play hard .  i was a crook ,  says jordan belfort , once a wall street fat cat who made $ 1 million a week before going to jail .  it 's like fiddling . nero fiddled while rome burned ,  said thomas graf , vice president and producer of northmarq capital .  we 're smoking cigars while we 're losing our shirts , literally .  he was among hundreds of mid-level wall street executives and traders gathered for a party thrown by cigar report magazine , published by new york-based doubledown media . and if they seemed a little tone-deaf about how this kind of event could be perceived as millions of dollars were lost , at least on paper , most did not seem especially concerned .  it is a great time ,  said adam marsh of empire capital partners .  i think for at least a couple of hours in the evening , we can kind of sit back , have a few drinks , forget what 's facing us on the street tomorrow .  few of the men and women at the party earned millions in wall street bonuses on top of their salaries . but nearly all did very well , they say , at the top of the wall street bubble . and their bosses , along with those who managed wall street hedge funds , did even better .  these guys were spending more than $ 250 billion a year ,  robert frank said .  they bought mansions in greenwich and palm beach . they bought art for $ 100 million a painting .  frank , author of  richistan ,  says the enormous amounts of money earned by wall street elite made them practically a nation unto themselves .  they just looked at the guy with the bigger house , the nicer ferrari , the better artwork ,  he said .  and it was all competitive spending .  one prominent example is the ceo of lehman brothers , richard fuld . in 2007 alone , according to the executive compensation firm equilar , he earned total take-home compensation of more than $ 45 million in salary and bonuses . congressional researchers said he earned nearly $ 500 million from 2000 through 2007 . fuld told congress that the failure of his company centered on inaction on the part of government and a loss of confidence in the financial markets .  this is a pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life , regardless of what comes out of this committee , regardless of when the record books get written ,  fuld told congress during a recent hearing . not every wall street executive played by the books . jordan belfort was once chairman of a brokerage firm called stratton oakmont . in the early to mid - '90s , he called himself the wolf of wall street . he was jailed on federal charges of securities fraud and money laundering . he spent 22 months behind bars and was released in 2005 .  i was a crook ,  belfort said . at one time , he says , he was earning more than $ 1 million a week . now , he has been ordered to pay back $ 110 million to his victims , and he said he is working on that . even the man who first chronicled wall street excess to a national audience can barely believe what has happened . oliver stone , who wrote and directed the film  wall street  21 years ago , says the main character in his story , unprincipled stockbroker gordon gekko , has been overtaken by reality .  i never thought it would go to this level ,  stone told cnn 's larry king .  i thought the gordon gekkos of the world would die out . but they got worse .  so what exactly did the new gordon gekkos do to earn those fabulous sums ?  what they really did was to figure out new and clever ways of investing ,  frank said .  of creating financial products that very few of us could understand .   on wall street , there 's no cost . the only cost is the employees , the executives ,  said andy serwer , managing editor of fortune magazine .  so if a firm is creating a financial product that it can sell for $ 5 million , the person who sells it will get $ 2 million .  but people who earned relatively little on wall street are now paying the price as well . win hornig , a 25-year-old minnesotan who worked at both bear stearns and j.p. morgan , is now out of a job . he 's launched a web site called bankergonebroke.com to talk about it .  my life was basically a disaster ,  hornig said .  i was working all the time , did n't have a lot to show for it . i came to the conclusion that there was more to life than money .  while it lasted , the good times on wall street made money for traders and , of course , for americans who had invested in the stock market , mainly through their 401 -lrb- k -rrb- contributions . but there is a  new normal  these days .  the party is over on wall street -- until it comes back again ,  serwer said .  i 've been around long enough to see that we have these cycles . these guys get their cigars and champagne . they have a great time . the whole thing blows up . but then they re-emerge years later . this one is a really , really bad one . but i do n't think wall street is dead .
