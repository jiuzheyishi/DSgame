{"text": "to resolve america 's ongoing , bruising battle over the debt and deficit , house republican paul ryan and senate democrat patty murray announced a deal on december 10 to halt spending cuts -- mostly in defense -- and lock in a two-year budget agreement to avoid another government shutdown on january 15 . but in eagerly seeking agreement with the republicans who shut the government down in october , democrats risk hurting the economy 's fragile recovery by accepting too much budget austerity embedded in the newly adopted budget . president obama and the democrats won big over the republicans in october 's budget fight . instead of pressing their advantage , democrats took tax increases for the rich off the table , agreed to cut federal pensions and did not get unemployment benefits extended . the democrats basically threw away their political gains . the deal repeals less than half of the sequestration cuts planned for 2014 . if obama and congress continue their shortsighted obsession with austerity and budget cuts , they ignore the big economic lesson from the past several years : austerity hurts prosperity . the congressional budget office estimated that repealing the entire 2013-2014 spending cuts would increase gross domestic product by $ 113 billion and create 900,000 additional jobs next year . the october 2013 government shutdown took another $ 24 billion out of the gdp . unemployment remains stuck around 7 % . though the deal reduces a bit of fiscal uncertainty , it hardly affected the u.s. growth forecasts for big banks , despite bank economists citing some pessimism because of  austerity shock  from spending cuts and  uncertainty shock  from washington 's continued fiscal battles . republicans bargain for more cuts and fewer taxes , but cutting military spending makes them nervous , so they attack social security and medicare . the wall street-affiliated democratic group third way is helping . it launched an attack on sen. elizabeth warren , d-massachusetts , and others who rightly refuse to cut social security as part of a long-term budget solution . we all know that republicans like to defend the wealthy and slash government . but why does austerity , especially cuts to old-age programs , have credibility with obama and other democrats ? advocates of  grand bargains ,  cutting programs to balance the budget , wrongly presume the budget is a fixed quantity . they imagine it like a fixed pie . programs for the young , like education , must be paid for by cutting other programs , like social security . but their belief that a dollar taken from the old will be spent on the young is not only divisive , mean and fierce -- it is wrong . in his december 6 speech on inequality , obama talked about the sky-high and stubborn child poverty rate : more than 24 % . but cutting social security and medicare will only destabilize the economy and increase the elderly poverty rate . in many countries , programs for elderly people are not traded off against help for the young . when support for old-age programs increases , so does spending on children . advanced democratic countries ' spending on the elderly is positively correlated with education spending . one analysis shows that a 10 % increase in spending on education is correlated with a 7.3 % increase in spending on pensions . the congressional budget office warns that long-term deficits can hurt the economy . want to reduce the debt and deficit ? tax the wealthy , which wo n't hurt the economy . economists emmanuel saez and thomas piketty estimate that raising the tax rate for the top 1 % as high as 80 % would generate far more revenue . sen. tom harkin , d-iowa , and rep. peter defazio , d-oregon , propose a transactions tax -- a three-penny charge on every $ 100 traded in the stock market , which the congressional budget office estimates would raise $ 352 billion over 10 years . this small tax would also reduce stock churning by speculators , creating a nice secondary benefit . want to find even more savings ? sen. harry reid , d-nevada , wisely put tax loopholes that cost the treasury almost a trillion dollars per year on the table . for example , reid called for eliminating the small , but noxious , tax break for buying yachts and the $ 17 billion break that comes from taxing private equity , real estate and hedge fund profits as  carried interest  rather than at the ordinary income rate of 39.6 % instead of the capital gains rate of 20 % . there is one piece of good news : the deficit is coming down , from 9.2 % when obama took office to 4.1 % of gdp in 2017 . faster economic growth would shrink the deficit more rapidly . in contrast , further spending cuts will slow the economy and deficit reduction along with it . so , this is no time for obama to accept a lower budget path , or to consider cuts in social security and medicare . the small budget deficit reductions in this deal -- less than one-half of 1 % of the total debt or $ 23 billion -- would almost pay for extended unemployment benefits for one year at $ 25 billion . democrats are flinching under continued pressure from republicans playing out their long game as they ready for another bitter fight when the debt limit is reached next spring . but the president and the democrats have a winning economic and political strategy : raise revenues and keep social security and medicare strong . do n't throw october 's hard-won victory away ; it wo n't help the elderly , it wo n't help children , and it wo n't help the economy . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of rick mcgahey and teresa ghilarducci .", "summary": " democrats and republicans reach a deal on the budget .   rick mcgahey , teresa ghilarducci : austerity in budget will hurt our economy .   they say president obama should not make cuts to programs like social security .   mcgahey , ghilarducci : taxing the wealthy would generate revenue and cut deficit .
