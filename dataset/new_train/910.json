' peeples said it . was at that time that she started to dislike her friend 's new boyfriend . the couple would break up and then get back together - and walters . became increasingly violent , she said . ` he . would do crazy things like park her car in the middle of a four lane in . traffic with her in the passenger seat , take the keys out and run with . her sitting there in the car , ' peeples recounted . then , . during an argument outside brittney 's home in october 2009 , he hit her . and left her with bruises . she called the police and robbie spent a few . days behind bars . three weeks later , after she had started playing with a girls ' football team , walters said he wanted to see her again , and she relented . secrets : brittney found out that walters was married - but he said it was a marriage of convenience . evil : but when they returned to the u.s. , he became violent and hit her , and they repeatedly broke up . he joined her at a photo shoot for her football team , where the girls stripped naked but used each other 's body parts to maintain their modesty for the camera . investigators believe seeing brittney . remove her top with other people in the room pushed walters over the . edge - and led to him killing her just hours later . drunk , they left the photo shoot after midnight - but an hour later , the car slammed into a parked vehicle on a dead-end street , alerting neighbours to call authorities . brittney was killed in the crash . detective troy bisgard told 48 hours that walters ' story that they had been falling asleep initially made sense , but something did n't look right - so they called in a homicide team . ` they 're the ones telling me ,  look , it was a car accident but it was n't so significant that she should be dead from it  , ' bisgard said . a medical examiner found brittney had alcohol in her body , but only just over the legal limit . there were no drugs in her system . crash : a scene picture shows the wreckage after the crash on a dead-end road in november 2009 . scene : brittney 's head hit the windshield - but investigators said she would not have died from the impact . walters ' wife later revealed she had recorded him admitting to strangling brittney in the car . they also found that she did n't hit . windshield that hard and had been left with no significant injuries of . her organs , neck , spinal cord or brain . yet , . strangely , she did have bruising around her temple and upper right . cheek . in further signs that she could have been strangled , there were . hemorrhages on her skin and around her eyes . but . medical examiners came against an odd problem when trying to find if . she had been strangled ; because of her anatomy , she was missing a piece . of cartilage in her throat that is usually crushed if someone is . strangled . so the manner of death was ruled as ` undetermined ' . detectives were dedicated to finding out the truth about her death . despite his earlier protestations that his marriage to his wife , elena , was nothing , walters returned to her in california . when detective bisgard heard he had had a big fight with her , he gave her a call . interrogation : walters told detectives he did not kill her but evidence , such as bruising on brittney 's face and blood inside the vehicle that splattered before the crash , were against him . with barely a prompt , elena told him walters had confessed to punching and strangling brittney and covering it up with the accident . as he confessed , elena had pressed ` record ' on her mobile phone . ' i look over at her and just took a shot in the dark where her head would be and bam ! ' he says on the recording . ' i punched the girl with all my might . she felt like a f *** ing house dropped on her . ' he added that he held down his forearm against her neck to kill her . walters was arrested but said he had not been telling the truth in the recording . he insisted his wife had started the conversation and he ` just agreed with her to get the conversation to end ' . in august 2011 , the case went to court , where prosecutors said brittney had been driving , they swapped seats and he began punching her , before moving her back into the driver 's seat for the accident . they presented other evidence , including how 911 callers had seen the car erratically braking on the highway , suggesting times he had been hitting her . killer : speaking from prison , walters told 48 hours that he believes his wife was bitter for his affair and was out to get him . missed : brittney 's father barry said the conviction was no reason to celebrate - as he is still without his daughter . there was also blood in the car that had not splattered as she hit the windshield . he was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life without parole - and her family said they felt ` instant relief ' . but mr brashers added : ` you know , you do n't wan na say , ` yeah ! ' and cheer because it does n't really change anything . i mean , my daughter 's not gon na come back . ' walters said he will appeal the conviction as his wife recorded him without her knowledge , which is illegal in their home state of california . he added that she schemed against him out of revenge . ` she thought we were gon na be together , ' he told 48 hours .
