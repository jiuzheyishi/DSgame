{"text": "britain is attempting to opt out of a european initiative allowing people to easily remove their details from online service providers such as facebook . the controversial move has caused uproar among privacy campaigners , who today accused the government of blocking an ` essential move ' the rule , known as the ` right to be forgotten ' has been developed by the eu justice commissioners in the face of growing complaints about the way facebook and other social media giants retain information . the british government is locked in a battle with viviane reding , european information society and media commissioner , over the rules governing how social networks delete data . introducing the plans , viviane reding , the eu justice commissioner , said they are : ' a comprehensive set of existing and new rules to better cope with privacy risks online . ` when modernising the legislation , i want to explicitly clarify that people shall have the right -- and not only the ` possibility ' -- to withdraw their consent to data processing . ` the burden of proof should be on data controllers -- those who process your personal data . ` they must prove that they need to keep the data rather than individuals having to prove that collecting their data is not necessary . ' in its . current form , which is not finalised , article 17 of the data protection regulation provides for punitive fines -- up to 2 % of global turnover -- . for companies that refuse to comply with requests to erase customers ' personal details . nick pickles , director of privacy and civil liberties group big brother watch , said : ` the right to be forgotten is a political sound bite that got out of control , but the idea behind it is an essential move . ` it 's absolutely right that for companies who do not legally need to keep data , if you leave a service you should be able to delete your data wherever it appears across that service . ` this change gives citizens that right . ' britain 's objection to the eu move is that unrealistic expectations . will be created by the right 's expansive title because the controls . proposed will be relatively modest in their impact on the way data . spreads , or is traded , across websites . mr pickles agreed with these concerns , but called for the bill to be saved . ` there are fair concerns about who is responsible for tracking down and deleting information if it has appeared on other services , but that is no reason to junk the whole proposal . ` equally , it is critical that british citizens do not have weaker rights than people in other countries when we are dealing with international services . ` that creates needless complexity for individuals and businesses so i hope the detail can be worked out to ensure proper protections that are feasible and will not cripple small businesses .  viviane reding , the eu justice commissioner , said : ` at present a citizen . can request deletion only if data is incomplete or incorrect . the rules were proposed following a slew of complaints against sites such as mark zuckerberg 's -lrb- pictured -rrb- facebook . ` we want . to extend this right to make it stronger in this internet world . the . burden of proof shall be on the companies , they will have to show that . data is needed . ' she described the legislation as ` one of the biggest market-openers of the . last few years . ' the ministry of justice said : ` the uk does not support the right to be forgotten as . proposed by the european commission . the title raises unrealistic and . unfair expectations of the proposals . ` we are also concerned about potentially impossible requirements for . data controllers to manage third-party erasure ; the  reasonable steps  required by the draft regulation would promise much , but deliver . little . '", "summary": " ` right to be forgotten ' regulations .   developed by the eu after growing .   complaints about how social media giants retain .   information .   at present a citizen can request deletion only if data is incorrect .
