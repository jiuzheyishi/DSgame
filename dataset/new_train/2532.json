{"text": "have you picked your jaws up off the floor yet , gladiators ? if so , well done . indeed , it was probably a fairly herculean task considering all the mind-blowing revelations in  scandal 's  twisty season 3 premiere . though several one-on-one scenes took liv away from her trusted gladiators for much of the opener , you can be sure this thick-as-thieves crew will be facing the onslaught together in weeks to come . ew talked with three of liv 's fixers -- katie lowes , guillermo díaz and darby stanchfield -- about their reactions to the premiere -lrb- yes , even they were surprised by some things ! -rrb- and what 's to come for pope & associates this year . -lrb- spoiler alert ! if you have n't seen the premiere , do n't keep reading . -rrb- . ` ncis , ' ` the mentalist , ' ` hawaii five-0 , ' ` castle ' : find out what 's next in the spoiler room .  it 's handled  picked up right where the season 2 finale left off -- with olivia pope -lrb- kerry washington -rrb- under the microscope thanks to her affair with president fitzgerald  fitz  grant -lrb- tony goldwyn -rrb- going public . trying to cut off that problem at the pass was cia black ops commander rowan -lrb- joe morton -rrb- , a.k.a. liv 's dad , who had arranged a convenient international getaway . surprising absolutely no one , liv decided to forgo the easy way out and returned to her gladiators to fix ... herself . once liv returned , reformed assassin and personal confidante huck was a natural choice to escort his mentor back into her inner sanctum .  it 's a really short but really powerful scene when he 's pulling her out of the limo ,  díaz says .  he 's like her watchdog . he 's that guy that 's always thinking about her safety and protecting her and -lsb- making sure -rsb- nothing bad 's going to happen to her -lsb- because -rsb- she 's the one that saved him .  but can the gladiators save liv now that she 's in the sights of cold-blooded frenemy -- and fitz 's chief of staff -- cyrus -lrb- jeff perry -rrb- ? even stanchfield , who plays no-nonsense pope employee abby , was shocked when she finally saw one scene in particular play out on film .  we were watching the first episode where cyrus starts the ` kill folder ' -lsb- on olivia -rsb- ,  the actress remembers .  we 'd all forgotten about it -lsb- since the table read -rsb- , and we all just lost our marbles . it was incredible .  she adds ,  cyrus can be so evil -- just when you think you were going to trust him ! i start to like the guy , and then he does something like that , and i 'm just like , ` you 're dead forever now ... , '  then she laughs ,  at least for another episode .  cyrus is n't the only one who 's out for blood . liv 's newest acolyte , quinn -lrb- lowes -rrb- , is still practically shaking from the adrenaline boost of her first torture session under huck 's tutelage . lowes admits quinn  got a little bit of a taste for -lsb- violence -rsb- in the finale ,  but says ,  it 's not so much that she wants to go out with a machine gun and start killing people . i do n't think she 's psychotic , and that 's not how i 'm playing her . the deal is , she has had a lot of really terrible things happen to her in her life and , for the first time in a while , she was in control of the situation and she was excelling at something and she was causing pain on somebody else . it 's that sense of control that gives her a high , that forces her to be addicted to that feeling .  kerry washington on how she stays grounded amid ` scandal ' craze . even lowes admits how wild quinn 's change in character has been .  i can not go back and watch the pilot because we 've come such a long way , and such a 180 has happened , and she 's grown so much and changed so much as a person ,  she admits .  this season is a big mix . darby is always saying , ` oh , that 's old quinn ! oh , that 's new quinn ! ' now it 's really combining together .  for huck , though , quinn 's new empowerment spells trouble . he considers himself a murder-and-torture addict and now fears he 's enabling quinn . díaz previews ,  that 's kind of what he 's dealing with in the first few episodes : him having created this monster . he knows how seductive it was for him and how caught-up in it he got , in that dark world . he 's afraid she 's too far gone now , and he does n't know what to do about it .  however huck chooses to confront quinn 's growing bloodlust , it 's safe to say  huckleberry quinn  -- as shippers affectionately refer to the friendship -- will never be the same . according to díaz , that 's not necessarily a bad thing :  their relationship has shifted . it 's changed a little bit . it 's exciting what 's coming down the pike .  stanchfield 's character is also facing a relationship in flux with on-and-off lover david rosen -lrb- joshua malina -rrb- , the newly appointed u.s. attorney for the district of columbia . the pair had only a brief encounter in the premiere , with david telling abby to  return -lsb- his -rsb- calls ,  but stanchfield promises ,  it 's not over between abby and david . ... they try . the best way to describe it -lsb- is -rsb- , abby and david have never done normal -- they 've never actually been on a proper , normal date . there 's definitely an attempt at normal -lsb- in coming episodes that -rsb- will be interesting for fans . it 's been interesting to play . they really are two people who fit . they 're a good match together because they 're both sort of misfits in a way .  seeing as the beltway of  scandal  is packed with misfits and machinations , abby and david 's showmance will be in fine company -- starting with a huck-heavy episode next week .  scandal  returns next thursday at 10 p.m. et on abc . see the original story at ew.com . click here to try 2 risk free issues of entertainment weekly . © 2011 entertainment weekly and time inc. . all rights reserved .", "summary": " the third season premiere of  scandal  was shocking .   stars katie lowes , guillermo díaz and darby stanchfield were surprised by some scenes .   the actors tease what 's to come in season 3 .
