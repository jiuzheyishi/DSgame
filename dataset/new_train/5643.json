{"text": "very few jobs come with the following requirement : make toddlers cry . but they do if you 're alexander demetriou and your job is playing the baddie in the touring production of disney on ice . ` it 's brilliant fun being captain hook , ' the ice skater told mailonline . ` as a villain you can get away with a lot more than playing a good guy . and if i see a kid crying then i know i 'm doing my job ! but when i 'm dressed up in my costume children seem to cry just looking at me ! ' scroll down for video . alexander says performing in his hook costume while dancing on ice is made difficult because of the outfit 's weight . alex , who who grew up in blackpool and has been skating since he was seven years old , plays the pirate in the peter pan section of disney on ice 's touring production , passport to adventure . ' i loved peter pan when i was a child , so it 's terrific performing in it now . it 's wonderful to hear all the little kids doing the  tic-tocs  with the crocodile 's clock , and seeing their smiling faces light up when all the characters come onto the ice . of course , they 're not meant to smile when they see me ! ' alex explained that the trickiest part of his job is switching between the roles of different disney characters , changing skating styles to portray different characters . ` as well as performing captain hook , i also play david in lilo & stitch . he 's a bit of a surfer dude so i whizz around the rink more , whereas hook 's skating style is a lot sharper and rougher . ` plus , hook 's costume itself is very demanding because it 's so heavy - the heaviest one on the tour - which means that i actually ca n't physically jump or spin while i 'm wearing it . ` it makes sword-fighting on ice pretty tricky - especially since we use real swords so they 're also really heavy . ' mickey and minnie mouse performing in disney on ice . happily , alex has never skated off the ice with more than the odd finger injury . a cut here , a graze there . though there was once a slippery situation with a crocodile ... ` i 've had a few falls - in a live show anything can happen - my best one was once when i was being chased by the crocodile and i 'm meant to jump into the audience onto a stairwell - but i tripped and fell face-first into them . luckily i did n't fall on any small children . ' and being familiar with grueling training sessions , alex also had a few words of advice for the contestants on the new series of dancing on ice . ` do n't get worried about the audience - try to forget there are people watching . otherwise you 'll have falls . ' i always get pre-match nerves . not as bad . as when i first started , but there 's always a little fear in your minds . and i . do n't have any superstitions at all - i think it 's best not to , otherwise . you 'll panic . ' -lrb- sadly , his wisdom comes a little too late for pammy , who exited the show after just one episode following a fall and a slippery wardrobe malfunction . -rrb- . ` i 'd love to do dancing on ice , ' alex . added . ` it would be great . i think any other sportsperson would be a . good partner - they 'd be pretty flexible - but really i 'd like to be . partnered with natalie portman , because i love her a little too much !
