{"text": "one of the longest standing mysteries of migration has finally been solved after scientists discovered where the uk 's painted lady butterflies go each autumn . the large , colourful butterflies , commonly seen in the uk countryside , migrates to our shores in varying numbers from the continent each summer . but until now scientists had no idea whether the painted lady made the return journey at the end of summer , like the closely related red admiral , or simply died in the uk . long distance traveller : a painted lady butterfly sits atop lilac flowers . a new study of their migration habits has finally solved the mystery of where they disappear to each winter . thanks to a massive survey of the creatures ' habits , it has now been revealed that they make an epic intergenerational journey each year spanning thousands of miles from africa to the arctic and back again . in one of the largest citizen science projects ever conducted , scientists from butterfly conservation , the nerc centre for ecology & hydrology and rothamsted research amongst others , discovered exactly what happens to painted ladies each autumn . more than 60,000 public sightings of . the butterfly were collected across europe during 2009 , with 10,000 . british observers taking part . painted lady on an oxeye daisy : the creatures undertake a huge migration from africa to the arctic that takes them six generations to complete . scientists also used radar to track their . movements across southern england . they discovered that the painted lady did indeed migrate south each autumn but made this return journey at high altitude out of view of butterfly observers on the ground . radar records revealed that painted ladies fly at an average altitude of over 500m -lrb- 1,640 ft -rrb- on their southbound trip and can clock up speeds of up to 30mph by selecting favourable conditions . the findings also revealed that the species undertakes a phenomenal 9,000 mile round trip from tropical africa to the arctic circle . that 's almost double the length of the famous migrations undertaken by monarch butterflies in north america . the whole journey is not undertaken by individual butterflies but is a series of steps by up to six successive generations . painted ladies returning to africa in the autumn are thus several generations removed from their ancestors who left africa earlier in the year . the uk 's first major study of ` flying ant day ' has revealed not one but two flying ant days , and indeed large numbers of ants were reported over two flying ant weeks . when the uk 's garden ants took to the air this summer , the society of biology received over 6,000 reports from members of the public as part of its first flying ant survey . about one-in-five sightings happened on tuesday 24th july , and another one in five came two weeks later on wednesday 8th august . these peaks were extremely striking , but still these two flying ant days accounted for fewer than half of the records . in fact , flying ants were a common sight for the days in july and august around the two peaks . the time between the two peaks was a period of low pressure , which is usually associated with clouds , wind and rain . this suggests that the weather had a large role to play in determining when the ants flew . professor adam hart , an ecologist at the university of gloucestershire , said : ` we found a relationship between flying ant swarms and weather conditions , which we expected , and geographical variation , which we did n't expect . ' richard fox , surveys manager at butterfly conservation , was one of the report authors . he said : ` the extent of the annual journey undertaken by the painted lady butterfly is astonishing . ` this tiny creature weighing less than a gram , with a brain the size of a pin head and no opportunity to learn from older , experienced individuals , undertakes an epic intercontinental migration in order to find plants for its caterpillars to eat . ` once thought to be blindly led , at the mercy of the wind , into an evolutionary dead end in the lethal british winter , this amazing combination of mass-participation citizen science and cutting edge technology has shown painted ladies to be sophisticated travellers . ` we are extremely grateful to the many thousands of members of the public who reported painted lady sightings and contributed to this extraordinary discovery . ' radar in hampshire operated by rothamsted research revealed that around 11million high-flying painted ladies entered the uk in spring 2009 with 26 million departing in autumn . dr jason chapman , a researcher at rothamsted research , who led the radar studies of painted ladies , said : ` the apparent lack of a return migration of the late-summer generation of painted lady butterflies was one of the greatest enigmas in insect migration ecology . ` but , through a combination of traditional monitoring by butterfly enthusiasts and new radar techniques , we have finally solved this long-standing puzzle . ` migrant insects continue to amaze the public and research community alike as they are capable of carrying out the most remarkable journeys .
