{"text": "if you are reluctant to challenge your physician on a certain procedure or medicine , you are hardly alone . focus groups show that many patients feel intimidated by their doctors . they 're reluctant to take an active role in discussing their care because they 're afraid that the doctor will see them as  difficult .  recently , nine medical associations each took the unusual step of listing five medical procedures commonly used in their fields that patients do n't need , amounting to 45 tests or procedures . the associations report some of them might actually be harmful . eight medical associations have signed on to release additional lists in the fall . an annual ekg is an example of one test you can do without , unless family history or symptoms suggest otherwise . some procedures , such as repeated abdominal ct scans without a significant change in the patient 's condition , subject patients to a relatively high dose of radiation and can increase their cancer risk . it is not the government or the courts that issued these lists ; the physicians ' own professional associations decreed that these procedures usually should be avoided . but many doctors perform them anyway . there are many reasons for this : one is that doctors are often paid a fee for each procedure , and it does n't take much creativity to convince themselves the patient needs the intervention . another reason doctors i interviewed told me is that the medical associations ' recommendations have no legal standing . these doctors said they can be sued for not screening properly if their patient has a heart attack or some other untoward event . and sheer inertia is also a powerful factor in preventing reform ; the test is performed because  this is what we have been doing for years .  on these and on scores of other medical matters , you can not be a passive bystander . you need to keep an eye on what is ordered to be done to you and why . form your own judgments , disregard those doctors who pooh-pooh the internet . if you can find somewhere to park your general misgivings about the big , bad federal government , you will find that it runs excellent web pages where you can find very reliable information about what ails you , as well as information about possible treatments . for instance , the centers for disease control and prevention and the national institutes of health provide extensive resources . and if you can let go of the notion that the private sector is the best way to get what you need , you will find that nonprofit organizations provide very sound guidance , for instance , the mayo clinic and the cleveland clinic . it 's true there are dubious medical sites on the internet , and you do best by following the same guidelines that serve well in the financial world : if something sounds too good to be true , it probably is . if anybody tells you that you can lose 30 pounds easily if you buy their junk , let alone cure your cancer with apricot pits and coffee enemas in a few easy visits , click off and move on . behavioral economics has shown that people are more swayed by anecdotes than by statistics . parents will think the risks of vaccination are much higher after reading testimonials from parents whose children had negative reactions , in spite of having seen statistical information that says the risks are low . you need to pay more attention to people who say it with figures . when i read in the new england journal of medicine that a procedure i was to undergo had a 10 % risk of  esophageal injury with ulceration ,  i forced myself to pay more attention to this statistic than to the tale of a friend who had the same procedure and did well . i am sorry to say that i know quite a few people who agreed to undergo major surgery upon their doctor 's recommendation without investigating their options . some of those surgeries went awfully wrong . but they would not dream of buying a lawn mower , let alone a car , in this way . if you keep in mind what can and often does go wrong , you are likely to find the inner strength to ask questions , even if you have to apologize for not saluting the doctor and doing what you are told . and if you have to pay from your pocket for a second opinion , it 's worth it . i have been an inquisitive patient , which is one reason i am hitting 83 . i refused to undergo more surgeries than i have and , politely , left some doctors who were too eager to conduct a lot of tests that seemed to me hard to justify . i am not saying it is easy ; just that it is vital . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of amitai etzioni .", "summary": " nine medical associations each listed common medical procedures you do n't need .   amitai etzioni : patients too intimidated to question doctors about procedures .   etzioni : doctors order tests anyway ; for money , out of habit or fear of lawsuits .   beware of doctors dismissing your research , he says . stand up and demand answers .
