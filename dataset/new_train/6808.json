{"text": "a rare picture of charles miller , the british gentleman who arrived in brazil in 1894 with a football under each arm and introduced the country to the sport . it is a scene almost impossible to imagine today for reasons scottish football fans will readily understand . a scotsman arrives in a brazilian port with a football under each arm , attracting quizzical looks from the locals who wonder what the spherical objects are for . the scot demonstrates with a flash of his skills on the ball and the brazilians gape in awe at the wizardry on display . today , as brazilian fans eagerly anticipate their country 's bid for a sixth world cup win -- this time on home soil -- there is little any country , far less scotland , can teach them about football . but 120 years ago , this is essentially how the world 's greatest football nation discovered the sport . the man who stepped off the boat in santos in 1894 was charles miller , son of a greenock boatyard clerk who had left his home town to build a new life in south america . coincidentally , he began playing the game in sao paulo at the same time another scot , glasgow-born factory worker thomas donohoe , was helping to popularise it in rio de janeiro . a statue was unveiled there last year to honour donohoe 's role but historians now agree miller was the first to organise a match played under association football rules in brazil . and , far-fetched as it may seem , it is even suggested 5ft 5in miller 's dribbling and passing style became the blueprint for the brazilians ' trademark mode of play . he was too short to be any real threat in the air -- but his trick of flicking the ball over his head with the back of the heel is still known in brazil as ` chaleira ' , derived from the scotsman 's name . miller 's father had left his job in greenock to strike out on his own in brazil in the 1860s . by the time he met and married charlotte fox , daughter of the richest englishman in town , he had already landed a job as a high-powered railway engineer . sao paulo and rio de janeiro select teams pose in front of the train taking the rio team home after the first ever match between the rival cities . charles miller is pictured in the middle of the front row of the sao paulo athletic club assembled in 1904 . his son charles was sent to a boarding school , banister court in southampton , for a ` proper english ' education , and it was there he first kicked a football . on the . pitch , miller earned the nickname nipper for his deftness on the ball . and eye for goal and , at 17 , he was spotted by the local st mary 's side , . which later became southampton fc . he then joined corinthian , the legendary london amateur club , which boasted some of the best players in the world . the antonio casimiro da costa trophy , pictured left , taken by the winner of the original paulista league . charles miller , pictured right , dazzled brazilians with his footballing skills . charles miller ` shows off the ` wizardry ' that inspired people in brazil to take up football 120 years ago . he is pictured with the ball in the sao paulo against rio de janeiro select match of 1901 . when miller finished school at age 19 , he had scored a remarkable 45 goals in 34 matches in his latest season and was widely expected to turn professional . but it seemed he had a higher calling in south america . miller was amazed to find football was practically unknown in brazil . the british expat community 's pastime of choice was cricket , apparently much better suited to the tropical heat . the crowd watches on at a title play-off involving sau paulo ac and another side for the first league of brazil in 1902 . but he did not see it that way . he waited until autumn , when the cricket bats had been put away , and seized his chance . on april 14 , 1895 , on a scrubby field on the floodplains of a river in central sao paulo -- after some cattle were moved out of the way -- miller played in the first full football match on brazilian soil . ` what a nice little game , ' he said later of the encounter . his sao paulo railway side beat the gas works team comfortably by 4-2 . mr miller 's sau paulo ac squad pose for a photo ahead of the title play-off match for the first league in 1902 . charles miller is pictured second from left in the front row . a poster commemorating sao paulo athletic club 's three championships in a row from 1902-1905 . charles miller is pictured at the centre in the bottom . the brazilian fans watched bemused as first the rudiments then the subtleties of the game were presented to them . they seemed to get it . one local journalist was on the right lines when he wrote : ` it gives them great satisfaction or fills them with great sorrow when this kind of yellowish bladder enters a rectangle formed by wooden posts . ' in 1901 , the country 's first league was founded in sao paulo and at its conclusion miller 's sao paulo athletic club -- a team of expats -- and paulistano , made up entirely of brazilians , were tied . son of a scottish dad and an english mum , charlies miller was born in sao paulo less than 10 miles from the new itaquerao stadium . charles miller kicks off friendly between two of his old clubs southampton and sau paulo ac in sao paulo in 1948 . a family photo in sao paulo with charles miller as a two-year-old sitting on the bench . they met in a play-off for the title . after paulistano drew first blood , miller scored twice to lift -- and drink champagne from -- the first ever championship cup . miller was also behind rival cities sao paulo and rio meeting up for the first time . but the biggest victor of all was football . what began in brazil as a game for the white elite and impeccably dressed supporters who greeted every goal with cries of ` hip hip hurray ' became a game for the masses . charles miller is pictured sitting far right with members of the hampshire county xi squad in 1894 . when miller , pictured left with his sau paulo team and right with a hampshire xi , finished school , he had scored a remarkable 45 goals in 34 matches in his latest season and was widely expected to turn professional . before long , the sight of children kicking anything spherical around the streets was ubiquitous . they were infused with the rhythm , individualism and playfulness still evident in brazilian football with stars such as pele becoming household names . there is no doubt about the significance of miller 's contribution to brazilian football . by the time of his death in 1953 , brazil had hosted its first world cup . ` few have captured the imagination of an entire nation like he did , ' said a news-paper obituary . years later brazil would go on to become global footballing superpowers . pictured left to right , rivaldo , ronaldo and gilberto silva celebrate winning the world cup in 2002 .", "summary": " charles miller arrived in santos , brazil in 1894 with a football under each arm .   credited with introducing the country to the sport with footballing ` wizardry '   120 years later brazil is preparing to host the world cup on home soil .   another scot , thomas donohue , was introducing the game in rio de janeiro .   historians say miller organised first match under association football rules .
