{"text": "freelance journalist james foley was brutally killed yesterday after being held for 21 months by islamic militants in syria . despite the increasing dangers of working in the region , despite the many journalists who have been kidnapped or are still missing , and despite dreading this news , it has taken us all by surprise and we are deeply , deeply shocked . freelance journalists , photographers and video journalists have always played a vital role in newsgathering , and their contribution today is more important than ever . they make a crucial contribution to the free flow of information that is an essential part of a democratic society and fully deserve our support and protection . our trust works with freelancers on a daily basis -- helping them , helping their families , and sometimes working with them to help other freelancers . and james was one of these . we worked with him , helping him financially as he and his colleagues searched for missing colleagues in syria . we stayed in touch . james ' kidnap and death is yet another tragic reminder of the very real dangers facing journalists today . over the past two years , around 70 journalists have been killed covering the conflict in syria , and a further 20 journalists currently remain missing , including freelancer austin tice . the committee to protect journalists say that the last two years have been the most dangerous for journalists on record , with 174 confirmed deaths since 2012 . not only this , but threats , intimidation , assaults and kidnappings are becoming every day challenges for journalists working around the world . reuters columnist david rohde writes :  syria today is the scene of the single largest wave of kidnappings in modern journalism , more than in iraq during the 2000s or lebanon during the 1980s .  these are terrible facts . so , what of the freelancers ? who negotiates for them ? who sends in security consultants to try and get them out ? who helps their families ? freelance journalists like james often work alone without the resources and support of large news organizations behind them -- they are always the most vulnerable to these dangers . the rory peck trust has been supporting and assisting freelancers for almost two decades , and we 've never seen a demand for our assistance like this before . it 's not just freelancers travelling to conflict zones who are at risk . the majority of newsgatherers killed each year are journalists working in their own countries . freelance photographers , fixers and camera operators covering and reporting on conflicts that are affecting their own communities are often the most vulnerable . they 're unable to leave areas when it becomes too dangerous , or when their reporting is exposed , and are frequently threatened , attacked and accused of being traitors for working with international news organizations . beheading of american journalist james foley recalls past horrors . so , how to protect freelancers ? how to help them work securely ? our organization gives financial and other practical support to freelancers in trouble . we offer online resources on safety & security for those reporting from dangerous environments , and run a training fund that provides bursaries for freelancers to enable them to undergo hostile environments training before travelling to a conflict zone . this training can teach freelancers how to assess risk and spot danger , handle a crisis , support others and give vital first aid . the right training can save lives . although our focus is specifically on freelancers , we are only one of the many organizations that exist to support journalists worldwide . committee to protect journalists , reporters without borders and ifj all have security guides that can help freelancers be more prepared in situations of crisis . the international news safety institute offers up-to-date information about the security situation on the ground for journalists , and risc offers vital first-aid training . there 's no question that conflict journalism has always been a dangerous occupation -- and how very wrong that is ! so when we talk about protection , when we talk about security , we are talking about every sector of the news industry , whether news employers , staff or freelancers . in this brutal new world , everyone must be prepared to take responsibility -- for themselves and for others . james foley was a freelancer in the truest and most honorable sense -- a talented journalist and an exceptional human being . our thoughts are with his family at this tragic time , and with the families of all other journalists currently being held in syria .", "summary": " the rory peck trust works with freelance journalists on a daily basis , including james foley .   tina carr : foleys ' death is yet another tragic reminder of the dangers facing journalists today .   freelancers often work alone without the support of large news organizations , she writes .   carr : majority of newsgatherers killed each year are journalists working in their own countries .
