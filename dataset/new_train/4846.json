{"text": "muslim rebel leaders in the philippines ' troubled south will get access to the lion 's share of the region 's natural resources under a new agreement reached in peace talks with the government . the wealth-sharing deal , signed on sunday after eight months of talks , is viewed as a key step forward in the quest for peace with the moro islamic liberation front -lrb- milf -rrb- , which has fought for decades to set up an independent islamic state on the resource-rich island of mindanao . progress in the peace process had stalled in the wake of a landmark treaty signed in october last year , which sought to put an end to a conflict that has left tens of thousands dead .  for the benefit of bangsamoro and the whole country , the government and the milf once more demonstrated that they are invested in the process and will persevere in order to forge lasting peace in mindanao , miriam coronel-ferrer , the government 's chief negotiator said in a statement . the october agreement laid out the groundwork for a new autonomous region called bangsamoro that will be administered by muslims in mindanao . the philippines is a predominantly catholic country but 5 % of its population is muslim , according to the cia world factbook . under the terms of the wealth-sharing deal , muslims will get a 75 % share of income derived from the exploitation of metallic minerals in the area -- reported to include gold and copper . they will also receive 75 % of tax revenue , while any income derived from fossil fuels like petroleum , natural gas and coal will be split 50-50 with the central government in manila . an end to the conflict could help bring investors to the region , which is reported to have untapped mineral deposits worth $ 312 billion .  wealth creation is important for the operation of the bangsamoro , considering that the bangsamoro territory is among the most underdeveloped in the philippines due to the decades-old conflict ,  the statement added . however , hurdles remain in president benigno aquino 's plan to achieve lasting peace in the region by 2016 when his term ends . agreements have yet to be reached on power-sharing and normalization -- which means giving up arms . a report published in june by the international crisis group warned that the peace process needed to find ways to support insurgents as they build normal , civilian lives . it estimates that the milf has 11,000 to 12,000 fighters .  the government has a poor track record of implementing peace agreements and the milf is understandably wary of weakening its formidable firepower too soon ,  the report said .  secondly , even if it did hand over some guns , these are unlikely to be destroyed , as per international best practice ; military and police would rather keep the good ones , and there is a well-documented history of leakage into the black market from government ,  it added .", "summary": " wealth-sharing deal viewed as key step forward in quest for peace with muslim rebels .   muslims will get a 75 % share of income derived from the exploitation of minerals .   rebels have been fighting for independence from the philippines for years .   peace process to create a new autonomous region administered by muslims .
