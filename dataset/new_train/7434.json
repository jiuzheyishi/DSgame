{"text": "too lazy to get up to switch the kettle on ? soon you may be able to simply raise your hand or nod your head from another room , and you 'll be moments away from a fresh cup of tea . this is the hope of researchers at the university of washington who have developed technology that will allow people to control household devices with simple gestures . the technology , named ` wisee ' , is similar in concept to how microsoft 's xbox kinect sensor works by using cameras to recognise gestures . scroll down for video . a hand gesture changes the tv channel using wisee technology . the system detects the changes in the electromagnetic waves of wi-fi signals as they reflect off a moving human body . by adapting a wi-fi router and wireless . household devices , the researchers developed a system that can detect specific . movements without the need for sensors or cameras . they claim it is simpler and cheaper than similar gesture-recognition technologies . wisee works using the doppler effect - the way a wave of sound or light changes frequency at the point it is observed depending on the source of the wave 's movements . a common example of the doppler effect is the change in pitch of an ambulance siren as it passes . a standard wi-fi router can be adapted to function as a receiver . this . receiver then listens to all of the wireless transmissions coming from . devices throughout a home , including smartphones , laptops and tablets . when a person moves , there is a slight change in the frequency of the wireless signal . moving a hand or foot causes the receiver to detect a pattern of changes known as the doppler frequency shift . these . frequency changes are very small -- only several hertz -- when compared . with wi-fi signals that have a 20 megahertz bandwidth and operate at 5 . gigahertz . an algorithm to . detect these slight shifts and the system also accounts for gaps in . wireless signals when devices are n't transmitting . if a person wants to use the wisee , they would perform a specific repetition gesture sequence to get access to the receiver . once . the wireless receiver locks onto the user , they can perform normal . gestures to interact with the devices and appliances in her home . the researchers tested these gestures with five users in a two-bedroom apartment and an office environment . out of the 900 gestures performed , wisee accurately recognised 94 per cent of them . it was found that as many as five people can move simultaneously in the same room without confusing the receiver . the wi-fi receiver listens to all of the wireless transmissions coming from devices throughout a home , including smartphones , laptops and tablets . when a person moves there is a slight change in the frequency of the wireless signal . collaborator sidhant gupta , a . doctoral student in computer science and engineering at the university , who has worked . with microsoft research on two other similar technologies . soundwave , which , as its name suggests , uses sound waves to monitor . whole-body gestures and humantenna , which uses radiation from electrical . wires . but wisee stands apart because it does n't require the user to be in the same room as the receiver or the device . wisee detects the changes in the electromagnetic waves of wi-fi signals as they reflect off a moving human body . when specific gestures are used , it was found that as many as five people can move simultaneously in the same room without confusing the receiver . ` this is the first whole-home gesture recognition system that works without either requiring instrumentation of the user with sensors or deploying cameras in every room , ' said qifan pu , who worked on the research project . the researchers now plan to look at the ability to control multiple devices at once . wisee detects the changes in the electromagnetic waves of wi-fi signals as they reflect off a moving human body . using . a software algorithm , the technology can identify nine different . whole-body gestures , ranging from pushing , pulling and punching to . full-body bowling . video : wisee wi-fi signals enable gesture recognition in the home .", "summary": " system allows users to control home appliances using body movements .   detects tiny changes in wi-fi signals as they reflect off a moving body .   five people can move in the same room without confusing the system .   system , called ` wisee ' , is similar in concept to how the xbox kinect sensor uses cameras to recognise gestures - but does n't need a camera or sensors .
