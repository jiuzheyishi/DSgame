{"text": "after 13-year-old jahi mcmath had a tonsillectomy , she suffered cardiac arrest and loss of blood flow to her brain . her doctors pronounced her  brain dead .  but what happened next tragically exposed the challenges and confusion in american medicine over defining death . is it when the brain stops functioning , or when circulation stops ? by california law , if the brain is dead , the person is dead . according to the law in all american jurisdictions , it does n't matter how death is measured . doctors who persist in calling patients  brain dead  are asking for trouble . these doctors have gotten it . jahi is on a ventilator . her parents wanted a second opinion on whether she met the standard tests for the death of the brain . after the second physician confirmed that the criteria were met , the normal next step would have been to pronounce her dead and stop ventilation . but her parents continued to fight , and another extension on turning off her machines was granted . they are scrambling to move her to a facility that will treat her before the court-imposed deadline of january 7 . now the family of terri schiavo has joined the battle . schiavo 's case was another high-profile example of the devastation that happens when there are differences on whether someone is alive and whether to keep that person on support . terri schiavo , who was not brain-dead but was severely brain damaged , died in 2005 after her feeding tube was disconnected . her parents fought for years to keep her alive against her wishes , as expressed by her husband . the standard tests for the death of the brain are fairly straightforward . it is not a vegetative state -- it is absence of brain activity , and constitutes a legal measure of death in all states . and no law prohibits continued ventilation of a dead body . we do it routinely to preserve organs for transplant . jahi 's parents have decided to try to continue ventilation -- if you call it life-support you are taking a stand on whether she is dead -- so the issues become who will provide the treatment and who will pay . a significant minority in the medical profession continue to believe people with dead brains and beating hearts are still alive . believers include some of our wisest minds -- a harvard professor , an national institute of health theorist , a chief of neurology at ucla , and the former chair of the u.s. president 's council all reject brain-based death pronouncement . they agree with jahi 's parents that death is linked to circulatory loss . others take a position more liberal than the standard law that defines brain death . they favor pronouncing death in some cases even when some parts of the lower brain are still functioning . i have defended that view since 1973 . why , then , does american law continue to force one standard of death on jahi 's parents and others who have plausible alternative definitions ? once one realizes that the choice among the options is not a cut-and-dried matter of medical science , why not let people have some choice based on their personal religious and cultural views ? this is a  conscience-based  approach to defining death . we need to have a default public policy -- the brain-based definition currently in law -- but people like jahi 's parents should have the option to record their conscientiously held positions and allow pronouncements of death to be based on those beliefs . that 's the law in new jersey and japan . that would mean jahi could be classified as alive if that is what her parents choose . that , of course , does n't end the controversy . just like it is not illegal to provide medical support for dead people , it is not necessarily illegal to stop life-support on someone who is still alive . we do that every day , particularly for those who are permanently unconscious . the trouble arises when physicians want to stop life-support , perhaps because they believe the case is hopeless , and the patient or family insist that life support continue . we call this the  futile care problem .  i defended in court the mother of a severely brain-damaged baby referred to as baby k who wanted life support to continue even though her doctors wanted to stop . society should show sympathy for mothers who want their children to be kept alive . if preserving life requires high-tech support like a ventilator , doctors are the ones who should provide it . the costs should n't be borne by the hospital . the health insurance company or medicaid should n't pay . but if the family can raise the funds , like jahi 's parents are doing , and the patient is beyond feeling pain , no harm is done by continuing , especially if they can find a facility willing to take the case . whether this right to medical support should extend to those considered dead by one standard , but alive by another is the question we face with jahi mcmath . if the patient does not suffer , and private funding is available , people should have the right to make this decision for their loved ones . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of robert veatch .", "summary": " jahi mcmath has been declared brain dead but parents want her to remain on ventilator .   robert veatch : some define death when brain stops , some say it 's when circulation stops .   veatch : tragedy shows the confusion around defining death ; we need a public policy .   veatch : parents should be able to keep her on support if it can be privately funded .
