{"text": "for sportsmen to form a pop group is rare , for a boy band to be forged from a sport often criticized as being the stuffy reserve of boring old men is something of a miracle . not that the chances of future platinum-selling albums or world tours look particularly good for  golf boys ,  if the standard of their first release  oh , oh , oh  is anything to go but the band -- who were created by world-ranked 44 crane -- will not be disappointed if they fail to top the billboard charts because the quartet of pga tour players are singing and dancing for charity . the group 's debut track -- which is a throwback to the 1990s boy band heyday of new kids on the block , nsync and backstreet boys -- has so far proved an internet sensation attracting over a million views on youtube since it went live on june 13 . in fact , three-times pga tour winner crane , who was the driving force behind golf boys , has built a cult social media following over the last 12 months after uploading a host of comedy clips of himself . in one the 35-year-old took time to make fun of his reputation as a slow player -- prompting the pga tour website to suggest he 'd been transformed from the ,  sultan of slow , to the lord of laughs .   my image , amongst some of the golfers , is slow golfer , nice guy ,  crane told the pga tour .  so when friends go from slow golfer , nice guy to ` wow , ' it 's like the perfect storm of my image to the videos , it 's such a contrast . it 's had more effect because of it .  and crane 's latest production was designed to take things to the next level . after securing funding from farmers insurance , crane convinced watson , fowler and mahan to make it happen .  we 've got costumes , a studio rented and we 're going for it . the boy band is coming back ,  he proudly stated in may . farmers insurance came on board through their involvement with crane , a player they sponsor and who won the pga tour tournament they host in california last year .  the proceeds will benefit charitable organizations designated by farmers and ben crane ,  said company vice president mark toohey . the timing of golf boys ' debut release , during the 111th u.s. open at congressional country club in maryland , only added to the hype . when the golfing world should be occupied with finding its next major champion , many will be talking about the golf boys ' video -- and in particular the players ' ridiculous outfits . watson is shirtless in a pair of denim dungarees ; mahan in skin-tight leopard print pants and an open fur coat . crane sports what looks like a cut-off wetsuit , while fowler is resplendent in leather pants and an open leather jacket . the video opens with the foursome in staged boy band pose , before the camera pans in on each of their faces in slow motion . then the choreographed dancing kicks in , with the players mixing studio moves with coordinated routines on the golf course . by the time the golf-themed lyrics kick in you begin to wonder how the players managed to keep a straight face long enough to film it .  chip , putt , you know , what 's the big whoop ? when i play my game , then i make my mama proud ,  sings mahan .  smash , bang , you got to hit the ball far . when the crowd goes ooooh , then you hear the oo-da-la-li-la-li ,  continues fowler . fowler 's involvement is particularly amusing when you consider his status as america 's pop star golfer elect . the 22-year-old has been labeled  the jonas brother of golf  , on account of his boy-band good looks , and he attracts hoards of admiring fans wherever he goes . quite what his role in golf boys will do to his appeal remains to be seen . while crane 's collective are clearly the first pga tour boy band , golf boys are n't the first professional golfers to try their hands at music . two-times major winner john daly has been known to pick up a guitar and sing on occasion , and has even written his own material . it 's surely only a matter of time before golf boys invite him along for a cameo .  crane has talked about the potential of future videos ,  admitted toohey . and with that , it 's off to watch his latest clip -  the making of golf boys  . oo-da-la-li-la-li .", "summary": " the  golf boys  release their first single  oh , oh , oh  to coincide with the u.s. open .   pga tour pros ben crane , bubba watson , rickie fowler and hunter mahan complete the line up .   project was funded by farmers insurance with all proceeds going to charity .
