{"text": "a court in sweden has ruled that it is acceptable to masturbate in public as long as it is not directed at anyone . the ruling came in a landmark judgement following a case brought against a man seen touching himself on a beach . the 65-year-old man , who dropped his shorts close to the water at drevviken beach , stockholm , and started to masturbate , was initially charged with sexual assault . but in a surprise ruling , the södertörn district court acquitted the man . while the judgement stated it ` may be proven that the man exposed himself and masturbated on this occasion ' , it subsequently added that no offence had been committed . södertörn district court , pictured , has acquitted a man accused of sexual assault for masturbating on a beach , because it was not directed at anyone . it based its finding on the fact that the man was not pleasuring himself towards a specific person , according to sweden 's english language news website , the local . prosecutors held their hands up in agreement , underlining that the law calls for the act to be directed at another person to count as a crime . public prosecutor olof vrethammar told the mitti newspaper that he was n't planning to appeal the ruling . he told the paper , quoted in the local : ` for this to be a criminal offence it 's required that the sexual molestation was directed towards one or more people . i think the court 's judgement is reasonable . ' the 65-year-old man was initially accused of sexual assault after he pleasured himself on an inland beach at drevviken , near stockholm , sweden . the decision raises questions about whether public masturbation will now be acceptable across sweden , so long as it is not directed at another person . mr vrethammar appeared to think so , ` the district court has made a judgement on this case . with that we can conclude that it is okay to masturbate on the beach . the act may be considered to be disorderly conduct ' he said . sweden , like its scandinavian neighbours , tends to have a more tolerant and sometimes progressive approach to social issues . in the uk , indecent exposure comes under the sexual offences act 2003 . it involves the public display of parts of the anatomy in a manner that may be offensive to others and morally unacceptable . instances brought to court include people exposing themselves in a manner considered indecent and particularly offensive to others on trains , buses and other public areas . masturbation or touching oneself in view of the public in a blatantly sexual manner is covered by the law . the test of decency or otherwise depends on the audience , the community rules and whether or not the exposure is intended to and/or does repel the public . sunbathing for example , in few or even no clothes , is unlikely to cause offence and therefore constitute indecent exposure . if convicted , the most likely penalty is a fine and/or community service rather than a custodial sentence , although indecent exposure can result in a maximum jail term of 24 months , depending on the circumstances . but this landmark ruling raises concerns over the extent to which people will take advantage of the freedom to masturbate with impunity in public . dr liz davies , a reader in child protection at london metropolitan university who has carried out research into sweden 's child protection system , said she thought this ruling was surprising . ` sweden has a really robust child protection system and very rigorous investigation around sexual abuse . ` so this judgement is surprising given that such an act could be witnessed by children as well as adults ' she said . the case comes hot on the heels of a recent similar judgement , in which a 15-year-old boy was acquitted of sexual assault after he threw his underwear into a lake and stood naked in front of two underage girls . both girls had requested the boy be charged with molestation , but the södertörn district court ruled that his behaviour was not of a sexual nature so the charge was dismissed , according to the local . in the uk anyone who masturbates in public or exposes themself in any way faces an indecent exposure charge .", "summary": " man , 65 , acquitted of sexual assault after masturbating on beach .   court ruled he committed no crime since he was not directing his action towards a specific person .   anyone doing the same in the uk would face charge of indecent exposure .
