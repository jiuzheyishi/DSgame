{"text": "havana , cuba -lrb- cnn -rrb- the rattle of ice in a stainless steel shaker heralds the first mojito of the day . it comes courtesy of the award-winning cocktail waitress at waoo ! , a private restaurant run by 41-year-old cuban entrepreneur alain rodriguez .  the recipe for success is maintaining the real taste of cuba , whether that 's in the food and drink or our taste for life ,  he told me . businesses like rodriguez 's are among the most visible examples of economic reforms -- that are fueling small , private enterprise -- already launched by president raul castro . rodriguez , a former sommelier at havana 's famed el nacional hotel , says he set up his own business just over two years ago in a house owned by his cousin and financed with his own savings and some investment from relatives in the united states . now small businesses like his could get substantial new cash injections thanks to measures announced by president barack obama , which came into effect friday . among the changes , it will be easier for americans -- and their spending money -- to come to cuba . cuban authorities and tourism industry experts estimate that could open the door to 1 million u.s. visitors a year , added to the expected 3 million international tourists from other parts of the world . equally significant , the obama administration has approved a four-fold increase in remittances from cuban-americans to their families in cuba and no upper limit on remittances destined to fund small business . unveiling the changes to u.s. trade and travel policy on december 17 , obama said :  we 're calling on cuba to unleash the potential of 11 million cubans by ending unnecessary resistance to their political , social and economic activities .  predictably the decision drew fire from some u.s. republicans who thought the easing of restrictions would put more money into the hands of the cuban government , the united states ' longstanding cold war foe . but perhaps obama 's decision over time could prove to be a backdoor to generating change on the island . u.s. economist milton friedman , a former adviser to president ronald reagan , once said :  economic freedom is an indispensable means to the achievement of political freedom .  now , with obama 's changes , some ordinary cubans could gain higher incomes because they work in the growing tourist sector , could set up private businesses , or could receive higher-value remittances from families in the united states . others may be left behind , unable to make ends meet on meager state-sector wages , currently running around $ 20 a month . as economic divisions are exacerbated , so is the chance of growing political divisions that could ultimately chip away at cuba 's socialist system . restaurant owner rodriguez , however , does n't seem concerned .  if salaries start to rise and more remittances come in , then great . in cuba we do n't pay much attention to who is a first - , second - or third-class citizen . but if that starts to happen we 'll have to see how we deal with it ,  he said . rodriguez is already considering the possibility of new outlets and has patented his waoo ! trade name with a view to possible franchise options . but he is convinced liberalization must be gradual and orderly . he does not favor a free-for-all . he says all his 20 staff are affiliated to the cuban labor federation , ctc , and march in the may day parade to havana 's revolution square . rodriguez is a firm believer that cuban government reforms coupled with a bigger influx of u.s. dollars will not undermine cuban socialism . across havana , at a very different type of private business , nail salon owner indira yero has a very different viewpoint . at 29 she has never worked for the state . she charges around $ 5 as she works quickly but precisely smoothing then painting claw-like acrylic nails . she seems to have a well-established clientele who drop by a side room in her ground floor apartment in old havana . yero expresses very little patience for cuba 's socialist system and perhaps surprisingly is not afraid to speak her mind .  i am one of the capitalist generation . i 've never worked for the state and i believe that the capitalist generation is better than the other ,  she said . until fairly recently , such talk would have run her the risk of being branded a counter-revolutionary by her neighbors . yero is unabashed when she suggests her generation has little time for talk of the cuban revolution .  all that business of fidel and the revolution is a very pretty story but it 's got nothing to do with now ,  she said .  now its different . young people want to go to good places , a disco , an all-expenses paid hotel and with a state salary you just ca n't do that .  above her workstation , yero has scratched a sign into the fluorescent light fitting .  no money . no nail do .  a warning that cuba 's once-cherished dream of forging an egalitarian society may be dimming .", "summary": " cuban entrepreneurs hope u.s.-cuba policy changes mean more chance to make money .   they are confident and say they 're ready for the challenges .
