{"text": "the bureau of meteorology has predicted an el nino weather pattern to strike australia this summer , with irregularly hot and dry weather on the horizon . el nino is a climatic event occurring roughly every five years , which is defined by substantial warming in temperatures of the pacific ocean sea surface . in australia , el nino is characterised by droughts and abnormal heat , particularly in the eastern and coasts of the country , which are already on the grips of a dry spell . this week , the bureau has raised its prediction of an el nino hitting this summer to 70 per cent , up from 50 per cent just two weeks ago . scroll down for video . lake wallace dried up during a drought in australia . this week , the bureau of meteorology has raised its prediction for an el nino this summer to 70 per cent . large crowds visit bondi beach on february 8 , 2009 in sydney . in australia , el nino is characterised by droughts and anomalous heat , particularly in the eastern and southern coasts of the country . countries bordering on the pacific ocean who rely upon agriculture and fishing are the most affected by el nino . when the conditions last for months , fishing industries can be severely damaged . the counterpart to el nino , la nina , sees temperatures cool to lower than average across the pacific ocean , increasing the risk of cyclones and landfalls around the asia pacific region . australia has already had two major heatwaves this spring , while sub-surface temperatures in the central to eastern areas of the pacific are already 4 degrees warmer than average . the event is largely triggered by changes in the pacific ocean . ` we 're seeing very warm temperatures in the tropical pacific ocean , about 1 degree above average , ' said andrew watkins , the bureau 's manager of climate prediction service . ` things seem to have evolved fairly quickly in the last few weeks , ' ` what 's happened is that things have continued to warm up in the tropical pacific ocean rather than stay stagnant , and the central tropical pacific has reached temperatures that are basically at el nino levels now . ' ` this has a strong impact on temperature . october was 2.8 degrees above normal and very dry . we 're seeing similar conditions across southeast asia in malaysia and indonesia . simultaneously , there are floods happening in south america , which is the other side of the coin . ' the event is associated with very wet weather months in april -- october along the coasts of peru and equador , giving rise to serious flooding . mr watkins says the bureau used numerous approaches to reach the conclusion . ` there are five international models which we have used and they come from all over the world ; france , england , america , canada and japan , plus our own model at the bureau , which is called poama . ' andrew watkins -lrb- pictured -rrb- , the bureau 's manager of climate prediction service , says there are five international models which indicate that el nino is on the horizon . a map from the bureau predicting above average temperatures for summer across all of australia . in its latest fortnightly el nino southern oscillation -lrb- enso -rrb- wrap-up , the bom has lifted its enso tracking status from ` watch ' to ` alert ' . ` there is enough going on here that is sensible to raise the odds , raise the threat level , because we do n't want people to go without the best information , ' mr watkins said the last time we saw similar conditions in australia was in 2012 , and the conditions are looking to be more severe this year . according to us weather agencies , 2014 has been the warmest ever april-september period , posing a serious threat that 2014 could be the hottest year on record . at the moment , the warmest year is a tie between 2005 and 2010 . mr watkins warned it can be difficult to classify the event conclusively . ` the reality is that it 's not like flicking a switch . el nino is not a sudden change , but rather a gradual progression , ' he said . ` we are however seeing some telltale signs that these event will be reached by december . ' warmer pacific temperatures combined with cooler seas around northern australia mean there may be fewer tropical cyclones crossing the coast but also fewer tropical rain depressions relied upon by drought-affected farmers in queensland , dr watkins said . ` they have already had a couple of bad wet seasons up there so a third one is not a good situation . ' in 2009/10 there were serious drought conditions across much of eastern australia because of the el nino effect .", "summary": " the bureau of meterology has predicted el nino to arrive this summer .   the event is characterised by droughts and anomalous heat in australia .   we have already seen two major heatwaves this spring .   sub-surface pacific temperatures are four degrees warmer than average .   there is similar conditions in southeast asia and floods in south america .
