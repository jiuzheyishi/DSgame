' chris admits he used to smoke , drink and eat too much and felt his job allowed him to continue his bad habits . chris knew his weight was an issue and . dangerous for his health , but had previously struggled to stick to any . diet that saw him lose significant amounts in the long-term . ` i never had a good relationship with food even as a child - i was a little bit heavy and you get made fun of you say  ok that 's what this is like  . ' using his own high-tech method , chris managed to lose over 9st in a year and a half , dropping from 22st -lrb- left -rrb- to 13st 9lb -lrb- right -rrb- . then came a moment of enlightenment , when he realised he could use his passion for data and technology to tackle his weight . ` everyone needs to understand that the average person touches between 100 to 400 systems a day , whether it 's swiping a credit card or going past a speed camera or using the phone , ' he says . ` when you start to think about what we could do with that information it opens up a world of possibilities . ` i just put that same paradigm onto everything else , like if i 'm tracking my calories i can dig into that data and find out what causes me to eat extra calories . it lets me look at what i did that day , who i saw , how i slept , what i watched , what i listened to . ' chris used his love of data collecting gadgets -lrb- left -rrb- to help him see where he was going wrong in his diet and began to record -lrb- right -rrb- and analyse all aspects of his body and eating habits . chris maintained bad eating habits developed in childhood , and felt his success at his job allowed him to justify his bad habits . chris says he knew he was overweight and hated to look at pictures of himself . chris has earned the nickname of the most quantified human in the world through his job which allows him to test apps and gadgets that collect personal data . chris began by taking pictures of his meals and posting them on instagram to get a clearer picture of where and what he was eating as well as activating geo-tagging on his credit card so he could see where he was splurging on food . using his various gadgets chris is still continuing to lose weight . he also tracked his eating , sleeping and activity patterns , and began setting geographic limits on his credit cards , blocking him from spending at his favourite fast food restaurants or places near his home and work . ` often if you are overweight like i was , the most profound thing you can do is to look at your life in a quantified way . i think all men like puzzles and the more we can understand about ourselves through having a relationship with our own data the more powerful it becomes . ` a good example is that i use systems in my home to track the temperatures and the lighting and what i 've noticed with my own data is that the cooler it is the less i eat . chris 's realisations saw him shed nearly 9st from his 5ft 11in frame , dropping from 22st 1lb to 13st 9lb in a year and a half . ` i am still losing weigh pretty fast but i am also going to the gym now . in the beginning i said i did n't want to do the gym so i used to walk to mcdonalds which was 1.1 mile and then it was kind of a fast walk to subway which is 2.2 miles than it was running and then biking . ' chris says that his high-tech method of weight loss can work for anyone . ` just start with very simple things like being aware of what you are spending on food is often more than enough . ` a lot of grocery stores will offer you club cards and you can ask for the data . ` there is no magic that is going to happen . you are probably not going to wake up tomorrow and start this amazing data journey . what you can do is make a choice that you are okay right now . you can help you - you are your best coach , so just be nice to that person .
