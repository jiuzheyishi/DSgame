{"text": "the internet is becoming a ` dark and ungoverned ' place for paedophiles , murderers and terrorists to safely operate , the commissioner of the metropolitan police has warned . sir bernard hogan-howe has met with law enforcement experts at the headquarters of the new york police department as the levels of cybercrime increases ahead of officers ability to control it . the metropolitan police commissioner said encryption on computers and mobile phones is frustrating police inquiries and leaving parts of the web as ` anarchic places ' . sir bernard hogan-howe has warned that the internet is becoming a ` dark and ungoverned ' place for paedophiles , murderers and terrorists to safely operate and has called on internet companies to do more . he called on communication providers and internet companies to do more to protect the public from the so-called ` deep ' internet . speaking at the conference in the u.s , he said : ` we can not allow parts of the internet - or any communications platform - to become dark and ungoverned space where images of child abuse are exchanged , murders are planned , and terrorist plots are progressed . ` in a democracy we can not accept any space - virtual or not - to become anarchic where crime can be committed without fear . yet this is in danger of happening . ` this is a considered view that is shared by many law enforcement and intelligence professionals both at home and indeed here in the us . ' encryption on computers is frustrating police inquiries and leaving parts of the web as ` anarchic places ' he added : ` privacy is important , but in my view the security of communications methods and devices is growing beyond what any genuine domestic user could reasonably require . ` the levels of encryption and protection that we are seeing in the devices and methods used to communicate are frustrating the efforts of police and intelligence agencies to keep people safe . sir david omand , former gchq director , said that cybercrime is racing ahead and there are not enough detectives with the ability to control it . ` we need an informed , balanced discussion with communications providers to explore what they can do to help us protect the public from serious crime and terrorism . ' last month a former senior civil servant warned that cybercrime was speeding ahead of law enforcers ' ability to control it as the ` dark web ' expanded . sir david omand , a former director of britain 's electronic surveillance agency , gchq , said that law enforcers were trying to police the worst excesses of the internet - as it was used by thieves , fraudsters , terrorists and paedophiles . he told parliament 's intelligence and security committee : ` they are failing , because cybercrime is racing ahead , and the dark web is expanding . ` there are n't enough experienced cyber detectives , the tools for cybercrime can be bought , law enforcement ca n't access the communications data . ' the law enforcers had been forced to look to the intelligence community , which was primarily involved with safeguarding national security , to help protect society from threats of terrorism and criminality . this has lead to a misconception that this amounted to mass surveillance , which was not the case , according to sir omand . the remarks made by sir hogan-howe comes days after the new head of gchq , warned that us technology companies are becoming the ` command and control networks of choice ' for terrorists . robert hannigan said islamic state exploited social media for recruitment and propaganda , using the likes of whatsapp , twitter and youtube to promote beheadings . tor - short for the onion router - is a matrix of encrypted websites that allows users to surf beneath the everyday internet with complete anonymity . it uses numerous layers of security and encryption to render users anonymous online . normally , file sharing and internet browsing activity can be tracked by law enforcement through each user 's unique ip address that can be traced back to an individual computer . the tor network on the deep web hides the ip address and the activity of the user . most of the web 's information is buried far down on dynamically generated sites , unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines - sites or pages do n't exist until created as the result of a specific search . an internet search is like dragging a net across the surface of the sea - a great deal of information is caught , but a majority is deep and therefore missed .", "summary": " sir bernard hogan-howe met with law enforcement experts in new york .   he said encryption on computers and phones is frustrating police inquiries .   police commissioner has warned parts of web are left as ` anarchic places '   he called on internet companies to do more to protect public from dark web .   a former senior civil servant warned cybercrime was speeding ahead of law .   while head of gchq says technology is ` command networks ' for terrorists .
