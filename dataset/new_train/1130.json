{"text": "scientists are constantly on the lookout for links between data to try and prove certain theories - but just because two sets of statistics match up , it does n't necessarily mean they 're are closely tied . to prove a direct correlation does not always mean causation , a harvard student has plotted various spurious links between randomly selected statistics . these include a correlation between sour . cream and motorbike accidents , nicolas cage films and swimming pool deaths , and divorce rates and margarine . to prove that correlation does not always mean causation , a harvard student has plotted various spurious links between randomly selected sets of data from the u.s census . these include a correlation between sour cream and motorbike accidents , pictured . according to the data plotted from the u.s census , tyler vigen 's spurious correlations site found a link between : . the consumption of sour cream , and the number of motorcycle riders killed in accidents . the number of people who tripped over their own two feet and died , with civil engineering doctorates awarded in the u.s. . how much beef is bought in the u.s , compared to the number of deaths caused by lightning . the number of films nicolas cage has starred in , versus the number of people who died falling into a swimming pool . the amount of cheese purchased , and the revenue generated by golf courses . tyler vigen is studying for a juris doctorate at harvard school of law . using data from the u.s census and centres for disease control and prevention research , vigen was able to plot correlations between different subjects . each spurious correlation consists of a graph that plots the development of both chosen statistics . depending on the data , the date range can run from 1999 up to 2012 . below each graph is a chart that shows the numerical statistics , as well as their source , plus the correlation . the closer a correlation is to the number one , the more closely linked the two sets of data are . ` anyone can plainly tell that there 's not a connection between margarine and marriage , ' explained vigen . this graph plots the correlation between people who died by falling out of wheelchairs between 1999 and 2005 , and the rising costs of a 16oz bag of potato chips in the u.s during the same period . the data was taken from the u.s census and centres for disease control and prevention research . ` we saw data , we formed a hypothesis and then we rejected that hypothesis , based on our personal experience with the world . the graphs claim there to be a correlation between the films nicolas cage , pictured , has been in and deaths , driving accidents and divorce rates . that 's a big deal - and it 's a part that computers ca n't do . research is about discovery , but only humans can actually make discoveries . ' the purpose of the spurious correlations site , according to vigen , is not to say data is ambiguous and can be interpreted however people want , ` instead it reveals it 's up to us as rational thinkers to work out if there 's actually a connection between the variables - or if it 's a coincidence . ' ` finding causal mechanisms is the key goal in a lot of scientific research because when we find causal mechanisms , we learn that much more about the world around us . ` sometimes , we see connections that we ca n't explain and it inspires us to search for a potential cause . ' a good example of correlations leading to conclusions is the connection between smoking and lung cancer . in the early 1900s , incidents of lung cancer were on the rise but no-one really knew why . in 1929 , german physician fritz lickint published a paper in which he showed that lung cancer patients were particularly likely to have been smokers . that paper led to a body of research in which scientists learnt about the dangers of smoking - but it may never have happened if someone had n't spotted the links . ` correlations between two variables could be merely coincidence , or they could be the result of an underlying causal link -- and every time we see a correlation , we have the marvellous opportunity to try and figure out which one it is , ' concluded vigen . the purpose of the site , according to vigen , is not to say data is ambiguous , ` instead it reveals it 's up to us as rational thinkers to work out if there 's actually a connection between the variables - or if it 's a coincidence . ' this graph shows a link between nicolas cage films and people who died falling into a swimming pool . between 2000 and 2009 , there was a link between how many people ate eggs in the u.s and the number of drivers killed in non-collision transport accidents . the closer a correlation is to the number one , the more closely linked the two sets of data are . this correlation is 0.88 .", "summary": " the spurious correlations site was created by harvard student tyler vigen .   it plots data from the u.s census and centres for disease control and prevention research .   vigen is also in the process of adding international statistics to the site .   he created it to prove that correlation does not always mean causation .   other correlations include the number of nicolas cage films and people who died in swimming pools , and egg consumption with driving accidents .
