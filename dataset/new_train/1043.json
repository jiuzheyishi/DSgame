{"text": "the chinese boom town of suzhou is about to be put on the map as its iconic new skyscraper is set to be completed after years of construction . the ` gate of the orient ' towers 300m above the city , and many hope it will give suzhou a reputation as a leading global hub . however , others are less enthusiastic about the project - because they point out that it bears a striking resemblance to a giant pair of trousers . iconic ? the gate of the orient towers over the chinese city of suzhou , near shanghai . transformation : the skyscraper is set to make suzhou one of china 's leading cities . the building , designed by british architects rmjm , consists of two towers next to each other which join at the top . it is intended to resemble an arch , making a symbolic gateway into the centre of the city , which is near shanghai in jiangsu province . according to rmjm , ` the project introduces a dramatic iconic  gateway  to the city of suzhou and represents the significance of the china in the world today . ' attraction : but chinese web users have mocked the building for resembling a pair of skyscrapers . anger : some suggest that china has become a playground for western architects with wacky ideas . but chinese commentators have repeatedly mocked the skyscraper , laughing at it because they think it looks like a pair of trousers . last year newspaper shanghai daily asked in a headline , ` is it an arch or just plain pants ? ' and hundreds of users of micro-blog weibo have been quick to ridicule the building , with one writing : ` this should be called the pants of the east , not the gate of the east . ' artist 's impression : when it is completed , the gate of the orient will certainly be striking . others had more serious criticisms - one said the gate of the orient showed that china had become ` the playground of foreign designers with laughable architecture ideas ' . ever since the construction of skyscrapers such as the shanghai world financial centre and beijing 's ` bird 's nest ' stadium , dozens of smaller cities in china have attempted to match the metropolises . however , many have become laughing stocks for their overly ambitious plans , while the country 's economic slowdown could leave many supposedly iconic buildings standing empty for years .", "summary": " ` gate of the orient ' in suzhou will stand 300m high when it is finished .   skyscraper is intended to elevate the city to china 's top ranks .   but web users have mocked the building because it looks like trousers .
