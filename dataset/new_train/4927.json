{"text": "earlier this month formula one 's governing body punished pirelli and mercedes for holding an unsanctioned tire test -- at the british grand prix it was pirelli meting out punishment to the elite racing series . british home hope lewis hamilton lost the lead when the left-rear tire of his mercedes began to unravel on the eighth lap at the demanding silverstone circuit . it was the first of four incidents as ferrari 's felipe massa , toro rosso 's jean-eric vergne and mclaren 's sergio perez also had their races ruined by failures to the exact same tire . hamilton -- and the 130,000 british fans who streamed into silverstone to support the 2008 world champion -- were left counting the cost more than most . his problem handed sebastian vettel the race lead and red bull 's defending world champion marched ominously towards the checkered flag . but there was a final twist -- and a dash of retribution for mercedes -- as vettel 's red bull ground to a halt with 10 laps to go .  we had a gearbox issue ,  said the german , who now leads the championship by 21 points from ferrari 's fernando alonso .  fifth gear broke and it was not possible to carry on . it was quite disappointing to stop and retire .  the mercedes of nico rosberg inherited the lead from vettel and the german , who celebrated his 28th birthday this weekend , raced to his first british gp victory and second of the season .  when seb stopped , i wo n't lie , i was n't disappointed ,  smiled rosberg , winner of the monaco gp .  i definitely feel sorry for the british fans as it would have been a great ace for lewis .  but there were too many tire failures today and they need to look into that .  mark webber , who announced he was retiring from the sport at the end of the year , recovered from a dismal start to claim a brilliant second in his last-ever f1 race on british soil .  the start was a big negative for us and then -lsb- romain -rsb- grosjean touched my front wing at turn one and the race reset from there ,  webber explained .  i pushed very hard to do the business and in the end it was a very , very good result . it 's been a real highlight for me to race at this circuit .  ferrari 's fernando alonso followed the australian home and the spaniard said he considered himself  lucky  to have avoided the tire issues that hit other drivers .  it was a lucky race for us ,  said alonso .  we recovered some points but we need to raise our game as our pace is not good enough .  there was some world-class racing in the final laps . hamilton fought his way back through the field to finish fourth ahead of lotus driver kimi raikkonen , who is nine points ahead of the briton in the championship . rosberg reprimand . but regardless of the driving drama , tire failures dominated the fall-out from the british race -- even vettel 's first retirement in 12 months seemed to dip under the radar . in the immediate aftermath of the race , pirelli responded to serious safety concerns as the drivers questioned whether they were pushing themselves and their cars to the limit in safe conditions .  someone could 've crashed ,  said hamilton .  i was thinking behind the safety car that it 's only when someone gets hurt that something will be done about it .  massa , who was running in fourth before his tire failure , added :  what happened is unacceptable .  it was very dangerous for all of the 22 drivers racing . in order for us to race we can not have these problems . they need to do something for our safety .  in a short media conference after the race , pirelli motorsport director paul hembery explained :  today was n't foreseen . we 've seen a different type of problem .  we are still doing our analysis so we have to go away and understand what 's happened and get to the core of the issue . we take these things seriously . it was one tire , the left rear . when we have the answer we 'll let you know .  pirelli had wanted to introduce a new tire construction at the canadian grand prix earlier this month but failed to get all the teams to agree to the change at a meeting in monaco . the weakness of the tires had been masked in montreal but the high-speed nature of the silverstone circuit in the heart of england brutally exposed their frailties .  pirelli appeared to come up with a solution with a different construction and that was being offered from montreal ,  said red bull 's chief technical officer adrian newey .  two or three teams vetoed that because they were worried it would suit other teams more than them and because of that short-sightedness we have f1 putting on the worrying performance it did today and concerns over driver safety .  the sport 's governing body , the fia , are coming under pressure to force through a change in tires with or without the consent of the teams . as a result , the issue is due to be on the agenda at a meeting of the sporting working committee on wednesday ahead of the german grand prix with pirelli invited to attend by the fia . later sunday rosberg was subsequently handed a reprimand after the race for failing to reduce his speed under yellow flags , which are waved to warn drivers to slow down , but no further sanction was imposed .", "summary": " nico rosberg wins british grand prix for first time .   mark webber fights back from poor start to take seccond .   ferrari 's fernando alonso finished third .   championship leader sebastian vettel retires due to gearbox problems .
