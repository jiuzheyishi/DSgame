{"text": "it 's about making an entrance . dramatic entries are a given with air travel , and airports should convey a sense of welcome and arrival to travelers landing in a new city , like the great train stations of yesteryear , says architecture critic paul goldberger . that does n't usually happen .  an inspiring grand welcome to a place is not something you get in most of them ,  says goldberger , contributor to vanity fair , winner of the pulitzer prize for his architecture criticism at the new york times and author of  why architecture matters .   most only aspire to a sense of efficiency and most do n't even achieve that .  where they exist at airports , the more impressive spaces are usually located in the airports ' departure halls . those passengers are rushing to clear security and catch flights and do n't have time to appreciate their space . the arrivals hall usually does n't inspire much . check in : world 's best airport hotels .  when you arrive , you 're shunted to a lower level to baggage claim and go through what feels like a service -lrb- exit -rrb- ,  says goldberger , who regularly flies through new york and new jersey 's bustling but not very beautiful airports . although most airports do n't meet his wish for a  grand welcome  -- even the ones he likes -- some architects are designing lovely airports that are worth admiring . here are some of the airport designs goldberger has appreciated or is hankering to see for himself . madrid-barajas airport -lrb- spain -rrb- . the design by architect richard rogers for barajas ' terminal 4 , completed in 2006 , is one of goldberger 's favorites .  he took what is really a conventional plan , and he did a traditional airport beautifully ,  he says . rogers ' elegant architecture includes  magnificent steel tresses and columns , and a very long concourse that gradually changes colors ,  says goldberger .  the colors fade over the course of what must be half a mile . it 's quite breathtaking .  beijing capital international airport -lrb- china -rrb- . sir norman foster has been  more successful than anyone else at rethinking the airport and designing it in a new way that pretty much works ,  says goldberger . foster 's international terminal design in beijing was completed in 2008 in time for that summer 's olympic games . instead of a stretched-out layout or satellite terminals , terminal 3  is essentially two huge triangular shapes , where the points face each other and are connected by a train ,  he says .  that works quite well and is attractive .  5 great get-fit retreats . kansai international airport -lrb- osaka , japan -rrb- . architect renzo piano 's most remarkable achievement in this case may have been winning a design competition in 1988 for an airport that would sit on a man-made island that did not yet exist . located 25 miles away from osaka , japan -lrb- and three miles off the coast -rrb- , kansai airport was completed in 1994 and can handle air traffic 24 hours per day . the island is now connected to the mainland by a 2.5 mile-long , two-level bridge . the airport is lovely , but  it 's more the achievement than the architecture itself ,  says goldberger . king abdulaziz international airport -lrb- jeddah , saudi arabia -rrb- . completed in 1981 , skidmore , owing and merrill 's design of the hajj terminal in jeddah seems to capture the essence of saudi arabia 's nomadic tradition . the firm developed tent-like structures using little energy to keep the space cool in the desert . pictures of the terminal impressed goldberger , which is why it 's on his bucket list as an airport to visit .  jeddah seems like a fascinating attempt to marry the nomadic tradition of desert tents with monumental modern architecture ,  says goldberger .  a seeming impossibility , but i think they pulled it off .  world 's best airport spas . raleigh-durham international airport -lrb- north carolina -rrb- . often overlooked as an example of good airport architecture , raleigh-durham international airport 's terminal 2 was designed by fentress architects of denver and completed in 2011 . inspired by its southern roots and its service to the research triangle hub of companies and universities ,  it 's a terminal that has a lot of wood and glass inside , a nice alternative to steel and glass ,  says goldberger . aeropuerto de carrasco -lrb- montevideo , uruguay -rrb- . seeking to modernize and expand the airport serving uruguay 's capital , airport operators turned to native son and world renowned architect rafael vinoly . completed in 2009 , the carrasco airport 's structure seems inspired by the rolling dunes along the country 's coastline . the design is intriguing to goldberger , which is why the carrasco airport is also on his list of airports to experience .  i 've wanted to see uruguay because vinoly 's swooping shape looks wonderful in photographs ,  says goldberger .  it looks like something inspired by eero saarinen 's design  for trans world airlines at john f. kennedy international airport -lrb- then called idlewild airport -rrb- . airlines collect $ 27 billion beyond ticket revenue . twa terminal -lrb- john f. kennedy international airport , new york -rrb- . it 's not in use anymore , but goldberger says it still stands out as an architectural marvel . -lrb- maybe if it was still open , goldberger would like flying out of john f. kennedy international airport better . -rrb- . designed by eero saarinen and opened in 1962 , this gorgeous terminal had a significant flaw : it was n't built to change and grow with the growth of travel and the enormous aircraft that would soon come to idlewild airport , now jfk international .  it was one of the great airport designs of all time , and it was completely unworkable for security and the volume of traffic -lrb- to come -rrb- ,  says goldberger .  it remains a beautiful and incredibly inspiring building .  matteo pericoli mural -lrb- john f. kennedy international airport , new york -rrb- . no , this does n't mean goldberger likes flying out of the american airlines terminal where this mural is located . italian architect and artist matteo pericoli was commissioned to paint a mural of the great architecture of the world on a wall at the american terminal . so while goldberger is n't crazy about the airport , the mural  is one of my favorite things at any airport .  a pleasant experience matters , too . when goldberger is trying to get from one city to another , sometimes his requirements for a nice airport are the same as anyone else . at the last minute , that 's why he also tacked on these  fairly ordinary terminals that are nevertheless pleasanter to be in than the norm  : san francisco international airport 's newly redone terminal 2 and the jetblue airways terminal at john f. kennedy international airport in new york .  lots of light , nice places to eat , wide-open spaces , views of -lrb- the -rrb- field , places to work , rest , etc. ,  he wrote , via e-mail .  great architecture is n't always necessary to raise an airport above mediocrity .  what 's
