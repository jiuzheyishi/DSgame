{"text": "iran 's top leader furiously told washington ` the hell with you ' following u.s. criticism over the openness of the islamic republic 's presidential contest . ali hosseini khamenei , the supreme leader of iran , issued the stinging rebuke after casting his ballot in a race widely criticised in the west as being rigged in favour of tehran 's ruling system . the vote will bring an end to the eight-year era of the combative president mahmoud ahmadinejad , whose 2009 . re-election was steeped in controversy . many critics said it was the result of systematic fraud in vote counting after the reformist green movement was . brutally crushed . angry : iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei blasted the u.s. for its criticism of today 's presidential election as he cast his ballot today . the election race has taken unexpected turns in the past days as reform-minded iranians surge behind the only moderate of the six candidates . a victory by former nuclear negotiator hasan rowhani would be seen as a small setback for iran 's islamic establishment . candidates seen as hard-line loyalists include current nuclear negotiator saeed jalili and khamenei adviser ali akbar . velayati . recent comments by khamenei were . interpreted as support for jalili , whose reputation is further enhanced . by a battlefield injury during the 1980-88 war with then u.s.-backed . iraq that cost him the lower part of his right leg . khamenei , however , has not publicly endorsed a successor for . ahmadinejad , who had a spectacular falling out with the theocracy over . his attempts to challenge khamenei 's near-absolute powers . the ayatollah did not reveal who he was voting for when he cast his ballot today . voting : presidential candidate saeed jalili , centre , casts his ballot during the iranian presidential election today . but he used the occasion to issue his stinging criticism to the u.s. for its repeated criticism of iran 's . clampdowns on the opposition and the rejection of rafsanjani and other . moderate voices from the ballot . ` recently . i have heard that a u.s. security official has said they do not accept . this election , ' khamenei was quoted by state tv after casting his vote . ` ok , the hell with you . ' in . washington on yesterday , state department spokesman jen psaki said . that while the u.s. does not think the iranian election process is . transparent , it is not discouraging the iranian people from voting . ` we . certainly encourage them to , ' psaki said . ` but certainly the history . here and what happened just four years ago gives all of us pause . ' moderate : presidential candidate hassan rowhani shows his identification before casting his vote . after . voting , rafsanjani said he hoped the election would lead to ` national . unity , a requirement for success against any domestic and foreign . risks . ' if no candidate wins an outright majority , a runoff pitting the two top finishers would take place june 21 , so even a strong showing by rowhani in today 's voting could be overturned . rowhani 's backers , such as former president akbar hashemi rafsanjani - who was blocked from running by iran 's ruling system - have urged reformists and others to cast ballots and abandon plans to boycott the election in protest over years of arrests and pressure . iran 's security networks now appear to have blanket control , ranging from swift crackdowns on any public dissent to cybercops blocking opposition internet websites and social media . yet other cracks are evident . combative : today 's vote brings an end to the eight-year era of president mahmoud ahmadinejad . western sanctions over iran 's nuclear program have pummeled the economy by shrinking vital oil sales and leaving the country isolated from international banking systems . new u.s. measures taking effect july 1 further target the country 's currency , the rial , which has lost half its foreign exchange value in the past year , driving prices of food and consumer goods sharply higher . such concerns could have a direct effect on the outcome of the election . tehran 's mayor , mohammad bagher qalibaf , is widely viewed as a capable fiscal manager and could draw in votes , since economic affairs are among the direct responsibilities of iran 's president . other key issues , such as the nuclear program , defense and foreign relations , are all fully controlled by the khamenei , his inner circle and its protectors , led by the powerful revolutionary guard . the other candidates permitted on the ballot by election overseers are seen as hard-line loyalists , including current nuclear negotiator saeed jalili and khamenei adviser ali akbar velayati . such insiders in the presidency would give iran 's leadership a seamless front with significant challenges ahead , such as the possible resumption of nuclear talks with the u.s. and other world powers and the increasing showdown in syria between rebels and the iranian-backed regime of bashar assad . yesterday , the white house said it would begin sending arms to syrian rebel fighters after intelligence officials concluded assad 's forces used chemical weapons . but there also are clear chances that the election could leave iran further divided . rowhani 's rapid rise from longshot to reformist hopeful - aided by endorsements from artists and activists - has shown the resilience of iran 's opposition despite relentless crackdowns . a defeat could leave them even more embittered and alienated . at final rallies , rowhani 's supporters . waved his campaign 's signature purple - a clear nod to the single-color . identity of the now-crushed green movement and its leader , mir hossein . mousavi , who has been under house arrest for more than two years . important : an iranian woman casts her vote in the first round of the presidential election at a polling station in tehran today . on wednesday , the last day of campaigning , thousands of supporters welcomed rowhani in the northeastern city of mashhad yelling : ` long live reforms . ' some rowhani backers also have used the campaign events to chant for the release of mousavi and other political prisoners , including former parliament speaker mahdi karroubi , leading to some arrests and scuffles with police . rowhani is far from a radical outsider , though . he led the influential supreme national security council and was given the highly sensitive nuclear envoy role in 2003 , a year after iran 's 20-year-old atomic program was revealed . but he is believed to favor a less confrontational approach with the west and would give a forum for now-sidelined officials such as rafsanjani and former president mohammad khatami , whose reformist terms from 1997-2005 opened unprecedented social and political freedoms that have since been largely rolled back . helping out : an iranian boy places his mother 's voting slip in a ballot box at a polling station . it was unclear how much the boycott calls by reformists could cut into the turnout among iran 's estimated 50 million voters , which was reported at 85 percent four years ago . in tehran , lines were seen at various polling stations . state tv also showed video of voting queues in various cities . journalists were under wide-ranging restrictions limiting movement around the country . iran does not permit outside election observers . ali akbar nategh nouri , a close adviser to khamenei , predicted there would be no need for a runoff round next friday . but iran 's interior minister , mostafa mohammad najjar , dismissed ` any speculation before ending the vote counting ' by his office . outside iran , votes were casts by the country 's huge diaspora including dubai , london and points across the united states .", "summary": " ali khamenei issued the rebuke after casting his ballot in presidential contest .   u.s. claimed the election has been rigged in favour of tehran 's .   ruling system .
