' it is understood the teaching of british values is likely to include ` challenging negative attitudes and stereotypes ' . children will also be taught how to take turns and share and the difference between right and wrong . the announcement comes in the wake of the recent ` trojan horse ' scandal , a hardline muslim plot to take over primary and secondary state schools in birmingham . mrs morgan hopes the rules will come into effect in the new year following a consultation in september . ofsted will inspect early years providers on promoting of fundamental british values . the proposals are designed to bring nurseries into line with similar tough measures in schools . it is the first time the government has warned that toddlers could be at risk from extremist views . mrs morgan is said to be worried about the risks of nurseries linked to radical mosques run by islamic hardliners . there are also concerns within government that councils need more power to respond if there are allegations of extremist views . the announcement follows a consultation on local authority early years funding arrangements . operation trojan horse , was an apparent plot by muslim fundamentalists to take over schools in the birmingham city council , pictured , area . there are currently no explicit rules that allow local authorities , which provide funding to nurseries that meet ofsted requirements , to stop funding churches or mosques with extremist views . however , it is understood there is no concrete intelligence of any individual nurseries needing immediate action . a mysterious letter which described ` operation trojan horse ' -- an apparent plot by muslim fundamentalists to take over birmingham 's schools -- sparked a series of school inspections in the city . it was passed to the council , head teachers , unions and media outlets , sparking four separate investigations . purportedly written as a guide for fellow hardliners in bradford , the unsigned and undated letter itself is now viewed as an elaborate hoax . however , ofsted found evidence of an ` organised campaign ' to change the character of some schools , while calling for further investigation of others . it inspected 21 schools in the city , concluding a ` culture of intimidation ' had developed in some . five schools were placed in special measures : golden hillock school , nansen primary school and park view academy -- all run by the park view educational trust -lrb- pvet -rrb- , as well as oldknow academy and saltley school . a sixth , alston primary , was already in special measures . takeover plot : park view school in birmingham was at the centre of the allegations . the so-called trojan horse plot first came to light earlier this year . department for education inspectors were ordered into park view school in birmingham along with its sister schools , golden hillock and nansen , after a letter dubbed ` trojan horse ' - now thought to be a hoax - was uncovered . it allegedly outlined a plot by muslim hardliners to drive moderate headteachers out of schools . whistleblowers at park view have claimed the school is in the hands of a group of extremists who infiltrated the governing body . it is alleged girls at the school were forced to sit at the back of the classroom and non-muslim pupils forced to teach themselves at the state school . the letter prompted separate ongoing investigations by both the department for education -lrb- dfe -rrb- and ofsted in to the school and several others in the area . police , the government and school inspectors are thought to be investigating alleged attempts by radicals to seize control of 20 schools in the city after claims of plot emerged in march . the dfe has also appointed its own education commissioner , the former head of the metropolitan police 's counter-terrorism unit peter clarke for the investigation . yesterday , six schools at the centre of an alleged islamist takeover plot are facing radical reform and even closure after being officially judged as failing , it emerged last night . a three-month inquiry has found the birmingham schools did too little to protect children from extremism and female staff were intimidated . one of the six , golden hillock , was rated ` inadequate ' in every criteria . a leaked copy of its ofsted report says ` staff views are polarised ' about leadership and that sex and relationships education has not been delivered properly . however , three were today given ` outstanding ' or ` good ' results by the education watchdog .", "summary": " nicky morgan will warn toddlers must be protected from extremists .   will say they will be taught fundamental british values in an appropriate way .   proposals will also see nurseries that teach creationism will have funding cut .   announcement comes in the wake of the recent ` trojan horse ' operation .   plot was by hardline muslims to take over state schools in birmingham .
