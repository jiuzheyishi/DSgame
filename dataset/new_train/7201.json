{"text": "ryan ferguson was 21 when he sentenced to 40 years in prison for a murder his friend chuck erikson had implicated him in , despite erikson not remembering any details of the night in question . the only evidence that linked ferguson to the murder of a sports editor , found strangled in his office car park in columbia , missouri , was testimony from two witnesses who have since recanted their statements under oath . but despite the appeals and extensive campaigns spearheaded by ferguson 's father , bill , and documentary on cbs 's 48 hours , the young man remains in prison for a crime he vehemently denies being involved in . appeal : ryan ferguson has always denied that he was involved in the murder of kent heitholt . two years after columbia daily tribune sports editor kent heitholt was discovered strangled to death by his own belt in the early hours of november 1 , 2001 , erikson told police he believed he was involved . he told police the pair , who had been 17 at the time , had been drinking underage at a nearby bar and that he could not remember what happened on the night in question . after reading a newspaper article about the murder he became convinced he was involved , saying that a photo fit of a man seen near the scene looked like him . in his police interviews erikson , who was a drug user , was unable to give details of the crime , wrongly stating that heitholt had been strangled by a shirt , or a bungee cord , before the detective questioning him tells erikson it was a belt . he claimed however , that he struck the editor once , before ferguson strangled him . ` the police threatened me to implicate ferguson or else i would be solely responsible for heitholt 's death and be charged with first-degree murder and possibly sentenced to death , ' erickson said in an affidavit . confess : a mug shot of chuck erikson , right , who said he was involved after seeing a photofit , right , in a paper . memory loss : chuck erikson , who says he can not remember the night of the murder , recently retracted his statement that ryan ferguson was involved . despite fingerprints , a bloody footprint and other evidence found at the scene not matching erikson or ferguson , police arrested the young men . ` everything is wrong about this case , . everything 's wrong about it . it makes absolutely no sense , ' kathleen . zellner , who is working of ferguson 's appeal , told the court . ferguson has denied being involved in the case , throughout his arrest , trial and seven appeals . he stated to police that on the night heitholt was killed , he and erikson had gone to a bar and then he drove them home . when his latest appeal was denied , ferguson told cbs : ' i just sat in this room by myself . and . just stared at the floor ... and it 's frustrating because you do n't know , . even with all the facts , if you 'll ever get your life back . ' the appeal last year centered around the two witnesses who had implicated ferguson both admitting they lied . tribute : victim kent heitholt was the sports editor at the columbia daily tribune and a father of two . crime scene : the sports editor was leaving his office after 2am when he was strangled in the car park . erikson , who is serving a . 25-year-sentence , is now saying that although he still has no memory of . the night in question , he believes he acted alone . tribune janitor jerry trump , who said . he saw the young men at the scene , also later admitted under oath that . he had falsely identified them from a picture he was shown . in his police interview , erikson said : ' i could just be fabricating it all and not know . this is after reading the newspaper article in october and this is kinda what i put together with what could 've happened . ' he went on to say : ` from there on i 'm just presuming what happened . i 'm making presumptions based on what i read in the newspaper . ' according to the columbia daily tribune , a key witness who was the last person to see the victim alive , was never thoroughly investigated . fellow sportswriter michael boyd had left the office the same time as heitholt , who was married with two children . he says that he drove off before heitholt . the 1991 blue oldsmobile he was driving that night was never searched , and he traded it shortly afterwards . police have never been able to trace it . a forensic pathologist , dr larry blum , has examined evidence from the trial for ms zellner , cbs said . he claims that the tire tool erikson said he used to beat his victim did not fit the injuries . he added that the struggle lasted between six to eight minutes , meaning mr boyd put himself at the scene very close to the time . the crime was reported . according to cbs mr boyd said he left the car park at about 2.20 am , . only six minutes before 911 was called . campaign : ryan ferguson , left , with his father bill and sister , kelly , who are trying to have him released . mr boyd , who has always cooperated with investigators and denied having anything to do with the crime , told 48 hours that he returned to . the car park later that night after hearing about the murder . ferguson 's family and lawyer continue to fight for the young man 's conviction to be overturned . ` i 've always felt that the system works , ' ms zellner said , as she explained her determination to have him freed . ` he is absolutely innocent . ... i do n't want to be part of a system that can not recognize and correct an error .
