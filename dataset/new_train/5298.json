' the local authorities insisted temporary staff are needed to cover sickness and vacancies in the short-term . but claire wymald , unison branch secretary for southend , said : ` it is a concern for us that this work has been carried out through temporary staff when it could have been done through normal staff . ` there could have been quite a few jobs that could have been saved if the council had not been expending on these interim posts . ` there is n't really any evidence on the contrary that this benefits the council long term , so why do n't they retain staff instead ? ' a basildon council spokesman said : ` we employ over 1,000 staff , the vast majority of whom are contracted on either fixed term or permanent contracts . ` however it is sometimes necessary to employ a small number of interim staff to fill critical posts that require staffing immediately whilst a recruitment process is undertaken , to fill posts that are hard to recruit to , or to manage planned absences . ` we currently only have four interim positions , and it must be remembered that these posts would still incur a cost to the council if they were covered by contracted staff . ' basildon , southend and essex county council are being paid up to # 800-a-day , costing # 8million-a-year . both basildon and southend councils said that short-term staff do not get sick pay or paid leave . southend council 's sue goodwin said : ` we use interim managers for a range of purposes across the council but we do try to use them sparingly . ` interims are only commissioned to provide essential specialist advice and support if the council does not have the expertise in-house . ` the council has been working proactively to manage its use of interims and over recent years we have used a very limited number of interim managers , primarily to cover for vacancies in critical posts or where we have gone through significant change . ' essex county council said temps helped with the council 's cost cutting programme . a said : ` ecc has completed the first part of an ambitious programme of transformation , we have saved # 360m as a result . ` this has meant we have needed additional professional expertise and capacity in the short term in order to achieve this . ` interim staff can be a cost-effective way of accessing professional expertise in relation to short-term or one-off pieces of work and helps the council complete complex projects for which we have no or insufficient in-house capacity or capability . ` rigorous controls are in place around the recruitment of these staff , who are recruited for short periods of time in the main for less than three months .
