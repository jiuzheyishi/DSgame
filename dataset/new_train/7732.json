{"text": "ministers tried to justify the alleged rendition and torture of a key libyan politician by portraying him as a terrorist linked to al qaeda , it was claimed last night . the government is said to have made the allegation as part of its defence in a torture case brought by abdel hakim belhadj , the military leader who liberated tripoli from colonel gaddafi 18 months ago . the damaging claim comes just days after prime minister david cameron paid a surprise visit to the libyan capital in an attempt to shore up relations between the uk and libya . in the legal documents , seen by the mail on sunday , the government calls mr belhadj the ` emir ' or global leader of the libyan islamic fighting group -lrb- lifg -rrb- , which it says is a terrorist organisation . abdul hakem belhaj , the commander of the rebel forces in tripoli , libya , insists he has no links to al qaeda and is suing the uk government for authorising his torture . mr belhadj is bringing a multi - million-pound claim against the government over his rendition when he was arrested in thailand and handed over to gaddafi in 2004 . in the documents , ministers appear to justify the alleged torture of mr belhadj and his then pregnant wife , who claim they were abducted , chained , hooded and beaten . the government alleges : ` in the mid-1990s , the group claimed responsibility for a number of terrorist attacks in libya . ' it adds : ` at all material times mi6 assessed that elements of the lifg supported and had links with al qaeda . ' last night , mr belhadj rejected the claims and accused the government of wasting taxpayers ' money on blackening his name . his lawyer , sapna malik , said : ` mr belhadj has always denied that he was aligned to al qaeda and maintains that the focus of the lifg under his command was the removal of gaddafi . ' she added : ` whatever someone 's alleged conduct , this does not make their torture lawful or allow those complicit in their torture off the hook . it would be alarming if the government were to suggest otherwise . ' the court documents show that the government , former foreign secretary jack straw and former mi6 head of counter-terrorism sir mark allen , want mr belhadj 's case struck out because his claims are covered by the official secrets act . they all deny the torture and rendition allegations . the papers also reveal that mr straw and the coalition are prepared to make more claims against mr belhadj as the case progresses to trial . mr belhadj says british intelligence officers also provided libyan interrogators with questions to ask their captives and flew to tripoli to interview the detainees in jail . he also says mi6 alerted libyan intelligence to his and his family 's whereabouts . colonel gaddafi was killed in 2011 . mr belhadj , who played a key role in his assassination , insists he is not a terrorist . he also refers to a letter from sir mark to gaddafi 's then head of security , moussa koussa , which said : ` i congratulate you on the safe arrival of -lsb- belhadj -rsb- . this was the least we could do for you and for libya . i know i did not pay for the air cargo -lsb- but -rsb- the intelligence -lsb- on him -rsb- was british . ' cori crider , from the human rights charity reprieve , said : ` the public interest now lies in getting to the full truth about this sordid episode . ' l an afghan spy who fled to the uk after being exposed as a secret agent working for the cia is to be sent back to afghanistan , where he says he faces execution by the taliban . the 36-year-old male , who can be identified only as ms , left afghanistan after his cover was blown in an afghan newspaper , and his brother , also an agent , was murdered by the taliban . the uk government claim he is no longer a ` priority ' for taliban death squads . last week , the court of appeal backed the home office , paving the way for his deportation within weeks .", "summary": " libyan abdel hakim belhadj ` wrongly linked to al qaeda '   he insists he is no terrorist and is bringing lawsuit against britain .   row comes days after cameron visits libya on ` bridge-building ' mission .
