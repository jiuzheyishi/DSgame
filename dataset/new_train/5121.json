{"text": "most of us have an old pc lying around , which , until now , may be destined for the scrap heap . but as nvidia 's ben berraondo explains , for a modest sum , this humble unit can be turned into a powerful games machine - making it a very affordable alternative to aging mainstream consoles . ` you do n't need a gruffalo-esque pc to enjoy games looking their best , ' he says . stunning : graphics on consoles are limited to their hardware , but pcs offer sharper images with heaps more detail and longer draw distances . ` in fact , more often than not , it can take just one small upgrade to your old family pc and bring full high definition pc gaming goodness to your home . that upgrade is the graphics card . ' one big advantage on playing games on pc is that games will have much better graphics . advancements in graphics card technology means where console graphics are limited to their hardware , pc graphics have continued to improve . assassin 's creed 3 , for example runs on direct x 11 - resulting in anti-aliasing technology , higher-resolution textures and draw distances . the beauty is in the detail : this screenshot shows how anti-aliasing works on an image . notice the jagged lines of the first picture . in the second , multi-sample anti-aliasing is used , improving image quality . the third shows temporal anti-aliasing , developed to give ` movie-style ' quality to images . anti-aliasing removes jagged lines , and helps smooth edges , while tessellation allows for environments and objects to have greater surface detail . thankfully , changing the graphics card is remarkably easy . ` simply slide off the pc side-cover -lrb- many do n't even have screws nowadays -rrb- and find your pci-e slot - do n't worry about the name , it 's either going to be empty or have a graphics card already in there , ' explains ben . ` take the old card out -lrb- if one is already in there -rrb- , plug in your shiny new card , close up your pc , turn it on and point your web browser to www.geforce.co.uk . looking their best : for those considering an aging current gen console , likely to be replaced by newer models next year , an upgraded pc may be a better investment . nvidia will even help you automatically find your right drivers -lrb- these are what makes the graphics work -rrb- and then you 're all set and ready to ` press start ' ! graphics cards range in price and performance and can work out a lot cheaper than a buying a mainstream console . ` as a minimum i 'd go for around # 100 which will get you an nvidia geforce gtx 650 ti , taking you to another level if you 're used to an xbox 360 or a ps3 , ' says ben . ` going a bit further up to # 160 will get you a geforce gtx 660 which will enable you to ramp up all the settings to  high  to get even better visuals . ' ` finally , if you can stretch to # 230 , you 'll be able to get a geforce gtx 660 ti -- this means silky smooth games at over  1080p  -- full hd resolution . ` if you 've bought your pc in the past 3 or 4 years then you should be ready to go . ' sound investment : even with a # 100 graphics card , you 'll notice a much cleaner , sharper image . there are other graphics cards from other developers available , too . amd , another giant in the graphics market , have their radeon series , with the 6450 , 6570 and 6670 . prices vary depending on performance , although most now support direct x 11 . a radeon hd 5850 may be a slightly older card -lrb- and does not support direct x 11 -rrb- , but still delivers strong graphics in games such as crysis - a title renowned for setting the bench mark for visuals . coming in at just over # 100 , this is a viable alternative . there may be some other factors to consider , too . if your pc is older , then you may need to upgrade the power supply , motherboard and cooling system to deal with the new graphics card . while , given the fact that pcs are capable of displaying images at varying resolutions , a monitor upgrade may be needed if you 're to get optimum visual quality . lastly , ram -lrb- or random access memory -rrb- is used to store the game 's information , with many games stating a minimum amount . more ram can be added , and you 'll likely see an increase in performance . given that current gen console successors are likely to be announced later next year , a pc upgrade could be a sound investment . however , if your pc is too old , buying a new one may still work out cheaper in the long run . although it will be slightly more expensive than buying a console this christmas , it 's likely to ` future-proof ' your hardware to deal with the demanding 2013 games line-up - proving cheaper than shelling out for both existing and future consoles . for more information visit : . http://www.scan.co.uk/shops/nvidia/gamingpcguide?utm_source=nvdailymail&utm_medium=nvidiaarticle&utm_campaign=nvdiypc . follow talal on twitter : @talalmusa and on facebook : daily mail games .", "summary": " simple graphics card upgrade can ` create pc with better graphics than current gen consoles '   benefit from improved textures , frame rate and draw distances - making games look their absolute best .   aging consoles are due an upgrade , with new xbox and ps3 likely to be announced sometime next year .
