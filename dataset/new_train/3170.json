{"text": "students today backed a petition calling on their university union to cancel a ` sexist ' comedian 's gig . self-described ` proper lad ' dapper laughs - real name daniel o'reilly - is due to bring his socially unacceptable tour to the cardiff university students ' union , y plas -lrb- the place -rrb- , in february . however , a petition demanding the union cancel the londoner 's gig because of his ` trivialisation of rape , unprotected sex and dehumanising of women ' has amassed almost 500 signatures in two days . ` proper lad ' : comedian dapper laughs , real name daniel o'reilly , is currently on his socially unacceptable tour . on the street : dapper laughs came to fame for his online videos where he gives ` lad advice on romancing the ladies and being a geezer ' . this still is from a vine video entitled ` compliments are key ' it states ` misogynistic humour should not be supported by an organisation that stands for equality ' . petition organiser vicky chandler , 21 , a final-year journalism student , said : ` dapper laughs is that bloke that every woman knows who dresses up sexism as banter . ' ` his jokes are so disrespectful to women and giving him a tv show and letting him perform at the university is normalising inappropriate behaviour . ' dapper laughs , who hails from clapham , south-west london , came to fame for his online videos where he gives ` lad advice on romancing the ladies and being a geezer ' . he now has his own programme on itv2 called on the pull and has been accused of being a misogynist and encouraging men to harass women in public . future date : the london comedian is due to perform at cardiff university students ' union , y plas -lrb- the place -rrb- . ` lad ' : this still is from a vine video showing dapper laughs handing a beer to a london marathon runner . in his videos , which are peppered with very explicit language , he can be seen yelling sexual comments at women on the street or from his car as he drives past . last year , cardiff university students ' union voted to implement an ` anti-lad culture policy ' to stamp out behaviour that encouraged ` gender , sexuality and rape-based humour ' . and miss chandler said : ` i think it is massively hypocritical for the students ' union to allow him to come and play here when he embodies everything that is wrong about lad culture . ` every time i go on a night out someone shouts at me or touches me . we need to do more to change the sexist culture at university . we need to make the university a safe place for women . ' comments posted on the petition include one from andy williams , saying : ` this guy would be a joke himself if his stuff was n't so insidious and damaging . it 's not ok to victimise women like this , and it 's massively exploitative to make a living out of rape jokes and sexism . it 's not innocent  banter  , it 's just offensive . ' making a stand : a petition demanding the union cancel the londoner 's gig because of his ` trivialisation of rape , unprotected sex and dehumanising of women ' has amassed almost 500 signatures in two days . dapper laughs is one of the most successful comedians on mobile video app vine , which distributes six-second clips playing on a loop . after starting out as a performer on cruise ships , he now has more than 500,000 followers on vine and over a million facebook fans , as well as his own show on itv2 and a popular live tour . however , critics have repeatedly accused dapper laughs of sexism , arguing that his ` laddish ' humour relies on treating women as objects who should only be seen as sexual conquests . one reviewer of his tv show described his style of comedy as ` unpleasant sexism dressed up as banter ' , pointing to a scene in which he tells men they should not make friends with women because it reduces their chance of a one-night stand with them . his short videos repeatedly revolve around him advising men how to get no-strings sex , or feature him accosting women in the streets . however , defenders saying that dapper laughs is nothing more than a comic persona for daniel o'reilly , claiming that any sexism in his jokes is intended to be ironic . caroline hodges added : ` i can not believe that an su -lsb- students ' union -rsb- that is so concerned about not encouraging lad culture that it completely rebranded one of its club nights would allow such a disgusting misogynist act to perform in it . ` dapper laughs trivialises rape , objectifies women and encourages other men to do the same . we should not be providing him with a platform on which to express his warped views . ' students ' union president elliot howells said dapper laughs had been booked to play their y plas venue by an external promoter and had not been vetted by the organisation . he added : ` we did n't choose to have this person come to our venue and this situation has highlighted a gap in our policies - and as a result we will be reviewing them to make sure something like this does n't happen again . ` we are also looking into options to address the petition . we operate an anti-lad culture policy at our events and are committed to making the university a safe place for all students . ' dapper laughs is also visiting manchester , london , newcastle , glasgow , liverpool , leeds , birmingham and oxford before performing in cardiff on february 22 . following that gig he will also play in bristol , bournemouth , leicester and nottingham . however , none of his other forthcoming dates are at university or union venues . a spokesman for dapper laughs did not immediately return a request for comment from mailonline .", "summary": " ` proper lad ' dapper laughs due in cardiff on socially unacceptable tour .   but petition demanding union cancel his gig has almost 500 signatures .   the campaign criticises his ` trivialisation of rape and dehumanising women ' "}
