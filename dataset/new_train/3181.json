{"text": "tests for prostate cancer may be incorrectly giving the all-clear to up to 50 per cent of men who have the disease , according to a study . experts believe thousands of patients with the disease could be missed every year because the standard biopsy techniques used at most nhs hospitals are flawed . and thousands more perfectly healthy people could be wrongly diagnosed with the disease and undergoing needless radiotherapy or surgery , according to a study by the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine and university college london . experts say mri and ultrasound scans give more accurate diagnoses of prostate cancer . prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men , affecting 40,000 british men a year and killing 10,000 . most nhs hospitals automatically use biopsies for men with suspected prostate cancer , removing and examining tissue in an attempt to establish whether the disease is present . more than 100,000 of these ` blind ' biopsies are carried out every year -- but experts say the procedures are inaccurate and risky . they are instead calling for less invasive -- but far more expensive -- mri and ultrasound scans to be used first , which they say could immediately and reliably give the all-clear to men without the disease , and allow doctors to carry out more accurate biopsies by pinpointing the area where a tumour is suspected . professor mark emberton , of the university college london , told the daily telegraph : ` there is no other organ of the body where we carry out random  blind  biopsies without knowing where we are looking . prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men , affecting 40,000 british men a year and killing 10,000 -lrb- file photo -rrb- . ` at uclh we have been using mri , followed by a guided biopsy for several years , but there are only a handful of hospitals in this country which do this , and that needs to change . ' the health economists who carried out the wellcome trust-funded study calculated that using the alternative procedure could mean a quarter of patients are given the all-clear without having a biopsy . for every 1,000 men with suspected cancer , 250 men could have been reassured after a scan . of 500 of the cases in which significant disease was present , just 50 per cent were detected during the traditional biopsy , compared with 68 per cent using the mri-guided technique . one in 20 of those undergoing the traditional biopsy were wrongly found to have significant disease levels . using the mri-guided technique , around half as many men were given a wrong diagnosis . sarah willis , a health economist from london school of hygiene and tropical medicine , said : ` these findings suggest that the use of mri and ultrasound not only detects far more cases , but leads to fewer false positives , in which significant disease is wrongly diagnosed . ' dr kate holmes , head of research at prostate cancer uk , said : ` this early data suggests that giving men an mri scan before a biopsy may put clinicians in a better position to tailor investigations and treatments further down the line . ` however , further research is necessary before we will know the true value of this method . '", "summary": " thousands of sufferers could be missed every year due to ` flawed ' biopsies .   experts call for costly mri and ultrasound scans to be used instead .   prostate cancer affects 40,000 british men a year and kills 10,000 .
