{"text": "tom hanks ' upcoming movie  cloud atlas  might be a little confusing for those who have n't read the book on which it 's based . in the movie , actors play multiple races with varying accents and even different genders -- and they do it across eras past , present , and future . despite this , hanks -- who called the screenplay a  page turner like ` thornbirds '  -- thinks it will become self-explanatory as the film progresses , especially for careful observers .  even before the opening credits say ` cloud atlas , '  hanks said ,  jim broadbent as -lrb- the character -rrb- timothy cavendish explains the movie in one line . if you 're hip to figure that out , you 'll see it .  for those who miss that explanation , hanks had one of his own ready :  i found it actually gave a language to the connections we all have with each other ,  he said .  what ` cloud atlas ' is all about -- individual people have to make this decision between cruelty and kindness , someone has to go against a mindless version of the status quo , and it 's this idea that great acts of kindness last forever and reverberate through eternity . it 's another definition of human history .  but , said hanks , some stories are more important than others to the larger narrative . take presidential politics for example : hanks takes the recent round of presidential debates with a grain of salt .  you know what ? the debates are just tv shows ,  he said .  now , they carry a lot of weight because of all the stuff that goes on , but they 're just tv shows . i do n't think there 's any new policy that comes out of them .  hanks said it 's  interesting to watch the ballyhoo  following a debate , especially regarding a candidate 's choice of words , such as mitt romney 's  women in binders  comment .  you know what ? there are a lot of people who have binders full of women ,  hanks joked .  actually , i have a loose leaf notebook that has them in it .  but despite the discussion following a televised debate , hanks does n't think the actual debate is much of a factor in deciding the election . he cites the john kerry-george w. bush debates in 2004 , in which kerry would jump in the polls following a showdown with bush , and yet kerry ultimately lost the race . so even if one candidate seems to dominate , and the other crumbles , it wo n't matter , hanks said ,  unless someone says something so incredibly dumb that you ca n't trust them after a while . but those guys are n't going to do that . they 're both good at what they 're doing . they 've both got it . but i do n't think anybody says anything that magically alters our concept of anything .  but , as hanks well knows , anyone can say something  incredibly dumb  once in a while . hanks , for example , did so on  good morning america  friday . speaking in the voice of one of his  cloud atlas  characters , he accidentally swore on live television . but will it make anyone trust him less ? probably not , but it might encourage networks to use a seven-second delay while he 's promoting the film -- an idea he suggested seconds after using the f-word .  man , oh man ,  hanks apologized on  gma .   i 'm sorry , i slipped . ... i have never done that before . i would apologize to the kids in america that are watching right now . and let me say the next time i 'm on the show , there will be a seven-second delay .  tom hanks to make broadway debut .", "summary": " hanks is appearing in the new film  cloud atlas    he says he does n't think the debates will determine upcoming election .   hanks said he viewed the debates as like tv shows .
