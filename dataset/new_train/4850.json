{"text": "imagine carrying a bowling ball between your legs that weighs close to 200 pounds . if that image is too much to stomach , continue reading with caution . wesley warren , 49 , spent more than four years with this extra burden before having surgery to repair the damage from a rare medical condition called scrotal lymphedema . when doctors placed the swollen mass they had cut from warren 's scrotum on the scale , it weighed 132 pounds . that 's not counting the fluid or smaller pieces of tissue the surgeons had also removed from the las vegas man .  there are a lot of people that will look and laugh and stare in shock and awe and amazement ,  warren says as he walks down the street in a preview for tlc 's upcoming show  the man with the 132-pound scrotum .  the one-hour special airs monday at 9 p.m. et/pt .  it 's tough to deal with it , you know , because essentially , this is a sort of living and breathing freak show .  it began in 2008 , warren told tlc , when he awoke to a shooting pain in his testicles . the tissue around his penis soon began to swell , eventually growing at an estimated rate of 3 pounds per month . one doctor told warren that it might be necessary to castrate him to fix the problem ; others told him that he would probably die on the operating table . and the cost of the surgery alone would be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars . after warren appeared on the howard stern radio show , appealing for help , a fellow scrotal lymphedema sufferer referred him to dr. joel gelman , who offered to do the surgery for free . gelman , director of the center for reconstructive urology at the university of california , irvine , specializes in urethral and penile reconstruction surgery . although the headline of tlc 's special is catchy , scrotal lymphedema is a very real condition , gelman said . he hopes media attention surrounding the show will encourage other men with the problem to seek treatment . here are some more answers about this condition : . what is scrotal lymphedema ? scrotal lymphedema , also known as scrotal elephantiasis , is a  massive enlargement  of the scrotum due to thickening of tissue and accumulation of fluid , gelman said . what causes it ? outside north america , scrotal lymphedema is often caused by a parasitic infection called lymphatic filariasis that 's spread by mosquitoes .  thread-like worms  lodge themselves in the lymphatic system , according to the world health organization , where they can interfere with a person 's immune system . but lymphatic filariasis is virtually unheard-of in the united states , gelman said . most cases of scrotal lymphedema here are caused by blockages in the lymphatic vessels that prevent fluid from draining from the area . doctors are unsure what causes this blockage ; in warren 's case , gelman believes it was an injury or trauma to his scrotum . what are the symptoms ? the most obvious symptom is a large scrotum ; this can range in size from a grapefruit to a basketball . but the mass does n't  max out  at any particular size , gelman said . it will keep growing until the patient seeks treatment . warren 's scrotum was the largest gelman had ever seen .  -lrb- warren -rrb- did n't report that he was always in pain , but i think the biggest problem is that the sheer size of the mass made it very uncomfortable for him ,  the surgeon said .  it 's like lifting weights to take a step .  warren 's penis was  buried  about a foot under his skin , gelman said , but fully functional . a tunnel of sorts had formed from the tip to the top layer of his swollen skin , allowing warren to urinate without assistance . how common is scrotal lymphedema ? it 's rare , especially in the united states . definite numbers are difficult to come by , and the condition may be underdiagnosed due to physicians ' lack of awareness , gelman said . many patients with the condition are also obese and are simply instructed by their doctors to lose weight . how do you treat it ? surgery is usually the best option to remove the swollen tissue , gelman said . a surgeon who specializes in this type of procedure will cut a t-shape in the mass , identify the penis and testicles to make sure they are n't harmed and then excise the excess tissue . the surgeon will then use undamaged tissue to cover the penis and scrotum . how is warren doing now ? warren is walking again and enjoying life , gelman said . he 'll need a follow-up surgery to remove some additional skin that was damaged by his condition . gelman will perform a skin graft to cover the penis and scrotum . um , what if i think i have it ? if you are experiencing the symptoms noted above , see a doctor as soon as possible . ask for a referral to a specialist if your primary care physician is unfamiliar with these types of conditions . an unusually large scrotum can have a variety of causes , gelman said . one of the most common is a hernia , in which a small part of the intestines enters the scrotum . another cause is fluid buildup on one side of a man 's body between the testicle and the skin ; this is called hydrocele . all are treatable and usually not life-threatening unless left too long .", "summary": " wesley warren struggled with a medical condition called scrotal lymphedema .   in the united states , it 's caused by blockages in the lymphatic vessels .   a patient 's enlarged scrotum can keep growing if left untreated , doctor says .
