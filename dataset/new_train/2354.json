{"text": "if you have to ask , you 're probably not on the list . u.s. president barack obama hosted his french counterpart , francois hollande , at a state dinner tuesday night -- the first of his second term . the event is a highly coveted social soiree . the presidents were joined by michelle obama and the crÃ ¨ me de la crÃ ¨ me of washington and hollywood . the invite list is culled from recommendations from the president and first lady , top government officials , the pentagon , members of congress , the supreme court and the state department . movie stars and community and business leaders are also often asked to attend . among this year 's invited guests were : j.j. abrams , bradley cooper , stephen colbert , julia louis-dreyfus , jeff zucker , president of cnn worldwide , defense secretary chuck hagel , supreme court justice elena kagan and secretary of state john kerry . much like an awards show , guests streamed past a sea of cameras . some stopped and talked to reporters . the first lady wore a billowing black and blue dress designed by carolina herrera , and greeted hollande along with her husband on the steps outside . when the three came down a staircase inside , she walked behind the two men , because hollande went to the dinner stag . the main event was to be held in a tent on the south lawn of the white house . attendees were expected to dine on four courses of american-grown haute cuisine : osetra caviar and quail eggs , a winter salad  served in a wonderful glass bowl to make it look like a terrarium ,  colorado-raised beef and a chocolate dessert sourced from obama 's native hawaii . before the dinner , the white house released the names and vintages of the wines poured at each course -- a change from the last few state dinners , which listed only  american  bottles lest the price shock taxpayers . reds from california and washington state and a sparking wine from virginia were the selections . none retail for more than $ 50 a bottle . it all sounds very fancy -- and it is -- but state dinners are n't just about pomp and pageantry , according to the white house . real work gets done .  behind the festive exterior of the social scene , the important business of government goes on -- information is gathered -- opinions exchanged -- powerful connections made and appearances upheld . for these reasons white house invitations are the most important and the most sought after in the nation 's social whirl ,  the white house website says . obama and hollande are in the midst of a diplomatic bromance as they face international challenges that include the syrian civil war , iran 's nuclear ambitions and economic malaise in europe . a socialist elected in 2012 , hollande arrived alone for the dinner after revelations in france of an affair with an actress and the subsequent end of his longtime relationship with valerie trierweiler , who was considered the equivalent of the french first lady even though the two were n't married . it 's not the first time a french president has come to washington alone . hollande 's predecessor , nicolas sarkozy , attended a formal dinner at the white house shortly after announcing his split from his previous wife . cnn 's kevin liptak contributed to this report .", "summary": " the first lady wears a black and blue dress by carolina herrera .   the french president arrives at the dinner , as expected , alone .   the dinner marks the first state dinner of obama 's second term .
