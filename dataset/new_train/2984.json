{"text": "washington democratic and republican leaders do n't see eye to eye on much these days . but political veterans on both sides of the aisle do agree on one point -- the stakes are high in the rapidly approaching 2014 midterm races . for democrats , the midterms are all about holding their slim senate majority and , if possible , defying historical odds by retaking the house of representatives . they want to give president barack obama a working congressional majority for his last two years in office to help secure his legacy and lay the best possible groundwork for the party 's standard bearer in 2016 . for republicans , it 's the polar opposite . 2014 is all about finally realizing their maddeningly elusive goal of recapturing the senate while also boosting their house majority , ensuring obama 's a powerless lame duck , and pounding away at presidential accomplishments like the affordable care act in the run-up to 2016 . poll : voters split over republicans , democrats in 2014 . which party will come out on top next year ? it 's too early to know . but here are seven key factors to keep in mind : . 1 . obamacare . republicans have promised to keep this issue front and center throughout 2014 . and the botched rollout of the healthcare.gov website -- combined with news of canceled insurance policies and problems with the new exchanges -- has given the gop plenty of ammunition . the number of americans citing health care as the country 's biggest problem recently jumped seven percentage points -- from 12 % in october to 19 % in november -- according to gallup . meanwhile , the public 's opinion of obamacare has soured . net disapproval of obamacare jumped from three points -lrb- 44 % approval versus 47 % disapproval -rrb- in october to 15 points -lrb- 40 % approval versus 55 % disapproval -rrb- in november , according to gallup . pelosi defends obamacare claims , ca n't predict effect on 2014 . this month , democrats came close to losing a gubernatorial race in virginia that most analysts believed they 'd win easily . why ? part of the reason appeared to be obamacare 's sinking numbers . more than a quarter of virginia voters said health care -- a traditional democratic strength -- was their most important issue . they narrowly broke for the republican nominee . congressional democrats are spooked . thirty-nine of them voted last week for a gop bill that would let insurers continue to offer policies not in compliance with the minimum standards outlined in the affordable care act . obamacare rattles democrats with midterms looming .  even if the obama administration fixes obamacare in the near term or before november 2014 , this ineptitude ... has shaken voter confidence in government to its core ,  said brown university political scientist wendy schiller .  democrats have relied on government solutions to a wide range of problems to win campaigns . i believe that strategy is now threatened and the democrats will have to work on their policy messaging for november 2014 if they want to hang onto the senate .  gop taints 2014 democrats with obama health care pledge . 2 . shutdown fatigue . how badly did the republican party hurt itself during the recent government shutdown ? for the first time since the gop won back the house in 2010 , a majority of americans said in mid-october they believe gop control of the house is bad for the country . a majority of americans -- 54 % -- had a negative view of republican control of the house , up 11 points since last year , according to a cnn/orc poll . the question now is whether voters ' collective memory of the shutdown has been eclipsed by obamacare 's problems .  the gop has to avoid the kinds of disastrous politics that surrounded the recent government shutdown and debt ceiling fights ,  schiller said .  they have to appear more rational , reasoned and caring as a national party .   ironically ,  she added ,  the gop leadership looks more justified -lrb- now -rrb- in calling for a delay in obamacare but their tactics were so extreme that voters are still wary of them .  top gop congressional leaders are promising there wo n't be another shutdown , but will they be able to control their rank and file ? and if they ca n't , will that play into democratic charges that the gop is now a party under the control of its extreme fringe ? 3 . the economy . it seems like common sense . if your bank account 's hurting , the president 's party is hurting . if you 're doing well , the president 's party does well . except that this is n't always the case . real clear politics ' sean trende said it best four years ago : .  is the president pursuing an unpopular war and controversial policies at home -lrb- lyndon johnson in 1966 , george w. bush in 2006 -rrb- ? then it probably does n't matter that the economy is blazing ahead . is the president waging a successful war and getting ready to take out a longtime nemesis -lrb- george w. bush in 2002 -rrb- ? the public is going to be more forgiving of the sluggish growth in real disposable income and rising unemployment .  the bottom line is that every election becomes something of an explainable , unique event .  that said , some of the worst midterm losses for the president 's party -- 1930 , 1938 , 1946 , 1958 , 1974 , 1982 , 2010 -- occurred during or shortly after a downturn .  a bad recession occurring close to a midterm election is n't a necessary condition for a disastrous midterm election , but it seems to be sufficient ,  trende notes . there are special factors at play in every election cycle , but all things being equal the democrats should be in better shape if the economy 's in better shape . republicans should be in better shape if the economy 's in worse shape . no. 2 democrat says gop could easily lose house . 4 . six-year itch . one of the biggest factors working in the gop 's favor next year could be the simple fact that americans are ready for a change six years into a democratic presidency . the president 's party almost always loses congressional seats in the sixth year of his term . almost . the one recent exception to this rule came in 1998 , in the midst of an apparent voter backlash against the clinton impeachment . could gop overreach on obamacare or other issues create the perfect storm for another exception in 2014 ? 5 . gerrymandering in the house . while all 435 house seats are up in 2014 , the reality is that the overwhelming majority of those seats will not be seriously contested . the art of gerrymandering has evolved into a virtual science over the last couple of decades , leading to greater incumbent protection and a much smaller political playing field . cnn has tentatively identified 45 house races to watch in 2014 -- 25 democratic seats and 20 republican seats . given the fact that the democrats now hold 200 seats -lrb- 201 assuming they hold ed markey 's open massachusetts seat -rrb- , virtually everything would have to break the democrats ' way for them to recapture the house . 6 . who turns out ? midterm turnout is typically lower , which translates to whiter , older , and more republican . core gop constituencies are more likely to turn out at the midterm polls . take a look , for example , at the most recent two election cycles . the electorate in 2012 was 72 % white , 16 % age 65 or older and 53 % protestant . forty-two percent of voters attended religious services weekly . in 2010 , the electorate was 77 % white , 21 % age 65 or older and 55 % protestant . forty-eight percent of voters attended religious services weekly . all four of these groups vote solidly republican . if 2014 turns out to be a  typical  midterm in this respect , it will be a critical advantage for the republicans . 7 . electability versus purity . republicans have been burned over the last couple of election cycles by primaries that led to the nomination of sub-par general election candidates . in 2010 , the gop blew great opportunities to win democratic senate seats in colorado , delaware , and nevada when they nominated three tea party favorites -- ken buck , christine o'donnell and sharron angle -- who subsequently stumbled and proved unacceptable to larger general election electorates . in 2012 , the republicans tossed away a safe gop seat when six-term moderate sen. richard lugar lost his primary fight to more conservative state treasurer richard mourdock . democrats pounced on remarks mourdock made during the general election suggesting that pregnancies resulting from rape are  something god intended .  the seat was ultimately won by democratic nominee joe donnelly . in missouri , republicans lost a golden opportunity to oust vulnerable democratic sen. claire mccaskill last year when gop nominee rep. todd akin declared that in instances of  legitimate rape  a woman 's body  has ways to try to shut that whole thing down .  mccaskill trounced akin by roughly 15 points . in 2014 , gop primary voters will help decide more senate and house where conservative tea party candidates have been pitted against republican establishment types . one of the most notable of these contests is happening in kentucky , where senate minority leader mitch mcconnell is facing off against tea party favorite matt bevin . this is not to say that the establishment choice is always the best one for republicans . it 's not . and the grassroots energy provided by tea party activists is critical to gop chances . but the lesson of recent cycles should n't be ignored in 2014 . primaries matter . battle for the house in 2014 : obamacare vs. shutdown .", "summary": " obamacare fiasco has shaken voter confidence in democrats ' government solutions .   will voters ' memories of october shutdown be eclipsed by obamacare a year from now ?   worst losses have occurred to president 's party during or shortly after economic slowdown .   could gop overreach on obamacare or other issues break cycle of six-year itch ?
