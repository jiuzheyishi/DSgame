{"text": "he 's a huge , strangely dressed man who sneaks into people 's homes at night , then yells ,  ho ! ho ! ho !  at the top of his lungs . who would n't be afraid of santa claus ?  a 2-year-old knows what a regular person looks like , and santa ai n't it ,  author nancy watkins says . authors denise joyce and nancy watkins know at least 250 toddlers who are . the two recently published a book called  scared of santa : scenes of terror in toyland  that shows photos of children on st. nick 's lap -- most of whom are desperate to leave . the project started at the chicago tribune , where both joyce and watkins work . they asked readers to send in their photos and got an overwhelming response that 's still going strong . last week , the tribune 's  scared of santa  web site had 2 million hits . an agent saw the journalists ' success and proposed the stocking-stuffer book . now anyone can enjoy the chapters labeled  titans of tears ,  misery squared  and watkins ' favorite :  santa claus is comin ' ... after you .   we still laugh at -lsb- the book -rsb- ,  watkins said .  i 'll open it up and be like , ` oh you remember that one ! ' it just cracks me up .  see photos of screaming toddlers  cnn talked with watkins about her love of photos of scary santas and why she never forced her son onto santa 's lap . the following is an edited version of that interview : . cnn : how did the original idea for this book come about ? nancy watkins : it started out as a reader interaction feature for the holidays . we put the call out to readers to have them send us their photos . we were not the first people to do this , i must confess . the palm beach post did it first , and then they shared the idea with other papers in this organization we belong to . so that 's how it came about . and we got a great response in print . then it really took off when it went online , and it 's still going pretty strong at the chicagotribune.com / scaredofsanta . cnn : do you have any favorite photos or parts of the book ? watkins : well , you know , that would be like choosing a favorite child . but in general , i think denise and i both love the photos of the scary santas . we have a whole chapter devoted to the santas you would just not want to run into in a dark alley , and you can see why the kids would be scared of those guys . especially the vintage ones . i love the ones that are from the '50s and '60s , and we 've got some that go as far back as the '20s . those are just really fun to look at and see that being scared of santa just goes back many , many decades -- probably to the dawn of time . watch watkins talk about the book  cnn : what do you think is so scary about santa ? why do kids react that way ? watkins : well , i think you need to look at it from the perspective of a 2-year-old . i think 2 - to 4-year-olds are most likely , first of all , to completely freak out over santa . when they 're younger , everyone looks weird and new and different , and you just never know what 's going to make a kid cry at that age . but a 2-year-old knows what a regular person looks like , and santa ai n't it . santa is huge , and he 's got that crazy white suit , and he 's got the huge white beard and the hat . and he 's sitting on this great big throne . he 's very intimidating to a real little kid . so he can be the nicest , sweetest santa on the planet , but i can see why a 2-year-old would have a meltdown . especially , you know , after waiting in line for an hour , and there 's kind of already a lot of noise . and then this guy starts yelling ,  ho ! ho ! ho !  at them . cnn : it said in the book that you never made your kid sit on santa 's lap . is that true ? watkins : i never forced him to . we tried every year . we would wait in line , and he was always up for it , always wanted to go see santa , until we got right up to his turn and then forget about it -- he was not going anywhere near him . and i just thought , well , ok , i was n't going to force him . now looking at these pictures , i think , well maybe if i had just done it one time , it 'd be funny to have the picture now . because these families keep these photos -- they might have some of the nice , smiley pictures too , but i think it 's these crying pictures that really become heirlooms . you know , they bring them out , and everybody laughs at them . and as the kids get older they have to suffer through it , but then they kind of grow to appreciate it , too . cnn : do you have any like that of you ? watkins : my mom scrounged around trying to find some , and we did find one , but i was not scared . i was very happy to be seeing santa at the bank . i do n't know if they still do that , but back in the '60s you could go see santa at the bank . and my brothers and i were just as happy as can be because we knew where the toys were coming from , and we were going to be polite to santa . cnn : have you had any complaints from santas or santa associations ? watkins : well , for the book , denise actually interviewed the president of the amalgamated order of real bearded santas , and so we got some comments from them . no complaints from santas -- at least not yet . we did hear from kind of a grouch on amazon.com who objected to our laughing at and making money at the expense of crying children . but not yet has anyone come up to us and said ,  i am scarred for life because i was afraid of santa .  so i 'm pretty sure that most of these kids are over it in about five minutes .", "summary": " journalists denise joyce and nancy watkins wrote  scared of santa    book contains photos of screaming toddlers on santas ' laps .   watkins says ,  i 'm pretty sure that most of these kids are over it in about five minutes  "}
