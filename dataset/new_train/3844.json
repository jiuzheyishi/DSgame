' i had only managed to raise the flag five or six times before the phone rang to say it had to come down . ` we . all have rights but surely mine count as much as theirs . the least my . landlord could have done was to come and see me and the flag for . themselves . ` it 's not causing anybody any harm . ' another of mr fairfield 's neighbours complained that she could n't watch the television while his flag was flying . ` if she wants to watch the television , she should concentrate on that instead of my flag , ' he said . ` it 's ludicrous . ' mr . fairfield joined the british army through national service in 1952 . before being transferred to serve as a sergeant in the parachute . regiment in 1954 . the pensioner says he takes pride in being patriotic . mr fairfield 's landlord sanctuary housing told him to remove the flag from his garden , pictured , following complaints from neighbours . he said : ` maybe i am more patriotic than the average person . ` when i watch the military parades on television , i have a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes . ` i 've always wanted a flag but i 've never had a garden to fly one in until now , and i think it makes my garden look nicer . ` i 'm proud to be an englishman and proud to have been in the forces , so i want to fly my flag , it 's as simple as that . ' mr fairfield says he even checked whether he needed planning permission for the flagpole , which is 18ft tall , and hangs his 5ft by 3ft union jack flag . he and his wife shirley , 68 , moved to their bungalow 18 months ago after having problems with their neighbours at their previous home , where they lived for 26 years . he said : ` we find it very idyllic living here , it 's like our little piece of heaven . but this has really ruined things for us . ` i 've been totally upset by the whole thing , i ca n't believe people can take so much offence over our country 's flag . ' i hope people will see that there are much bigger things to be worried about , rather than stopping an old man from taking pride in his heritage . ' john hanson , local head of housing operations for sanctuary housing , said : ` mr and mrs fairfield are a lovely couple to work with , and we understand that they have the best of intentions . ` objections were about the size of the flag and the noise it created , not the principle of flying one , and we are more than happy to help the fairfields come to a suitable agreement with their neighbours .
