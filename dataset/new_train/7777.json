{"text": "for many , jonah lomu rugby remains the best rugby game ever created . although fifa maestros ea tried to tackle the rugby market , each attempt paled in comparison to codemasters ' 1997 classic . but that has n't stopped sidhe , the developers behind countless rugby league games , trying their hand at what 's proving to be a difficult sport to crack . scrum 's the word : rugby challenge may have some flaws , but it 's on course to be a solid sports game . first impressions are promising . menu screens are clear and crisp , and there 's a fifa-style glossiness to the animated background . content is rich , too , boasting a single match , competition , online and career modes to name but a few . it 's also heavily licenced - with more than 110 teams and 50 stadia looking exactly how they should . this includes heavy hitters such as the all blacks , australia and the lions , not to mention smaller teams in the rabodirect pro12 and ranfurly shield . unfortunately , south african teams are not licenced . but for all of this authenticity , the gameplay feels very arcade like - a move which may anger purists . fast and ferocious , there 's often so much happening on screen that it 's difficult to tell what 's going on . core mechanics such as passing , tackling and kicking work well , though , and although ai running lines are not as refined as rugby fans may like , it 's still very enjoyable . less enjoyable are the tedious scrum and lineout mechanics . both involve time-sensitive button and controller presses to ensure success , but the margin for error is extremely punishing . the decision to put all out-of-hand kicking into slow-motion , too , also jars with the ebb and flow of a match . graphically , rugby challenge 2 largely looks the part . enjoyed best from a side-on perspective , animations generally hold together and stadiums are nicely detailed . character models are less impressive , which is shame , given the number tv-style close-ups and replays broadcast during matches . sound has been noticeably improved since 2011 's rugby challenge . former all black justin marshall is on hand offering insightful quips and critique while grant nisbett follows the core action . sadly , commentary is not quite as smooth as you 'd hope for , and more than once during the match - was n't accurate to what was going on on-screen . arcade : harking back to the days of jonah lomu rugby , realistic gameplay has taken a back seat . but these minor gripes aside , on this evidence , rugby challenge 2 still looks like a strong rugby game , one that 's sure to please many die-hard rugby fans . rugby challenge 2 : the lions edition is released on june 13 . follow us on twitter : @dailymailgames and on facebook : daily mail games .", "summary": " crisp , clear menus and packed full of game modes .   core gameplay remains true to the sport - bar the odd ai hiccup .   fully licenced teams but lack of south african licence is a shame .
