{"text": "in the super-computing league table , the u.s. has reclaimed ` top spot ' from japan . ibm 's sequoia computer , which is 1.55 times faster than japan 's previous record-breaker , the fujitsu k computer , was installed and switched on at the u.s. department of energy 's lawrence livermore national laboratory in california . throwing evidence behind moore 's law - which dictates that computers get twice as powerful and twice as small every 18 months - the new super-computer is a powerful machine . it can perform - in less than a second - calculations which would take the super computers of 1993 three days to solve . in fact , the ibm team say it is 273,930 times more powerful than the 1993 machine - called the cm-5 / 1024 and created by american firm thinking machines . the sequoia : this grey slab is just part the most powerful computer on the planet , and will be used in nuclear power research , with perhaps a game or two of chess on the side . the bbc reports that sequoia is capable of calculating , in one hour , ` what otherwise would take 6.7 billion people using hand calculators 320 years . ' the computer will be used carry out simulations to help extend the life of nuclear weapons , in a bid to avoid real-world underground tests . sequoia and uses over 1.5 million processors - to put that in perspective , your brand-new , luxurious # 1,500 desktop pc will like be a quad-core , e.g. with four processors . gamers and computer enthusiasts all over the world will be very tempted to install some modern computer games like the first-person shooter crysis onto sequoia to watch the hardware destroy all previous hardware benchmarks . national nuclear security administration administrator thomas d'agostino said : ` while sequoia may be the fastest , the underlying computing capabilities it provides give us increased confidence in the nation 's nuclear deterrent . japan 's ` no 2 ' computer is certainly nothing to be sneered at . it packs 88,128 2.0 ghz 8-core processors -lrb- spread over 864 separate cabinets -rrb- . to put that in perspective , this is nearly 90,000 very-high-end home computers , all strung up together to work in sync . that creates around 705,000 processors in total , less than half of sequoia 's 1.5 million , but still a mighty beast in its own right . it runs on linux , the open-source and free alternative to windows which means , if nothing else , fujitsu got to save some money on the software side . ` sequoia also represents continued american leadership in high performance computing . ' it is also the machine with relatively outstanding economy power-wise , consuming 7.9 megawatts compared to the k computer , which consumes12 .6 megawatts . other countries with supercomputers include china and japan , with two apiece , and and germany , france and italy each have one . ibm has built five out of the top 10 computers . david turek , vice president of deep computing at the firm , told the bbc : ` substantial planning went into this . we knew the day would come . ' not everyone was left excited by the new machine : zdnet 's zack whittaker said : ` the u.s. may claim home to some the world 's top scientists , just as china has for two non-consecutive years claimed the world 's fastest computer . ... at the end of the day : supercomputers are just tools . ' however , in reply , another znet writer , dan kusnetzky , said : ` on the other hand , ibm or any other supplier 's ability to create such a complex , powerful computing research is of extreme importance . ` the thought , the tools and the procedures needed to build and operate such a huge system are directly applicable to other types of computing . '", "summary": " ibm 's ` sequoia ' beats japan 's ' k machine ' , running 1.55 times faster while being 15 per cent more energy efficient .   computer - which is nearly 300,00 times faster than machines from 20 years ago - will be used for nuclear studies .
