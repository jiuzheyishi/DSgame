{"text": "unhappy : children 's minister edward timpson . councils which turn away would-be adoptive parents for spurious reasons face being stripped of their right to run the service , ministers will warn today . new powers will allow the government to crack down on authorities which fail to play their part in tackling a ` chronic ' national shortage of prospective adopters and a backlog of 4,600 children waiting to be adopted . ministers are concerned that would-be parents are coming forward to adopt only to be told ` they are not wanted ' , in some cases purely for geographical reasons . some parents are turned away because the council they approached has no need of more adopters -- even though shortages nationally are acute . reasons given to parents include ` we are not recruiting within our own city council ' and ` we were out of their area ' . others fail because of arbitrary barriers , such as being overweight or too old . recent reports revealed how couples who hope to adopt are being told that one of them must give up their job . children 's minister edward timpson will today outline plans to create new powers for ministers to intervene in councils which fail to recruit more adoptive parents and consider the needs of children nationally . they could be stripped of their role recruiting and assessing potential parents and instead required to deal with voluntary agencies to find them . mr timpson said : ` there are over 4,000 children waiting to be adopted nationally but year-on-year local authorities are not recruiting enough people to give them stable and loving homes . we can not stand by while children 's futures hang in the balance . ' he said local authorities ` must now demonstrate that they are up to the challenge or we wo n't hesitate to intervene ' . policy change : ministers promise to remove ` race bar ' which have excluded parents from adopting children of another racial background . recent figures from ofsted reveal how only one in eight of the couples and individuals who try to adopt children are approved by social workers , meaning that more than 22,000 would-be adopters vanish each year . ministers have promised to sweep away barriers to adoptive parents over recent months , including race bars which have seen white parents routinely rejected as adopters of black or asian children . the barriers to adoption have helped push down the number of children who find new families from 20,000 a year in the 1970s to few more than 3,000 now . in further measures being announced today , # 150million will be restored to local authorities from cuts elsewhere to spend on adoption reforms . referring to the plan for voluntary agencies to become involved , david simmonds of the local government association said : ` removing councils from the process of recruiting and screening potential adopters could adversely impact on the very children and potential adoptive parents the government is trying to protect and should only be considered as a very last resort . '", "summary": " britain has backlog of 4,600 children waiting to be adopted .   figures show that 12.5 per cent of those who want to adopt are approved .   ministers should to intervene , says children 's minister edward timpson .
