{"text": "scientists have finally solved a visual illusion first discovered by galileo over 400 years ago . he was perplexed to find venus looked bigger than jupiter with the naked eye - but not through a telescope . now , researchers say the effect is an optical illusion that occurs because of the way our eyes see lightness and darkness in the world . galileo was perplexed to find venus -lrb- left -rrb- looked bigger than jupiter with the naked eye - but not through a telescope . now researchers claim to have discovered why . the edges of a light object appear blurred and this is effectively magnified by the brain so that the entire object appears bigger than it should . venus , being nearer to earth , is brighter than jupiter and so it appears bigger against the dark background of the night sky . their results advance our understanding of how our brains are wired for seeing white versus black objects . the work was done by jens kremkow and collaborators in the laboratories of jose manuel alonso and qasim zaidi at the state university of new york college of optometry , and will be published on february 10 of 2014 in the proceedings of the national academy of science . ` galileo was the first to say that our eye was distorting reality , ' dr alonso said . ` he could see that venus appeared to be much larger than jupiter when seen with the naked eye and that the opposite was true when he looked through his telescope , ' galileo said that the effect was some kind of size illusion created by the eyes . ` either because their light is refracted in the moisture that cover the pupil , or because it is reflected from the edges of the eyelids and these reflected rays are diffused over the pupil , or for some other reasons , ' galileo wrote . the 19 century german physicist hermann von helmholtz came nearer to the truth when he said that the ` irradiation illusion ' , as he called it , was caused by our sensation of the object and not by the optics of the eye . ` the latest research demonstrates that the sensation helmholtz used to explain the irradiation illusion is a ` non-linear ' response of the visual system when objects are presented on dark backgrounds , ' dr alonso explained . the phenomenon is related to the way we see black and white - and also explains why we find black text on a white page easier to read . galileo was puzzled by the fact that he appearance of the planets hanged depending on whether one looked with the naked eye versus with a telescope . viewed directly , planets seemed ` expanded ' and had ' a radiant crown ' , which made venus looked eight to ten times larger than jupiter even if jupiter was four times larger . though galileo realized this size illusion was not created by the object -- but by his eyes -- he did not understand why or how . he wrote , ` either because their light is refracted in the moisture that covers the pupil , or because it is reflected from the edges of the eyelids and these reflected rays are diffused over the pupil , or for some other reason .  generations of scientists following galileo continued to assume the illusion was caused by blur or similar optical effects . however , though blur can distort size , it does not explain why venus looks larger than jupiter with the naked eye . hermann von helmholtz -- the venerable 19th century german physician-physicist -- was the first to realize that something else  was needed to explain the illusion , as he described in his treatise on physiological optics . in this photo , the planet jupiter is visible as a bright dot on the upper left , with venus the brightest planet in the center of the frame and the cresent moon is behind the cloud . scientists have now discovered why venus looks bigger than jupiter . the researchers say the results also show why we prefer black text on a white background . only now , with kremkow and colleagues ' new study , has science finally zoomed in and illuminated the scope of the problem . it 's a feature of how we see everything , no less . in the new study , alonso and his colleagues used electrodes to record the electrical signals from neurons in the visual areas of anesthetized cats , monkeys and human brains while the researchers showed the animal and human participants dark shapes on a light background , light shapes on a dark background , or light or dark shapes on a gray background . so white spots on a black background look bigger than same-sized black spots on white background , and galileo 's glowing moons are not really as big as they might appear to the unaided eye . this effect is responsible for how we see everything from textures and faces -- based on their dark parts in bright daylight -- to why it is easier to read this very page with black-on-white lettering , rather than white-on-black -lrb- a well known , and until now , unexplained phenomenon -rrb- . by tracing these effects as a function of the way neurons are laid out and interconnected in the retina and brain , the authors found that the illusion is potentially derived from the very origin of vision -- in the photoreceptors of the eye themselves .", "summary": " experts say key is the way our eye processes black and white .   also explains why we prefer reading black on white text .   galileo first spotted effect when planets were viewed with the naked eye and a telescope .
