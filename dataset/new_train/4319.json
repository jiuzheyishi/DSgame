{"text": "bangkok , thailand violence flared overnight in bangkok amid anti-government demonstrations intended to drive thailand 's prime minister out of office . tens of thousands of protesters have disrupted traffic at major intersections and marched on government offices in thailand 's large and hectic capital city this week . the protests , dubbed  bangkok shutdown ,  had begun monday without serious incident . but on tuesday night , two people were shot and wounded , an explosive device was thrown at an opposition leader 's house , buses were set alight and police officers were attacked , according to authorities . the protesters say they want thailand 's political system overhauled instead of new elections scheduled for next month . they 're demanding that prime minister yingluck shinawatra 's government be replaced with an unelected  people 's council .  their numbers dropped from a peak of as many as 170,000 on monday evening to about 60,000 on tuesday evening , said lt. gen. paradon pattanathabut , thailand 's security chief . he said roughly 10,000 demonstrators had stayed out on the streets overnight as others returned to their homes in the bangkok area . protest leaders disagree with the government 's estimates of their numbers . they say they had more than one million people on the streets on tuesday night . intersections occupied . since monday , groups of demonstrators have occupied seven main intersections in bangkok and marched on several government buildings , including the labor , commerce and foreign ministries . the protests have caused some disruption in central bangkok , but large areas of the sprawling capital city so far remain unaffected . authorities have deployed about 20,000 security personnel to keep watch throughout the city . the rallies are orchestrated by the people 's democratic reform committee -lrb- pdrc -rrb- protest group , led by suthep thaugsuban , a former deputy prime minister for the opposition democrat party . the government has offered talks with protesters and other concerned parties to discuss a way out of the impasse and the possibility of postponing the election . but suthep 's group has rejected the offer . unrest overnight . with thailand still scarred by deadly civil unrest in 2010 , police and demonstrators have both pledged not to resort to violence . but amid the tense atmosphere in parts of bangkok , pockets of unrest sparked on tuesday night . an explosive device was thrown at the house of opposition leader abhisit vejjajiva , paradon said . abhisit , the leader of the democrat party , was not in the house at the time and nobody was wounded by the blast , paradon said . the case is under investigation and it is not certain at this point whether the attack was politically motivated , he said . abhisit , a former prime minister , has denied being a member of the pdrc but has appeared on stage and among the crowds at some of their demonstrations . at pathumwan , one of the major occupied intersections , two protesters were shot and wounded by unidentified attackers , paradon said . one of the protesters suffered serious , but not life-threatening , injuries , he said . the other had minor injuries . in the lumpini park area , protesters ' guards attacked four police officers who were gathering intelligence , police said . one of the officers remains in the hospital after the assault . at nang lerk intersection , where scores of people have been protesting for months , two buses were set on fire , paradon said . dispute over elections . rights groups , the united nations and the united states have called on thai authorities and anti-government protesters to respect human rights and avoid violence during the mass demonstrations . since demonstrations against yingluck 's government began in november , eight people have died and 470 have been wounded , authorities said . in a bid to cool tensions , yingluck dissolved the nation 's parliament last month and called for new elections to be held on february 2 . but the move has done little to appease protesters . they have called on the prime minister to step down from her caretaker position and be replaced by an unelected  people 's council ,  which would see through electoral and political reforms . the national election commission has urged the government to postpone elections amid the continuing unrest . yingluck offered to meet with protest leaders and election commission officials wednesday to discuss whether to delay the vote , her office said . but akanat prompan , a pdrc spokesman , said yingluck 's offer of talks was n't an answer to the problems . the protesters want to see changes to thailand 's political system enacted before elections take place , he said , and the demonstrations will continue until they achieve that goal . travel warnings . dozens of countries have issued travel advisories amid fears the tensions could erupt into violence . the u.s. embassy in bangkok has urged u.s. citizens to avoid large gatherings in the city and to ensure they have a stock of cash and essential items in case the situation deteriorates .  while protests have been generally peaceful over the last two months , some have resulted in injury and death ,  its online warning said .  even demonstrations that are meant to be peaceful can turn confrontational , and can escalate into violence without warning .  the protest group has said that it will allow ambulances to pass along the roads it blocks , and that it will not block access to airports and public transportation . the u.s. government supports  a democratic process to resolve the ongoing political tensions in thailand ,  marie harf , a state department spokeswoman , said monday .  we also continue to urge all sides to refrain from violence , exercise restraint and respect the rule of law ,  she said at a regular news briefing .  and we do , i would note , applaud the restraint shown thus far by government authorities in this regard .  ambitious goal . protest leaders have said they want to rid thailand of the influence of former prime minister thaksin shinawatra , the older brother of yingluck . that 's an ambitious goal in a country where every election since 2001 has been won by parties affiliated with thaksin , a billionaire who built his political success on populist policies that appealed to thailand 's rural heartland . thaksin was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and has spent most of the time since then in exile overseas . if he returns , he risks a two-year prison sentence on a corruption conviction , which he says was politically motivated . the recent protests in bangkok were prompted by a botched attempt by yingluck 's government to pass an amnesty bill that would have opened the door for her brother 's return . that move added fuel for critics who accuse her of being nothing more than her brother 's puppet , an allegation she has repeatedly denied . opposition to thaksin and yingluck is strongest among the urban elites and middle class , particularly in bangkok . thaksin 's traditional support comes from the populous rural areas of north and northeast thailand . his supporters , known as  red shirts ,  support the holding of elections on february 2 . kocha olarn and saima mohsin reported from bangkok , and jethro mullen reported and wrote from hong kong .",
