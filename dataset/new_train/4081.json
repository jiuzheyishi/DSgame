' and if they do , we may see those delays that we warned them about ,  gish said . traffic was also unusually light on pacific coast highway , a recommended alternative route for motorists traveling to los angeles international airport . and parking lots at santa monica beach , typically packed on a sunny saturday , were relatively empty . the closure of the 405 is being deemed such a potentially calamitous event that locals called it  carmaggedon .  that 's because southern california is notorious for its love affair with the car and its reluctance to embrace public transportation . one of the busiest freeways in the country , the 405 is one of two mountain passes in the heart of los angeles and is the major coastal artery connecting southern california with the rest of the state .  we are the car capital of the united states of america and the single-passenger-car capital ,  villaraigosa told cnn . a 10-mile stretch of 10-lane i-405 closed for the demolition of a bridge section made for a surreal scene overnight -- a stretch of freeway without any traffic . it is expected to remain that way for about 53 hours . crews closed ramps late friday on the 405 , where it passes over the santa monica mountains , california department of transportation officials said . the $ 1.2 billion construction project calls for replacing a portion of a bridge at mulholland drive , a mountain summit road that is featured in many hollywood films , authorities said . a year from now , crews will have to shut down the 405 again to replace a final portion of the mulholland drive bridge , officials said . villaraigosa said officials carried out  an unprecedented  campaign urging motorists to stay put or use public transportation .  it does n't have to be ` carmageddon . ' that 's why we have done so much outreach to the public ,  the mayor said . the weekend construction project should be completed by 5 a.m. monday to accommodate the morning rush hour , officials said . the project also calls for adding a car-pool lane in each direction , creating  the largest hov system in the world  at 48.6 miles in length between the san fernando valley and orange county , said mike miles , the california department of transportation 's director for los angeles and ventura counties . the two-year project will replace two more bridges , also to accommodate the widening of the 405 , and will improve about two dozen on-off ramps and add 18 miles of sound-deadening walls for nearby residents , miles said .  this is a big project that is much needed , and it will be a great benefit to the public ,  miles said . the 405 is usually one of the busiest freeways in the country , carrying about 500,000 cars a day through the sepulveda pass , a critical artery connecting californians along the coast . the 405 achieved notoriety on national television as the corridor that former nfl player o.j. simpson used as he was being slowly chased by police in 1994 . the highway also cuts through the west side of los angeles , an area that includes the high-status communities of bel air , brentwood , beverly hills and santa monica . the four-mile southbound section is closed between u.s. 101 and getty center drive ramps . the 10-mile northbound section is closed between u.s. 101 and interstate 10 . los angeles international airport is urging travelers to get there by public transit , especially rail , or to stay at nearby hotels for early morning flights . there is an app , or several , for  carmageddon .  kabc has partnered with waze , the mobile social traffic and navigation app , to help navigate the traffic .  the app provides free turn-by-turn gps navigation based on the live conditions of the road ,  the station said . celebrities are even tweeting -- cheekily -- about this weekend 's affront to the los angeles driving experience . twitter titan and actor ashton kutcher has gotten into the act :  lapd askd me 2tweet : 405fwy btwn 10 & 101 will b closed july16-17 . in xchange i would like a free pass on that stoplight tickt it was yellow .  when shown a copy of the tweet while he was being interviewed on cnn , the mayor laughed about the request to fix the ticket .  no , thank you , ashton ,  villaraigosa said . cnn 's sonya hamasaki and zohreen adamjee contributed to this report .", "summary": " new : interstate 405 expected to open ahead of schedule , villaraigosa says .   traffic is relatively light on los angeles ' freeways .   interstate 405 in los angeles carries about 500,000 cars a day .   it 's one of two major mountain highway passes in the heart of the nation 's second-largest city .
