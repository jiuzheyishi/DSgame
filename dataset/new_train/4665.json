{"text": "maybe . that 's the verdict from scientists trying to answer a question that has riveted people around the middle east and beyond for nearly a decade : did someone kill palestinian leader yasser arafat by poisoning him with a radioactive isotope ? his widow insists he was assassinated , a conclusion scientists who have completed an exhaustive study of the evidence did not reject , but said thursday they could not confirm either .  was polonium the cause of death ?  asked professor francois bouchud , director of lausanne university hospital 's institute of radiation physics about yasser arafat 's death in 2004 in a paris military hospital .  our study has not been able to prove categorically a hypothesis of poisoning or another of non-poisoning by polonium .  he was fielding questions from reporters in lausanne , switzerland , about his group 's work a day after al jazeera released a report prepared by his laboratory that concluded that levels of polonium-210 measured in arafat 's personal effects and in tissues from his exhumed body  moderately  support a proposition that he died of polonium poisoning . bouchud said thursday that the results  support reasonably the hypothesis of poisoning  by polonium , but he bemoaned the lack of tissue samples from just after death , which the hospital has destroyed .  if we had access to samples , we could be more categorical . unfortunately , they disappeared .  still ,  poisoning from polonium-210 was possible ,  bouchud said . the findings , released by the university center of legal medicine of lausanne , do not address how arafat , who died at age 75 , might have been poisoned or who might have done it . bouchud also cited the passage of nine years since arafat died as a complicating factor . the half-life of polonium is 138 days , which means less than a millionth of the isotope that was present at death would still be there . a polonium expert who was not involved in the work praised the swiss researchers ' efforts as scientifically sound , but said they were given a tough job .  it 's like a blindfolded man holding the tail of an elephant and using that to estimate the weight of the elephant ,  said paddy regan , a professor of radionuclide metrology in the physics department at the university of surrey in guildford , england .  you can do it , but there is a huge amount of extrapolation involved .  and the mere presence of the isotope -- even in amounts significantly higher than what occurs naturally -- does not necessarily mean that that is what killed arafat , he told cnn in a telephone interview , citing the scientists ' measurement of a urine stain on arafat 's underwear .  if you were being cynical about such a thing , if you wanted to put a false trail out there , you could put a tiny amount of polonium-210 on that urine stain . that does n't mean that the urine stain came from inside him .  regan described the amount of polonium needed to kill a man as  terrifyingly small ... the size of a grain of salt , something like that .  professor patrice mangin , director of the forensics center at lausanne university hospital , underscored the uncertainty .  we have never said in a categorical way we have the absolute proof that we 're dealing with polonium poisoning ,  he said . but that caution was not shared by arafat 's widow .  i 'm convinced it was a political murder , a political assassination ,  suha arafat told cnn in a telephone interview from doha , the capital of qatar .  they wanted to get rid of him ,  she said , without saying who  they  are .  i 'm not pointing fingers , but this polonium came from a nuclear reactor , and the next step is to identify its source .  it was her suspicions that led authorities to exhume arafat 's body after polonium-210 was found last year on his personal belongings . yet another complication : the chain of custody of arafat 's personal effects -- from the time he died to 2012 , when the center began to study them -- is unclear . but the report said that suha arafat had  certified that the measured personal effects have been stored in a secured room .  invoices for the two analyses , whose cost mangin would not disclose , were sent to the palestinian authority and to suha arafat . palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas has ordered that a probe into his predecessor 's death continue  to reveal the complete truth to the palestinian people and the entire world ,  presidential spokesman nabil abu rudeineh told wafa , the official palestinian news agency , on thursday . what polonium does to the body . the report may renew suspicions over how arafat -- the most prominent face of palestinian opposition to israel for five decades -- died . the palestinian authority , which runs the west bank , has said israel would have been behind any poisoning of arafat , who was regarded by many palestinians as a father figure .  i believe that all fingers are pointed at the israeli occupation ... who have experience in such cases of poisoning ,  said wasel abu yousef , a member of the executive committee of the palestine liberation organization . yousef called for a  criminal international committee  to be formed to look into the report . an israeli foreign ministry spokesman said wednesday that any such accusation would be  utter nonsense .   this is nothing to do with us , and for the moment they refrained -lrb- from -rrb- making accusations ,  israeli foreign ministry spokesman yigal palmor said .  they know why -- there 's no strictly no connection to israel .  french prosecutors launch murder inquiry in arafat 's death . arafat , who first led the palestine liberation organization and then the palestinian authority , died in november 2004 after suffering a stroke , ending weeks of illness . palestinian officials said in the days before his death that arafat had a blood disorder -- though they ruled out leukemia -- and that he had digestive problems . rumors of poisoning circulated at the time , but the palestinian authority 's then-foreign minister , nabil shaath , said he  totally  ruled them out . french authorities , responding to a request from arafat 's widow , opened a murder inquiry last year after the isotope was found on arafat 's toothbrush , clothing and his keffiyeh , the black-and-white headscarf he often wore . france opened the investigation partly because arafat died there . forensic experts from switzerland and russia took their own samples for independent analysis . radiation poisoning caused by polonium-210 looks like the end stage of cancer , according to medical experts . the substance can enter the body via a wound or through contaminated food , drink or even air . russian spy dies after polonium poisoning .", "summary": "  i 'm convinced it was a political murder ,  says suha arafat .   the palestinian leader died in 2004 at age 75 .   last year , his widow , suspecting he was poisoned , had the body exhumed for tests .   polonium-210 , a radioactive isotope , had been detected on his clothing and toothbrush .
