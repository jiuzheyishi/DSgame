{"text": "boston marathon bomber dzhokhar tsarnaev was so close to death after being shot multiple times by authorities that he had to have immediate life-saving surgery once arriving at the hospital , new court documents reveal . his lawyers said he had gunshot wounds to his head , face , throat , jaw , left hand and legs after the shoot out that occurred when he was found hiding in a boat in watertown , massachusetts . tsarnaev 's health ` suddenly declined ' immediately after he was transported to a local hospital and doctors were forced to perform emergency surgery to keep him alive . tsarnaev is accused of working with his now-dead brother to place two bombs near the finish line of the 2013 marathon , killing three people and injured more than 260 . his trial is scheduled for november . he was intubated throughout the night and given heavy pain medication like dilaudid , fentanyl , and propofol which was one of the prescription drugs that michael jackson overdosed on when he died . just 20 hours after being brought to the hospital , he was questioned by investigators in a session that lasted for about 36 hours in spite of his repeated requests for a lawyer and rest . his left eye was sutured closed , had a tracheotomy tube down his throat , could n't hear out of his left ear , and his mouth was wired shut throughout the interrogation . his legal team submitted the new documents to the court in an effort to suppress the statements he made - using a notepad because of his inability to speak - during the questioning session . rights denied : tsarnaev 's lawyers argued that he wrote notes asking for a lawyer at least 10 times during his questioning immediately after coming out of surgery . defense attorneys said the questioning continued ` despite the fact that he quickly allayed concerns about any continuing threat to public safety , repeatedly asked for a lawyer , and begged to rest . ' ` the questioning continued for hours , in what was obviously an effort to extract as much incriminating information as possible , without regard for the protections of the fifth amendment , ' the filing states . they said his treatment included painkillers that impaired his judgment and increased his susceptibility to pressure . documents reveal that he complained about his pain and said that he needed to vomit . ` mr. tsarnaev wrote answers to questions in a notebook because he was unable to speak , ' his defense team wrote in the motion filed wednesday . ` these notes reflect his attempt to respond to urgent questions -lrb- he assured the agents that no public safety threat remained -rrb- as well as his poor functioning and limited cognitive ability . ` in all , he wrote the word ` lawyer ' ten times , sometimes circling it . ` one of the agents insisted , nonsensically , that mr. tsarnaev was not in custody . ' there are instances where the pen trailed off the page , and his legal team is arguing that it is a sign of him passing out or losing control of his motor function during the interrogation . at one point , dzhokhar 's note implies that the questioning agents lied to him about his brother , tamerlan , who had been killed in a shootout days earlier . in one note , dzhokhar wrote : ` is my brother alive i know you said he is are you lying is he alive ? ' ` these questions went well beyond even the department of justice 's own written policy regarding use of the public safety exception to interrogate members of terrorist organizations , ' his legal team wrote . the lawyers said his rights also were violated when his appearance in court was delayed to complete the interrogation , during which he told authorities about how the bombs were built and about the brothers ' activities before and after the bombing . ` agents made clear by word and deed that they would not allow him to see a lawyer until they had finished questioning him , ' his defense team 's filing said . according to abc news , the prosecution has implied that they will not be using any of the bedside statements in the trial , but they have not formally noted that in court documents , so yesterday 's filing is seeking a notarized version of that agreement . also on wednesday , the defense asked the judge to declare the federal death penalty unconstitutional . security concerns : the fbi argues that they were able to question dzhokhar without a lawyer present because they needed answers immediately about whether or not there were any more bombs or threats to public safety after he was caught . they cited ` worldwide revulsion over the recurring spectacle of botched executions , ' including one in oklahoma last month when the inmate was straining to lift his head off a pillow after supposedly being rendered unconscious . tsarnaev 's lawyers said the u.s. constitution 's protection against cruel and unusual punishment prohibits the application of the death penalty because it 's not authorized under massachusetts law . mind games : dzhokhar 's notes also implies that the interrogators told him that his brother tamerlan -lrb- pictured -rrb- was alive even though he had died during an earlier shoot out . the lawyers also asked the judge to bar federal prosecutors from arguing that targeting the crowded athletic event last year is a factor a jury should consider when weighing his possible punishment if he 's convicted . the lawyers said the decision to bomb the marathon should n't be an ` aggravating factor ' in determining whether he should receive the death penalty because prosecutors also argue he committed the offense after substantial planning to cause death and commit an act of terrorism . ` stated differently , the allegation that tsarnaev targeted the marathon is simply a more specific statement of the substantial planning allegation , ' tsarnaev 's lawyers wrote in a court filing . federal law requires the jury to reach its sentencing decision by weighing each aggravating factor cited by prosecutors against mitigating factors cited by the defense . tsarnaev 's lawyers said having duplicative aggravating factors ` can have no other effect than to introduce arbitrariness and unfairness into the jury 's sentencing deliberations . ' tsarnaev , 20 , has pleaded not guilty to several federal charges . prosecutors allege he and his brother , 26 , planted two pressure cooker bombs near the marathon 's finish line , killing three people and injuring more than 260 .", "summary": " dzhokhar tsarnaev was shot in the head , face , throat , jaw , hand and legs .   health ` suddenly declined ' after arriving at the hospital and had to undergo life-saving treatment .   his mouth was wired shut , left eye sutured shut , could not hear out of one ear and complained that he needed to vomit .   shortly after that , he was interrogated for 36 hours heavily medicated with prescription drugs including propoful and diluadid .   notes he took during the interrogation shows that he asked for a lawyer 10 times and the pen trailed off the page - suggesting he passed out or stopped being able to control his motor skills .   defense team has filed a motion to get the bedside confessions thrown out .
