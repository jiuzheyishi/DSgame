' a department for education spokesperson said : ` there is absolutely no place for extremism in schools . ` since 2010 we have taken a number of steps to strengthen our capability to deal with extremism in schools , including setting up a dedicated counter extremism unit within the department for education . ` we have also worked with ofsted to strengthen inspectors ' capacity to identify and report on extremism in schools . ` ofsted has inspected a number of schools in the light of recent allegations and will report to the secretary of state shortly . retired senior police officer peter clarke has been asked by the secretary of state to make a full enquiry into birmingham schools and will report back this summer .

' inspectors thought the school so good it went on to criticise local education authority birmingham city council because ` it has not done enough to help the school share its good practice with other schools in the city ' . at nearby washwood heath , students were found to be tolerant and well-behaved while there was consistently  strong leadership  from headteacher beverley mabey . inspectors concluded : ` they -lrb- students -rrb- know about risks related to religious extremism , sexual health , drug misuse , use of the internet and social media and different forms of bullying . ` students are taught to respect the things that make people different such as sexual orientation , appearance , ability and race . the park view school in birmingham - which is alleged to have been infiltrated by islamic extremists who are attempting to change the school . it has received the most scrutiny of the 21 schools alleged to be involved . ` students say that it is acceptable to be different at the academy . ' ofsted added the ` executive headteacher , and key members of the board of governors , have provided a strong lead on issues of religious extremism ' . numerous media reports , quoting anonymous sources , have claimed ofsted is poised to place several birmingham schools into special measures after inspections sparked by an unsigned letter purporting to contain details of the alleged takeover plot . claims have also emerged that concerns about the management of a school embroiled in the row were first raised with council officials as early as 2008 . the trojan horse letter , which was unsigned , undated and first sent to council officials and teaching unions late last year , has sparked several separate investigations including by birmingham city council and west midlands police . meanwhile , pvet which runs park view academy , nansen primary and golden hillock school , said it would not comment on speculative and ` highly irresponsible ' reports in the media based on ofsted reports which had not yet been published . highlighting the academic success of park view 's students , the trust said : ` if the inspectors who carried out both inspections at park view academy have ignored these achievements then we have to conclude that they are working to a different set of criteria than is normally used for an ofsted inspection . ' the so-called trojan horse plot first came to light earlier this year . department for education inspectors were ordered into park view school in birmingham along with its sister schools , golden hillock and nansen , after a letter dubbed ` trojan horse ' - now thought to be a hoax - was uncovered . it allegedly outlined a plot by muslim hardliners to drive moderate headteachers out of schools . whistleblowers at park view have claimed the school is in the hands of a group of extremists who infiltrated the governing body . it is alleged girls at the school were forced to sit at the back of the classroom and non-muslim pupils forced to teach themselves at the state school . the letter prompted separate ongoing investigations by both the department for education -lrb- dfe -rrb- and ofsted in to the school and several others in the area . police , the government and school inspectors are thought to be investigating alleged attempts by radicals to seize control of 20 schools in the city after claims of plot emerged in march . the dfe has also appointed its own education commissioner , the former head of the metropolitan police 's counter-terrorism unit peter clarke for the investigation . yesterday , six schools at the centre of an alleged islamist takeover plot are facing radical reform and even closure after being officially judged as failing , it emerged last night . a three-month inquiry has found the birmingham schools did too little to protect children from extremism and female staff were intimidated . one of the six , golden hillock , was rated ` inadequate ' in every criteria . a leaked copy of its ofsted report says ` staff views are polarised ' about leadership and that sex and relationships education has not been delivered properly . however , three were today given ` outstanding ' or ` good ' results by the education watchdog .", "summary": " fears over plot to infiltrate birmingham schools raised in 90s , it is claimed .   three schools said to have written to john major and education ministers .   claims of john ray , former official at golden hillock school , disputed today .   three other schools in area given ` good ' or ` outstanding ' ratings by ofsted .   ` trojan horse ' takeover is alleged plot by muslim extremists infiltrate schools .
