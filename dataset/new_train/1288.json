{"text": "click here to read the most damning allegations in the leaked ecb dossier . kevin pietersen has never been one to follow the norm , and on tuesday night he chose one of the world 's 100 most endangered buildings to launch the book charting the recent career of this endangered cricketer . the former england batsman found himself in a stunning franciscan monastery set , incongruously , in the unfashionable manchester suburb of gorton to publicise the autobiography that has lit bonfires around the national team . this late 19th century building has long since ceased to be a place purely for religious contemplation - it is now rented out for assorted functions - but it still seemed an appropriate place for him to stop to consider the latest chapter in his colourful life . kevin pietersen , pictured during the last ashes series , has told his side of the story in his new autobiography . gorton monastery in manchester , one of the world 's most endangered buildings , where pietersen spoke . by the time pietersen was introduced , in conversation with journalist tim hague , he was being buffeted by the appearance of an ecb dossier , which had mysteriously appeared online to coincide with this book launch . tuesday night was the first event of what might , in reality , be the last concerted blast of publicity for the wandering batsman , good or bad . his resurrected profile in the past week saw a late surge in interest , and it was standing room only in the cloisters with the monastery full to its 400-capacity . supplementing their number , and paying for their tickets , were representatives from the ecb , including one of m'learned friends in the governing body 's employ , just to keep an eye on things . a dossier of information on kevin pietersen put together by the ecb has been revealed . it was not long before pietersen brought out the heavy roller with reference to the home board . ` my character has been assassinated for five or six years by the ecb press machine , but i can go to bed at night and sleep easy , ' he said . this was the first time that he had put himself in the court of public opinion , and he got a warm enough reception from the gathering of cricketing enthusiasts , although it was hardly the one direction treatment . the five-page section of the ecb dossier draft is marked strictly privileged and confidential . after warming up , he lined up graeme swann in his sights , addressing the spinner 's decision to leave the ashes tour after three tests , something he omits in the book . ` do i think it 's right he jumped ship ? no , i think he let the england team down . a lot of the players felt very aggrieved by him jumping ship mid-series . ` if his elbow was an issue , fine , but i think he could have held on for a couple more weeks . ' never likely to escape was one of his main targets in the book , wicketkeeper and vice-captain matt prior , and laughter broke out when the big cheese label was brought up - ` the dairylea triangle who thinks he is brie ' . a truncated round of applause broke out when he addressed the issue of england players being ` picked on ' . he said : ` everyone knew there was a bullying culture in that dressing room . a lot of players have texted me in the past 24 hours saying  well done  . ' as his answers echoed around this former place of worship with its glorious acoustics -lrb- it was deconsecrated in 1989 -rrb- , the audience hung on his words . whether people like pietersen or not , they wanted to hear his every thought , even when credulity was stretched . ` if there was a podium for egos in the england team , i would n't be on it , ' he insisted . sitting 30 yards beneath a giant crucifix hung from the ceiling , persecution for stating his beliefs was a recurring theme . it had been a long day of broadcast appearances and he sounded tired , and somewhat resigned to his fate with england : ` i live in hope and i know a lot of people will think i have no chance , maybe rightly so . ' he reiterated his regret about textgate , of how he added to andrew strauss 's stress as england captain , and how he apologised to the skipper 's wife , ruth . batsmen pietersen spoke of his regret for adding to andrew strauss 's stress as captain of england . and another thing he kicks himself for : ` watching an ipl match on the television while we -lrb- england -rrb- were batting - bad move . it sounds funny but it was n't . ' it is one thing saying it in a book or on the radio , it is another saying it to a room of 400 people . the first 40 minutes of last night was serious stuff and somewhat joyless , not unlike much of the book . he seemed relieved to , latterly , get questions purely about his playing experiences . the mood lightened considerably when it was thrown open to the floor , with the people seemingly well-disposed towards him . a boy , announcing that he was 10 years old , asked what tips he might hand out about batting . ` if it 's up there , hit it into the car park , ' replied pietersen . and for a fleeting moment it seemed like 2005 again , everyone eating out of his hand .", "summary": " kevin pietersen launched new book in a stunning franciscan monastery .   former england batsman 's new autobigraphy has lit bonfires around the national team .   a dossier of information on pietersen put together by the ecb was leaked on tuesday .   document alleges pietersen disobeyed flower 's instructions ahead of second test by taking out two young players drinking until late .   ` my character has been assassinated for five or six years by the ecb press machine , but i can go to bed at night and sleep easy , ' said pietersen .
