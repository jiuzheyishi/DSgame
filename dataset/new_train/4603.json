{"text": "ronney jenkins can not be sure whether chronic traumatic encephalopathy is clawing through his brain tissue right now , but he suspects that it is . after all , he fits an emerging portrait of people diagnosed with the disease : a former professional football player who took lots of hits to the head -- a couple knocked him out -- and a life off the field that has begun to unravel .  my mood has changed ,  said jenkins , 36 , a soft-spoken former running back who played for several teams , including the san diego chargers .  sometimes i think i 'm going crazy .  jenkins began to suspect cte several years ago when an uncharacteristic dark mood and , occasionally , deep anger began to bubble up at unexpected times .  i 'd be talking to a cousin of mine , disagree with him , and i 'd just want to do something to him ,  jenkins said .  i do n't know why i had those thoughts , but i wanted to hurt him .  jenkins can not shake the feeling that these and other symptoms he has add up to cte , but he will never be sure . the only way to diagnose cte is after death -- by analyzing brain tissue and finding microscopic clumps of an abnormal protein called tau .  the problem is , people are diagnosing cte clinically all over the place ,  said robert stern , professor of neurology and neurosurgery at boston university school of medicine .  there is no framework to make that diagnosis while someone is alive .  stern and his colleagues want to change that . he is co-author of a new study that is beginning to describe what the disease looks like during life . the study , published wednesday in the journal neurology , suggests that when cte symptoms emerge at a young age , players more often exhibit behavioral and mood problems , whereas symptoms that begin later in life tend to show up as memory and thinking problems . family members and loved ones of 36 athletes -- 29 football players , three professional hockey players , one professional wrestler and three boxers diagnosed with cte after they died -- were quizzed about , among other things , the nature of the players ' cte symptoms and when they appeared . a tale of two former nfl players -- and their brains . according to those family reports , 11 players in the group first struggled with memory and decision-making , at an average age of 69 . twenty-two players first exhibited mood and behavior problems like depression and hopelessness or violent , explosive behavior . those players tended to be younger when they died , an average age of 51 . three players did not display any symptoms before being diagnosed with cte . it is too early in the research to know why some symptoms crop up early and others later -- and why the symptoms seem to diverge , or not show up at all , depending on the player . one theory among scientists is that where and how the damage manifests in the brain matters . for example , tau , which tends to be peppered in particular areas of the brains of people diagnosed with cte , could damage brain tissue at different stages of the disease , depending on the person .  there is no specific order of changes in cte ; it 's on a case-by-case basis ,  said stern , who is also the co-founder of the center for the study of traumatic encephalopathy .  it could be that some people have more initial changes to -lrb- brain -rrb- areas that are more responsible for mood and aggression and impulse control .  symptoms could also be explained by other changes in the brain , associated with repetitive brain trauma , that have nothing to do with tau or cte . junior seau had brain disease that comes from hits to head .  this disease remains somewhat mysterious in terms of exactly what its causes are and how it 's expressed ,  said dr. julian bailes , co-director of the northshore neurological institute and a cte researcher , who was not involved in the current study . but bailes says this study , though small and not generalizable for all cases of cte , adds to current knowledge about the disease . for example , the data did reveal other interesting patterns , particularly related to genetics . the study participants with cte were more likely than people without the disease to express the apoe gene , which is associated with slower recovery and worse cognition after traumatic brain injury ; it 's also associated with later development of alzheimer 's disease . stern and his colleagues know that their study sample is skewed : people who tend to donate a loved one 's brain to be studied for cte also tend to suspect a problem . and there is no formula for how many hits -lrb- or what type of hits -rrb- tip the balance toward symptomatic disease . there has also been no examination of what role things like steroids or body weight may play . even with those caveats , stern is confident that  eventually , clinicians will have the ability to diagnose the disease during life .  in the meantime , former players like jenkins are left in a fight against time and the progression of whatever brain disease their concussions may have wrought .  i 'm paying attention to things more ,  he said ,  and i 'm more worried about my health .  in the meantime , researchers of many disciplines are scrambling to define a disease that 's definition is elusive at best .  for perspective , alzheimer 's disease was first described in the first decades of the 1900s , and we still do n't have the ability to diagnose it definitively during life ,  stern said .  it still ca n't be cured , prevented or even slowed down .  both jenkins and stern hope that for cte , it will not be that long . nfl players association , harvard planning $ 100 million study .", "summary": " cte has been seen in brains of athletes who have taken a lot of hits to the head .   cte can be diagnosed only after death , but a new study begins to describe symptoms .   athletes with the disease exhibit behavioral and mood problems , as well as memory issues .
