' mr peck now plans to protest against the # 70 fine issued by the warden employed by southend council . mr peck , who lives with long-term partner , kathy , 68 , added : ` it was annoying because a couple of more able-bodied , younger men were laughing at my efforts to move the car rather than try to help me . ` it took an almighty effort to move the car - it must weigh a tonne - and i was absolutely shattered as it was one heck of an effort . destination : mr peck was just yards away from the car park entrance of his doctor 's surgery in leigh-on-sea , essex , when his car ran out of petrol and stalled in the middle of the road . rules of the road : mr peck was given the ticket for causing an obstruction to other motorists by blocking the carriageway on rayleigh road , pictured , in leigh-on-sea , essex . ' i got it as far as the sleeping policeman - the traffic hump in the road - and then i could not get any further . ` it was an amazing effort to push it as far as i did - and where it stopped certainly was not obstructing anybody and then i went to call kathy to bring some petrol from the lawnmower . ` as i was stood in the shop , the newsagent said  someone is fiddling with your windscreen  and by the time i got out to the car , the ticket had been slapped on there - i think he may have been on a scooter as it was that fast . ' derek kenyon , southend council 's parking manager , said : ` if anyone wishes to challenge a penalty charge notice , then there are set procedures to follow , laid down by the department of transport . ` if there is a claim that a vehicle has broken down , then we would need evidence to support that - such as the relevant repair bill or details from breakdown assistance services .
