{"text": "an nhs hospital has been found guilty of making bogus claims about the benefits of hypnosis for serious medical conditions . the royal london hospital for integrated medicine has been told to withdraw a leaflet it issued promoting hypnosis treatment for a number of conditions including mental health problems and irritable bowel syndrome . the hospital , whose patron is the queen , is part of the group of university college london hospitals nhs trust and calls itself the largest public sector provider of integrated medicine in europe . the royal london hospital for integrated medicine has been told to withdraw a leaflet promoting hypnosis treatment for serious conditions . apart from hypnosis , its clinicians offer various alternative medical therapies including homeopathy and acupuncture . a leaflet issued by the london hospital headed ` medical and clinical hypnosis ' made a number of impressive claims for the treatment . it boasted : ` hypnosis can benefit almost anyone to improve their physical , emotional and mental health . ' it then went on to provide a long list of conditions which it could help alleviate including problems with the immune , nervous and gastro-intestinal systems . the leaflet said hypnosis could also help sufferers with conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and dyspepsia . the benefits of hypnosis were questioned by a campaigning group called the nightingale collaboration which was set up to challenge claims made for quack treatments . it made a formal complaint to the advertising standards authority -lrb- asa -rrb- , which ruled that most of the hospital 's claims for hypnotherapy could not be substantiated . the leaflet said hypnosis could help sufferers with conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and dyspepsia . the hospital provided a raft of clinical studies and research papers to back up their claims , however these failed to satisfy the advertising watchdog . its decision calls into question the use of hypnosis in the nhs , where millions of pounds of public money is spent offering the controversial therapy . the asa said there is evidence that hypnotherapy can help relieve anxiety , confidence issues and minor skin conditions , but it said the hospital was wrong to make wider claims about improving mental and physical health . it said most of the trials and studies presented by the hospital to justify its claims were too small to provide meaningful conclusions . ` we concluded that the claim ` hypnosis can benefit almost anyone to improve their physical , emotional and mental health ' exaggerated the potential benefit to patients ' mental and physical health and was therefore misleading , ' it said . the hospital was told to withdraw the leaflet by the asa , which said most of the hospital 's claims could not be substantiated . similarly , the hospital was unable to provide convincing evidence of benefits for the immune , nervous or gastro-intestinal systems . the asa did side with the hospital over claims that hypnosis can help people cope with the effects of chronic pain , such as headaches , cancer pain and rheumatism . however , it banned the hospital from issuing the leaflet again and told executives to make sure that they have ` robust evidence ' to substantiate medical claims in any future publications . it said : ` in summary , we considered that the body of evidence provided by rlhim , as a whole , had supported the notion that hypnotherapy might help people to cope with and manage pain , and with perceived relief of pain . ` however , we considered that the leaflet had misleadingly implied more : that hypnotherapy could treat or cure the conditions listed , an interpretation for which we had not seen suitably robust evidence . ' the hospital said it took the asa ruling ` very seriously ' . it added : ` we will make the necessary changes to bring our patient information in line with their guidance . in the meantime we have withdrawn the leaflet concerned and have amended our website accordingly . ' two unrelated adverts which referred to jimmy savile have been ruled harmful and offensive following complaints that they made light of allegations of sexual abuse against the disgraced tv presenter . an email for clothing company dirtysmart read ` choose your fate ' with arrows pointing to a cartoon image of savile . one person complained that the ad was offensive and irresponsible because it made light of the allegations under investigation . another email for extreme publishing read ` how 's about that then ' in large print above a black and white image of savile wearing underwear and smoking a cigar with a superimposed copy of a magazine in his hand . two complainants challenged whether the ad was offensive and irresponsible in view of recent media coverage surrounding the abuse allegations . dirtysmart acknowledged that some people may have found the cartoon image of savile distasteful but they considered it would not cause serious or widespread offence . extreme publishing , trading as tbm magazine , said it did not intend to offend or upset anyone by sending the email . the -lrb- asa -rrb- said the adverts were likely to cause serious offence to some . it said : ` we told them to ensure they prepared their ads with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society , and to ensure they did not cause serious or widespread offence . ' a campaign for rowse honey has been banned for making a ` misleading ' claim that it is a natural source of slow release energy . the television advert , which screened in april last year , featured a boy squeezing honey on to his porridge before heading off to school where he was shown playing football and participating in lessons , while a voiceover said : ` rowse honey is a natural source of slow release energy for busy boys and girls . ' nine viewers complained that the slow release energy claim was misleading . defending the ad , rowse said it believed the term ` slow release energy ' implied the energy was delivered more slowly than a comparable food or ingredient . it believed rowse honey qualified for the claim because it was a significant source of fructose , pointing out that the european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- had said that ` fructose is more slowly absorbed in the gastro-intestinal tract than glucose ' . however the asa said it understood from its own expert foods were deemed to have a low gi when the value was 55 or below , noting that the rowse test gave a value of between 50 and 60 . it said : ` because the ad did not make clear that the consumption of rowse honey led to a lower blood glucose rise than the consumption of sucrose or glucose-containing foods , we concluded that the claim was misleading and therefore breached the code . ' it ruled : ` the ad must not be broadcast again in its current form .
