{"text": "voyager 1 appears to have at long last left our solar system and entered interstellar space ... or has it ? the spacecraft , which carries earthly greetings on a gold plated phonograph record , has travelled farther from earth than any other human-made object . its current mission , along with voyager 2 , is to explore the outermost edge of the sun 's domain and beyond . scroll down for video . a massive 36 years of scientific data generated by nasa 's voyager spacecraft has been transformed into a powerful piece of orchestral music . voyager 1 's current mission -lrb- illustrated -rrb- along with voyager 2 , is to explore the outermost edge of the sun 's domain and beyond . and now , maryland and boston university researchers say it has begun the first exploration of our galaxy beyond the sun 's influence . but this contentious claim is at odds with a recent report from nasa which claimed voyager 1 was still exploring the final frontier of our solar system . ` it 's a somewhat controversial view , but we think voyager has finally left the solar system , and is truly beginning its travels through the milky way , ' said maryland university research scientist marc swisdak . mr swisdak and fellow plasma physicists james drake , also of the university of maryland , and merav opher of boston university have constructed a model of the outer edge of the heliosphere . this artist 's concept shows nasa 's two voyager spacecraft exploring a turbulent region of space known as the heliosheath , the outer shell of the bubble of charged particles around our sun . in the 36th year after their 1977 launches , the twin voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft continue exploring where nothing from earth has flown before . their primary mission was the exploration of jupiter and saturn . after making a string of discoveries there -- such as active volcanoes on jupiter 's moon io and intricacies of saturn 's rings -- the mission was extended . voyager 2 went on to explore uranus and neptune , and is still the only spacecraft to have visited those outer planets . the current mission for both spacecraft , the voyager interstellar mission , is to explore the outermost edge of the sun 's domain and beyond . their model indicates voyager 1 actually entered interstellar space a little more than a year ago . but nasa and other scientists believe the spacecraft is still in a fuzzily-defined transition zone between the sun 's sphere of influence and the rest of the galaxy . the problem is scientists do not know exactly how far voyager 1 has to go to reach interstellar space . in reality , there is n't a clear boundary that defines the limits of our solar system 11 billion miles away . the sun 's pocket , also known as the heliosphere , is relatively well-understood as the region of space dominated by the magnetic field and charged particles emanating from our star . outside the heliosphere , interstellar space is filled with matter from other stars and the magnetic field present in the nearby region of the milky way . voyager is bathed in solar wind from the southern hemisphere flowing northward . the voyager 1 spacecraft explored a new region in our solar system called the magnetic highway . in this region , the sun 's magnetic field lines are connected to interstellar magnetic field lines , allowing particles from inside the heliosphere to zip away and particles from interstellar space to zoom in . according to conventional wisdom , scientists will know when voyager has passed through this mysterious boundary when they stop seeing solar particles and start seeing galactic particles . they will also be a change in the prevailing direction of the local magnetic field . the problem is nasa believes that the direction of magnetic fields in the solar bubble run in a different directional pattern to the fields found in interstellar space . the university of maryland argues that the magnetic fields inside and outside of the solar bubble run in the same direction . they claim that because of this , there is an area where the solar bubble and interstellar space overlap , meaning the limits of our solar system are closer and that voyager has already crossed it . voyager 1 is capable of returning scientific data from a full range of instruments , with adequate electrical power and attitude control propellant to keep operating until 2020 . in a statement nasa 's voyager project scientist , ed stone said : ` the fine-scale magnetic connection model will become part of the discussion among scientists as they try to reconcile what may be happening on a fine scale with what happens on a larger scale . ` the voyager 1 spacecraft is exploring a region no spacecraft has ever been to before . we will continue to look for any further developments over the coming months and years as voyager explores an uncharted frontier . ' voyager 1 and voyager 2 , which were launched in 1977 , are capable of returning scientific data from a range of instruments and have enough power to remain operational until 2020 . this artist 's impression shows how plasma flows around nasa 's voyager 1 spacecraft as it gets close to entering interstellar space .", "summary": " scientists claim voyager 1 entered interstellar space more than a year ago .   but nasa argues that the spacecraft is still in a fuzzily-defined transition zone between the sun 's sphere of influence and the rest of the galaxy .   debate has arisen because our solar system has no clear boundary .
