{"text": "washington a former high-ranking cia official who was involved in the iran-contra scandal has worked on an alleged ad hoc spy program that the pentagon is investigating , cnn has learned . duane  dewey  clarridge -- who was pardoned for his alleged role in the reagan-era scandal by president george h. w. bush in the waning hours of his presidency in 1992 -- is using contacts in afghanistan and pakistan to obtain information for the pentagon , according to former government officials familiar with the current program . they declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue . the pentagon has launched an assessment of the roles of at least three contractor companies with more than $ 20 million in contracts , according to pentagon officials . defense secretary robert gates wants to know if bounds were overstepped . he needs  a factual baseline from which to determine whether or not systemic problems exist ,  and how to fix them if they do , defense department spokesman geoff morrell said tuesday . the two-week survey will be led by a small team of senior military and defense department officials , he said . the assessment was prompted by an investigation -- currently under way -- into a program led by michael furlong , a defense department official who oversaw contracts aimed at gathering information about afghanistan and pakistan . the program was meant to be limited to gathering what is known as  open-source information ,  in which publicly available facts are gathered from , for example , local media and public events . some of the contractors with the program -- retired cia officers and former military commandos -- may have instead hired local agents to gather information on the specific locations and movements of particular individuals and passed it along to military officials for possible lethal strikes , according to government officials and private-sector businessmen familiar with the investigation . federal laws and regulations generally prohibit contractors from directly engaging in intelligence collection because it is considered a crucial government function . the pentagon is seeking to find out both whether the law was violated and whether funds were inappropriately diverted to conduct these alleged operations . furlong has denied wrongdoing .  this is something that i need to know more about , but we do have reviews and investigations going on to find out what the story is here , find out what the facts are , and if it 's necessary to make some changes , i 'll do that ,  gates said monday . documents provided to cnn detail sensitive information that contractors gathered , including word of a meeting between afghan president hamid karzai 's brother and mullah baradar , a top taliban leader who was arrested weeks later in pakistan . at another meeting with taliban commanders , an audio message from the reclusive leader mullah omar was played , in which he directed who would lead operations after a key member was captured . another document details the comings and goings at a safe house in kabul , afghanistan , used by suspected members of the haqqani insurgent network . concern within the central intelligence agency about the contract played a role in prompting the investigation , according to officials . rear adm. gregory smith , a spokesman for the u.s.-led force in afghanistan , told cnn last week that elements of furlong 's project were not clear .  there was ambiguity about how they were going to collect information ,  he said , and about whether afghans were to be used to do the work , and how the information might be used .  none of us were comfortable with what this contract meant . we wanted to know how they were going to glean information ,  smith said . smith said he subsequently terminated furlong 's effort last year because of his concerns . he estimates $ 6 million to $ 7 million of the funds allocated were spent and does not know what happened to the balance of the contract money . clarridge , the former cia official allegedly involved in the ad hoc spy ring , worked for the agency for 33 years , heading the agency 's latin american and european divisions and setting up its counterterrorist center in 1986 , according to a publisher 's weekly review of his book  a spy for all seasons .  he was indicted in 1991 on federal charges of lying to congress and the tower commission , which investigated the iran-contra affair , the review says . investigators said clarridge was the man who put then-marine col. oliver north in charge of sending money and weapons to anti-communist fighters in nicaragua in the 1980s , in contravention of congressional mandates . clarridge always maintained he was innocent , referring to the scandal as  the iran-contra nonsense ,  publisher 's weekly said .", "summary": " program used contractors to gather publicly available info in pakistan and afghanistan .   pentagon
