' eisenhower did go to normandy after his presidency , for the 20th anniversary observance . former president bill clinton was in normandy in 1994 for the 50th anniversary of the invasion of france . former president george w. bush , whose father is a world war ii hero , went to normandy for the 60th anniversary commemoration in 2004 . lyndon johnson , 20th anniversary , 1964 . johnson , in washington pushing for passage of the civil rights act of 1964 , delivered remarks to members of a d-day delegation , headed by gen. omar bradley : ` your country remembers and will never forget , the resolve born on that d-day , that , so long as we are able , and other men are willing to stand together , we shall not permit the light of freedom to be extinguished on any continent again . ... so let all the world know that when this nation has stood 2,000 years we shall not have forgotten the lands where our sons lie buried , nor the cause for which our sons died . where we have commitments to the cause of freedom , we shall honor them -- today , tomorrow and always . ' richard nixon , 30th anniversary , 1974 . nixon , in the throes of the watergate investigation and with impeachment hearings underway , sent general bradley once again to the ceremonies . five years earlier , nixon had issued a proclamation on the 25th anniversary calling the normandy assault ' a historical landmark in the history of freedom . ' he also met at the white house with former war correspondents who were on their way to france for the 25th anniversary observance . preparations and atmosphere for the normandy d-day landings 70th anniversary are seen in arromanches le bain , france . 91-year-old u.s. veteran edward tierney from brock berry , connecticut , who landed on june 14 , 1944 is seen here signing an autograph for two young reenactors . ronald reagan , 40th anniversary , 1984 . reagan spoke at the top of the cliffs of pointe du hoc , the atlantic ocean spread behind him and with 62 gray-haired surviving rangers seated before him . ` they shot rope ladders over the face of these cliffs and began to pull themselves up . when one ranger fell , another would take his place . when one rope was cut , a ranger would grab another and begin his climb again . they climbed , shot back , and held their footing . soon , one by one , the rangers pulled themselves over the top , and in seizing the firm land at the top of these cliffs , they began to seize back the continent of europe . two hundred and twenty-five came here . after two days of fighting , only 90 could still bear arms . ` behind me is a memorial that symbolizes the ranger daggers that were thrust into the top of these cliffs . and before me are the men who put them there . ' bill clinton , 50th anniversary , 1994 . clinton attended the 50th anniversary , delivering his remarks at the u.s. cemetery in colleville-sur-mer , france . his comments offer an ironic reference point to the europe that obama faces as he arrives in normandy on friday . ` fifty years later , what a different world we live in . germany , japan and italy , liberated by our victory , now stand among our closest allies and the staunchest defenders of freedom . russia , decimated during the war and frozen afterward in communism and cold war , has been reborn in democracy . ` and as freedom rings from prague to kiev , the liberation of this continent is nearly complete . now the question falls to our generation : how will we build upon the sacrifice of d-day 's heroes ? like the soldiers of omaha beach , we can not stand still . we can not stay safe by doing so . avoiding today 's problems would be our own generation 's appeasements . for just as freedom has a price , it also has a purpose , and its name is progress . ' american veteran frederick carrier reads the names of soldiers who died landing on utah beach at saint marie du mont . george w. bush , 60th anniversary , 2004 . bush went to normandy in 2002 to observe memorial day . he returned for the 60th anniversary , speaking at the u.s. cemetery and accompanied by french president jacques chirac . ` all who are buried and named in this place are held in the loving memory of america . we pray in the peace of this cemetery that they have reached the far shore of god 's mercy . and we still look with pride on the men of d-day , on those who served and went on . it is a strange turn of history that called on young men from the prairie towns and city streets of america to cross an ocean and throw back the marching , mechanized evils of fascism . ' barack obama , 65th anniversary , 2009 . obama recalled that his grandfather , a 26-year-old supply sergeant stationed near the english channel , crossed the channel six weeks after d-day and followed allied forces across france . ` at an hour of maximum danger , amid the bleakest of circumstances , men who thought themselves ordinary found within themselves the ability to do something extraordinary . ... that is the story of normandy -- but also the story of america ; of the minutemen who gathered on a green in lexington ; of the union boys from maine who repelled a charge at gettysburg ; of the men who gave their last full measure of devotion at inchon and khe san ; of all the young men and women whose valor and goodness still carry forward this legacy of service and sacrifice .
