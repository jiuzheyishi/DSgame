{"text": "alzheimer 's will be treated or even prevented by replacing faulty genes , an expert in the disease has predicted . men and women could be given a nasal spray packed with healthy versions of the defective genes that cause the illness . professor julie williams , of cardiff university , said the entire population could eventually be screened in middle-age to identify those at most risk of the memory-robbing disease . they could then be given cutting-edge gene therapy and other treatments to stop the disease ever developing . gene therapy : men and women could be given a nasal spray packed with healthy versions of the defective genes that cause alzheimer 's . alzheimer 's and other forms of dementia affect more than 800,000 britons , with the number expected to double in a generation as the population ages . existing drugs delay the progress of alzheimer 's , but their failure to tackle the underlying cause in the brain means that the effect quickly wears off and the disease soon takes its devastating course . the professor , who was given a cbe in the queen 's birthday honours last year for her work on alzheimer 's , made the prediction after jointly leading the biggest-ever study into the genetics of the disease . the landmark study , involving more than 180 researchers from 15 countries , pinpointed 11 genes that raise the risk of alzheimer 's . the size of the collaboration allowed them to identify more genes in less than three years than have been found in the past two decades . by taking the total to 21 , it also more than doubles the number of known alzheimer 's genes , the journal nature genetics reports . alzheimer 's charities said the ` exciting ' discovery of genes linked with the disease ` opens up new avenues to explore in the search for treatments for the condition ' . screening : professor julie williams says the entire population could eventually be screened in middle-age to identify those at most risk of the disease . the new genes were found by comparing the dna of more than 25,000 people suffering from alzheimer 's with that of 48,000 people without the disease . professor williams , who is chief scientific adviser to the welsh assembly in addition to being a working researcher , said : ` what surprised us most about the findings was the very strong pattern that showed several genes implicating the body 's immune system in causing dementia . ` each individual gene will carry a relatively low risk but when you put all the information together , they are telling us an interesting and novel story and that takes us in a new direction . ' she added that the find needs to be followed up with ` great urgency ' to determine just how the genes cause dementia . knowing this will speed the search for new drug treatments . medicine : existing drugs delay the progress of alzheimer 's , but fail to tackle the underlying cause in the brain . but another possibility is correcting the flawed dna , or the genetic variations that cause alzheimer 's , by giving people a nasal spray packed with healthy genes . professor williams said : ` i do think that in ten years ' time we might be looking at a genetic therapy . that might be feasible but not quite yet . ` if you have variation that you know is contributing to a disease , the most effective way of reducing the risk is to change the variation in a very precise way . genetic therapies will allow you to just change the elements that are contributing to the disease . ` drugs may not be precise and can cause side-effects . ' she added that ` in the distant future ' everyone in their 40s or 50s could be screened for dementia genes and given genetic therapy and other treatments in a bid to stop the disease ever developing . the study also suggested links between alzheimer 's and multiple sclerosis and parkinson 's disease . professor hugh perry of the medical research council , which part-funded the study , as did alzheimer 's research uk , said : ` understanding how our genetic code contributes to alzheimer 's disease , other dementias and neurodegenerative diseases is a crucial part of the puzzle in learning how we can prevent their devastating effects . '", "summary": " people could be given cutting-edge nasal spray packed with healthy genes .   researchers identified 11 key genes that raise the risk of alzheimer 's .   number of dementia sufferers expected to double as population ages .
