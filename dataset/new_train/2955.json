{"text": "if you set your alarm this morning for quarter-past ungodly -lrb- california time -rrb- to catch the predawn announcement of the oscars nominations , then we 're in the same twisted little club . the order of the oscars freaks . years before oscars handicapping became an official olympics sport -- what ? it 's not ? -- two fellow oscars-obsessed friends and i made an annual game of trying to predict who 'd get nominated . i never won -lrb- i tied once -rrb- , but i never lost my enthusiasm for it ; that is until every magazine and website came along with their own predictions and took the fun out of it . this year for old times ' sake we revived our game , only doing the best actor category because it 's been an impossibly full year of great male lead performances that have stumped the prognosticators . my 14-year-old nephew miles was in on it because he 's been a rabid oscar fiend since he was at least , oh , 12 . call out a category -- best actress say -- and a year -- 1966 -- and he 'll holler back  julie . christie , not andrews .  am i proud , or concerned ? today the results came in and we all tied with four corrects each , but with different names on our lists . jude must have known christian bale had the gale winds of  american hustle  at his back . david , a great strategist , and miles the scorsese devotee , both recognized leo dicaprio 's high standing with the academy , even if miles wo n't be seeing that film anytime soon , i pray . we all had faith in bruce , matthew and chiwetel -lrb- funny how we know them all by first name . -rrb- i held out for robert redford because , well , he 's redford , and because i 'm un-young . that should teach me to stop leading with my heart . but did anyone ever imagine that betting against mr. oscars himself , tom hanks , could pay off ? if i had i would have won for once . of course , oscar mania is not just about the horse race . it 's also the spectacle , the show around the show . the history . i 'm a diehard . i have n't missed an oscars since i got hooked as a teen . my favorite year was 1978 , the night jane fonda and jon voight took the best leads categories for  coming home .  justice ! glory ! as a professional plower of the fields of celebrity , with a license to fawn and gush -lrb- want to see my card ? -rrb- i 've attended the oscars , been inside the crimson cocoon , felt the collective shock when  shakespeare in love  beat  saving private ryan  for best picture . i 've stepped on a few gowns . not even the cruel realization that there are essentially two red carpets -- velvet stanchions separate the stars on one side from the rest of us attendees -- could squelch my blind and blinded-by-the-flashbulbs enthusiasm . but like most true believers i have my moments of doubt . if you are not in our little club , i get where you 're coming from . to the osc-nostics it is all too much , too little , and certainly , should you try to slog through the entire three-and-a-half hour ceremony on march 2 , too late . it is kind of preposterous : over-hyped , over-scored , overwrought . in poor oscar 's defense , for the past decade or so hollywood 's big night has had to suffer indignities that the academy of old could n't have imagined : dwindling viewership , the cultural-relevance supremacy of tv over movies , an attention deficit that just ca n't sit still for the live-action shorts category , acting and directing victories basically pre-called by critics and tweeters and bookies , james franco . there 's desperation in the air . oscar 's been trying too hard . this year 's host ellen degeneres will take care of some of that , i 'm sure . you never see her sweat . plus , there 's red carpet fatigue , as the oscars limp on high heels to the finish line of a bloated awards season as overextended as christmas and the nfl . critics ' awards , the people 's choice awards , the golden globes , the sag awards Ã¢ $  you can only cut to a reaction shot of jennifer lawrence so many times before it constitutes stalking . but is it oscar 's fault that everyone else wants in on the action ? i recognize the madness -- struggle with it -- but it 's hopeless . i just ca n't shake my addiction . will i sound like i 'm on the academy 's payroll if i argue that the oscars really are a great national tradition ? movies , of course , which might actually be getting better . and stars , our collective guilty delight . and glamor , maybe even a modicum of sophistication . and there are less-lofty traditions to savor : carping about his speech , dissing her dress . trying to catch a loser register a little disappointment . enduring campy production numbers with aerialists . dutifully filling out the ballots at your friend 's oscars party even if the only movie you saw that year starred adam sandler . it 's all part of the ritual . the knowing that it 's all too much , but the kind of too much that some of us just ca n't get enough of . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of tim allis .", "summary": " if you watched early morning oscars nominations , you 're in tim allis ' order of oscar freaks .   allis : it 's not just a horse race : oscar mania is the spectacle , the show , the history .   allis : academy of old could n't have imagined dwindling viewership , competition from tv .   despite its excesses , he says , oscars are a great national tradition , with a little magic .
