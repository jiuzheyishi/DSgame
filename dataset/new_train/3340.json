{"text": "doctors have warned that our unwavering love of bacon could be sending us to an early grave . figures released last week revealed that bacon sales in the u.s. rose by nearly 10 per cent last year to an all time record of $ 4 billion . and research by pork supplier supplier smithfield found that 65 per cent of americans were behind the idea of making bacon the country 's ` national food ' . figures released last week revealed that bacon sales in the u.s. rose by nearly 10 per cent last year to an all time record of $ 4 billion . but doctors say unprocessed meat increases the risk of heart disease , cancer and diabetes . but medical experts have repeatedly warned of the dangers of eating too much processed meat , as it has been linked to cancer , diabetes and heart disease . worse still , the legendary pairing of bacon and maple syrup is even more damaging , harvard scientists have warned . they say when bacon or sausages are combined with sugar , this makes our craving for the meat worse - a phenomenon known as ` food trifecta ' . this is defined as the irresistible trio of fat , salt , and sugar , live science reports . previous research has pinpointed the exact chemical reaction that makes bacon so smell so tempting . called the maillard reaction , it occurs between an amino acid and a reducing sugar when heated . the acid and sugar react to release a huge amount of smells and flavour that make us salivate . the legendary pairing of bacon and maple syrup is even more damaging , experts warn . they say when bacon or sausages are combined with sugar , this makes our craving for the meat worse - a phenomenon known as ` food trifecta ' another theory is that the meat has a special savoury taste called ` umami ' . this is the japanese word for the fifth basic sense of taste , after bitter , salty , sour and sweet - and is the main reason why we like foods such as cheese , bacon and soy sauce . but experts are increasingly concerned about how much processed meat we are all eating . researchers from the harvard school of public health have found that eating processed meat , such as bacon , sausage or processed deli meats , was associated with a 42 per cent higher risk of heart disease and a 19 per cent higher risk of type 2 diabetes . previous research has pinpointed the exact chemical reaction that makes bacon so smell so tempting . called the maillard reaction , it occurs between an amino acid and a reducing sugar when heated . the acid and sugar react to release a huge amount of smells and flavour that make us salivate . elin . roberts , of the centre for life education centre in newcastle , . explained the reaction releases hundreds of smells and flavours , but it . is the smell which reels in the eater . ` if we could n't smell , then taste would n't be the same . ' but they did not find any higher risk of heart disease or diabetes among individuals eating unprocessed red meat , such as from beef , pork , or lamb . researcher renata micha said : ` when we looked at average nutrients in unprocessed red and processed meats eaten in the united states , we found that they contained similar average amounts of saturated fat and cholesterol . ` in contrast , processed meats contained , on average , four times more sodium -lrb- salt -rrb- and 50 per cent more nitrate preservatives . ' this suggests that differences in salt and preservatives , rather than fats , might explain the higher risk of heart disease and diabetes seen with processed meats , but not with unprocessed red meats . ' salt is known to increase blood pressure , a strong risk factor for heart disease . in animal experiments , nitrate preservatives can promote hardening of the arteries and reduce glucose tolerance , effects which could increase risk of heart disease and diabetes . to lower . risk of heart attacks and diabetes , people should consider which types . of meats they are eating , she said . ` processed meats - such as bacon , salami , sausages , hot dogs . and processed deli meats - may be the most important to avoid . based on . our findings , eating one serving per week or less would be associated . with relatively small risk . ' last year , a massive number-crunching exercise has revealed that . dishes with bacon really do taste better - and very few taste worse . tech magazine wired teamed up with the food network to analyse 50,000 recipes and 906,539 comments on them . last year , a massive number-crunching exercise revealed that dishes with bacon - sandwiches in particular - really do taste better . explaining . how the results were calculated , wired writer cliff kuang said : ` first , . we searched out all the recipes that fit a certain description - . sandwiches , for example . ` then , we calculated the average rating for those foods if they did not include the word  bacon .  ` we . ran the numbers again using only recipes that did include bacon . of all . the foods we analysed , bacon lends the most improvement to sandwiches . ' many . other dishes also got a boost when bacon was added - when the data was . analysed , those with with a rasher or two included got better scores . there . are various theories as to why - not least because of the crunch and . flavour bacon adds to sandwiches . it 's also a good addition to salads - . providing it does n't go soggy . recipes with spinach and asparagus were all rated better when they contained bacon , for example . but . it was n't all good news . there are foods that get worse with bacon - . namely pasta -lrb- particularly in creamy sauces -rrb- and , rather unsurprisingly , . desserts .", "summary": " u.s. sales rose by nearly 10 % last year to an all-time record of $ 4 billion .   but doctors say bacon raises the risk of cancer , heart disease and diabetes .   this may be due to the salt and preservatives in it .   researchers add that combining it with maple syrup makes us crave it more .
