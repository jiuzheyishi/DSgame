{"text": "bali , indonesia nestled among the lush forests of bali , near the hill town of ubud , is one of the island 's most remarkable villages . it 's not just that each of the 18 homes of green village is constructed almost entirely from bamboo , but the form they take . from vast spiral staircases to a river-spanning bridge leading to the door of the newest house , the designs are more akin to luxury mansions than jungle huts . the exclusive abodes are part of creative director elora hardy 's masterplan for sustainable , luxury living . as the daughter of john hardy -- who set up bali 's green school to educate a new generation of environmentally responsible students -- she and her team of designers and architects are also committed to changing common perceptions of what sustainability means .  the first step -lrb- for us -rrb- is to create sustainable luxury living and different a mindset ,  says green village architect defit wijaya . read more : why emeralds make some of us mad with desire . centered around a communal area but separated by discreet gardens , the villas are open to the elements adding to each of the homes ' sense of space and light and affording some beautiful views of the surrounding forests and rushing ayung river below . while some families live in the village , some homes are luxury retreats and can cost between $ 500,000 and $ 2million . the latest and largest structure lies on the other side of the river with its five stories towering above the forest canopy . lucky guests traverse a glass and bamboo bridge to reach the villa 's front door , itself a revolving glass oval . clever design and roll-down shutters help protect those inside from rainstorms , while banana paper for interior walls and some aluminum for roofing are generally the only concessions to non-bamboo materials . simplicity then is a key design element but it has n't restricted some non-organic basics , with electricity and high-end kitchen fittings standard throughout the buildings . wijaya 's next project is to build a house with a 15-meter roof span -- twice as big as the largest so far -- and without any central columns . read more : beauty from the crypt - mystery of europe 's jeweled skeletons .  this is the future . it 's pure architecture ... to breathe fresh air and touch nature , that 's everything .  much like any other house anywhere , some running repairs have to be made on small non-structural pieces of the homes . but the largest structural bamboo logs could last a lifetime , says mokoho sumerta , the chief builder from the nearby bamboo factory .  we treat each piece of bamboo with a mixture of water and boric acid to stop fungus and insects . before doing this a bamboo structure would last only seven years , now we 're not sure how long a building can last .  around 200 farmers across the island are paid to grow bamboo on areas of their land not used for agriculture . some of the largest logs are 25 meters long but only take 3 years to grow . the angle of the main structural logs is also important to minimize the impact of direct sun and rain , which can weaken them . but the magnificent designs show another side of bamboo that those connected to the project , like operational director patrick how , hope will be a greater legacy .  many people still think bamboo is cheap and only for small buildings , but we 're showing it can be used to make high houses and really redefine how the material is used .  read more : high art meets the high-street at neon-lit miami beach .", "summary": " bali 's green village sets a precedent for high-end design and sustainable architecture .   locally sourced bamboo used to create million dollar luxury villas .   project aims to change mindsets and push boundaries of design and architecture .
