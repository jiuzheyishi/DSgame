{"text": "turks have picked prime minister recep tayyip erdogan to be the country 's first directly elected president . erdogan secured 52 % of the votes in the first round of the presidential election , narrowly avoiding a runoff , according to turkish election board . turkey is a parliamentary democracy and the prime minister is the head of its government . the president 's role is more formal , and represents the country as the head of the state -- similar to the queen in the uk . but erdogan has already indicated he would like to see more powers being transferred to the presidential palace , speaking about a  new era  in his victory speech .  with the president elected directly by the citizens , all barriers between the people and the presidential palace have been removed ,  he was reported as saying in his speech by the turkish media . here is what you need to know about the historic election . why does erdogan want to be president if he is more powerful as prime minister ? the former mayor of istanbul and the leader and co-founder of the justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- came to power in 2003 and has been serving his third term as prime minister . while the constitution would have allowed erdogan to run again when his term finishes next year , his own party rules prohibited him from seeking fourth term . his transition to presidency was seen as a logical step for a politician who wanted to maintain political power . karabekir akkoyunlu , researcher at the london school of economics , said the country 's constitution -- drawn up by the military junta in 1982 -- gave the head of state significant authority . erdogan , akkoyunlu said , would likely push those to the limit by  invoking the ` national will ' he claims to embody .  what issues will he face next ? the kurdish peace process is one of the most pressing issues of the coming months . turkey passed a law in july establishing a legal framework for peace talks with the kurdish militants to end three decades of insurgency .  the kurdish peace process is also linked with regional dynamics and the rise of the islamic state , which is now threatening the kurds in northern iraq and syria ,  akkoyunlu said . erdogan will also have to work with the government in trying to tackle turkey 's economic troubles . the imf and oecd have both warned turkey 's economy remains vulnerable to dangers outside its borders . high inflation , low employment and the country 's chronic inequality are putting it at risk . who else was running ? the main opposition parties , the republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- and the nationalist movement party -lrb- mhp -rrb- had nominated ekmeleddin ihsanoglu as their joint candidate . the former secretary general of the organization of islamic cooperation -lrb- oic -rrb- was campaigning on the idea of national unity and secured 38 % of the vote . selahattin demirtas , a left-wing politician popular with turkey 's kurdish minority , ran for the peoples ' democratic party -lrb- hdp -rrb- and finished third with 10 % . around 25 % of people in turkey identify themselves as kurdish . why does this matter ? turkey 's geographical position and cultural make-up has contributed to the country being seen as a powerful bridge between asia and europe . its membership of nato and candidacy to join the european union reflect its importance . the country 's $ 800 billion economy is among the 20 biggest in the world and attracts $ 200 billion in foreign direct investment every year . turkey also plays a key role in the middle east , bordering syria , iraq and iran . read more : how turkey turned into economic mess . opinion : turkey 's teflon politician targets top post . john defterios : erdogan looks to secure his place in history .", "summary": " turkish pm recep tayyip erdogan has won the country 's first direct presidential election .   the president 's role is more formal , he represents the country as the head of the state .   but erdogan has already indicated he will seek more powers as the president .
