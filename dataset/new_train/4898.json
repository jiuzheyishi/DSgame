{"text": "people visit jerusalem for the rich history , interwoven religious narratives and crumbling holy walls . they visit europe for ornate churches with painted ceilings and golden trim . they visit india for peace of mind , finding serenity in its carved and colorful temples scattered along the sacred ganges river . but people rarely travel the u.s. in search of such sanctuaries . after all , what religious wisdom could america , a country still in its youth at 236 years old , have to offer ? although the country may not have a reputation for religious landmarks , america is home to more than just secular city halls and strip malls . whether or not you practice a faith , visiting these beautiful and historic u.s. religious spots may provide inspiration . bahá ' í house of worship in wilmette , illinois . this bahá ' í house of worship is one of just seven bahá ' í temples in the world and is the only of its kind found in north america . it 's just 30 minutes north of chicago in wilmette , illinois . although the house of worship was created with a mixture of quartz and cement , the intricately carved temple looks as if it 's made of white lace . like all bahá ' í houses of worship , the circular temple has nine sides and is surrounded by fountain-filled gardens . the temple services members of the bahá ' í faith , a religion founded in 19th-century persia that stresses unity of all humankind . anyone is welcome to visit the space -- its auditorium and gardens are open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day free of charge .  we do n't ask what your religion is -- we do n't even care ,  the temple 's summer tour coordinator , gwendolyn clayborne , said .  it 's a place for people to come and meditate and pray and just get in touch with their spiritual sides .  clayborne said people are surprised such a temple , which was completed in 1953 and took more than 30 years to construct , can be found in illinois .  a few people from chicago will admit it 's the best kept secret ,  clayborne said . hsi lai temple in hacienda heights , california . with its traditional chinese design , this buddhist temple looks like it came from the far east . although it was completed in 1988 , the temple 's architecture is faithful to the ming and ch ` ing dynasties , which ruled in china from the 14th to 20th centuries . the hsi lai temple features golden tiles in its buildings , protective figurines on its roof and a peaceful courtyard at its center . a bird 's - eye view shows the building is shaped like a bodhi leaf , symbolic of the tree under which the buddha attained enlightenment . inside the temple , an art gallery includes both eastern and western paintings , ceramics , photographs and buddhist artifacts .  people come here and say , ' i do n't know i 'm in southern california . it seems i am in another part of the world , '  said the temple 's director of outreach , miao hsi . the temple is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day free of charge , and tours are offered on weekends . for a $ 7 donation , visitors can enjoy the temple 's chinese vegetarian buffet . islamic center of america in dearborn , michigan . although it is a modern mosque in michigan , inspiration for the islamic center of america came from venerable houses of worship in turkey , india and other countries . with a stone-carved edifice and fiberglass dome , the mosque 's design is distinct . inside , visitors will find crystal chandeliers , imported granite and a prayer room decorated with islamic motifs and calligraphy of quranic verses created by a lebanese artist .

of america has been serving america 's muslims since 1962 . guests often are impressed with the mosque 's beauty , but what they are most awed by is the center 's openness , said kassem allie , the center 's executive administrator .  what people are kind of surprised about is we are so open to visitation and dialogue and collaboration ,  he said .  i think they think we 're a closed organization . ... they find out who we are and the fact that we have an open house .  the islamic center of america is open to visitors from 9 a.m. to about 11 p.m. daily and free tours of the facility can be scheduled on its website . memorial presbyterian church in st. augustine , florida . memorial presbyterian church may be beautiful , but it 's the story behind the building that often touches visitors the most . the church is dedicated to jenny louise benedict , the daughter of tycoon henry morrison flagler , who built the church in 1889 . flagler had always had a special place for st. augustine in his heart , investing heavily in the city after visiting with his first wife , mary . and when his beloved daughter died after complications from childbirth , flagler knew the presbyterian church he was planning to build in town would be erected in her honor . flagler , along with mary , jenny louise and his granddaughter , marjorie , are all entombed at the church . the structure 's detailed design draws influence from the churches of europe , including venice 's st. mark 's basilica . it features wood-carved walls , stained-glass windows , a peaceful sanctuary and a prominent dome that inspires guests to lift their eyes toward the heavens .  people walk in , and they see a little piece of europe ,  church historian jay smith said .  i would n't say it rivals the european cathedrals , but it has its own unique beauty and majesty , and people are very surprised by that .  smith said people must remember to appreciate the rich history of memorial presbyterian church and the city that surrounds it . founded in 1565 , st. augustine is the longest continually inhabited city founded by europeans in the u.s. memorial presbyterian church is open to visitors from

the building feature an impressive rose garden , a fountain , thousands of different bushes and a lotus-filled lake . it 's hard to believe this exquisite palace , which opened in 1979 , was initially intended to be just a simple house . in 1973 , west virginia devotees of the international society for krishna consciousness , a hindu organization more commonly known in the u.s. as the hare krishna movement , had decided to build a home for their leader , srila prabhupada . but when prabhupada died in 1977 , the disciples ' course of construction changed , and they began instead to build a

dedicated in 1893 , took 40 years to construct . except for some of its hardware and glass , the temple was built completely of native materials . with five floors , six spires -- the tallest standing at 210 feet -- and a granite facade , the structure is definitely imposing . salt lake temple is at the heart of temple square , three blocks containing nearly 20 attractions significant to latter-day saints ' life and history , such as assembly hall and the salt lake city tabernacle . in 2011 , temple square saw about 2,750,000 visitors from all over the world . and for those not allowed inside

known as a place of retreat , monsignor robert ritchie said .  it 's kind of an oasis of quiet inside the hustle and bustle of the surrounding area ,  ritchie said .  it 's a place people can go with their problems , a place where people can just go and look at some beautiful scenery , a place where people can pray .  open from 6:30 a.m. to 8:45 p.m. daily , the church welcomes visitors . free
