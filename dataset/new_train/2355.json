{"text": "abraham lincoln once said ,  in life , what counts is the size of a man 's heart , not the size of his disproportionate willie .  lo , there was an awkward moment of silence among those standing in the open shower at the old white house crossfit gym , as the 16th president nervously added ,  i 'm serious , guys . that 's what counts . seriously .  but despite lincoln 's largely unknown and forgotten  wee-man-cipation proclamation  -- which i may have just completely made up -- a recent study appears to have proven this belief scientifically incorrect . yes , gentlemen , when it comes to the preference of heterosexual women , perhaps our worst fear is true . size does matter . at least according to a new study that quickly found its way around the internet . because , of course it did . we like this kind of stuff -- anything about genitals or cats . whereas , if they found a cure for cancer , maybe six people would give it a tweet .  they cured cancer . but check out this cat ! lol . #kitteh  you 're all weirdo sinners . and i like that . the big buzz about this study started when research results appeared this week in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences . which is one of those fancy journals where normal people understand about every 15th word . and even fewer if you cheated your way through mr. ware 's high school physiology and anatomy class .  psst . what bone is this ?   dude , bellini , that 's not a bone . that 's your pencil .  the point is that it 's a super-science-y journal . and it 's difficult to read . but , on the plus side , for those of us more intellectually suited to watching a good episode of  cops ,  if you sound out the publication 's acronym , pnas , it makes a delightfully funny word that brings us right back to the topic at hand . package size . and why it matters . brian mautz , an american biologist now at the university of ottawa , was the lead author of the study , and conducted his research while in australia . which i believe completely invalidates the results . not for any particularly scientific reason , but it helps me sleep at night . even conan o'brien took solace in the technicality :  the good news ? my wife is n't australian .  regardless , just how does one come to a scientific , unbiased conclusion on the importance of large manhood ? you know , without mixing in other result-skewing personal features like a lush ginger beard and a bald head . those kind of horrible things . well , that 's where the computer models come in . down in australia , 105 lucky ladies were asked to rate the sexual attractiveness of about 50 life-sized computer-generated , naked male figures with different body structures . some were tall . some were short . some were thin . some of them may have been john candy . -lrb- full images of the figures here . warning : featureless , gray full-frontal -rrb- . we 'll never know , because the gray-colored figures did not possess any other features . just unique body types and varying amounts of speedo filler . the figures were then projected on a screen so the women could rate them from 1 to 7 . which absolutely bothers me . all rating scales should go to 10 . i 'm a metric guy , and it 's just the natural order of things . especially when it comes to rating attractiveness . otherwise , there 's not enough wiggle room for minor beauty flaws . like fuzzy earlobes . always a three-point deduction . but never mind such little things . for these women , overall height and body shape seemed to be the most important factors . which is n't a big surprise . however , a man 's nether region was definitely an important factor . and as the overall size down below increased , so , too , did the sexual attractiveness scores . the women also spent more time actually staring at the goods . which is so rude . hello ? our eyes are up here ! just kidding . enjoy the view . we 'll just watch some baseball . but here 's the thing . for taller men , size was even more important . quite simply , it 's a matter of proportion . when your canvas is bigger , waldo is harder to find . that said , if it actually looks like waldo , you need to see a doctor . today , if they can schedule you in . -lrb- but put it on reddit first . they 're into that . mega up-votes ! -rrb- . now , for shorter men , being bigger downstairs was also important . but only when compared to other short men . if you bring a taller man into the mix , not even an actual ponderosa pine will help you compete . though you might make it on tv . sadly , even if the tall guy has but a sapling , he still has the advantage . so long as he 's fit . because , under these scientific conditions , that 's still the biggest factor . body shape . fortunately , though , humans are n't computer-generated gray figurines projected on walls . we have skin . and hair . and courtside seats to the lakers . and that 's what really counts . just as long as you do n't have fuzzy earlobes .", "summary": " new study confirms that when it comes to male anatomy ,  size does matter    computer-generated male figures were shown to australian women .   overall body figure is still most important , but males with bigger appendages were rated higher .
