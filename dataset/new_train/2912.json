{"text": "the enthusiasm gap between football fanatics and those who ca n't tell a raven from a falcon can widen into a chasm come super bowl sunday . it 's hard to resist a nationwide party , so you 'll find the clueless mingling with the season ticket holders , which can lead to bitterness from both quarters when apathy meets with bone-crushing enthusiasm . as a colleague wrote in an e-mail upon discovering that a friend who does n't care for football was hosting a super bowl party ,  i think it 's totally annoying and now i have to find a reason to tell you to keep your chips and dip to yourself because i do n't want to constantly listen to you ramble on while i 'm trying to watch the game . wan na have a party ? then have one . just do n't hijack my super bowl . i 'm about to go into mourning about football season being over .  plenty of non-fans are perfectly comfortable taking a pass and indulging in an alternate activity on game day . many hosts are warm and welcoming to guests who do n't know a blitz from a drop kick -lrb- so long as they bring a sufficiently chilled six-pack or a semi-competent guacamole -rrb- . but the occasional  shush ! i 'm trying to hear jerome boger 's call !  is bound to happen . granted , any thematic gathering stands a chance of widening the gulf between devotees and dilettantes . there 's always the blowhard at the oscars party rolling his eyes , delivering a dull indictment of celebrity culture and yammering on about not having seen any of the films -lrb- all while hogging the artichoke dip -rrb- . that 's a pretty serious fumble in the decency department . so how about a little teamwork this sunday ? here are tips on how not to ruin a super bowl party for those disinterested in the game yet game for a celebration . opinion : i hate , hate super bowl parties . for the non-fan : . keep off the field of play . if you go to the beach and you spend the whole time crabbing about sand between your toes while the rest of your friends are frolicking , perhaps you 're meant for the museum or the mall instead . it 's not fair to bring everyone else down just because football is n't your bag . have a  me  day , indulge in something you love -lrb-  law & order  marathon ? puppy bowl perhaps ? -rrb- and console or celebrate with the gang after the game . perform some drills . dig the company , but know you 'll be bored stiff even before kickoff ? assign yourself a labor-intensive task that will benefit everyone . assemble a 47-layer dip , serve up freshly made guacamole to order or squeeze a few dozen limes to ensure everyone 's margaritas stay replenished . just clear it with the host beforehand , and everybody wins . consult your bookie . not into the game , but want to get your share of chicken wings and halftime hijinks ? while it would be terribly rude in most other social circumstances , feel free to retreat to a quiet corner with a book or the -lrb- quiet -rrb- communication device of your choice . just remember to look up and smile every once in a while -lrb- especially if you 've been dragged there as someone 's plus one -rrb- so you are n't just remembered as that party pooper who spent the whole time scowling . rally an ally . around bowl time , the internet abounds with articles about how to sound like you know what you 're talking about at a super bowl party . that seems exhausting . while the assembled masses might not have time or patience for your questions about what 's happening on the gridiron , there 's bound to be at least one person dying to take you under his or her wing . keep that person 's nacho plate topped off and he/she will be your no. 1 fan . hut or shut up . perhaps you think football is dull , barbaric or hopelessly unsophisticated . there 's an awesome place where you can go and yelp about that to your heart 's content : it 's called the internet , and it 's right there in your pocket . feel free to tweet , comment or text your heckling to the sympathetic masses -- which might be rather passive-aggressive , but at least you 're not out-loud harshing the buzz of the folks who were kind enough to let you take up couch space . for the host : . kick it off properly . are casual or non-fans welcome ? if your aim is to party down with only the die-hards , -lrb- politely -rrb- make that clear in the invitation so less-fanatical friends can make alternate plans . make room on the sidelines . if your gathering is going to be split between die-hard football fans and folks who are just in it for the dip and halftime nip slips , consider drawing some clear lines on the field of play . this might mean you 'll have to clean up your bedroom or den , but that 's a small price to pay for peace . draft backup hosts . you might be the best host in the history of the game , and have all your bases covered -lrb- apologies for the mixed sports metaphor -rrb- , but accept offers of help if you can . the guest might simply be at a loss for something to do . consider tasking them with beer runs , cheese grating or dish duty and consider it a victory for your mad hospitality skills . are you a non-fan who plans to attend a super bowl party with die-hard fans ?
