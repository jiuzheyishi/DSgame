{"text": "a breakthrough by british scientists could lead to new treatments for the most common form of arthritis . researchers have discovered eight sections of our dna that are responsible for osteoarthritis , the crippling incurable condition that affects millions . crucially , they think that at least two or three of these so-called ` genetic regions ' could be used to treat the illness . the research , carried out by scientists at the university of newcastle , could lead to new treatment for thousands of arthritis sufferers . they all contain genes responsible for the production of cartilage , the tissue between bones that is damaged by osteoarthritis . the scientists from the university of newcastle believe that in future they could alter patients ' genes to make them produce stronger cartilage , helping to repair the damaged joints . around 8.5 million britons suffer from osteoarthritis and it is believed to affect as many as 40 per cent of the over-70s . it causes debilitating joint pain -- particularly in the hips and knees -- and often leaves patients immobile or unable to walk long distances . at present there is no cure and patients can only alleviate their symptoms with drugs , physiotherapy or in severe cases through surgery to remove the affected joint . the study , published in the lancet , looked at 7,400 patients with osteoarthritis and compared their dna to 11,000 people without the disease . the team found eight sections of our dna that are responsible for osteoarthritis . although the authors acknowledge that it will be at least five or ten years before they are close to a treatment , they say the findings are an important ` first step ' . professor john loughlin , who led the research , said : ` we 've identified eight regions of human genomes that increase the risk of the disease . ` we would dearly like to use the information gathered to enable patients ' cells to be modified to ensure they make better cartilage . but it 's a long way off . our results do n't enable us to do that at this point and it 's not something that anybody who has got the disease now can hope for . ` it 's a major breakthrough , the largest study of its kind performed in this world to date . ` we 're trying to work out now exactly what these genes are doing and what is going wrong . ' he said it was not possible yet to use their findings to carry out genetic tests to predict who was more at risk from the illness . scientists have known for many years that osteoarthritis runs in families . but until now they knew of only three genetic regions that increased the risk of the illness . they have now identified a further eight . professor alan silman , medical director of arthritis research uk , said : ` there is no cure for osteoarthritis yet it affects millions of people around the world . ` for 60 years we have known that you are twice as likely to have osteoarthritis if your parents have the disease , yet we have n't known why . ` until we understand the cause of this complex disease , we can not hope to find a cure . ` this is a major breakthrough in our understanding of osteoarthritis which we hope will help us to unlock the genetic basis of the disease . ' osteoarthritis is notoriously difficult to diagnose , with patients waiting an average of almost three years to be diagnosed and referred for treatment , according to a recent report by arthritis care . the number of britons suffering from the crippling condition is expected to double over the next 20 years due to the ageing population and higher levels of obesity , reaching 17million by 2030 , according to the charity . a third of sufferers are forced to retire early or substantially reduce the numbers of hours they work , because of the condition . it is estimated to cost the economy # 3.2 billion in lost working time .", "summary": " breakthrough made by researchers at the university of newcastle .   around 8.5 million britons suffer from osteoarthritis .
