{"text": "five birmingham schools declared failing by inspectors in the wake of the alleged ` trojan horse ' takeover plot by hardline muslims have still not improved , ofsted has warned . in the first update following inspections earlier this year , the watchdog 's chief sir michael wilshaw said that ` too much poor practice remained unchallenged during the summer term ' . ofsted also found it has taken too much time to appoint new governors and senior leaders at these schools , meaning that ` very little action ' has been taken to address the serious concerns raised . scroll down for video . sir michael wilshaw has said too little has been done to tackle ` poor practice ' in schools at the centre of the ` trojan horse ' extremism scandal in birmingham , which emerged earlier this year . ofsted said that the segregation of boys and girls at park view academy has not been tackled . in one case , at park view academy , ` little had been done ' to tackle segregation between the sexes , and encourage boys and girls to sit together in lessons and share ideas , inspectors warned . at another school , golden hillock , teenagers studying for a gcse in re ` have to teach themselves for options other than islam ' , ofsted said , leaving students at a ` significant disadvantage ' . and at another school , oldknow academy in small heath , trustees were kept in the dark about a controversial trip to saudi arabia involving pupils . ofsted said : ` worryingly , trustees were not aware that a visit to saudi arabia had taken place this year for pupils and staff , despite a similar trip last year receiving criticism from inspectors at the previous inspection due to failures in safeguarding . ` indeed , they had been told by senior leaders that the visit had been cancelled . ' oldknow came under fire in june after banning ` un-islamic ' tombolas and raffles at a fete and has now seen parents withdrawing their children from acts of collective worship , the new report found . responding to the latest report , shadow education secretary tristram hunt said : ` it is utterly incomprehensible that , six months after these serious concerns became public , david cameron 's government has still not taken action , putting children at risk from radical , hardline agendas and damaging school standards . ` it is gross negligence from the prime minister and his tory-led government and they must urgently explain their inaction . ' gcse re students at golden hillock school have to teach themselves about religions other than islam . pupils at oldknow academy have been taken on another trip to saudi arabia this year , despite criticism for a similar move in the past . in june , ofsted issued a damning verdict on the running of a number of birmingham 's schools and declared five failing , placing them into special measures . these schools were golden hillock school , nansen primary school and park view academy - all run by the park view educational trust -lrb- pvet -rrb- , as well as oldknow academy and saltley school . four separate probes were conducted into the allegations in birmingham , which were originally sparked by the ` trojan horse ' letter - now widely believed to be a hoax - that referred to an alleged plot by hardline muslims to seize control of a number of school governing boards in the city . following the publication of the investigations into the trojan horse scandal , ministers announced that in future , all schools will be required to ` actively promote ' british values such as democracy , tolerance , mutual respect , the rule of law and individual liberty . while plans have been drawn up to revamp the curriculum at each of the five schools inspected , these often lack the detail needed to ensure that action will be taken to actively promote these values and tolerance of different faiths , ofsted said . inspectors conducted unannounced follow-up visits to the five schools , four of which are academies and the fifth run by the local council , during a week last month . the findings also showed that staff at the schools had ` some optimism ' that there would be changes , but they also raised concerns about equality and fairness . saltley school was among five schools put into special measures by inspectors following the claims . some staff said some people at their school hold jobs that they do not have the experience or qualifications for , the advice note said . it also criticised birmingham council for failing to show ofsted the plan it has drawn up in response to the findings of the investigations into the alleged trojan horse plot . sir michael called on the department for education -lrb- dfe -rrb- to look at how it can take more rapid action to change the trustees and governors of an academy school when there are serious concerns about how it is being run . in a statement issued to pupils ' parents , the trustees and executive principal of the park view educational trust said it had already addressed many of the issues raised by ofsted . ` in the period of a month since the monitoring visits , the trust 's new transition plan has led to significant progress and this was highlighted by the department for education during their recent visits to our academies at the beginning of october , ' the statement said . ` we remain realistic about the challenges ahead but are focused and determined to maintain rapid and sustained progress ahead of the next monitoring visits , which will provide a more authentic insight into the new leadership and governance arrangements . ` students at our academies no longer face segregation in classes and several new opportunities are being welcomed . ' the trojan horse plot first came to light earlier this year , when a letter emerged outlining an alleged a plot by muslim hardliners to drive moderate headteachers out of schools . the letter prompted department for education inspectors to go into park view school in birmingham along with its sister schools , golden hillock and nansen . sir michael wilshaw said the plot was ` planned and orchestrated ' attempt to control school boards . whistleblowers at park view claimed the school was in the hands of a group of extremists who had infiltrated its governing body . it is alleged girls at the school were forced to sit at the back of the classroom and non-muslim pupils forced to teach themselves at the state school . the letter prompted separate ongoing investigations by both the department for education -lrb- dfe -rrb- and ofsted in to the school and several others in the area . following inspections , sir michael wilshaw told mps in july that there had been a ` planned and orchestrated ' plot to radicalise pupils in schools in the city . he told the education select committee said : ' i spoke to eight or nine head teachers . they believed it was planned and orchestrated . ` they believed people got together and decided which schools to target . they believed there was a strategy to infiltrate governing bodies . ` they believed governing boards could n't take place in the normal way . they believed all that was planned and orchestrated . this was all in birmingham . ' when asked by mps if pupils had been radicalised in the schools , sir michael replied : ` we did n't see that . the issue of extremism was outside of our remit . ' the ofsted chief inspector told mps : ` what we did see was the promotion of a culture , which if that promotion had continued would have exposed these children to extremism . '", "summary": " inspections ordered earlier this year amid claims of extremism in schools .   five schools were placed into special measures by education watchdog .   ofsted now warns that too little has been done in the schools since scandal .   one school is accused of allowing segregation of boys and girls to continue .   re students at another had to ` teach themselves ' about other religions .   one school took children to saudi arabia , despite a past trip being criticised .   unqualified staff still working at affected schools , new inspections find .
