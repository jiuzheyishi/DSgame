{"text": "whether you feel fat , thin , average or you simply do n't care may have nothing to do with the chocolate cake you ate -lrb- or did n't eat -rrb- yesterday . it may instead be down to the genes you inherited from your parents . a woman 's body image and desire to be thin stems chiefly from her genetic make-up , according to new research carried out at michigan state university -lrb- msu -rrb- . mothers pass on their ` thin idealisation ' to their daughters , so harper beckham is likely to inherit victoria 's fondness for the skinny leg , left , and lourdes may enjoy working out like her mother madonna , right . scientists found that nearly half of the reason why some women feel more pressure to be slim is down to their ` genetic programming ' . scientists found that nearly half of the reason why some women feel more pressure to be slim is down to their ` genetic programming ' , which causes some women to be more susceptible to body image issues and eating disorders . georgia may jagger , left , will probably have the same attitudes towards body shape as her mother , jerry hall . so harper beckham is likely to inherit victoria 's prediction for a tiny waist ; georgia may jagger could take after her mother jerry hall when it comes to staying toned and slim ; and lourdes ciccone will probably follow her mother madonna into the gym . the research challenges the popular notion that young women are pressured into idolising thinness due to their environments , which are replete with airbrushed photos of celebrities and ` size zero ' models . scientists carried out the study by examining differing attitudes between identical and fraternal twins . lead researcher at msu jessica suisman said : ` we 're all bombarded daily with messages extolling the virtues of being thin , yet intriguingly only some women develop what we term ` thin ideal internalisation . ` this suggests that genetic factors may make some women more susceptible to this pressure than others . ' the . study - which is being published in the international journal of eating disorders - . assessed more than 300 female twins from the msu twin registry between . the ages of 12 and 22 . researchers measured how much the twins wanted to look like people from films , television and magazines . once . the levels of their ` thin idealisation ' were assessed , identical twins . -lrb- who share 100 per cent of their genes -rrb- were compared with fraternal . twins -lrb- who share 50 per cent , just like standard brothers and sisters -rrb- . identical twins ashley and mary kate olsen , left , would be likely to have the same ` thin idealisation ' because they share exactly the same genes , but it would probably differ to that of their younger sister elizabeth , right . the . results showed that identical twins have closer levels of thin . idealisation than fraternal twins - suggesting a ` significant ' role for . genetics . this means that identical twins such as ashley and mary kate olsen are more likely to have the same attitudes towards body image and eating as each other , but will not necessarily share these attitudes with their younger sister , actress elizabeth . further research put this figure at . 43 per cent , meaning half of the reasons women differ in their . idealisation of thinness can be explained by their genetic make-up . results did showed that environmental influences are also important , especially experiences not shared between twins . non-shared . factors include one twin . being involved in a weight-focused sport like dance , one twin observing . more media that promotes thinness , or one twin having friends . who place importance on weight . a woman 's unique dna dictates how she feels about her body - more so than environmental factors such as diet and the media . ms suisman added : ` we were surprised to find that shared environmental factors - such as exposure to the same media - did not have as big an impact as expected . ` instead , non-shared factors that make co-twins different from each other had the greatest impact . ` the broad cultural risk factors that we thought were most influential in the development of thin-ideal internalisation are not as important as genetic risk and environmental risk factors that are specific and unique to each twin . ' kelly klump , professor of psychology at msu and co-author of the study , said a broad range of factors can contribute to the development of eating disorders . she said : ` this study reveals the need to take a similar approach to the ways in which women buy in to pressure to be thin , by considering how both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of thin-ideal internalisation .
