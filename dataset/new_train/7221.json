{"text": "a driver who has competed 12 times in the indy 500 finally won on sunday - and with a bit of luck at that . the popular brazilian tony kanaan dipped inside defending indycar champion ryan hunter-reay on a restart with three laps to go and cruised from there under the yellow caution flag . he flipped up his visor to wipe tears from his eyes as the crowd roared and then poured the celebratory winner 's milk over his head in victory lane . among the thousands gathered for the historic race was former vp candidate sarah palin who had come to indianapolis with her husband todd . she described watching the race as ` bucket list stuff ' . milking it ! tony kanaan , of brazil , celebrates with the traditional pouring of the winner 's milk after winning the indy 500 in indianapolis on sunday . ' i have to say , the last lap was the longest lap of my life , ' kanaan said . ' i got a little bit of luck today . i was looking at the stands , and it was unbelievable . i 'm speechless . this is it , man . i made it . ` it means a lot to because so many people , i could feel that they wanted me to win , and it 's such a selfish thing to do because what are they getting from it ? i 'm the one who gets the trophy . ` and if you can bring some joy to them and i think the best thing was trying to put an exciting race for them . and i said it before the race , i believed that this win was more for people out there than for me . ' kanaan had his fair share of chances to win at indianapolis motor speedway but came up short time and time again . he was leading when the rain came in 2007 , only to lose to dario franchitti when the race resumed . champion : kanaan , driver of the hydroxycut kv racing technology-sh racing chevrolet , celebrates as he races towards the start/finish line to take the checkered flag and win ahead of carlos munoz of colombia . fan : former vp candidate sarah palin walks through the pit area before the start of the race . in all , kanaan went into sunday 's race with 221 laps led at indy - more than any non-winner except michael andretti and rex mays - but his second-place finish to buddy rice in 2004 was the closest he had come to victory . he had a pair of third-place finishes , including last year , again to franchitti . the indy 500 tradition of pouring a jug of milk over the champion 's head started in 1936 when winning driver louis meyer asked for a glass of buttermilk after the race . from the 1950s , milk companies put up the winner 's purse - and handed milk to the champion driver as part of the deal . today , the american dairy association pays $ 10,000 if the winner drinks dairy in victory lane . ' i wanted it all my life , but over the years i was kind of ok with the fact that i may never have the chance to win , ' kanaan said . ` we can disprove the theory that nice guys do n't win . we proved that wrong . ' this time , it was franchitti whose crash brought out the final caution to seal kanaan 's victory . ` it 's wonderful for him , ' said mario andretti , himself a victim of bad luck at indy . ` he 's raced here long enough that he deserves it , no question . ' the win for kanaan and car owner jimmy vasser was celebrated throughout the paddock . alex zanardi , who came from italy to watch the race and gave kanaan one of his 2012 london paralympics medals as good luck , wept behind the pit wall as kanaan took the checkered flag . good luck charm : kanaan kisses his wife lauren bohlander kanaan after winning the race . celebration : the brazilian driver celebrates by kissing the bricks after winning the indianpolis 500 mile race . ' i tell you i 'm starting to think -lrb- the medal -rrb- really works , ' said zanardi , who lost his legs in a 2001 crash in germany . ` it 's a dream come true to see tony win , to see jimmy vasser win , my dear friend . i 'm so happy , i 'm so happy . ' it was vasser who brought zanardi 's medal to kanaan before the race , telling his driver that zanardi wanted him to rub it for good luck . ' i cuddled with it , ' kanaan later admitted . fellow brazilian helio castroneves , shooting for a record-tying fourth indy win , was happy for his long-time friend . ` finally he 's able to win this race . he 's so close so many times , but the good news is the good old boys are still able to run fast , ' castroneves said . carlos munoz , a 21-year-old rookie making his first indycar start , finished second and hunter-reay was third . ` t.k. is such a fan favorite , absolutely , it 's great to see him win it . if anybody is going to win it in the field , he 's one of the few i 'd like to see other than myself , ' hunter-reay said . ` we were leading on that last restart , i knew i was a sitting duck , and i was n't too bummed about it because i knew we had enough laps to get it going again and have a pass back . maybe i would be third on the last lap , which is where i wanted to be . ' got milk ? kanaan toasts his victory on sunday by pouring the winner 's milk over his head , an old indy 500 tradition . they 're off ! drivers start their engines in the 97th running of the historic race . only there was n't a last lap as franchitti brought out the caution seconds after the race went green . ' i went into the first corner on the last restart and it just did n't turn and then hit . the big , old hit , ' said franchitti . ` when i saw who was leading , it cheered me up a little bit . he 's a very , very deserving winner . ' the leaders came to the finish line all bunched up around kanaan , saluting the longtime indycar stalwart who had longed to add the final missing piece to his resume . that was about as slow as anyone had driven all day . the average speed was 187.433 mph , another indy record . marco andretti finished fourth , failing to win for the eighth time , and justin wilson was fifth in the highest-finishing honda on a day that was dominated by chevrolet . castroneves was sixth . pole-sitter ed carpenter led a race-high 37 laps and finished 10th . for a time , it appeared the win would go to aj allmendinger , who led 23 laps in his indy 500 debut for roger penske . fired by penske from his nascar ride last year after failing a nascar drug test , penske gave him a second chance with this indycar opportunity . seven years after leaving open-wheel racing , allmendinger finally ran  the greatest spectacle in racing  and was leading when his seat belt came undone , forcing him to pit . it put allmendinger off the pit cycle , and he was forced to stop for gas twice far in advance of the rest of the field . it meant allmendinger had to drive his way back to the front each time , and he finally sputtered out at seventh . ` once i figured it out , it was phenomenal . i could drive by guys at will when i wanted to , ' allmendinger said . ' i felt like we were up front running our own race , and , i do n't know , belts come undone . it just popped . ` i 'll be honest , pretty special moment to be leading at indy ,  he said .  my body kind of went numb , my mind was racing and i could feel my heart beating really fast , and that 's a special moment i 'll never forget . ' a year after 34 lead changes and a frantic finish created what many considered the best indy ever , indycar had its hands full trying to top itself . this one might have done it , with the slicing and dicing at the front , over and over and over again . there were a record 68 lead changes by 14 drivers , and 28 of the 33 cars were running at the end . with 100 miles to go , 25 drivers were on the lead lap . ` it was a hell of a race . that 's all i can say , ' said mario andretti . ` this is riveting competition , that 's all i can tell you . it 's just amazing . the reliability of the cars is there . the product is there . it 's unbelievable racing , the best i 've seen in years .
