{"text": "companies will be allowed to ` frack ' for shale gas underneath people 's homes without telling them , if government proposals go ahead . shale gas firms drill straight down into the earth before redirecting their drills horizontally over a wide area to maximise the amount of gas they can collect . the plans , which would make it easier for companies to drill for miles underground , met with fury from green campaign groups and locals in the sussex village of balcombe who say drilling has made their lives a misery . a test drilling site for shale gas non the outskirts of southport , lancashire . companies will be allowed to ` frack ' for shale has underneath people 's home without telling them , if government proposals go ahead . juliette harris said water from her taps at home was coming out brown , adding that noise from cuadrilla 's early activity was already ` unbearable ' . chancellor george osborne yesterday stepped up the government 's support for fracking , which involves injecting water and chemicals into the ground to release gas trapped inside rocks . the department for communities and local government said it was ` unreasonable and impractical ' to expect companies to warn all those whose homes might sit above one of its wells . the dclg said anyone living near proposed above-ground facilities would still be notified . but it said there was no need to tell people if firms planned to drill beneath their property because gas reserves are more than 1,000 metres below ground . miss harris said the dclg 's plans would heap more misery on locals . ` they 've got pound notes in their eyes and a government that used to champion the countryside is just throwing it away , ' she added . ` the fact they can then go horizontally under your house and you have no say is compounding the way this government is trying to bulldoze through this policy without any care and attention to us as residents . ' residents in the sussex village of balcombe , where protests were held against company cuadrilla , say fracking has made their lives a misery . ` i 'm a lifelong conservative voter , my family are , but i can not understand what this government is doing . ' mr osborne pointed out that communities where fracking is to occur have been offered a # 100,000 incentive and 1 per cent of future revenues . he said : ` of course , we want exploration of our shale resources to be safe , to avoid environmental damage , and be done in a way where communities get the benefit of what 's happening in their backyard . ' he added : ` britain is not going to turn its back on the energy sources of the future . so we 've set out a generous new tax regime for shale gas and removed the bureaucratic obstacles to its use onshore and offshore . ' a friends of the earth spokesman said : ` it 's astonishing that ministers want to end people 's right to be notified about plans to drill for gas and oil under their homes . ` it 's little wonder communities do n't trust the government over fracking when their rights are so clearly being bulldozed aside to smooth the path for the big fracking firms . ' chancellor george osborne stepped up the fracking campaign and said britain will not ` turn its back on the energy source of the future ' the dclg is inviting responses to its proposals until october 14 , but has no fixed timetable for implementing the changes . plans to revise the oil and gas planning regime came as cuadrilla withdrew its own planning application , admitting it had not consulted people living above areas where it wants to drill . a company spokesman said it was ` coincidence ' that cuadrilla withdrew its planning application 24 hours after it emerged that the government might change the rules . it is expected to resubmit its application , potentially delaying operations in balcombe .", "summary": " plans would make it easier for companies to drill miles underground .   residents of sussex village of balcombe say fracking made their life a misery .   chancellor george osborne stepped up support for fracking .   he said : ` britain will not turn its back on the energy of the future ' "}
