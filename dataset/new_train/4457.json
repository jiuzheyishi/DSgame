' black guy . he 's the car black guy . morgan freeman is the other credit card black guy . you only hear his voice , though , so you probably wo n't confuse him with laurence fishburne .  rubin later issued a more formal apology .  i indicated to samuel that i 'd seen him during the super bowl , and he thought that i had confused him with the commercial laurence fishburne had done for a car company . of course a ` captain america ' ad had also run during the super bowl , but i immediately felt so dumb , i did n't bring that up -- and he gave me the shellacking that was well deserved ,  the reporter said . jackson is set to appear in the upcoming sequel  captain america : the winter solider .   i pride myself on the fact -- that unlike a lot of people who do this kind of work -- more often than not , i really do know what i 'm talking about . but i did n't 30 minutes ago , and i 'm really embarrassed about it , and i very much apologize to samuel l. jackson and anyone else who was offended for what was a very amateur mistake ,  rubin said .", "summary": " ktla 's sam rubin asks jackson about the reaction to his super bowl commercial .    what super bowl commercial ?  jackson replies .   the reporter apologizes for his  very amateur mistake  "}
