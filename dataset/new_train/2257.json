{"text": "when european explorers were planting their flags all over north and south america , they referred to the territory as the  new world .  that was a misnomer . for while the americas might have been  new  to the europeans , they were n't new on the world timeline . things were happening in the western hemisphere a long , long time ago , as the sites on this list -lrb- a very small sampling -rrb- demonstrate . some you might know already ; others might come as a surprise . many of them are sites of active archaeological research that continues to unearth new examples of very interesting old stuff . 15 ancient ruins you might not know . tiwanaku , bolivia . theorists have explained tiwanaku as everything from a temple complex built by nomads to the work of an extraterrestrial society . its truth is only slightly less extraordinary , and it tantalizes with questions of why and how a city of temples , public buildings , homes , streets and irrigation systems was built at 13,000 feet above sea level in the altiplano of the bolivian andes . between 500 and 900 a.d. , the tiwanaku civilization numbered in the hundreds of thousands . by 1200 , they were gone . archaeologists continue to study the site , even constructing reed boats to demonstrate how stones weighing several tons might have been transported from one shore of nearby lake titicaca to the other . you 'll need imagination to picture tiwanaku as it was ; a visit during the winter or summer solstice celebrations can enhance its mystical qualities . dinosaur provincial park , alberta , canada . about 75 million years ago , western canada was part of an island continent called laramidia , and this 30-square-mile expanse of badlands was populated by creatures great and small . sounds like the start of a fantasy novel , but it 's a dream come true for anyone fascinated by dinosaurs . unesco adds 19 sites to world heritage list . since the turn of the last century , when paleontologists began working here in earnest , the park has yielded thousands of prehistoric remains , including hundreds of complete dinosaur skeletons from the late cretaceous period . at the park you can join in or observe current fieldwork . there are activities for families and kids , guided and self-guided tours , and sunset excursions for photographers . to see more specimens recovered from the park , visit the royal tyrrell museum in drumheller , two hours away . tikal , petén , guatemala . with its five towering pyramids , probably built between 250 and 900 a.d. -lrb- ongoing research regularly revises the dates -rrb- and situated to correspond with the position of the sun , tikal is the site by which other mayan archaeological sites are measured , both in scope and significance . tikal national park also encompasses uaxactún -- once a separate city -- as well as nearly 55,000 acres of rainforest that add to its beauty and mystery . the petén region in northern guatemala continually yields archaeological discoveries from the maya , such as the stunning frieze found in holmul earlier this year . the murals at san bartolo are under consideration for unesco world heritage site status . in neighboring honduras , is the mayan site of copán -- founded by a splinter group from tikal . monte albán , oaxaca , mexico . monte albán is a marvel of urban planning , especially when you consider that the olmecs -- and later the zapotecs -- who built it did so by carving its terraced landscape out of the mountainside . and they began construction sometime around 500 b.c. . it was built to be grand , from the ceremonial pyramids to the stadium surrounding the ball court , and because it 's so impressive monte albán tends to be heavily visited today . the most famous artifacts are the series of olmec carved stone slabs known as los danzantes -lrb- the dancers -rrb- because it was originally assumed they depicted dancing men . current scholarship says they depict disemboweled prisoners of war , which would be strange , yet in keeping with the unusual artistic sensibilities of the olmecs . parque museo la venta , villahermosa , tabasco , mexico . it 's hard to know what to think about the olmecs . they practiced ritual human bloodletting and raised dogs that they subsequently ate as part of their regular diet . on the other hand , they 're probably responsible for introducing chocolate to the world . they also left a wondrous legacy of carved stone sculptures , especially the enormous stone heads for which they 're known . many olmec sculptures discovered at san lorenzo tenochtitlán in veracruz and at la venta in tabasco -- olmec settlements dating back to 1200 b.c. -- have been relocated to museums where they 're more accessible for public viewing . you 'll find more than 30 , including three 20-ton heads , at parque museo la venta in villahermosa . the 16-acre park is known for its tropical foliage and for the dramatic sound and light show that illuminates the sculptures at night . chan chan , peru . machu picchu is the most widely known archaeological site in peru , the nazca lines are arguably the most mysterious , but chan chan , located about three miles from trujillo , deserves mention because while its past is documented , its future is uncertain . the capital of the chimú culture , chan chan probably dates back to before 850 a.d. . at its peak in the early 1400s it had a population of 30,000 before the inca came and wiped it all out . what remains of the huge earthwork city is still astounding -- networks of beautifully carved and sculpted adobe walls delineate enclaves devoted to work , worship and family life . about five square miles of the chan chan site is on the unesco world heritage list , but even unesco ca n't stop the wind and weather from slowly eroding chan chan . cahokia mounds state historic site , collinsville , illinois , united states . cahokia mounds looks like a grouping of giant lumps in the earth -- hills where no hills should be , built by the mississippian culture more than 1,000 years ago . the largest is 100 feet high and bigger than the great pyramid of giza at its base . around it once stood wooden houses and plazas where people gathered for ceremonies that involved a potent concoction called black drink and competitions in a vigorous sport called chunkey . inside the mounds , archaeologists have found a wealth of objects including unexpected specimens like shark 's teeth carried from the gulf of mexico to western illinois in some way yet to be determined . in fact , much of what went on at cahokia is still undetermined , including why this thriving community -- the oldest pre-columbian settlement north of mexico -- disappeared in the early 14th century . rock art of the lower pecos canyonlands , texas , united states . around comstock , texas , where the pecos river meets the rio grande , acres of unremarkable terrain hold a remarkable surprise : cave paintings -lrb- pictographs -rrb- and carvings -lrb- petroglyphs -rrb- made by the prehistoric hunter-gatherers who lived here thousands of years ago . they 're not especially easy to reach , which has been their salvation , having left them largely unmolested throughout the centuries . recently archaeologists have been working to raise awareness of the sites in order to catalog , preserve and protect them . guided tours at seminole canyon state park take you on a rigorous 1.5-mile hike to the fate bell shelter . other tours conducted by members of the nonprofit rock art foundation visit sites located on private land . panther cave and parida cave in the amistad national recreation area near del rio are accessible by boat .", "summary": " things were happening in the ` new world ' a
