{"text": "as the debate continues to drag on about wayne rooney 's midfield role at manchester united , one man could be forgiven for wondering just what he has done wrong . ander herrera cost united # 29million . sir alex ferguson identified his potential , david moyes did the donkey work to extricate the basque star from his complex contract at athletic bilbao , and louis van gaal rubber-stamped his signing before officially taking over at old trafford last summer . herrera has made just six premier league starts under the dutchman , however , and none since playing against stoke at the start of december . ander herrera cost manchester united # 29million , but he has spent more time watching than playing so far . herrera has been told he must fight for his place , but united fans have called for him to get more playing time . herrera makes a point to team-mates jonny evans and chris smalling during some rare time on the pitch . the situation has mystified many united fans who hope that herrera will be given a chance at preston north end in the fa cup fifth round on monday night having done well in the competition so far this season . the spaniard scored with a wonder strike to break the deadlock at yeovil in the fourth round -- his only other start in the last two-and-a-half months -- and then came off the bench to set up a goal for james wilson in the fourth round replay against cambridge united . yet he still seems to have some way to go to win the trust of van gaal and his coaching staff . there is a feeling around the club that he has not bought into the manager 's strict ` philosophy ' quite as well as some of his teammates . herrara congratulates smalling and angel di maria after the central defender had scored a goal . louis van gaal has not started herrera in 2015 , and is in the market for another creative midfielder . it appears as though herrera is paying the price for his below-par performances against leicester city in september , when united fell apart in a 5-3 defeat , and west brom the following month when he was taken off at half-time . van gaal has challenged herrera to improve , warning that competition for places in his midfield diamond could limit his opportunities . daley blind and angel di maria followed the spaniard into old trafford last summer , michael carrick , juan mata and adnan januzaj were already in situ , and that was before the decision came to re-deploy rooney . ` i have to compare him with people like rooney and mata , for example , so that 's difficult , ' said van gaal earlier this month . ` they are all at a high level , he has to improve . ` he 's a great guy , a very great professional also , so that 's not the problem . his problem is he has to compete with high level players and rooney is also the captain so he has a privilege . with the arrival of di maria to join juan mata in the creative midfield role , herrera has been sidelined . wayne rooney -lrb- far left -rrb- and daley blind -lrb- right -rrb- complete van gaal 's first choice diamond . ` we are playing now with a no. 10 and that 's mata and di maria . that 's difficult to compete against , but he already knew that when he signed for manchester united . ` when you sign for a top club like he did he knows that he is had to fight but he is fighting . ' it 's only four months , however , since herrera was deemed so important to united that he was hurried back from a rib injury and van gaal allowed him to play in a protective corset on that disappointing night at the hawthorns when he was replaced by marouane fellaini for the second half . van gaal has kept herrera on the bench but the spaniard could get his chance against preston on monday . now , herrera must warm the bench while van gaal claims he has to play rooney in midfield because there are no better options . it is quite a snub , and the manager 's admission that he will look to sign a world-class midfielder in the summer to release the england striker back to the front line does little to ease concerns that his future at old trafford is increasingly uncertain . herrera , who has also been forced to protest his innocence after being caught up in a match-fixing scandal in spain since his move to manchester , must wonder if he is in danger of going the same way as shinji kagawa . for the time being , a player who arrived in england with such great expectations last summer just has to be patient -- and hope for a chance to play against preston .", "summary": " manchester united paid # 29million for the spaniard last summer .   herrera has started just six premier league games , falling behind wayne rooney , angel di maria , juan mata and daley blind in pecking order .   with louis van gaal in the market for more midfielders , herrera needs to make his mark .   read : man utd boss van gaal wants another creative midfielder .   click here for all the latest manchester united news .
