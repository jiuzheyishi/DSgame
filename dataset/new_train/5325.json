{"text": "john sheardown , a former canadian diplomat who sheltered american citizens in tehran during the iran hostage crisis of 1979 , has died aged 88 . the cool-headed mr sheardown played a pivotal role in the so-called canadian caper when cia operatives posed as members of an irish film production company to rescue us citizens on the run following the iranian revolution . the audacious plan was celebrated in last year 's film argo directed by ben affleck , however mr sheardown did not feature as a character . passing : john sheardown , a former canadian diplomat who sheltered six america fugitives following the iranian revolution in 1979 had died aged 88 . yet so important was his role in the real-life events that his omission from the movie led to accusations that the filmmakers had ` rewritten history ' . after a mob stormed the u.s. embassy building in tehran they took 52 americans hostage in retaliation for western support for the recently deposed shah . however six americans managed to evade capture . all six were taken in by sheardown at his home in the suburbs north of tehran . two then stayed at the home of canadian ambassador ken taylor while the other four remained with the sheardowns . flashpoint : supporters of ayatollah khomeini on the streets of tehran celebrating following the iranian revolution 1979 . ben affleck stars as cia operative tony mendez in the 2012 film argo , which told the story of the six americans ' escape . describing the tense situation that lasted for an agonising 72 days , mr sheardown said : ` we were under surveillance . ` we had tanks at one end of the street and a fellow that walked up and down . they were always suspicious . ' kathleen stafford , one of the americans described mr sheardown as ' a lifesaver ' . sheardown 's omission from the film led to accusations that the makers had ` rewritten history ' to . avoid tipping off the iranian authorities to the americans ' presence , . the sheardowns would buy food from several different stores to disguise . the amount that was being consumed . the six fugitives were eventually driven from sheardown 's home to the airport by an iranian employee in a canadian embassy van . they boarded a swissair flight and were flown to safety on a plane called ` aargau ' . talking to the washington post , historian robert wright described mr. sheardown as exuding ` the sort of quiet but unyielding resolve that made him a natural leader in a crisis . ' sheardown was born in windsor and served as a tail gunner in during the second world war . he broke both legs bailing out of a crippled halifax bomber over britain , but somehow managed to crawled to a pub and order a drink . he recovered and was soon back flying missions over germany . sheardown featured in the 1981 canadian film , ` escape from iran , ' according to his wife , zena sheardown , he was suffering from alzheimer 's disease and died on dec 30 at a hospital in ottawa . the iranian hostage crisis was one of america 's darkest hours , in november 1979 , iranian anti-american protesters had shocked the world by storming tehran 's u.s. embassy and taking 52 americans hostage . they were to be held for the next 444 days . but a maverick cia agent persuaded a desperate u.s. government that the best way of spiriting six trapped diplomats out of the most dangerous place on earth was to turn the golden rule of espionage operations -- do n't attract attention -- on its head . the six -- consular chief bob anders , agricultural attach√© lee schatz , and two young couples , mark and cora lijek , and joe and kathy stafford -- were split between the homes of the canadian deputy chief of mission , john sheardown , and ambassador ken taylor . iran 's current president mahmoud ahmadinejad is pictured holding the arm of a blindfolded american hostage at the united states embassy in 1979 . a month after the embassy take-over , cia agent tony mendez , 38 , a veteran of the vietnam war hatched a bizarre plan in which he would reinvent himself as kevin costa hawkins , an irish sci-fi film production manager leading a pre-production team into iran on a location-scouting mission . mendez flew to los angeles to enlist john chambers , the make-up artist who had created mr spock 's ears in star trek and who won an oscar for the simian masks he made for 1968 's planet of the apes . chambers brought in a special effects colleague , bob sidell . the trio took over offices recently vacated by makers of the thriller the china syndrome and , in four days , set up their own company . mischievously calling it studio six productions , they designed business cards for the six trapped diplomats , and invented cvs of former film credits for each of them . mendez commissioned a film poster which appeared as a full-page advert in hollywood trade papers variety and the hollywood reporter . they even threw a small launch party . soon , the studio was being inundated with scripts , including one from steven spielberg . hollywood 's finest were taken in -- but would the iranians be so easily convinced ? on january 25 , 1980 , after the mission had received the personal approval of president carter , mendez flew to iran . alert to the possibility officials might call to check the story , he left his colleagues manning the phones in la. . he arrived in tehran on an early morning flight , knowing the terminal would be quiet , and wasted little time meeting the canadian ambassador , ken taylor , who handed him the six passports his government had made for the americans . mendez , meanwhile , forged the necessary iranian visas , using the ambassador 's scotch to moisten his ink pad . that evening , mendez met the six and outlined his plan , assigning them roles in the film crew . ` being all fairly young , we did n't really think about the danger we were in , ' lee schatz , now 64 , tells me . ` frankly , we were more worried what would happen to our canadian hosts if we were caught . ' did they think the plan totally ludicrous ? ` no , ' says lee , ` because mendez told us to be convincing in these situations , you have to like the idea of who you 're going to be . you have to have some fun . and as mendez had wryly told us :  everyone wants to be from hollywood . ' over the next two days , mendez spent hour after hour drilling his charges , testing them endlessly on their cover stories and getting them used to their new identities . in the early hours of january 28 , they all piled into a van to drive to the airport , suitably disguised . most had attempted to look as ` movie industry ' as possible , with oversized sunglasses , eccentric hairstyles and lapels so wide they almost did n't need a plane . bob anders , the conservative consular chief , had gone the whole hog , dressing in a blue silk shirt two sizes too small and unbuttoned to reveal a hairy chest and gold medallion . he completed the act with a blow-dried bouffant hairdo and a walk that mendez remembers as ` ridiculously mincing ' . at the airport , the six entered the terminal nervously with mendez . as revolutionary guards wandered through the queues harassing other travellers , the group checked in smoothly with swissair and got through customs . mendez recalls the six were really embracing their roles by this point . ` we were trying to look like we were having a good time . we wanted to be the hollywood people who did n't get it -- who were out celebrating at the worst time in history . it was part of the cover story . ' suddenly , disaster loomed . lee schatz joined the non-smoking queue for immigration out of habit , while the others stood in the smoking queue . separated , he found himself being quizzed by an immigration officer who peered suspiciously at his passport photo and demanded to know if it was really him . apparently unconvinced , the officer went into a backroom with the passport . the group froze , but mercifully he returned bringing only a cup of tea . he shrugged at the passport and stamped it . they were almost home and dry . as the plane -- coincidentally named aargau -- left iranian airspace , bound for zurich , mendez gripped the bag he had thankfully never had to open : the one full of argo posters , relevant hollywood magazines and even the film storyboards that he might have needed to convince suspicious officials .", "summary": " john sheardown played a pivotal role in the escape of six us fugitives .   he sheltered four at his home and helped organise canadian passports .   but he was not featured as a character in last year 's film argo .   critics claim this omission amounted to the film makers ` rewriting history ' "}
