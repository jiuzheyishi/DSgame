' miss russell told the hearing that the patient had an obsession . with nazi germany and would suffer hallucinations . she added : ` the patient would often speak in a german accent and go on about nazi germany . he 'd say he was adolf hitler . ' chris renehan , the clinical manager at the time , told the panel johnson would incite the patient to shout ` heil hitler ' . mr renehan , who now works at the princess alexandra hospital in harlow , added : ` mr johnson was very black and white . ` he either liked you or he did n't -- and that tended to be people that were ethnic minority or people not english . ` he was very english . very british . ' he also performed the role of a german soldier in front of miss a , which she was said to find ` particularly offensive as she is polish , and associations with the second world war have particularly offensive significance to her . ' johnson , who lives in a quiet cul de sac in great horkesley , colchester , called mr d by the names of arab terrorist organisations , hezbollah and hamas , and once said to him , ` bnp go home ' . the male care assistant also reported johnson to police for grabbing his genitals at work while another colleague . pinned his arms behind his back . torment : johnson reduced a patient who suffered from delusions that he was adolf hitler , pictured , to tears . johnson denied the charges , accusing colleagues of conspiring against him and making him a scapegoat . but james spencer , chair of the nmc panel , said : ` the panel is not . satisfied that any of the witnesses have colluded , that mr johnson has . been made a scapegoat or accused of any of these things for any reason . other than the facts included in the charges . ' the panel also found johnson guilty of grabbing another patient 's genitals on an almost daily basis . miss russell said in a . statement : ` mr johnson would stand facing him and hold the patient 's . genitals through his clothing . ` mr johnson would grab the patient 's genitals all the time , i would say this happened on a nearly daily basis . ` he did it to make people laugh , the staff would laugh . ' johnson 's campaign of harassment began just three weeks . after miss a joined severalls house , after the pair took a . patient on a trip to london . ` mr johnson sent a pornographic photograph of a woman 's vagina ' , said mr unwin . ` she found this disgusting , showed the . picture to her boyfriend , and then deleted it . she replied to mr . johnson , telling him to grow up . ' but johnson continued to bombard her with messages , saying , ` you sexy momma , i love you . ' he added : ` do n't you give up on me ' and ' i want to complete you :-rrb- xxxxx ' , and repeatedly tried to call her at midnight . ` mr johnson himself performed a nazi salute while in her presence and while looking at her , ' added mr unwin . ` she found this particularly offensive . as she is polish , and associations with the second world war have . particularly offensive significance to her . ' ` miss a felt threatened by his conduct . and felt that if she did n't tell mr johnson what he wanted to hear he . would make her life at work very difficult . ' unacceptable : johnson 's tasteless behaviour is reminiscent of a memorable scene in fawlty towers in which basil fawlty goose-steps around his hotel . the tribunal heard the sexual . texts stopped when johnson 's wife , who also works at the trust , saw . a message and called miss a to confront her . after miss a reported johnson 's advances , mr d came forward to report the deputy ward manager . for groping him while on duty . mr d described one incident in october . 2008 when johnson and another member of staff allegedly ambushed him . while he was looking through a colleague 's holiday photos . he said he was standing outside severalls house , when johnson and the male member of staff ` jumped ' on him . ` he -lrb- the other male -rrb- grabbed both my hands behind my back , mr johnson grabbed my genitals outside of my clothes , ' he said . the . panel was told that the staff nurse mr d had been speaking to at the . time was still present and took a photograph of the incident . ` it is not acceptable in my country or my culture , ' said mr d. ' i was very offended and felt violated . ` mr johnson had no respect for any staff members at severalls house . ' mr d told the panel the insults happened almost every shift at the care home . johnson . was arrested by police and questioned on suspicion of groping mr d in . january 2010 , but was later released without charge . johnson resigned from the trust in august 2010 before a full disciplinary process could take place . he admitted sending the texts to miss a , but claimed it was part of a two-way consensual conversation . johnson . said the thought of being in the same building as mr d ` makes me feel . sick ' , and did not attend the central london hearing . johnson 's fitness to practice was later found to be impaired by reason of misconduct at the nursing and midwifery council . panel chair james spencer said : ` it is unlikely mr johnson would have treated a patient without a mental health disability in this manner and his conduct amounts to discrimination on the basis of disability . ` he abused his senior position and did not treat patients or staff with respect or dignity . ` the panel has determined that mr johnson 's fitness to practice is impaired by reason of his misconduct .
