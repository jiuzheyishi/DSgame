{"text": "cheeky postcards were once part and parcel of any trip to the seaside . but in one british tourist resort , giant-sized versions of the risque cards are stirring up controversy . traders in the town of cleethorpes are calling for the larger-than-life , politically incorrect postcards to be taken down . nostalgic : the signs were installed for the cleethorpes in bloom display but now look set to be taken down . controversy : traders in cleethorpes have reacted furiously to the unveiling of the postcards on the seafront . the posters had originally been put on display to welcome judges to the annual ` cleethorpes in bloom ' floral show due to be held at the end of july . however , shopkeepers say the nostalgic cards - stationed on council-owned land - are lowering the reputation of the seaside town . angry : local shop owner , phyllis o'connell , pictured , says that the postcards belong in the past . phyllis o'connell , 47 , who runs an equestrian shop , said : ` how would you explain these sort of jokes to your five year old grandchild ? they are so sexist and rude . ` they have really put people 's backs up . they are bad for business and we should have been consulted before anything was put up there anyway . ' a caption on one of the postcards , showing a man ogling two girls in bikinis , reads : ` looking at the lovely birds ' . whilst another shows one angler saying to another ` that 's what i call a catch ' as a woman walks past in a skimpy swim suit . shock : one shopkeeper says she wants the postcards taken down as she will find it impossible to explain them to her grandchild . traditional ? the giant-sized postcards have been defended by a spokesman for cleethorpes in bloom who said that one -lrb- pictured right -rrb- even promotes recycling . mark treacher , 38 , who runs a gallery and picture framing business directly opposite the display , also said he found the postcards inappropriate : ` the one with the dog is just obscene and the rest are sexist . ' i have got an eight year old boy and do n't know how i would explain some of them to him . ` they may be 1950s postcards but i do not think they have any place at all in a family resort . humour : once a staple of the british seaside , traders are now up in arms over the saucy postcards . ' i would term them obscene and i must have had sixty or seventy complaints already from customers . ' a lot of children come in and out of these shops and we are trying to encourage families to come down here to enjoy the scenery and support local businesses . ` they are certainly not going to enjoy these . i would say it 's beyond a joke but there 's no joke to it as far as i can see . ' and , following the complaints , it looks as though the giant postcards - designed by a local artist based on original images - will have to be removed . ironically , in 1954 , cleethorpes was chosen by the conservative government of the day to lead a crackdown on rude postcards amid concerns about declining public morals . local police raided seventeen shops and seized thousands of cards to prepare a case under the 1857 obscene publications act against illustrator donald mcgill , who worked for bamforth 's , the manufacturer of the postcards . mr mcgill pleaded not guilty but was convicted at a trial at lincoln crown court and fined # 50 with # 25 costs . bamforth 's appeared to have the last laugh though - going on to sell some 200 million postcards . the company 's current managing director ian wallace hit back furiously at the calls to take down the signs . he said : ` it seems the po-faced tradition continues to this day in cleethorpes . ` it would be really said if the placards have to be taken down . there is enough gloom and doom about at the moment . ` it is really unusual for these cards to upset anyone . our images have been in every national paper and tv and we hardly ever get a complaint . conventional : a non-controversial cleethorpes in bloom sign put up to welcome judges for the floral competition later this month . ` my message would be , to those in cleethorpes who have complained , is to get a life and start making their visitors smile . people love this stuff and still do . ' ` cleethorpes in bloom ' vice chairman jeff blanchard insisted the postcards were merely intended as ' a bit of fun ' . he said : ` attitudes have changed since 1954 , thank goodness , so it 's a shame people have taken the wrong attitude but the last thing we want to do is offend local people . ' i can see in today 's climate it could be considered sexist but was meant as a bit of fun . ` you can still buy saucy postcards in cleethorpes and all over the country and most people do not take offence . ` some people think it lowers the tone of the resort and we should be promoting a more sophisticated image . ` well , a lot of people in the resort like traditional things like funfair rides and i remember these cards from when i was a little boy . ' two of the posters were also promoting public messages about recycling and clearing up after pets , he added .", "summary": " the risque postcards , inspired by classic versions from the 1950s , were put up to celebrate cleethorpes ' floral display and impress judges .   shopkeepers have slammed the designs , however , branding them ` obscene ' , ` sexist ' and ` rude '   managing director of bamforth 's , the company which sold 200million of the postcards , hit back and told complaining traders to ` get a life ' "}
