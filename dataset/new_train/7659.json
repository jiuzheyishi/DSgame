{"text": "fashion friends : mulberry 's ex-creative director emma hill with kate moss . the fashion world tripped over its platform shoes this week at the news that mulberry 's creative director emma hill had abandoned ship . apparently , the one-woman whirlwind from surrey had major ` disagreements ' with the company 's new ceo , frenchman bruno guillon . mulberry 's share price dipped 8 per cent at the terse announcement . given that hill is the transformative designer who turned mulberry into a fashion player and a magnet for celebrities from emma watson to the duchess of cambridge , it was rather like watching the leading lady storm off in the first act . indeed , mulberry has had more blood on its floor than a jacobean drama . only last week hill picked up a glamour award for best accessories designer . vogue 's may issue profiled her as ` one of the most successful names in british fashion , ' and called her a ` visionary ' . last summer she became a cbe . even sarah burton of alexander mcqueen , who designed the royal wedding dress , was only made an mbe . hill was mulberry , mulberry was hill . together , they had become a british institution . who would have thought that they could have ever been parted ? but it seems selling lots of handbags in britain is n't enough any more . mulberry has had some hits and seen an underlying rise in its rollercoaster share price , but is altogether a much patchier story than that of its home-grown rival burberry , which has spread its trademark check over the lucrative chinese market , and everywhere else . much to the chagrin of mulberry 's elusive singaporean owner , christina ong , who wrestled the company from founder roger saul in a nasty boardroom coup ten years ago , it does n't seem to have the global clout she desired . there was a time , of course , when it seemed mulberry could do no wrong . take the strappy alexa bag , named after alexa chung and based on a man 's satchel . emma hill called the alexa ` the anti-it bag that became an it bag ' , so popular that it once had a waiting list that ran into thousands and accounted for a staggering third of mulberry 's sales . combined with the classic bayswater , by 2011 mulberry was the fastest growing luxury brand on the planet ; sales in its 86 stores soared . then came the schism . last year , christina ong hired a french luxury goods executive to take mulberry from fashionable british bag maker to high-end international brand . and so mulberry poached bruno guillon from hermes , the snootiest of all the french luxury brands . to hermes , vuitton are mere parvenus , dior attention-seekers . as you might imagine , french luxury goods executives are not noted for their sense of humour . so heaven knows what monsieur guillon made of mulberry using giant gnomes as show props and poodles on the catwalk - or , more to the point , what he thought of the exuberant ms hill . uk success : hill with her cbe . cue ' a culture clash of titanic proportions ' , as one british magazine editor described it to me . hill , who joined mulberry in 2008 and had worked at marc jacobs and gap , grew the brand by courting cool young things and promoting the brand at festivals . as well as alexa chung , kate moss , cara delevingne , kristen stewart , kate hudson , florence welch and kirsten dunst were all photographed at the brand 's parties , pouting and sporting their mulberry bags . hill saw mulberry as ` iconic and irreverent , warm and fuzzy ' . the label was known for parties : its london fashion week show at claridge 's had edgy young things spinning the decks . but occasionally their exuberance misfired . as vogue later recounted , the company 's 40th birthday party in new york was such mayhem that the fashion press could n't get in and the police shut it down . it was youthful , jolly and a little wild . when guillon arrived , he was confronted with hill and her ` mulbs ' , as her colleagues were known . ` luxury with a laugh ' did not appeal to the man from hermes . he did n't appear to be in on the joke - or the business model hill had created . for guillon did n't want mulberry to be thought of as the bag that middle-income brits would buy as a present to themselves . he wanted a new , expensive tier to attract a new , more expensive customer . and he did n't want a celebrity-studded front row at their shows at all , fearing that the presence of chung - let alone a geldof girl - might alienate as many customers as it brought in . he has a point . celebrities can kill brands as quickly as they boost them . just ask burberry , which took years to recover from exposure by its low-rent celeb fans . berry good : princess beatrice -lrb- here clutching a mulberry bag -rrb- has helped to make the brand a british institution . guillon told vogue that 60 per cent of mulberry 's business was in britain . as ` the uk is only 4 per cent of the luxury market worldwide ' , he believed that this left the brand vulnerable . ` sometimes in your own market you can do things you ca n't do internationally . here they love you , you are iconic , but in paris you are just one of many brands . ' an italian fashion editor told me that while the british all know mulberry , it has barely any profile in france or italy . ` italian women do n't crave mulberry bags . ' intense , quirky britishness could make the label seem provincial abroad . and coming from extremely expensive , deliberately exclusive hermes , where the product - not the designer , let alone the customer - is the star , guillon was unlikely to embrace mulberry 's ambassadors pottering round glastonbury . guillon wanted mulberry to compete with dior , prada and vuitton . put simply , he and ong wanted to make more money . so the prices went up . but bags that were a hit at under # 700 - silly money , of course , but a price many british women would save up for - stopped selling when they went over # 1,000 . a series of profit warnings followed . as one fashion editor said : ` funnily enough , women who buy mulberry do n't want to be thought of as women who spend crazy amounts on bags . so even those who could afford them were put off by the snootier pricing . ' the city has taken a dim view of hill 's departure . the response of luca solca , managing director of luxury at investment company exane bnp paribas , is typical : ` mulberry is trying to reposition itself to the high end . . . mulberry in my view should be cheaper than burberry and gucci . ` there is little choice for handbags between # 250 and # 600 . market results indicate that mulberry 's upmarket ambitions are facing hurdles . ' in other words , mulberry 's price inflation is greed rather than good sense . no one thinks of it in the prada or hermes league - its appeal is something else altogether - and many think it unlikely that it ever will . mulberry 's results today are forecast to see it report a 28 per cent drop in profits . and the share price that once reached # 25 now stands at # 9.40 . ` warm and fuzzy ' are no longer the buzzwords at mulberry . let 's hope a parisian snob has n't killed off the bags of fun .", "summary": " mulberry 's creative director emma hill has resigned .   the fashion ` visionary ' transformed the brand into a major fashion player .   but she 's had major disagreements with the new ceo bruno guillon .   guillon wants to turn mulberry into a high-end international brand .
