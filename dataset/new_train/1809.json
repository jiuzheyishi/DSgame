{"text": "the scout who recruited brown ideye and then left west bromwich albion ` by mutual consent ' last month amid concerns that the club 's record signing had proved something of a flop , was feeling more than a little vindicated on saturday . ` ahem , ' tweeted stuart white -- and understandably so , seeing as the nigerian has now scored four goals in three games . clearly , all ideye needed was a manager capable of utilising the talent that persuaded west brom to pay # 10million for him in the first place . and while tony pulis admits a decent enough offer might well have led to ideye 's departure had carlton cole been signed in the last transfer window , the fact that the striker is now performing as effectively as he is amounts to a triumph for both player and manager . ideye marked his second of this fa cup tie with a celebratory somersault , having demonstrated his athleticism with the power he generated from the header moments earlier . west brom striker brown ideye celebrates his opener for the baggies after 20 minutes against west ham at the hawthorns . craig dawson 's cross is met by ideye , who tapped in his third goal in as many games as the home side took the lead on saturday . west brom midfielder james morrison pumps his fist in celebration having scored a scorcher from long range at the hawthorns . nigerian striker ideye made it 3-0 early in the second-half with this header , which was his fourth goal in three games for the baggies . england under 21 striker saido berahino runs away to celebrate having fired in west brom 's fourth goal on saturday in the fa cup . west brom -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : foster 7 ; dawson 7 , mcauley 7 , lescott 7.5 , brunt 7.5 ; sessegnon 7 -lrb- mcmanaman 78 , 6 -rrb- , yacob 7 , morrison 8 , gardner 7.5 -lrb- gamboa 90 -rrb- ; ideye 8.5 -lrb- baird 86 -rrb- , berahino 7.5 . subs not used : wisdom , olsson , myhill , pocognoli . scorers : ideye 20 and 57 , morrison 42 , berahino 72 . manager : tony pulis 8 . west ham -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : adrian 6 ; jenkinson 5 , tomkins 5 , kouyate 5 , cresswell 5 ; song 4 -lrb- o'brien 68 , 5 -rrb- , noble 5.5 , nolan 4 -lrb- amalfitano 60 , 1 -rrb- , downing 5 ; valencia 4 , sakho 5 -lrb- cole 68 , 5 -rrb- . subs not used : demel , jaaskelainen , henry , lee . booked : amalfitano red card . manager : sam allardyce 5 . referee : martin atkinson 7 . motm : ideye . compared to a quite stunning first-half goal from james morrison , not to mention a fine finish from saido berahino after the break , ideye 's 20th-minute strike was not much to look at . it was a poacher 's goal that owed far more to craig dawson and the quality of his cross as well as his success in winning an aerial challenge with aaron cresswell . indeed , ideye might have been a fraction offside when he diverted dawson 's delivery past adrian from close range . the assistant referee saw nothing wrong with it but sam allardyce did -- and complained . in fairness to a side now boasting just one defeat in nine since pulis took charge , it was no less than west brom deserved . set up to be aggressive by their manager , they attacked west ham with real vigour to produce arguably their finest performance of the season . the travelling fans would probably rate this as west ham 's worst . they booed their captain kevin nolan and they hurled abuse at allardyce , not for the first time telling him to ` **** off ' . exactly why they display such animosity towards a manager who , for the most part , has done a good job at upton park is baffling . but this was a rough afternoon for allardyce , made all the more uncomfortable by the dismissal of morgan amalfitano and the reaction of west ham 's owners . while david sullivan is said to have left early , david gold took to twitter to express his sympathy for the fans . allardyce also said they were entitled to feel frustrated when this competition was one they hoped to advance further in . but he also defended his players ` to the hilt ' , arguing that fatigue undermined their hopes of progressing after three games in six days . not to mention that final spell against southampton on wednesday with nine men . ` it 's a game too far for us , ' he said . ` the fixture list did n't give us the right opportunity to come here and play better . the players were dead on their feet . ' asked specifically about the personal abuse , he said : ` i ca n't afford to get disappointed on things like that . it 's not professional . ' further weakened by the loss of andy carroll to injury , allardyce 's side offered little in response to west brom 's ambition ; not a single effort on target in an opening half and not much of note in the second other than the dismissal . morgan amalfitano of west ham -lrb- centre -rrb- and chris brunt -lrb- left -rrb- square up after a challenge during the second-half at the hawthorns . morgan amalfitano strikes brunt in the face during the second-half at the hawthorns in full view of referee martin atkinson . amalfitano gives referee martin atkinson no choice , having raised his arm into brunt 's face , to send off the west ham substitute . west brom manager tony pulis is all smiles before kick-off at the hawthorns as he hoped to guide his side into the fa cup last eight . carl jenkinson of west ham clears the ball under pressure from west brom forward stephane sessegnon in their fa cup clash . craig gardner 's first-half strike clattered off the post as the hosts dominated proceedings to lead 2-0 at the break . amalfitano had been on the pitch as a replacement for nolan for less than 10 minutes when a nasty challenge on chris brunt invited martin atkinson to show him a yellow card , before a shove in the face of the west brom captain prompted a straight red . allardyce said : ` it 's unprofessional , is n't it ? ` the punishment is laid down in our code of conduct in terms of hands and getting sent off for something like that . that will be dealt with , as always , internally and we move on . but we 're so short of bodies it 's the last thing we need . ' west brom , by contrast , were both composed and excellent here . well organised , obviously . this is a pulis team , after all . but they were dynamic , determined , every inch a team desperate to secure a place in the quarter-finals . they too were playing their third game in six days but there were no heavy legs in the home side . ideye displayed that sharpness to open the scoring and morrison did well to ride a challenge from mark noble before beating adrian with a terrific 25-yard strike just before half-time . ideye 's second came in the 57th minute when he produced a tremendous amount of power from a deflected stephane sessegnon cross . and to compound west ham 's misery , a 72nd-minute goal from berahino would then follow , beating adrian at his near post . as thrilled as pulis was , he stressed the need to remain focused on premier league points . and ideye ? ` the difference is confidence , ' he said . and a new manager . saido berahino -lrb- left -rrb- attempts to shield possession from cheikhou kouyate and alex song at the hawthorns in the fa cup fifth-round . west brom midfielder doubled the hosts ' lead late in the first-half with this sublime long-range strike for tony pulis ' side . ideye is joined by west brom team-mates saido berahino -lrb- centre -rrb- and craig dawson as they cruised to a comprehensive victory . west ham manager sam allardyce -lrb- right -rrb- ca n't hide his frustration as his side suffered a heavy defeat at the hawthorns . brown ideye is evidently delighted having added his second of the afternoon as west brom reached the fa cup quarter-finals . west ham 's craig gardner contests for the ball with west brom 's craig gardner during the fa cup fifth-round match on saturday . tony pulis erupts in celebration as his west brom side emphatically beat west ham 4-0 in the fa cup fifth-round on saturday . ideye was clearly head over heals with joy having found his scoring boots for west brom , that 's four goals in his last three games . click here for all the graphics , stats and heat maps from the fa cup clash at the hawthorns , including brown ideye 's second goal -lrb- below -rrb- .", "summary": " brown ideye scored his fourth in three matches for west brom to open the scoring after 20 minutes .   west brom 's james morrison doubled the baggies ' lead with a fine long range strike for a 2-0 lead at the break .   ideye scored his second with a deflected header in the 57th minute to make the advantage 3-0 at the hawthorns .   morgan amalfitano received a straight red card before saido berahino added a fourth for tony pulis ' side .   west brom progress to the fa cup quarter-finals for the first time since 2008 .
