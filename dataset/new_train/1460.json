{"text": "speaking out : professor lennart bengtsson . a leading academic says activists are trying to block scientific reports that question the dangers of climate change . professor lennart bengtsson said he had been subjected to ` unbearable ' pressure from other researchers and warned of the increasing politicisation of the once ` peaceful ' science . others described a ` poisonous atmosphere ' in which researchers plot behind the scenes to block the publication of work that queries the danger posed by climate change . prof bengtsson , a top meteorologist attached to reading university , spoke out after some of his research was rejected by a leading scientific journal . his study suggested carbon dioxide may be less damaging to the planet than feared -- effectively challenging the political consensus and the urgency of the taxpayer-funded drive towards green energy . an unnamed academic who was asked to help decide if the paper should be published , denounced it as ` harmful ' . the reviewer also warned it would generate bad publicity and have a ` high ' but ` strongly negative ' impact on the field of climate change science . prof bengtsson said having research rejected was ` part and parcel of academic life ' , but added that it would be ` utterly unacceptable ' for an academic to advise against publishing a paper on the grounds that it might bolster the views of climate sceptics . he told the times : ` it is an indication of how science is gradually being influenced by political views . the problem we now have in the climate community is that some scientists are mixing up their scientific role with that of climate activist . ` the reality has n't been keeping up with the -lsb- computer -rsb- models . therefore , if people are proposing to do major changes to the world 's economic system , we must have much more solid information . ' however , the publisher of the environmental research letters journal said the study contained errors and did not meet its criteria of contributing significant new knowledge . prof bengtsson 's remarks came just days after he resigned from the advisory board of a think-tank that questions the amount of money being poured into combating climate change , after being subject to a ` witch-hunt ' by fellow academics . the 79-year-old said the pressure had become ` virtually unbearable ' and made him fear for his health and safety . prof bengtsson , a top meteorologist attached to reading university , spoke out after some of his research was rejected by a leading scientific journal . in his letter of resignation to the global warming policy foundation , he said : ` i would never have expected anything similar in such an original peaceful community as meteorology . apparently it has been transformed in recent years . ' benny peiser , of the gwpf , said the professor 's case was just one example of a ` poisonous atmosphere ' pervading climate change research . he said many scientists with dissenting views were having their research rejected by the editors of scientific journals , and young scientists were censoring their work out of fear for their careers . dr peiser said : ` over the last few years , the editors of many of the world 's leading science journals have publicly advocated drastic policies to curb carbon dioxide emissions . at the same time , many have publicly attacked scientists sceptical of the climate alarm . ` instead of serving as open-minded broker of the contested fields of climate science and climate science , most science editors have opted to take a dogmatic stance that no longer allows for open research . ' david gee , an emeritus professor at uppsala university in sweden , said the pressure on prof bengtsson ` simply confirms the worst aspects of politicised science ' . the institute of physics , which publishes environmental research letters , said the decision to not publish prof bengtsson was based solely on the paper not meeting the journal 's high standards . editorial director nicola gulley said : ` far from hounding  dissenting  views from the field , environmental research letters positively encourages genuine scientific innovation that can shed light on complicated climate science . '", "summary": " professor bengtsson 's research suggested carbon dioxide may be less damaging to the planet than feared .   says he 's been subjected to ` unbearable ' pressure from other researchers .   has warned of increasing politicisation of the once ` peaceful ' science .   others describe a ` poisonous atmosphere ' fuelled by plotting researchers .
