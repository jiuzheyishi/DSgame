{"text": "home secretary theresa may left rank and file officers in shock today - after launching a furious assault on the police . the tory minister , speaking at the police federation 's annual conference in bournemouth , accused officers of treating the public with ` contempt ' over the way they treated victims of abuse and domestic violence . she also announced that she was scrapping all police federation funding because the organisation sits on ` vast reserves ' of cash worth tens of millions of pounds . mrs may 's intervention came as a fourth police officer was sacked over the downing street ` plebgate ' row involving the former tory chief whip andrew mitchell . theresa may , addressing the police federation 's conference in bournemouth today , launched a furious assault on officers ' behaviour and accused them of holding the public in ` contempt ' theresa may 's bombshell attack came as a it emerged another police officer has been sacked following the investigation into the downing street ` plebgate ' row . susan johnson , a serving pc with the diplomatic protection group - which mans the gates in downing street - was dismissed today for gross misconduct . the ` plebgate ' row erupted after cabinet minister andrew mitchell launched into a foul-mouthed outburst when he was denied permission to cycle through the main gate at downing street on september 19 , 2012 . mr mitchell and the gate officer at the time pc toby rowland gave conflicting accounts of what happened . the officer claiming mr mitchell used the word ` pleb ' , something mr mitchell has always denied . scotland yard said a person ` closely connected ' to pc johnson , who was not on duty at the time of the incident in downing street , contacted the sun newspaper the day after the incident . another officer , pc gillian weatherley , was sacked at the end of april over leaks to the press linked to the row . she was on duty in downing street on the day of the confrontation . four officers have now been sacked over the scandal . scotland yard today confirmed one further gross misconduct case remained . mrs may warned the federation , which represents ordinary police officers , that it was time for them to ` face up to reality ' and change their ways . the sustained assault left one officer complaining that he had never had ` such an attack and a personal kicking ' in his 21 years in the police . mrs may said she was determined to change the way officers behave and announced that she was willing to grant the police watchdog , the independent police complaints commission , more powers to investigate corrupt pcs . she said : ` it can not be right when officers under investigation by the ipcc comply with the rules by turning up for interview but then refuse to cooperate and decline to answer questions . ' the minister said this behaviour ` is often encouraged by the federation ' . she said this revealed an attitude ` far removed from the principles of public service felt by the majority of police officers ' . mrs may added : ` it is the same attitude exposed by hmic when officers , called to help a woman who had suffered domestic violence , accidentally recorded themselves calling the victim a  slag  and a  bitch  . ` it is the same attitude expressed when young black men ask the police why they are being stopped and searched and are told it is  just routine  even though according to the law , officers need  reasonable grounds for suspicion  . ` it is an attitude that betrays contempt for the public these officers are supposed to serve -- and every police officer in the land , every single police leader , and everybody in the police federation should confront it and expunge it from the ranks . ' she said ` it is not enough to mouth platitudes about a few bad apples ' in the face of a slew of high profile scandals that have hit the police . mrs may said a third of the public do not trust officers to tell the truth . during questions and answers , one police federation representative , who said he had served as an officer for 21 years , told the home secretary : ` i 've never had such an attack and a personal kicking from what you said there . ' he added : ` we all accept we need to change . we want to do that . we do not need to be politicised . ' ` you 're threatening to bully us , ' he said . earlier , delegates heard from outgoing chairman of the police federation steve williams , who said the organisation was ` more than stories about plebgate ' . the chairman , whose successor is expected to be chosen on friday , told the home secretary said that members are ` deeply concerned ' that officer numbers are falling across the country in the face of 20 per cent budget cuts , and claimed that staff levels were falling close to those in the 1980s . despite previous claims that he had been bullied out of his role , he received a long round of applause at the end of his final annual address . the government has already reduced the police federation 's funding from # 320,000 to # 190,000 a year . but in a speech to around 2,000 officers mrs may said : ' i can announce today that this funding will be stopped altogether from august . ' the federation came under fire earlier this year for having tens of millions of pounds stashed in unregulated accounts . there were murmurs through the audience after mrs may told members : ` it is not acceptable that when the federation is sitting on vast reserves worth tens of millions of pounds , it is in receipt of public funds to pay for salaries and expenses of the chairman , general secretary and treasurer . ` we have already said we would reduce this spending from # 320,000 to # 190,000 per year but i can announce today that this funding will be stopped altogether from august . ` instead , the money will go into a new fund to accelerate the introduction of police first - a new scheme designed to attract the brightest young university graduates into the police . ' the home secretary also announced that officers will no longer automatically become members of the federation , and instead will have to opt in . earlier , the home secretary told police officers who question the need for change to ` face up to reality ' . tory mp andrew mitchell was accused of calling downing street police officers ` plebs ' but angrily denied the accusation . he claims the police conspired to bring him down in a bid to damage the government . mrs may listed a string of damning controversies faced by forces across the country including the findings of the hillsborough independent panel and the so-called plebgate row . she said : ` if there 's anybody in this hall who doubts that our model of policing is at risk , if there is anybody who underestimates the damage recent events and revelations have done to the relationship between the public and the police , if anybody here questions the need for the police to change , i am here to tell you that it 's time to face up to reality . ' in a forceful speech , mrs may told members if the federation does not change and accept reforms recommended by sir david normington , it will be forced to do so . she said that she will change the law to allow the home office access to the federation 's so-called ` number two ' accounts , many of which are currently inaccessible even to the federation 's national leadership . mrs may said : ' i do not want to have to impose change on you , because i want you to show the public that you want to change . ' i want you to show them that you have the best interests of the police and of the public at heart . ' but mrs may added that she would overhaul the police with or without their support . she said : ` make no mistake , if you do not make significant progress towards the implementation of the normington reforms , if the federation does not start to turn itself around , you must not be under the impression that the government will let things remain as they are . ` the federation was created by an act of parliament and it can be reformed by an act of parliament . if you do not change of your own accord , we will impose change on you . ' mrs may was greeted with silence from audience members as she finished her speech , and no round of applause . the police federation , representing 126,000 rank and file officers in england and wales , has come under sustained attack after being caught up in a series of scandals . an independent review earlier this year said it had lost the trust of ordinary police officers following its high profile and controversial campaign against government cuts . the federation had tried to use the 2012 plebgate row - in which the former chief whip andrew mitchell was accused of swearing at police officers - to attack the government . but it then emerged that a witness to the row was a metropolitan police officer who had lied about what he had seen . the officer , pc keith wallis , was jailed for a year in february . another two officers have been sacked for misconduct over the scandal . the subsequent review into the organisation found it needed change from ` top to bottom ' and revealed the existence of secret accounts worth millions of pounds and lavish expenses claims . chairman steve williams then announced he was standing down after being called a dictator and a traitor for trying to reform federation . the scandals surrounding the federation came as the police as a whole faced growing public anger over cover-ups , corruption and racism allegations . it emerged last year that officers had tried to smear the family of murdered teenager stephen lawrence . a review into the murder also revealed shocking evidence of corruption during the original investigation . officers have also been attacked for their role in the hillsborough cover up scandal and for allegedly rigging recorded crime statistics to make their performance look better than it actually is .", "summary": " tory minister attacks corruption and treatment of women and minorities .   says public no longer trust police after hillsborough and ` plebgate '   condemns public funding for police federation as ` unacceptable '   tells organisation 's annual conference it needs to ` face reality ' and reform .   claims britain 's model of policing is ` at risk ' amid growing public mistrust .   comes as a fourth police officer is sacked over downing street ` pleb ' row .
