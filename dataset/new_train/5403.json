' ' i was a ticking timebomb health wise , but still that was n't enough to make me lose weight . what really made me decide to do it were my boys and the thought of them growing up without a dad . ' i vividly remember reading somewhere that the life expectancy for someone with a bmi of 40 was 20 years less than someone with a healthy bmi around 25 . that made me realise that i was living on borrowed time . ' wayne lost his mother in his mid 20s to bowel cancer and he says he did n't want that for his boys . he wanted to be around to see them grow up , get married and have children of their own so decided to take action . motivated : wayne decided to embark on a strict diet after he became too embarrassed to attend his children 's parents evening for fear of them getting bullied because of his size . wayne turned to the lighterlife weight loss management programme , attending counsellor paula carruthers ' classes in carlisle . when he started at the beginning of february 2012 , he weighed 30st 13lbs . the programme saw him replace ordinary eating with four specially formulated food packs per day , alongside weekly counselling sessions to assess the psychological issues behind overeating and ensure a permanent lifestyle change . wayne is now gradually reintroducing food in a controlled manner combined with counselling and has shrunk to 13st 4lbs , taking his weight loss to 17st 9lbs . his bmi currently resides at 25.4 . ` the change has been unbelievable . it 's not just physical : inside i am a completely different person ' wayne said . ` my life had come to the point where i was making a conscious effort to constantly avoid embarrassing situations , from having to ask for a seat belt extender on planes to never attending parents ' evening at my sons ' school so they would n't get bullied about my size . happy : wayne has been enjoying spending time with his children and being able to be involved in all the holiday activities like going on a rollercoaster . ` do n't get me wrong - i was no shrinking violet and was a very sociable guy , i just avoided certain everyday situations . ` if i am honest , it was more than just the everyday situations ; i was even avoiding extremely serious appointments . ` for example , my mum died of bowel cancer at the age of 45 , so when i reached 35 i was supposed to go for a routine screening to make sure it could be caught early if i was unlucky enough to have it as well . ` i 'd received the letter from the hospital but i was so worried that the hospital would n't be able to do it because of the size of me that i did n't go . ` even though i knew one of major reasons that mum died was because it was n't detected earlier , the embarrassment and fear kept me away . ' i never want to feel like that again . ' wayne puts his weight gain down to a combination of factors , one being that from the age of 16 he did a job where he sat behind a desk most of the day . by the time he married wife samantha at the age of 23 he was already tipping the scales at 20 stone and by the time his mother died four years later , he was nearly 26 stone . and for wayne , it was n't just food , it was alcohol to blame too . ` while i 've never had a problem with drink , i could easily get through 10 or 12 pints of beer on a night out . ' i now realise that it was more to do with how comfortable i felt in social situations rather than a need to drink . i would drink to rid myself of those social inhibitions that told me people were looking at me due to my size . ' but since embarking on his rigorous diet , wayne has n't looked back . he said : ` over the last 10 months i have literally been the miraculous shrinking man . my weight loss has far exceeded all my expectations ; in 40 weeks i have averaged half a stone weight loss per week , which is incredible . ' wayne is now able to enjoy time with his sons , william aged 14 , harry who is 11 and four year old finley , on trips and family holidays . ` for once in my life i could run around with the boys all day , going on rollercoasters without the fear of being too big for the seat . ` when we got back harry said to me that it was the best family holiday he 'd ever had . i know it was n't the nicest place we 've ever stayed , but i agree with him . ' i put it down to the fact that i could join in with everything they did . i have a real zest for life now and the look of excitement on my sons ' faces will stay with me forever . ' ` the world is my oyster now and after losing all this weight i feel euphoric and like i can do anything that i put my mind to .
