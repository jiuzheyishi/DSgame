{"text": "the hole in the wall experiments , known as hiw , were first implemented in 1999 , when a computer with an internet connection was embedded into a wall for children to discover and use unsupervised . the wall adjoined a slum in india . only a month later , it was evident that the children had taught themselves to use the computer and also picked up some skills in english and mathematics . this kind of design was then set up in more and more remote areas across the nation with almost identical results . these were computers embedded in walls or kiosks in easily accessible and highly visible public spaces , facilitating peer interaction , discovery and learning in groups of children . we concluded that groups of children from disadvantaged and remote settings can learn to use computers and access internet resources , on their own , if given appropriate free , public and unsupervised access . watch an interview with sugata mitra . these earliest experiences also showed that children could develop some skills in english and mathematics . what came through unequivocally in this and further work on self-organizing systems in education was that groups of children -- irrespective of who or where they are , or what language they speak -- given free and public access to computers and the internet can : . 1 . become computer-literate on their own -- that is , they can learn to use computers and the internet for most of the tasks done by lay users . 2 . teach themselves enough english to use e-mail , chat and search engines . 3 . learn in a few months to search the internet for answers to questions . 4 . improve their english pronunciation on their own . 5 . improve their mathematics and science scores in school . 6 . be prepared to pass examinations several years ahead of grade level . 7 . change their social interaction skills and value systems . 8 . form independent opinions and detect indoctrination . we then went on to show that the quality of traditional schooling declines the farther schools are from the urban center of new delhi . a similar decline is visible in the uk as one goes to more economically disadvantaged areas . this has been attributed to the lack of teachers willing to work in these areas . ted.com : bill gates on mosquitoes , malaria and education . two landmark events took this work further . the first was a comment by the late sir arthur c. clarke to me :  teachers that can be replaced by a machine should be  . the second was an experiment in a tsunami-hit indian village , where i was trying to prove that tamil-speaking 12-year-olds can not teach themselves biotechnology in english . at the end of the experiment , a little girl told me ,  apart from the fact that improper replication of the dna molecule causes genetic disease , we have understood nothing else .  finally , we found that the presence of a friendly , but not knowledgeable , mediator can enable children to reach levels of learning similar to formal schools with trained teachers . ted.com : ken robinson says schools kill creativity . we went on to set up a  cloud  of  emediators ,  mostly retired schoolteachers with broadband access from their homes . schools can access this  cloud  over skype and children can interact with the mediators over free videoconferencing . interestingly , in the hands of good teachers , these methods can be powerful motivators for children , resulting in better performance . what started out as a solution for remote areas turned out to have universal applicability . both hiw and the work done later are based on the concept of minimally invasive education , a pedagogic method that motivates groups of children to learn in an environment with little or no intervention from teachers or other adults , and that formed the basis of the design of the ` hiw ' computers . it is now possible to formulate a new approach to learning , using these findings . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of sugata mitra .", "summary": " sugata mitra : experiments show students can teach themselves with computers .   he says students showed remarkable progress by working in teams .   adult mediators can help further this kind of learning even without formal teacher training , he says .
