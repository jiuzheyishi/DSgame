{"text": "a black-maned lion leads his pride over a hill in south africa . the population of wild lions in africa is estimated to be as low as 15,000 . the west african lion is on the verge of extinction , according to experts after a marked decline in recent years . it is estimated there are just 645 genetically distinct wild lions left in western and central africa , with as few as 34 remaining in the whole of nigeria . now experts from conservation group lionaid say they are ` in real danger of extinction ' . according to the group , there are no lions left in 25 african countries and populations are barely surviving in ten . clusters of lions remain in burkina faso , niger , the central african republic , cameroon and chad but are already extinct in countries such as ghana , the ivory coast and togo . thirty years ago there were 200,000 lions roaming wild across the continent -- but now there are only between 15,000 and 32,000 left . west african lions have been largely forgotten due to political apathy to conservation . dr pieter kat , trustee of lionaid , told the guardian : ` there has been a catastrophic decline in the populations of lions in africa , and particularly west africa . ` these lions have been neglected for a very long time and do not have adequate protection programs . ' he said the west of the continent is often ignored in favour of eastern africa , leading to a decline in species . the lion is threatened by a range of factors , including loss of habitat , loss of natural prey due to poaching , ` unsustainable levels of trophy hunting ' and human conflict . a new threat is also on the rise as lion bones are being used to supply the demands of asian traditional medicine as tiger bones become more scarce . conservationists want lions to be put on the list of most endangered species to give them greater protection from hunters . in nigeria a government wildlife . official told the guardian that the number of lions in the country had . dropped from 44 in 2009 to a meagre 34 . yohanna . saidu from nigeria 's interior ministry told the newspaper they are . trying to protect the lions but admitted to being ` very concerned ' . dr kat said it would now be impossible to build up a population of lions in nigeria and therefore the species should be classed as extinct there as well . the picture is similar in other countries . in senegal , the lionaid said there are just 40 lions left . the charity said there are only five ` viable ' populations - those of 1,000 or more - lions left on the continent . three of those are found in tanzania and kenya , with the remaining populations surviving in south africa and botswana and zimbabwe . lions are now extinct in 25 african nations . recent studies on african lion populations show that about three-quarters of africa 's savannah has disappeared over the past 50 years . conservationists say it is not possible to individually count every lion in the continent so estimates on remaining population numbers vary . however experts do agree the plight of the african lion is ` very serious ' and want the animal to be included on the convention on international trade in endangered species list . inclusion would mean tight protection on hunting and trade , especially important as more than 5,600 wild african lions were hunted and exported as trophies between 1999 and 2008 . however , conservationists say they face strong opposition from the pro-hunting lobthe conservation needs of a species so greatly important to our . cultures , history , and indeed the health of wildlife biodiversity in . africa . ` lions are not only an iconic species important to very many people all over the world , but they are also a vital component of african ecosystems .
