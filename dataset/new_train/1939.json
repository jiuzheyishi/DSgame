{"text": "a wealthy property developer is being taken to court after refusing to tear down a giant # 2,500 playhouse he built in his back garden for his children . jeffrey morris , 40 , and his wife louise cook , 45 , erected the 12ft wooden playhouse in the grounds of their # 800,000 home in the northamptonshire village of horton for their young daughters . when neighbours complained their properties were overlooked , they dismantled it and put it back up without a wooden platform , but they were told they were still in breach of planning law and had to take it down . jeffrey morris , louise cook and daughters amelia , left , and poppy , in front of the controversial playhouse . the property developers , pictured right with amelia , left , and poppy , bought the playhouse two years ago . mr morris says that he has complied with the issues raised at the start but believes the council ` wants a scalp ' the problem began two years ago when the morris family bought the playhouse for their 300ft back garden . south northamptonshire council complained the structure , which 11ft high , 19ft wide and 9ft deep , caused ` significant harm to the character and appearance of the area ' and ordered it to be removed . the couple complied and rebuilt the house without its wooden platform but were told it still breached planning law and given an enforcement notice ordering them to remove the playhouse , which consists of a swing set , slide and tree house . when the couple refused to comply , they refused they were ordered to northampton magistrates ' court , where they denied breaching an enforcement notice . mr morris told magistrates : ` the supplier leisure time products confirmed to us we did n't need planning permission because the full height was under four metres and the planning officer said the same . ` we proceeded on that basis and eight months went ' edge of the village : the family 's house is ringed , while the yellow dot indicates where the playhouse is . the morris-cook family lives in an # 800,000 stone house in the village of horton , south of northampton . mr morris says the firm he bought the playhouse from in 2011 told him it did not require planning permission . if they lose the case they could face a maximum # 20,000 fine plus court costs and still be forced to rip the playhouse down . the couple claim they were told by planning officers during site visits that the platform was the only issue , but that after taking it apart , making several adjustments and reassembling it , the officers said they had still breached the enforcement notice . mr morris , who lives has lived in the detached stone house since 2005 with his wife and their three children , charlie , 20 , amelia , 12 , and poppy , nine , said : ` we were assured by the company that the playhouse did not require planning permission and it was up for 11 months before someone complained to the council . ` the platform was the floor of the . little treehouse bit of the structure so to show good faith we took the . floor out but now the council claim the ledge near the slide constitutes . a platform . quite palatial : the # 2,500 playhouse boasts a slide , climbing wall , swings , and an impressive treehouse . ' a planning officer bizarrely told me one way to comply with planning law would be to build a large shed covering the playhouse to make it an indoor play area which did not need planning permission . ` it 's crazy because that would mean building something even bigger . ' mr morris added : ` in my view the council are desperate for a scalp and because we are property developers they have come after us and are using bully tactics to make us tear it down . ` at the court hearing the council officers told me they would pursue the maximum # 20,000 fine plus court costs . ' i refuse to take this lying down and i will not be bullied so i am putting my money where my mouth is and will fight them because i know i am in the right . ' a trial will take place in march next year at wellingborough magistrates ' court . a spokesman for south northamptonshire council said the construction of garden sheds , garages , tree houses , and play equipment was allowed without planning permission if they did n't have a balcony or raised platform over 300mm , had only a single storey , and if were more than two metres from a boundary if over 2.5 m high . he said : ` the development in horton did not comply with any of these criteria . ' councillor rebecca breese said : ` the council has consistently informed the applicant that the structure was unauthorised and required planning permission . ' -lsb- the council 's -rsb- enforcement notice has not been complied with , despite repeated requests to do so and left the council with no other option but to prosecute the site owner .
