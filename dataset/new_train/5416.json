{"text": "honeymooners : british actress kate winslet and her new husband ned rocknroll have already been embroiled in a battle with locals over plans for new gates at her 15th century . no doubt she hoped that moving to the countryside would provide her with a peaceful start to her third marriage . but kate winslet has already found herself embroiled in a battle with locals over her plans for a set of new wooden gates at her 15th century home in a sleepy hamlet . the 37-year-old actress has lost the fight following objections to her proposals to install the 2metre-high gates -lrb- just over 6ft 6in -rrb- at the # 1.95 million property she moved into just weeks ago . miss winslet , who has been honey-mooning at the house , has now been forced to withdraw her application to the parish council . it is understood she wanted the imposing gates to protect her privacy , but she was accused of trying to impose ` suburban ' values on the home she shares with husband ned rocknroll . several of her neighbours attended a meeting in the village hall at which they expressed their concern that the design of the gates was out of character . the hamlet -- so rural that it does not even have street lights -- has become one of britain 's most exclusive areas because of its picturesque scenery . one neighbour said of the plans : ` people are very protective of the village . they are not the sort to gawp . some have said that if she wanted that much privacy she should n't have bought a house like that . ' another added : ` it 's very different from new york and hollywood here . i 'm sure everyone there has these great big gates and i think it 's probably what kate has been used to , but there 's no need to come here and do that . ` i do n't know what to think , quite honestly . the gates were totally out of character . we are in an area of outstanding national beauty and they just were n't in keeping with the surrounding area . ` if you put gates up , you are just drawing attention to something . if you live normally , no one is going to think a thing . ' titanic star miss winslet , who previously lived in new york , has returned from america permanently to make a home with mr rocknroll , sir richard branson 's nephew , who changed his surname by deed poll from abel smith . kate 's gate : the current gate on kate winslet 's 15th century home in a quiet countryside hamlet . the property is just a few miles from the home mr rocknroll shared with his ex-wife eliza pearson , the daughter of viscount cowdray . miss winslet has a 12-year-old daughter mia from her marriage to director jim threapleton and a son joe , nine , from her marriage to director sam mendes . one reason she is said to have moved to the area is because of the standard of local schools . the parish council said of the plans : ` these gates and adjoining fencing are considered to be a prominent , visually intrusive and incongruous feature more suited to a suburban or urban area than this rural setting . ' the council added that while miss winslet 's house is not a listed building , it ` should be regarded as a heritage asset ' . it went on : ` the hamlet lies in a very sensitive , tranquil , unspoilt and rural location . security : the 2m high gates that kate winslet has applied for planning permission to erect outside her home . ` any development should be compatible with its location and reflect local style and vernacular design . ` the parish council object to the proposed high oak solid gates . ' neighbours were unsure whether the actress would re-apply with a new design for the gates , although one said : ` i hope they do n't try again . ' miss winslet married last month in america in a romantic and private ceremony attended by only a handful of family and friends . it is thought to have taken place at a resort in the catskill mountains in a heated barn with a rather hippyish country-chic vibe . the ceremony is understood to have been brief and very simple , with the venue filled with wild flowers in jam jars and pretty coloured lanterns . in november the actress received a cbe from the queen at buckingham palace for services to drama . she won a best actress oscar for her performance in the 2008 film the reader .", "summary": " actress kate winslet is embroiled in a row with neighbours over a gate .   the 37-year-old wanted to erect two metre high gates at the # 1.95 m house .   her planning application has now been withdrawn after complaints .   she only moved into the property weeks ago after marrying for a third time .
