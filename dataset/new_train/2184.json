{"text": "tacloban , philippines  it is like a tsunami has hit here .  these were the first words from cnn 's paula hancocks , as she arrived in the storm-battered eastern city of tacloban on board a military transport plane . leading the first international news team into this part of the philippines in the wake of super typhoon haiyan -- one of the strongest storms ever recorded to hit land -- hancocks and crew hitched a ride from manila with the country 's military , along with members of the world food program , the united nations , local media and a load of food aid . this is her first account of the scenes she witnessed : . the damage in tacloban looks almost identical to that caused by a tsunami . as we were flying over the area , it was quite clear there was a lot of water and a lot of destruction . the area is flooded and everything i can see has been damaged . latest on super typhoon haiyan : more than 100 killed in tacloban . the sheer devastation and debris is something i have seen from tsunamis -- i have n't seen damage of this magnitude from a typhoon before . every single tree is either flattened or broken off and stripped bare . this damage to the trees alone shows the strength of the winds . officials tell me the storm surge came as high as the second story of the terminal building here and it clearly has devastated the structure . what was once inside the building is now strewn outside . helicopters are taking off from the airfield -- this looks like it is becoming a staging point for the relief effort . it is hard to get a gauge right now on just how many casualties or how much damage the storm has caused here and across the country . in tacloban , all the power lines are down and the airfield itself is badly damaged . the military and the u.n. are looking for where they should set up areas where residents can come to get assistance . this is the initial phase of the relief efforts . typhoon tracker : haiyan heads to vietnam . there are a lot of residents wandering around looking lost -- they look like they 're not sure what they should be doing . it is difficult to know how many people will come to this area . the roads are inaccessible and completely cut off . there is barely a tree in its entirety standing , blocking roads . people are coming to the terminal area as they believe this is where food and water and first aid will be administered . the head of the world food program told me what they have to do in the first few hours is figure out what they can do -- figure out the lay of the land , where they can get to , where they ca n't get to and that will take some time . and that is also a major task facing the military -- getting to the areas they need to get to . it is going to take heavy machinery and a lot of work before they can reach those who need help . the first challenge will be providing food and water as well as shelter . a couple of residents have approached me . one , a young man with his baby daughter looked very shell-shocked and very shaken up . he was waiting for some medical treatment . the medical facilities at this point are very rudimentary but that will change in the coming hours . i have also had many people wave and smile at me . they are familiar with typhoons -- this country sees more than 20 typhoons each year but not at the level or scale brought on by this storm . among the tasks facing relief workers is bringing in food for these people . food and water are the main issue facing residents . i can see the military right now carrying in tents to certain areas -- for medical purposes or to provide shelter . there are some structures that remain intact but they look very dangerous in themselves . twisted and unstable -- it is not an ideal situation for people to shelter but there are no alternatives right now . are you in the affected area ? send us your images and video but please stay safe .", "summary": " paula hancocks are crew are the first international news team to reach tacloban .   hancocks : debris and destruction everywhere .   relief efforts are at an early stage .   roads are inaccessible , hard for authorities to gauge full impact of storm .
