{"text": "rebel : conor burns , the mp for bournemouth west , has vowed to join those voting against a policy for lords reform , despite the fact it will cost him his job as a ministerial aide . david cameron is braced for a crushing defeat tonight on house of lords reform . up to 70 tories are expected to rebel against a policy that tops the wish-list of their liberal democrat coalition partners . one of them , conor burns told the mail he will join them even though it will cost him his job as a ministerial aide . ` when i asked the prime minister recently why on earth we were going to bring in this bill , he replied simply :  it 's the only thing nick clegg asked for in the queen 's speech  , ' mr burns said . downing street is expecting the government 's first commons defeat , pitching the two parties of the coalition into turmoil . mr clegg was heckled by tory mps last night as he attacked opponents of elected peers ` whatever the century ' . the lib dem leader suggested the government might agree to fresh commons votes to approve further stages of reform after the first tranches of peers are elected in 2015 . but as 70 tories broke cover yesterday to say they would rebel , one senior conservative said it would be better for the legislation to suffer a heavy defeat than a narrow one . a big loss would put mr cameron under intense pressure to tell mr clegg the plan must be abandoned . the key vote this evening is on the timetable for the legislation , which the government wants to limit to ten days of debate . a defeat would mean months of open-ended parliamentary debate on the issue , snarling up other government business . tory stalwart nicholas soames , who has defied his party only once in three decades , said the bill was a ` constitutional catastrophe ' that ` must be defeated at all costs ' . mr burns , a ministerial aide to northern ireland secretary owen paterson , said the proposal to abolish the lords and replace it with a mainly elected second chamber was an act of ` constitutional vandalism ' . split : david cameron is braced for defeat over the house of lords reform policy championed by nick clegg . he claimed the prime minister 's private remarks about the reason for pressing ahead with the legislation showed it was a ` liberal democrat obsession ' . ` but it is also a distraction for parliament from important debate and an irrelevance to the british people . i will be proud to vote against it , ' he added . mr burns wrote last night to mr cameron and the government 's chief whip patrick mcloughlin informing them of his intentions and inviting them to sack him . number 10 said any member of the government voting against or abstaining in tonight 's vote would lose their job . at least one other parliamentary private secretary is expected to quit , with half a dozen more harbouring serious doubts . under the government 's plans , the . house of lords , which will soon have 1,000 appointed and hereditary . members , will be transformed into a democratic chamber over 15 years . members . will be elected in three tranches at the next three general elections , . using a system of proportional representation designed to ensure no . party wins an overall majority . ` constitutional catastrophe ' : tory stalwart nicholas soames , who has defied his party only once in three decades , said the bill ` must be defeated at all costs ' by 2025 , there will be 450 members serving single 15-year terms . eighty per cent will be elected and 20 per cent appointed by an independent commission . pro-reform ministers say it is high time to end the culture of cronyism which means parties appointing failed mps , ex-ministers and donors to an unelected second house . but mr burns insisted the proposals would produce a second chamber of parliament ` with a new phalanx of politicians chosen from lists selected by the political parties and their ever-diminishing memberships ' . ` the quality of the debate in the lords is enriched by the presence of captains of industry , retired senior civil servants and military figures , people from the arts and voluntary sectors , diplomats and bishops , ' he added . ` many are figures who would never contemplate standing for political office on a party ticket . it seems obvious to me that parliament would be worse off if we swapped this for 400 party placemen . ' he warned there would be ` no stopping ' an elected lords challenging the supremacy of the commons . ` i have told the prime minister and the chief whip i can not support the bill . in all probability , this will mean that i have to give up my job . but it is too important to stop this act of constitutional vandalism to put career before principle . ' mr clegg insisted britain was the only country in the world , other than lesotho , that has a second parliamentary chamber that is appointed rather than elected . ` there is neither accountability nor legitimacy in the status quo . surely it is time to trust the british people , ' mr clegg told mps . conservative constitutional reform minister mark harper urged fellow tories to realise that labour -- which says it will vote against the government 's timetable , but support the legislation later -- was trying to damage the coalition . but baroness boothroyd of sandwell , former speaker of the commons , urged rebels to wreck the bill . ` i have never witnessed such a reckless attempt to change the british constitution and to do it on such spurious grounds , ' she said . every time nick clegg dealt with one . bunch of enemy insurgents , another lot sprouted elsewhere . i say ` enemy ' insurgents , but in fact they were on his own side of the chamber : . tories pinging curried devilment at this gulpy , scratchy-voiced deputy . pm . coalition-on-coalition . fire . here , cleggy , catch this fizzing hand grenade . ` i am very . grateful to my rt hon friend ... ka-boom !
