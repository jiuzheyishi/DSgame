' identical : from an early age the twins showed distinct personalities with jonas preferring pirates and spiderman while wyatt preferred barbie and mermaids . the gems clinic is the first of its kind . in the u.s to focus on children and teenagers with gender identity . issues . they have a multifaceted team including specialists in . gynecology , urology , social work and psychiatry . using hormone therapies , the clinic . halts puberty in transgender children , blocking the development of characteristics like breasts or facial hair , which can make the final steps to the other gender more painful and expensive .
