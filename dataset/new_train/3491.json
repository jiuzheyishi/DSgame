{"text": "speaking about the abortion scandal , jim dobbin , labour mp for heywood and middleton , said : ` it 's a mockery ' dozens of doctors found to be signing off abortions for women they had never met will not face any disciplinary action , it was revealed yesterday . the 67 doctors were identified in an investigation by nhs watchdog the care quality commission as having illegally signed blank abortion forms , which should be filled in only once they have a thorough understanding of a woman 's circumstances . one of the doctors had signed so many blank forms that they were still being used by the abortion clinic four years after he left . all 67 were referred to the general medical council but a freedom of information request has now established that none of them will be brought before a fitness to practise hearing , where they could be disciplined , suspended , or struck off . the gmc has also refused to pass the names to the police , even though the offence can merit a jail sentence . mps say the figures are evidence of a society where ` abortion is on demand ' and have accused watchdogs of covering up the crimes of doctors who remain free to practise . by law , a woman can have an abortion only if two doctors sign a form having agreed that continuing the pregnancy could cause her physical or emotional harm . the government advises that at least one doctor has seen the woman -- and at the very least , they should have thoroughly read her medical notes or spoken to her on the phone . but the cqc found that at least 67 doctors working at private and nhs clinics had pre-signed abortion forms without even knowing the names of the women they would be used for . jim dobbin , labour mp for heywood and middleton , said : ` this is clear evidence of the abortion-on-demand culture throughout the medical establishment . ` sixty-seven doctors happily referred for abortions without knowing a single thing about the woman requesting them . worse , at the very top , senior doctors and lawyers at the gmc decided to keep these crimes to themselves . this shames the gmc and makes a mockery of the abortion act . ' david burrowes , the tory mp for enfield southgate and parliamentary chairman of the conservative christian fellowship , said : ` there is something frightening about this . by law , a woman can have an abortion only if two doctors sign a form having agreed that continuing the pregnancy could cause her physical or emotional harm -lrb- stock picture -rrb- . abortions can legally be performed under certain conditions . the first is that continuing with the pregnancy involves a greater risk to the physical or mental health of the woman , or her existing children , than having a termination . the woman 's ` actual or reasonably foreseeable future environment ' may be taken into account . a non-emergency abortion must be agreed by two doctors -- or one in an emergency -- and carried out by a doctor in a government-approved hospital or clinic . the two doctors who give their consent must work for either an nhs clinic or gp surgery , or at a private provider affiliated to the health service , such as marie stopes or bpas , the british pregnancy advisory service . staff also have a duty to provide impartial and objective counselling . in september 2011 , mps rejected an attempt by tory mp nadine dorries to stop abortion providers giving nhs-funded counselling to women . ` it says something about how sinister and unaccountable abortion practice in the uk has become that such a large number of doctors could brazenly break the law and the most senior medical establishment in the land omit to refer their crimes to the police . ' the cqc carried out spot checks on 250 private and nhs abortion clinics in 2012 after it emerged that some doctors had been letting women terminate their pregnancies simply because the foetus was the ` wrong ' sex . an undercover investigation for the daily telegraph filmed consultant prabha sivaraman , who worked for both private clinics and nhs hospitals in manchester , telling a woman : ' i do n't ask questions . if you want a termination , you want a termination . ' dr raj mohan , who worked at the private calthorpe clinic in edgbaston , birmingham , was also filmed agreeing to conduct the procedure even though he told the woman : ` it 's like female infanticide , is n't it ? ' both doctors are being investigated by the gmc , although they will not face criminal charges because the crown prosecution service said it would not be in the public interest . the cqc said that during the course of its investigations its inspectors had found piles of pre-signed forms at some clinics . one was still using forms signed by a doctor who had left four years before . the daily mail used freedom of information requests to obtain figures from the gmc on the numbers of doctors referred to them for pre-signing forms following the cqc investigation . but the gmc refused to reveal the names of any of the doctors or give details about their exact job titles or where they practise . professor jack scarisbrick , chairman of life , the pro-life pregnancy counselling charity , said : ' i think it is utterly disgraceful that the gmc has n't pursued these doctors . ` how can anyone say that they are acting in  good faith  when they sign , in advance , forms authorising a serious medical intervention ? ' lord campbell-savours , a labour peer , said : ` whatever one 's position on abortion , for or against , we can all agree on one simple principle : the law passed by parliament should be enforced . '", "summary": " 67 doctors were identified in an investigation by nhs watchdog .   care quality commission said they illegally signed blank abortion forms .   but none of them will be brought before a fitness to practise hearing .
