{"text": "verrry scary things as we approached halloween : . 1 . zombies . 2 . vampires . 3 . david ortiz . it was a dark and bone-chilling night in boston , massachusetts . a game of baseball was to be played -- a spine-tingly , goose-bumpy game , game 6 of the 2013 world series , in a park fenced in by a green monster -- and the visiting st. louis cardinals had a particularly petrifying sight to face on halloween eve when , one by one , those wolfman-hairy boston red sox came to bat : .  big papi .  -lrb- screams . a thunder clap . a lightning bolt . -rrb- . oooh , as scary as the walking dead . up to the plate he stepped , 6 feet 4 , 250 pounds , lugging a huge wooden club . a cardinal or two on the front of a st. louis player 's shirt must have flown away in fear . the rest of the red sox were eerie enough , with those demented-farmer-from-a-horror-film faces of theirs . yet it was not the dark whiskers of david americo ortiz that were intimidating to anybody . it was that bat . that dangerous , deadly , pitcher 's - bloodsucking bat . sure enough , they tried to take that bat out of ortiz 's huge hands . they walked him ... and walked him ... and walked him ... . and walked him . four times , three of them intentional , but all for naught because the red sox took game 6 anyway , 6-1 , to claim the world series as their own on the green grass of home . he came to wednesday night 's game hitting .733 . no , not .333 . not even .533 , which would have been a fairly surreal bat stat . the monster masher known in new england to all as  big papi  already had 11 hits in 15 official times at bat in this world series , a fiendishly good , sell-your-soul batting average of .733 . which is kind of like playing 18 holes of golf and getting birdies on 14 or 15 of them . once when he did n't get on base , he walloped a ball to fenway park 's right-field wall that required a fence-banging , rib-bruising catch on the part of the cardinals ' carlos beltran to prevent it from being a grand slam home run . scary good , this guy has been . -lrb- a banshee 's cry . a creaking door . -rrb- . on the opposite wall of boston 's ancient park , the intimidatingly high left-field one nicknamed the  green monster ,  ghosts inside probably were cackling in delight whenever ortiz lurched up to home plate . wednesday 's game needed to be won by the visitors from missouri to stay alive . they must have felt fenway 's old walls closing in on them , like anxious villagers finding themselves trapped by stephen king under a dome . st. louis came armed with a strong team and a splendid pitching staff . yet it had to at least consider the possibility of not having a pitcher throw a single pitch to big papi . at least not one he could hit . wait ... you mean walk ortiz on purpose every time up , no matter what ? it might beat getting beat by his bat .  i remember them doing it to frank howard ,  the former big-league outfielder rick reichardt said when i touched base with him before wednesday 's game . september 2 , 1970 : cleveland indians vs. washington senators . the manager of the visiting team , alvin dark , had a dread of seeing 6-foot-7 , 255-pound frank howard stride toward the plate .  he 's the monster man in baseball ,  dark once said of him .  i never saw any man feared like this .  so , he intentionally walked howard time after time . he made pitcher sam mcdowell walk him in the first inning . -lrb- reichardt batted next and made an out . -rrb- walked him in the third inning , even though howard was the first man up . -lrb- reichardt struck out . -rrb- walked him in the fifth , again with none on base and none out . -lrb- reichardt singled , then howard scored on a wild pitch . -rrb- . it got weirder . sixth inning , two senators on base , howard up , so the cleveland manager decided to finally risk pitching to him . he told mcdowell to go from the mound to first base . he brought in the great dean chance just to pitch to howard , who promptly made dark regret it with a base hit . reichardt then knocked in a run and washington won the game . would you walk the red sox 's red-hot david ortiz every time at bat ?  every at-bat , i would not ,  reichardt told me .  but depending on the situation , it could be automatic .  this is the kind of fear that barry bonds struck in his foes . bonds was walked intentionally a whopping 120 times in the 2004 season alone . that is insane . yet to opposing managers , it felt more logical than letting bonds have a chance to belt a home run . sparky anderson refused to let george brett hit after being burned by him once too often .  anytime i 've got first base open ,  anderson said in the '80s when he was managing the detroit tigers ,  that 's where he 's going .  walk him even with the bases full ?  you bet ,  sparky said .  that 's the way they pitched ted williams . i 'll take my chances with whoever 's on deck .  ah , ted williams ... the scariest red sox of them all . willie mccovey of the san francisco giants was once walked deliberately by anderson four times in a game , whereupon he yelled to anderson in the dugout :  who do you think i am , ted williams ?  hmmm , maybe the specter of ted williams was there a-haunting fenway park as well , watching over ortiz as the red sox went out hunting for the ultimate halloween treat . the way that ortiz had been hitting in this world series , you could definitely describe it as williams-esque . big papi , unlike the man once nicknamed the splendid splinter , is a baseball slugger in an era when many fans have become suspicious of a hitter 's success . is his prowess the result of hard work and legitimate talent or are more sinister methods involved : a secret formula from a frankenstein-like laboratory , perhaps ? ahhh , but almost nobody seems to speculate that a banned steroid has ever passed through david ortiz 's flesh and veins . he seems immune to suspicion , possibly due to his always being a man of considerable size , big arms , big trunk , big head , and not some 170-pound beanpole who transformed into a baseball-crushing beast .  they pick me -lrb- to be drug-tested -rrb- every time , i do n't know why ,  ortiz said a few years ago with a bemused shrug .  all i know is all they are going to find is a lot of rice and beans .  he came to halloween eve looking to torment and haunt everyone from st. louis to the very end . -lrb- a maniacal laugh . a wolf 's howl . -rrb- . the cardinals , well , they were looking to do whatever it took , short of garlic or a stake to the heart , to fend off fenway park 's scary bat . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of mike downey .", "summary": " mike downey : david ortiz may have been the scariest thing to face cardinals this halloween .    big papi  was awesome at the plate : 11 hits in 15 official times at bat before game 6 .   downey : cardinals had to walk ortiz four times in the final game ; they lost anyway .   red sox claimed the series as their own in large part due to ortiz , downey says .
