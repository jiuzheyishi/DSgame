' the unit will be funded using money from other parts of the defence budget . two specialist fuchs nbc vehicles which had been put in storage after the unit was closed are reportedly already being tested and reconditioned at raf honnington in suffolk . the only remaining specialist chemicals unit within uk forces is the raf defence chemical biological radiological and nuclear wing . bold move : the move comes after us president barack obama made the decision that his country should intervene in syria . but that unit is described as only having limited collection and analysis capabilities . an mod spokesman told the telegraph that resources to tackle the chemical weapons threat to the uk are constantly being reviewed . security services see the danger that chemical weapons could fall into the hands of islamist fighters or extremist allies such as the iranian-backed hizbollah as a prime risk . the threat of an attack against britain using chemical weapons was downgraded in 2010 , a year before the specialist unit was scrapped . warning : mayor of london boris johnson . mayor of london boris johnson has warned that arming syrian rebels would be ` pressing weapons into the hands of maniacs .
