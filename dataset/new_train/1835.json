{"text": "junk food firms should be banned from running tv commercials before 9pm , say health experts . junk food firms should be banned from running tv commercials before 9pm to help prevent parents from being hounded by their children , say health experts . the call comes from the british heart foundation , which says current controls are weak with the result parents are under pressure to give youngsters unhealthy food and sugary drinks . seven in ten parents with children aged four to 16 have been pestered by their children to buy junk food they have seen advertised on tv , according to a new survey by the charity . the move to ban commercials for products high in fat , sugar and salt before 9pm has support of doctors and the labour party , which is expected to put the plan into its general election manifesto . almost one in three children are overweight or obese with children from poorer households almost twice as likely to fall into this category as those from the most affluent families . the bhf said obese children are more likely to become obese adults , putting them at greater risk of a coronary heart disease , stroke and some cancers in later life . the tv regulator ofcom introduced restrictions on junk food advertising during programmes specifically targeted at children in 2007 . however , it subsequently found that that this only reduced exposure to advertising of unhealthy food for children by 37per cent , and for older children -lrb- 10-15 year olds -rrb- by just 22per cent . the same research found television advertising can impact on children 's food preferences , consumption and behaviour , and that younger children in particular can not distinguish advertising from entertainment . the bhf poll found more than two fifths -- 43per cent - of parents with children aged 4 to 16 say they are badgered by their children at least once a week . almost one in three children are overweight or obese with children from poorer households almost twice as likely to fall into this category as those from the most affluent families . almost two fifths said they think junk food adverts on tv make it difficult to help their children eat a healthy diet . the bhf believes that this survey highlights the urgent need to close legal loopholes in the uk 's regulatory system which mean companies are free to promote unhealthy food and drink products to children both online and on tv during popular family tv shows . the group 's director of policy , mike hobday , said : ` regulations for tv and online advertising in the uk are weak . loopholes in the system mean that every day millions of children are exposed to sophisticated marketing techniques specifically designed to lure them into unhealthy eating habits . ` this evidence shows that junk food ads are having a detrimental impact on children 's behaviour and are hindering parents ' efforts to get their children to eat healthily . ` we can not allow companies to continue exploiting holes in the system at the expense of our children 's health . the government must act now to help give children a stronger chance at fending off future heart disease . ' the idea of a ban before the 9pm tv watershed has been condemned by the health secretary jeremy hunt -lrb- above -rrb- , who said that ` banning and legislation not always the answer ' the policy is also supported by the academy of medical royal colleges , which said : ` only a ban on advertising before the 9pm watershed would prevent children from viewing unhealthy content during family orientated programming . ` children of all ages are still exposed to a large amount of unhealthy food and drink advertising via popular all-ages programmes , such as soaps or reality shows . ` while parents and those that care for children have a role to play in the food that their children consume , the food manufacturing industry have a major influence in terms of marketing and pricing . ' the idea of a ban before the 9pm tv watershed has been condemned by the health secretary jeremy hunt , who said that ` banning and legislation not always the answer ' and that ` backing families to make better choices brings lasting change ' . the trade body which speaks for advertising companies , the incorporated society of british advertisers , said there is no such thing as junk food , only junk diets . spokesman , ian twinn , said : ` there is room for concern about childhood and adult obesity and levels of people being overweight . sadly the debate then breaks down for two simple reasons . first , campaigners seem convinced that foods can be called ` junk ' , very few foods are . ` secondly , the prescribed solutions , usually ad bans or exiling ads to late night , are placebos , which if taken seriously will not make people thin . ` we need to continue educating children and parents on the issues of a healthy and responsible diet . the advertising industry is committed to this , but are the campaigners ? ' nick court , of the food & drink federation , said : ` in the uk we have one of the strictest advertising regulatory regimes in the world concerning the foods that can be advertised to children on tv . ` these rules are comprehensively adhered to and enforced . many companies go even further , developing their own responsible marketing guidelines and making voluntary commitments .
