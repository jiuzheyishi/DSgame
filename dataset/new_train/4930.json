{"text": "after years of thinking it over , floyd corkins finally had a plan . he 'd bought a gun and learned how to use it . he 'd loaded three magazines . and he had stopped by chick-fil-a to pick up 15 sandwiches , which he planned to smear in the dying faces of staffers he expected to kill at the family research council in washington . it would be a statement , he said ,  against the people who work in that building ,  according to documents filed in u.s. district court , where corkins pleaded guilty on wednesday to three charges related to the august shooting at the conservative policy group . corkins told judge richard roberts that he hoped to intimidate gay rights opponents . the shooting came amid intense debate over remarks against gay marriage by an executive with the atlanta-based chick-fil-a restaurant chain and the company 's support for groups considered hostile to gay rights . the research council , a christian group that focuses on family , anti-abortion and religious liberty issues and views homosexuality as harmful , backed chick-fil-a in the ensuing controversy .  they endorse chick-fil-a and also chick-fil-a came out against gay marriage , so i was going to use that as a statement ,  prosecutors quoted corkins as telling investigators . corkins , 28 , pleaded guilty to committing an act of terrorism while armed , interstate transportation of a firearm and ammunition , and assault with intent to kill while armed . prosecutors dropped seven other charges . the charges carry sentences of up to 70 years in prison . however , the sentence could be shorter because corkins has no prior criminal record . corkins will be sentenced april 29 , prosecutors said . the act of terrorism charge alleges that corkins wanted to kill building manager leo johnson and other family research council employees  with the intent to intimidate and coerce a significant portion of the civilian population of the district of columbia and the united states .  it is a district of columbia law passed in 2002 but never before used . according to prosecutors ' account of the attack filed on wednesday , corkins got into the family research council 's building by telling johnson that he was there to interview for an internship . after johnson asked for identification , prosecutors say , corkins reached into his backpack , retrieved a handgun and leveled it at johnson 's head . johnson ducked and lunged at corkins before he could fire a shot , according to prosecutors . as the two struggled , corkins fired three times , hitting johnson once in the arm , before the building manager was able to wrestle him to the ground , disarm him and hold him at gunpoint until police arrived . as he lay on the ground , corkins said something to the effect ,  ` it 's not about you . ' it 's about the frc and its policies ,  according to the prosecution account . corkins -- who had chosen the research council as his target after finding it listed as an anti-gay group on the website of the southern poverty law center -- had planned to stride into the building and open fire on the people inside in an effort to kill as many as possible , he told investigators , according to the court documents . if he 'd been successful and escaped , his plan was to go to another conservative group to continue the attack , prosecutors said . a handwritten list naming three other groups he planned to attack was found among his belongings , prosecutors said . according to the documents , corkins had thought about such an attack for years but  just never went through with it .  he purchased the gun used in the attack a week before at a virginia gun store , where a french television crew taped him while doing a story about the widespread availability of guns in america , according to prosecutors . he also went to the store the day before the attack for two hours of training . u.s. attorney ronald machen said corkins ' guilty plea  makes clear that using violence to terrorize political opponents will not be tolerated .  at the time of the shooting , corkins lived with his parents in herndon , virginia , and volunteered at a washington center for the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender community . in august , fbi investigators said in an affidavit that investigators had interviewed corkins ' parents after the shooting , and they said their son  has strong opinions with respect to those he believes do not treat homosexuals in a fair manner .  the southern poverty law center has listed the family research council as a hate group since 2010 , pointing to what it describes as its anti-gay propaganda and legislative agenda . on his nightly radio show on wednesday , family research council president tony perkins mentioned the plea deal and accused the southern poverty law center of playing a role in the shooting by inciting hatred and violence rather than fighting it -- a claim he has repeatedly made since the shooting .  the southern poverty law center is dangerous . they are inciting hatred , and in this case a clear connection to violence ,  he said on the radio broadcast .  they need to be held accountable , and they need to be stopped before people are killed because of their reckless labeling and advocacy for homosexuality and their anti-christian stance .  a spokeswoman for the center declined to comment on the plea deal or the research council 's comments , but referred to a statement from the organization last year , standing by its designation of the family research council as a  hate group .   as people who care about human dignity , we have a moral obligation to call out the frc for its demonizing lies and incendiary rhetoric about the lgbt community ,  the statement said .  the fact that we list the frc as a hate group because of its demonizing propaganda does not make us the hateful one . spreading demonizing lies is what is dangerous , not exposing them . ", "summary": " the president of the frc accuses the southern poverty law center of  inciting violence    floyd corkins , pleads guilty , says he wanted to intimidate those who oppose gay rights .   he faces up to 70 years in prison when sentenced april 29 .   building manager wrestled with corkins and disarmed him after being shot in august incident .
