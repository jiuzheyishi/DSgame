{"text": "a farm field overlooking the york river in tidewater , virginia , is believed to be where pocahontas interceded with her powerful father powhatan to rescue captain john smith from death . the story goes that just as the great chief lifted his war club to carry out the execution , his young daughter laid her head on the english explorer 's to protect him . but that 's a fanciful footnote for many virginia indians , historians and archaeologists , who say the real story is that this land was the centre of a complex , sprawling empire ruled by powhatan long before the first permanent english settlement on american soil was founded in 1607 . it was called werowocomoco , which roughly translates to a ` place of chiefs . ' pocahontas saving the life of captain john smith : this image provided by the library of congress illustrates the tale of the native american princess . archaeologists say they have found the capital of her father 's empire . ` this is like our washington , ' said kevin brown , chief of the pamunkey tribe . ` history did n't begin in 1607 and there are a lot of people who overlook that . ' on loan to archaeologists for more than a decade , these 57 privately owned acres will be preserved forever under an agreement years in the making and to be officially announced on friday . the deal is important for native . americans because they believe their story has been overshadowed for . centuries by the narrative of captain smith and his fellow europeans . in a departure from past digs . involving native sites , archaeologists sought the counsel of indian . leaders before and during the exploration , honouring their wishes that . burial grounds not be disturbed and helping interpret what was . discovered . legendary figure : a portrait of pocahontas , who converted to christianity after she was captured by the english and married a settler . for ashley atkins , a college of william & mary doctoral candidate who has worked at the site since 2005 , ` recovering things out of the ground ' was secondary to working with her fellow pamunkey . ` unfortunately , native people in the past have had no involvement at all in the way that their history has been investigated , uncovered and presented to the public , ' said ms atkins , who is 28 . ` most people would think ,  they would n't be involved in uncovering your own history ?  but the reality is that has not been the common practice . ' jeff brown , a pamunkey and kevin . brown 's brother , worked at the site for years . he recalled indians . visiting the sweeping expanse overlooking the york river and being . overcome . ` it gets emotional , ' he said . ` and when you 're digging you can really feel it . ' martin gallivan , a william & mary anthropologist , said the involvement of native people ` enhanced the project immensely . ' only . a fraction of werewocomoco has been explored , perhaps just 2 per cent . after decades of research , archaeologists used the writings of captain . smith and others , ancient maps and their own detective work to conclude . with near-certainty that this was powhatan 's seat of power . it was just 15 miles from jamestown , the first permanent english settlement established in the new world . powhatan 's . powerful chiefdom covered 30 political divisions and a population of 15,000 to . 20,000 people , while nearby jamestown settlers struggled to survive in their new environment . excavations have yielded the outline . of the largest longhouse ever found in virginia and a system of ditches . that may have separated sacred and secular areas . 'em otional ' : pamunkey indian jeff brown , left , with randolph turner , retired state archaeologist , centre , and martin gallivan , college of william professor , right , who have all worked on the excavation of the site . randolph turner , a retired state archaeologist whose hunt for werewocomoco dates to the seventies , said powhatan 's empire was ` one of the most complex political entities in all of eastern north america . ' the leader ` had the power of life and death ' and expanded his empire through warfare or the threat of warfare . ` he 's one of the most interesting political and military figures that i 've ever read about , ' mr turner said . ` and we 're just getting hints in the historical records of all he accomplished in his lifetime . ' spiritual : mr brown , whose brother is chief of the pamunkey tribe , helped with the excavations . in a departure from past digs at native sites , archaeologists sought the counsel of indian leaders . retelling an untold story : professor gallivan gestures as he walks the site , which was discovered by chance by the landowner when she found arrowheads and fragments of pipes while out walking her dog . ` one of the most complex political entities in all of eastern north america ' : mr turner , centre , said powhatan is one of the most interesting political and military figures that he has ever read about . the discovery of werewocomoco can be credited to a pure-bred dog belonging to the land 's owners , lynn and robert ripley . lynn . ripley used to walk around their land with her chesapeake bay . retriever , an american kennel club competitor named mobjack rhett master . hunter . she would remove debris that could cut her dog 's paws , and . found arrowheads , spear tips , pipe stems and pottery shards . ' i . just seemed to have an eye for it , ' she said . ` that 's how it all began , . so our dog would n't cut his feet . it 's like we were meant to be there . and i was meant to find these things . ' the clincher was the discovery of copper , which was valued by the indians as gold is today . ' i am absolutely convinced this is werewocomoco , ' mr turner said . ` it makes no sense for it to be anywhere else . ' that conclusion is supported by the u.s. park service , william & mary , the virginia department of historic resources and the association for the preservation of virginia antiquities . virginia indians hope work at the site will continue to build on what is known about powhatan and the centuries before him , dispelling myths about what the first european settlers found when they arrived . ' i want people to understand there was a real civilisation , a complex cultural community that existed prior to european colonisation , ' ms atkins said . ` europeans did n't bring civilisation . they brought a lot of other things , some good , some bad . ' kathleen kilpatrick , executive director of the state 's historic resources agency , said the site ` certainly tells an aspect of a story that often goes untold . in tangible ways , it is their jamestown . ' digging up the hidden past : this june 26 , 2003 photo provided by the . werowocomoco research group shows students hard at work excavating the . site , where among other things they discovered the outline of the . largest longhouse ever found in virginia and a system of ditches that . may have separated sacred and secular areas . the preservation will be commemorated on friday at a ceremony with virginia governor bob mcdonnell and indian leaders . an easement will ensure the site remains undeveloped and open to future exploration . it is part of more than 250 acres owned by the ripleys , who have lived there for nearly 17 years . when ms kilpatrick approached them with the idea of preserving the site , ` we decided it really is the best thing , ' robert ripley said . ` if we do nothing else for virginia indians , we 've done the very best because we have preserved it for all time with an entity that has the power to enforce its easement : the state of virginia , ' he said . mrs ripley said , ` it 's their heritage , their history . we felt a huge responsibility to protect it . ' she hopes her collection of artifacts can be displayed someday in a museum on the site . centuries after powhatan ruled , she added , this place still resonates with what it once was . ` it 's definitely a sacred place , ' she said . ` it 's serene , it 's spiritual , it 's beautiful . i feel very good about what we 've done .
