{"text": "national guard troops stationed on the texas-mexico border ca n't arrest illegal immigrants , but texas gov. rick perry says the deterrent factor makes sending the troops there worthwhile . ` it 's a powerful reminder that what you are doing is a crime , ' perry told an online news outlet run by the conservative heritage foundation . ` it 's just like a law enforcement effort in your neighborhood , where you see a parked patrol police car on the corner , and the bad guys see it and do n't commit a crime . ' scroll down for video . texas governor rick perry announced on july 28 that he would deploy up to 1,000 national guard troops along the texas-mexico border to assist the u.s. border patrol in stopping illegal immigration . no federal government border presence : u.s. border patrol agents escorted this group of illegal immingrants into custody on july 22 near falfurrias , texas -- 85 miles from the us-mexico boder . he told the news website the daily signal that it was his decision to keep his state 's national guard detachment out of the law-enforcement business . ` their real job is not apprehension , ' perry said . ` border patrol apprehends . ' but many of those federal agents have been re-tasked in recent months to glorified babysitting duties , caring for the hundreds of unaccompanied minors flooding the border . public outcry , especially among texas ranchers and tea party groups , drove perry to deploy the national guard . he said tuesday that u.s. border patrol agents will be grateful for the help . ` they are n't displacing border patrol , ' perry said of the national guard troops , who will number as many as 1,000 . ` it 'll be just like how we partner with law enforcement . they want to see the border secure , so they wo n't resist the assistance . just the presence and knowledge that they 're deployed will have a powerful message . ' the national guard will mostly work alongside state law-enforcement officers deployed at the border by perry earlier this month . ` for those who say ,  this is very out of the ordinary ,  the national guard being at the border is not an unusual situation , ' he added . ` there 's troops at the border every year and there 's troops there now . ' president george w. bush ordered national guard units to patrol america 's southwest border in 2006 . president barack obama extended that order in 2010 . but his 2012 executive order of a virtual amnesty for hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants brought to the u.s. as children before 2007 has led to a wave of central american children and teens seeking the same treatment . with that development , existing border security measures have proven inadequate . flood : hundreds of children and teens from central american countries pour across the border daily and turn themselves in to federal agents , hoping for a ` permiso ' document that will allow them to stay pending an immigration court hearing . obama visited texas just weeks ago but decided not to visit the border region . perry later said that during a private meeting , obama conceded that he was unaware most u.s. border patrol officers were stationed dozens of miles inside the united states -- not on the border itself . that arrangement has left them powerless to detain illegal immigrants until they are in the united states . perry 's deployment of texas department of public safety officers followed that meeting . ` the responsibility for securing the border rests exclusively on the federal government , ' perry wrote to that agency 's director on june 18 . ` the federal government 's failure to secure the border has created an incentive for families to send their children on a dangerous , and sometimes fatal , journey . ' ` until the federal government fulfills its duty , ' perry declared , ` it falls on the state of texas to address those obligations . '", "summary": " texas governor deployed up to 1,000 national guard troops to the us-mexico border this month but did n't give them arrest powers .   he argues that their deterrent factor alone is worth the exercise .   troops will work alongside state police agencies perry activated as a supplement to what he says are inadequate measures from washington .   hundreds of children and teens pour across the border from mexico every day , following a 2012 amnesty announcement from president obama that only affects illegal immigrants brought to america as children before 2007 .
