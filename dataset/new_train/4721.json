{"text": "it is not easy to capture a man 's life in 152 minutes , let alone a life as illustrious and complex as nelson mandela 's . for london-born actor idris elba , who played the south african leader in the 2013 biopic  mandela : long walk to freedom ,  the task was sure to feel herculean .  i could never really articulate what it felt like to play mandela properly in an interview ,  he admits in a phone conversation with cnn . though the actor is british , and physically bears little resemblance to the late south african leader , elba recalls the unexpectedly warm reception he received , particularly from extras on set -- many of whom were locals who lived through the apartheid era .  south africa is very embracing . even though i 'm not from south africa and was about to play mandela , they still gave me a lot of love ,  he says . by the end of filming , many were even calling him  madiba .  the experience , life-changing in many ways , was bound to feel odd . for elba , the best way to capture not just the man but the feeling of playing him on film , was through music . next week will see the release of  mi mandela ,  a tribute to mandela made up of songs written and produced by elba himself , and performed by a mixture of south african and british talent , including mumford & sons , the mahotella queens and maverick sabre .  there were various sensations i experienced -lrb- playing mandela -rrb- , and i could never give an answer i was satisfied with . i think this album represents that answer . it allows me to express the feelings of playing him ,  says elba . the  luther  actor describes the record as a  character album ,  and hopes to produce similar projects for the many other roles he 's taken on over the years . in this respect ,  mi mandela  is as much about his own journey as it is about mandela 's . in the album 's title song -- the only one that elba performs on -- he has a tongue-in-cheek lyric about the casting choice .  all the families showed me love , the people wished me well/the whole town wondering how mandela could be played by stringer bell ,  he sings , referring to his breakout role in hbo 's  the wire .   it 's the thoughts i was thinking at the time of making that film . music is a good way to get closer to a character , closer to an actor . it describes the whole journey of playing mandela . it 's better than any picture , any postcard , any script , any autograph from an actor ,  he says .  i would love to hear a character album from marlon brando in ` the godfather , '  he admits .  just to understand what marlon was going through at the time of making that film , how he was feeling playing that character . what kind of music would that be ? what would it sound like ? that would be fascinating for me .  a link to his father . for elba , playing mandela had personal resonance as well , as filming for the role coincided with the death of his father .  i lost both men around the same time ,  elba confides .  mandela reminded me of my dad , and my dad reminded me of him . they were both massive symbols in my life .  elba describes how his father , a sierra leone-born shop steward working out of london 's hackney , fought for the rights of union workers at a time in english history when their plight was particularly arduous -lrb- it was maggie thatcher 's time in power , after all -rrb- .  he was always equating himself with mandela and people like mandela who were standing up for what they believed in , and i would always succumb to 30-minute lectures about rights ,  he recalls . he co-wrote the song  tree ,  which features on the album and is performed by american artists audra mae and cody chesnutt , partially as a tribute to his father .  somebody tell my father , that we are standing by his tree / and even though we miss him , we are glad that he 's set free ,  the lyrics go .  that song is particularly moving to me ,  says elba .  as much as i wrote it for my dad , it relates to mandela too , even more so now .  idris elba 's  mi mandela  is set for release on november 24 .", "summary": " actor idris elba releases his first album ,  mi mandela  next week .   it describes the sensation of playing nelson mandela in film  mandela : long walk to freedom    elba plans to release other  character albums  for luther and stringer bell in the future .
