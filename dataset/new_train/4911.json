{"text": "which country boasts the world 's fastest growing clean energy investment ? germany ? no . united states ? think again . jumping from a few hundred million dollars to $ 5.7 billion , south africa recorded last year the world 's highest growth in renewable energy investment , according to the u.n. environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- . the spectacular surge , led largely by investments in solar power projects , comes as south africa moves to reduce its dependency on coal , which accounts for around 86 % of its energy . to achieve that , the country has set the ambitious target of generating 18 gigawatts -lrb- gw -rrb- of clean energy by 2030 . as a result , a series of investments have trickled into the country , including google 's first foray into africa 's solar power market . the internet giant , which has spent more than $ 1 billion in renewable energy projects in the united states and europe in recent years , announced in late may its decision to back the jasper power project , a 96 mw solar photovoltaic -lrb- pv -rrb- plant in northern cape , with a $ 12 million investment . read this : ` solar sisters ' spreading light in africa .  we only pursue investments that we believe make financial sense ,  said rick needham , google 's director of energy and sustainability .  south africa 's strong resources and supportive policies for renewable energy make it an attractive place to invest .  abundance of sun . once completed , jasper is expected to be one of the biggest solar installations in the continent , capable of generating enough power for some 30,000 homes . it 's no secret that africa has plentiful sunshine , with many parts of the continent enjoying daily solar radiation of between 4 kwh and 6 kwh per square meter . but it 's no secret , either , that africa has the world 's lowest electricity access rates , with more than half of its countries experiencing daily -- and costly -- power outages . amid such conditions , experts say investments in large-scale solar power projects could transform a continent faced with fast-rising populations and increasing demand for energy to support its economic growth .  six out of the 10 fastest economies in the world -lrb- over the past decade -rrb- were in africa , and that requires much more energy , at a faster-growing pace than we 've seen before ,  says frank wouters , deputy director-general of the international renewable energy agency . ambitious projects . and some countries have already taken notice . while south africa is clearly setting the pace , projects are being announced across the continent as more countries look to unlock their massive solar potential . in late april , mauritania launched what 's described as africa 's biggest solar pv plant so far , a 15 mw facility that is designed to account for 10 % of the country 's energy capacity , according to its developers . in early may , morocco began the first phase of the construction of a 160 mw concentrated solar power technology plant near ouarzazate as part of the country 's efforts to produce 2,000 mw of solar energy by 2020 . and late last year , british company blue energy announced plans to build the nzema project in ghana , a 155 mw facility . construction at the $ 400 million project is expected to begin in the first quarter of next year , while the plant should become fully operational by the end of 2015 . obstacles . yet , despite such ambitious schemes , experts say the continent is far from exploiting its massive solar energy potential . according to the international energy agency , coal , oil and gas together accounted for 81 % of africa 's total power generation in 2009 , with nuclear power making up 2 % , hydropower 16 % and all other renewable sources accounting for just 1 % . read this : harnessing pedal power to light up africa . wouters says that a lack of awareness about the current price competitiveness of solar technology , coupled with wider inefficiencies in the performance of most power utilities across the continent , is preventing african countries from scaling up their solar energy production . another problem is financing , as higher up-front capital costs , longer payback periods and a lack of solar-project experience in the banking sector make access to funds more challenging .  you need to involve banks and for many banks in africa this is also new , so again you have to raise awareness ,  says wouters .  money typically comes with a risk premium which makes it more expensive than necessary .  actions . others say , however , that it 's inadequate policies and a lack of political commitment that prevent solar from taking off .  the governments in africa should change their attitude of thinking that solar is too expensive ,  says dickens kamughisa , chief executive of uganda-based ngo africa institute for energy governance .  every decision should be based on research that can help in allocating the energy budgets .  last year , a unep report said that africa 's power sector needs to install an estimated 7,000 mw of new generation capacity each year . it warned that  unless stronger commitments and effective policy measures are taken to reverse current trends ,  half the population of sub-saharan africa will be without electricity in 2030 . mark hankins , director of kenya-based african solar designs , says that in order for africa to tap its clean energy potential , solar must take center stage in the continent 's energy discussions .  there needs to be a serious reassessment of how to do policy and finance to help solar meet its potential in africa ,  says hankins .  this means not just addressing the needs of poor people -- it means using solar to address the energy sector needs for on and off grid and ... using it to help business ,  he adds .  solar needs to be at the table , with all of the other technologies . ", "summary": " solar power projects are increasingly being announced across africa .   experts say that africa can use solar power to fuel its future growth .   lack of awareness and financing are still major challenges .   industry insiders also call for new policies to help the sector to take off .
