{"text": "google is knocking at your front door . it wants to come inside , make itself at home , and quietly turn all of your boring home devices into  smart  connected gadgets that learn about your patterns and preferences , talk to each other , collect data about your habits and make life easier by assisting with daily tasks . on monday , google announced it was buying smart-device company nest labs for $ 3.2 billion in cash . this is google 's first major foray into connected homes , and news of the deal ignited a flurry of speculation about what the silicon valley giant really wants from nest , as well as some privacy concerns . nest currently only sells two products : a smart thermostat that learns your habits over time and adjusts the temperature accordingly , and a personable smoke and carbon monoxide detector that does n't panic when you burn toast . while the devices have been popular , on the surface they do n't seem like they move enough units to be worth such a hefty investment , even at $ 130 to $ 250 each . it 's what 's behind the scenes and inside the gadgets that makes nest a coveted get for google . nest makes impeccably designed hardware powered by clever algorithms . its staff comes from major companies like apple , sling and logitech and is experienced in machine learning , product design , artificial intelligence and robotics . nest is a standout in the increasingly crowded connected-home market . it may only have two products , but those devices are considered some of the best in the field . for now , nest is expected to continue operating as its own brand headed by co-founders tony fadell and matt rogers , but down the line google could tap the team 's expertise to help with its own hit-and-miss attempts at creating and selling devices -lrb- remember the nexus q ? -rrb- . the nest thermostat uses motion , light , temperature and humidity sensors to collect information about what 's going on in the home and uses that information to control heating and cooling and predict patterns . the end result is a customized , more energy efficient home . like any good smart device , it can be controlled from a smartphone or tablet so your house can be prewarmed before you get out of bed or return from work .  it 's amazing to see how they have taken important but unloved devices and made them beautifully simple and useful ,  said google ceo larry page in a brief post announcing the deal . aside from the financial windfall , there 's a lot nest could gain from having google as its parent company . nest has been slow with product releases so far . the first thermostat came out in the fall of 2011 , and the company did n't release a new product for another two years , when it announced the nest protect smoke and co detector . with google resources , nest can ramp up its design process and develop more projects . new products will come faster and roll out in more locations globally . google also wants to be a player in the connected home . the trend of connecting previously  dumb  devices to each other and the internet is sometimes referred to as the  internet of things .  as regular objects get connected , they gain the ability to collect information about mundane happenings around them . that data can be used to learn about a person over time and offer a customized , automated experience . at home , that can mean a refrigerator that knows what food is inside and when it expires , or security systems that send your smartphone a push notification when they detect anything unusual . google has cultivated a diverse and seemingly random set of interests since starting out as a search engine and advertising company . it dabbles in e-mail , smartphones , self-driving cars , social networking , smart glasses , television and robots . nest is the latest in a string of intriguing acquisitions , following a handful of robotics companies . in the near future , these interests may not seem so disconnected . today 's emerging technologies will eventually blend together . the divisions between smartphones , home automation , cars , smart glasses and watches and fitness trackers will fall away , and our gadgets and data will work together for a seamless experience . all of your devices will communicate with each other . where one drops off another will pick up . your self-driving car will share push notifications from your smartphone , turn it over to your google glass when you park and start walking , and then a smart home can take over when you walk through your front door . -lrb- thanks to gps on your phone and car , the house knew exactly when you were arriving and turned on your favorite tv show . -rrb- streams of data from all these devices will be collected in one place where a company like google will analyze it and learn about you over time , programming hardware and software to meet your unique needs . a few years from now , you might even connect your smart devices to your brain . dean aslam , a professor of electrical and computer engineering at michigan state university and a senior member of ieee , is working on miniaturizing single electrode devices that can be placed in your hair and read electrical activity from the brain through a technology called electroencephalography , or eeg .  it can read the brainwaves which determine the state of our minds , like whether we 're healthy or unhealthy . a lot of information can be obtained -lsb- from eeg -rsb- ,  aslam said . he says in the future , smart homes will pick up on cues from the body and brain to adjust things like temperature . it if detects you 're in a deep rem sleep , a home might increase the level of security . the technology would n't be limited to smart homes and could expand to include personal heath care systems . if this is the future , it 's no mystery why google would want to get into the business now . google owning another tool that would allow it to gather more data immediately triggered privacy concerns . fresh off of an unpopular decision to allow google + contacts to contact people in their circles through gmail , google already has users who are unsettled by the vast amounts of data the company can collect . google has access to a person 's data through the chrome browser , gmail accounts , google search terms and the many advanced sensors on an android smartphone . that wide reach is actually a good reason not to worry about a smart thermostat . google can collect most of the same information through an android phone . it already knows your location and your daily schedule . samsung 's galaxy s4 android smartphone even has a built-in temperature sensor . google has access to much of your data . now it wants to put it to use connecting your home , work and mobile life .", "summary": " google is purchasing smart-thermostat company nest for $ 3.2 billion in cash .   this is google 's first major entry into the connected home market .   smart homes , phones , cars and glasses could all work together for a google-powered life .
