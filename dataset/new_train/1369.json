{"text": "early man : the descendants of the first humans to leave africa thousands of years ago shrank to little more than 1,000 . the number of descendants of the first humans to leave africa shrank to little more than 1,000 before expanding rapidly , a study has revealed . scientists discovered the population of the ancestors of modern asian and european people dwindled to just 1,200 who were ` actively reproducing ' . they also found that african populations crashed to around 5,700 people . and , contrary to popular opinion , the study revealed that these early humans continued to breed with sub-saharan africans until as recently as 20,000 years ago . the findings were made by genome scientist richard durbin and his then research assistant heng li at the wellcome trust sanger institute near cambridge . they mined the publicly available dna sequence of american biologist craig venter - who was one of the first to sequence the human genome - as well as the sequences from six other people . by taking just a single person 's genome , the pair were able to learn an entire population 's history . traditionally geneticists keen to look back at human history have compared dna sequences from numerous people around the world to determine how different populations relate to one another and when they might have gone their separate ways . discovery : richard durbin , left , mined the dna sequence of american biologist craig venter , right , as part of a project which found that the first humans out of africa shrunk to just 1,000 . but they have now found that part of a . person 's genome - which stores hereditary information - can also be . followed back in time to when just one version , a common ancestor , existed . john novembre , a population geneticist at the university of california , los angeles , explained the theory to nature.com . ` each little piece of the genome has its own unique bit of history and goes to a unique ancestor as you go further and further back . ` as you look at different parts of the genome , you get access to different parts of history . ' using this theory mr durbin and mr li were able to determine a way to calculate - from the ages of different segments of a single person 's genome - changes in the population size of our ancestors . most experts now believe that modern humans evolved in . africa between 150,000 and 60,000 years ago and then migrated to the near east , . europe , asia and eventually america . they looked at the genomes of mr venter . as well as those of two europeans , two asian men and two west african men . they all told the same story until about 100,000 years ago when their populations began to split and decrease in size . it is believed this reflected the first human migrations out of africa . the two scientists were also able to compare the dna from an african and a non-african to determine when their ancestors stopped interbreeding after the first humans left africa . previous research from human remains and artefacts found that humans colonized europe , asia and australia about 40,000 years ago which prevented the opportunity to interbreed with africans . but the new study by mr durbin and mr li has found that these groups may have continued to interbreed until as recently as 20,000 years ago . mr durbin said he believes this could be because after the first humans left africa 60,000 years ago , they were followed by waves of africans who interbred with the ancestors of the earlier migrants . despite this , chris stringer , a palaeoanthropologist at the natural history museum in london , said that 20,000 to 50,000 years ago , human populations outside of africa were probably small and widely dispersed , so regular interbreeding with africans seemed unlikely . ` there could have been surges of gene flow at particular times , driven by innovations or environmental change , but it would be surprising if these continued right through that period ,  he says . the theory used by mr durbin and mr li can not reveal every chapter of human history . but it is hoped that scientists will now be able to use the new approach to determine when neanderthals and a mysterious sister population known as denisovans stopped breeding with one another .", "summary": " study also reveals that early humans continued to breed with sub-saharan africans 20,000 years ago .   scientists believe waves of africans followed earlier migrants and interbred with their descendants .
