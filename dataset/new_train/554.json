{"text": "more of us than ever are living on our own -- and it seems that the solo lifestyle could be a cause of poor mental health . a third of britons live alone . the latest figures from the office of national statistics show that divorce rates are rising and fewer people are getting married . it is estimated that by 2020 , 40 per cent of households will have only one person . but now a study suggests that those living alone are 80 per cent more likely to be depressed than those who co-habit . shocking : between 2002 and 2008 , those people living alone were 1.8 times more likely to purchase antidepressants . researchers in finland followed 1,695 finnish men and 1,776 women aged between 30 and 65 for seven years , of whom 14 per cent lived alone . use of antidepressants was monitored simultaneously through national prescription registers . between 2002 and 2008 , those people living alone were 1.8 times more likely to purchase antidepressants . researchers attributed this discrepancy to a number of reasons . lack of social support was a major risk factor in men and poverty was more likely to affect women . the results come as no surprise to experts in the uk . ` we know that loneliness is a major factor in depression , ' says consultant psychiatrist dr adrian winbow , at fitzroy square hospital in london . although britons do not take as many antidepressants as the finnish , numbers are increasing . ` i 'd suggest about one in 20 britons is on antidepressants . a large proportion of those are likely to live on their own , ' he says . impact : lack of social support was a major risk factor in men and poverty was more likely to affect women . although it may seem surprising that those of working age are so prone to depression -- presumably those with jobs have daily interaction with others -- dr winbow points out that the current economic climate has put great pressure on employees . ` if you are lucky enough to have a job , you are probably working longer hours and expectations will be higher , ' he says . ` this stress is hugely alleviated if you have someone at home with whom you can laugh or complain to . marriage brings a decreased risk for all psychiatric problems . ' of course , if you are n't working then this is an extra reason for low moods . so what can you do ? ` join a gym or a group in the evenings to improve your social life , ' dr winbow suggests . ` alternatively get a pet -- they are proven to help with psychological problems . flat-sharing or getting a lodger are also great ways to save money and stay social .
