{"text": "sitting in the waiting room of the antenatal clinic i was aghast at the sight of the women around me . to my left , a lady awaiting a 20-week scan munched her way through an enormous bag of crisps . it was barely 10am . another woman had spread a napkin over her expansive thighs and was devouring an oversized ` breakfast muffin ' . these , as any self-respecting woman knows , are just calorie-laden cakes masquerading as a healthy meal . this is a ruse that only ever seems to fool the overweight . all around me i spotted arms , chins , thighs and bottoms . dimpled , corpulent flesh was everywhere . if it were n't for the pregnancy bumps , this easily could be mistaken for a slimming club meeting . only at a slimming club , there is a sense of shame , or responsibility and desire to change . scroll down for video . no excess weight gain : sadie at three months pregnant , left , and two months later at five months pregnant , right , she does n't look much different . ` when are you due ? ' a woman asked me . ` four weeks , ' i replied proudly . her eyes dropped immediately to my compact bump , and i could see her mental processes working overtime . her initial incredulity rapidly morphed into anger at me and pity for my unborn child . ` anorexic , ' i could tell she was thinking . ` obsessive . narcissistic . putting her own vanity before the health of her bai suspect that was the real reason behind 75-year-old feminist germaine greer 's attack on the duchess of cambridge this week . her argument was that kate , who happens to be suffering again from chronic morning sickness , was ` too thin ' , and that she ` should n't have been made to go through all this again so soon -lsb- after the birth of prince george -rsb- ' . her outburst infuriated me , as i too came in for constant criticism just because i chose not to put on mountains of blubber during my own pregnancy , which culminated a year ago in the birth of my bouncy , happy , healthy son , albie . despite the bleatings of all those who attacked me for refusing to eat for two , we were both declared to be in perfect health just hours after the birth . why wo n't people wake up and acknowledge that the real risk to unborn babies comes when their mothers are obese ? staying healthy : sadie had a small bump at six months , left , causing her friends and even strangers to criticise her for not eating enough . kate also had a neat bump when she was pregnant with prince george at six months , right . dr david haslam , chairman of the national obesity forum , recently warned : ` obesity in pregnant women can lead to all sorts of problems , including the death of the mother , or of the baby through stillbirth , or the baby having foetal abnormalities , or the woman suffering pre-eclampsia or gestational diabetes , or requiring a caesarean because either she or the baby is too big . ' i firmly believe that if more mothers adopted my - and kate 's - approach to pregnancy , scant nhs resources would not be wasted treating the problems associated with maternal obesity . every woman has a duty to exercise and eat healthily before and during pregnancy - for her own good and the good of her unborn child . the morning of that antenatal appointment for example , i 'd already done an hour 's workout in the gym and eaten a bowl of organic porridge for breakfast . this was all part of my campaign to ensure i only gained minimal weight during pregnancy . and , i 'm pleased to say , it worked . four weeks before having my baby boy by caesarean section - essential due to complications with the placenta - i was still wearing my pre-pregnancy size 10 tops . i never bought any maternity wear at all - except for some pregnancy jeans with stretchy waistbands . my pregnancy coincided with kate 's first and i would examine photos of her forensically . i felt absolutely inspired by her mini-bump and otherwise slim frame . of course , the mummy-tummy mafia were n't so keen , branding her selfish for remaining trim and claiming this put pressure on ordinary mums not to pile on the pounds . for me , kate - known for her love of sport - was welcome proof that not every mother-to-be has to turn into an overweight , out-of-shape slob . and like kate , i was seven months pregnant before my bump even started to show in my clothes . starting to bloom : a more noticeable bump at seven months , right , and seven-and-a-half-months , left , but she was still slim compared to the other expectant women she met who had seen pregnancy as an excuse to pile on the pounds . according to my midwife , it was the legacy of my tight abdominal muscles , developed through years of regular exercise . she estimated i 'd gained just a stone-and-a-half when i was full term . i was well within the healthy weight-gain boundaries . experts recommend you should put on no more than 21 to 28lb while expecting , a combination of baby , placenta , amniotic fluid , extra blood and around half a stone of fat laid down naturally in preparation for breastfeeding . but , just like poor kate , i had to defend myself throughout , to everyone from friends to other pregnant women and even strangers . at five months , when i still had no visible baby bump , friends started to voice their concern , telling me sanctimoniously that i was failing my unborn baby . this went on right up until the moment i gave birth last september . ` are you eating properly ? ' one old friend demanded when i met her for dinner at seven months . ` is n't it time you let go of your need to be slim for once ? ' snarled another . one close girlfriend was particularly vociferous , exclaiming : ` you 've not put on nearly enough weight , you need to concentrate on nourishing your baby . ' that hurt , as it insinuated that i was n't putting my son 's health first when that could n't have been further from the truth . in the gym there were looks of disdain on the faces of other members at the sight of a pregnant woman lifting weights . and out powerwalking - i stopped running outdoors at 17 weeks - the disapproving tuts of passers-by were audible . when i wrote in this newspaper last year about exercising till i was eight months pregnant , i was vilified , with critics even suggesting my child would be born underweight or with shaken baby syndrome . yet when did you ever hear anyone berate a pregnant woman for putting her feet up , gorging herself on cream cakes and chips and whacking on a pile of unnecessary weight ? all i did was continue to exercise daily and eat a diet rich in chicken , turkey and fish , lots of fresh vegetables and homemade soups . full-term : sadie had gained just a stone-and-a-half - and she was back in her size 10 jeans just over a fortnight after giving birth . proud : despite the mummy mafia 's reservations , albie was born weighing a very healthy 7lb 6oz . all of this was done with the blessing of my obstetrician , who said that she wished more women would take the approach i had . my priority was to be the healthiest i could be for the good of my baby . but i 'm not ashamed to admit that i was also terrified of losing my figure out of vanity . what 's wrong with that ? why would i suddenly want to be fat just because i was pregnant ? my husband 's only concern was that i and our baby were healthy . but i 've always taken pride in my appearance and would have seen it as disrespectful to him to let myself go . all the research backs up my sensible approach , even though the mummy mafia wo n't agree . countless studies have proved that a sensible diet and being active throughout pregnancy are good for the woman and her unborn child . the royal college of midwives ' policy adviser , janet fyle , is unequivocal regarding nutrition and the dangerous ` eating for two ' myth . ` in the womb , babies take what they need in terms of nutrition , leaving the mother with the remainder . therefore eating more than the baby requires results in excessive weight gain and that will be the mother 's problem in the end . ' weighing in : germaine greer has said the duchess , pictured left shortly before it was announced she 's pregnant again , is too thin . in fact , no extra calories are needed until the final three months of a pregnancy , and even then only a further 200 a day are recommended , the equivalent of one extra slice of toast or a small bowl of cereal . my argument with the ` thin haters ' was well and truly won when my beautiful son albie was born weighing a very healthy 7lb 6oz . and just 16 days later , i was back in my size 10 pre-pregnancy jeans and gleefully stuffing those maternity skinnies into a cupboard . unfortunately , the jealousy did n't end there - as it did n't with kate , whose body recovered very quickly after the birth of prince george too . one friend told me , with a distinct sniff , that i would doubtless gain weight over the coming months as i sat around feeding and cuddling my baby . i did n't . would i find it more comforting to see kate porking out and straining at the seams of her maternity wear during her second pregnancy ? absolutely not . i shall be watching , and admiring , her all the way .", "summary": " sadie continued to exercise when pregnant and ate healthily .   as a result , she did not put on excess weight .   but friends and strangers were concerned she was n't eating enough .   they accused her of not nourishing her baby .   but ` eating for two ' is a myth .   her son was born a healthy 7lb 6oz .   she is proud she did n't ` let herself go ' when pregnant .   thinks other women view having a baby as an excuse to get fat .   obesity can cause health problems for both mother and baby .
