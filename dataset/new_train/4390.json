{"text": "los angeles reza taghavi , an iranian-american detained for more than two years in iran , returned to the united states thursday evening . the retired businessman from orange county , california , was released saturday . he had been held in iran 's notorious evin prison since may 2008 on suspicion of supporting an anti-regime group . taghavi 's lawyer , pierre-richard prosper , had been negotiating taghavi 's release since september 2009 . saturday 's release was the product of three trips to iran , meetings with iranian officials in new york and europe , and close to 300 e-mails with iranian officials , he said . taghavi , 71 , traveled frequently to iran to visit family and friends without incident , according to prosper . in april 2008 , taghavi went to tehran with his wife . before he left , he was asked by an acquaintance in los angeles named imran afar to take $ 200 for a friend in tehran  who was down on his luck ,  prosper said . los angeles has a large persian community . taghavi did not know the individual to whom he was asked to deliver the money , prosper said . he handed it over and two weeks later was detained by iranian authorities , after the recipient of the money was arrested on charges of association with an anti-regime group called tondar . prosper said afar provided him with information he shared with the iranian government that proved that taghavi was not part of tondar , which seeks to restore the monarchy in iran . the group claimed responsibility for the april 12 , 2008 , bombing of the hosseynieh seyed al-shohada mosque in the city of shiraz .  this is the product of fourteen months of nonstop negotiations with the iranian government and authorities ,  prosper said saturday .  they finally got to the point where they realized he was used by this organization and he does not pose a threat to them .  prosper said taghavi 's case has thus far been  suspended ,  but that he hopes after working out  some final details  with iranian authorities , the case will be dismissed outright . although taghavi continues to maintain his innocence , prosper said a condition of his release was that he travel to shiraz before leaving the country to visit the sight of the mosque bombing and to meet with a survivors ' group . taghavi also agreed to share the story of the circumstances of how he was taken advantage of by tondar .  he is more than happy to that , as he feels aggrieved  by the group , prosper said . taghavi 's is a rag-to-riches story , his 36-year-old daughter , leila taghavi , told cnn in march . he brought his family to the united states in 1979 , before the iranian revolution , and stayed on in california to keep his family safe . leila taghavi said her father taught himself english , started a video game company in his garage and grew it into a successful corporation , which he handed over to his son when he retired 10 years ago .  his life was the american dream ,  leila said .  he learned everything the hard way , sacrificed for his children and taught us to be grateful for the good things . he is wonderful , honest and generous , the kind of father every daughter would want .  the family was silent for more than a year about his arrest , fearful that speaking out would politicize the case in tehran and washington .  it was blind faith , really ,  leila said , explaining the silence .  not knowing it would take this long , and fear of the system . there was never a doubt of his innocence .  in september 2009 , with no movement on the case and losing hope he would be released , the family hired prosper to contact the state department and initiate a dialogue with the iranian government . the united states and iran do not have formal relations , and switzerland serves as the  protecting power  for the u.s. in tehran . prosper , who served as the ambassador-at-large for war crimes under the bush administration and as a prosecutor for the rwanda tribunal at the hague , said he kept the state department informed about the case , but did not ask for u.s. intervention out of fear taghavi would become a political pawn by iran in its standoff with the united states over tehran 's nuclear program .  it was a conscious decision not to engage them in the effort ,  he said . he added that political upheaval in iran after 2009 's disputed presidential election and the government 's subsequent violent crackdown on demonstrators complicated his efforts . other americans remain in prison in iran . american hikers josh fattal , shane bauer and sarah shourd were detained in iran on july 31 , 2009 . according to their families , they accidentally strayed across an unmarked border into iran while on a hiking trip in iraq 's kurdistan region . shourd was released last month , while bauer and fattal are still being held on espionage charges . kian tajbakhsh , an iranian-american scholar who spent four months in jail in 2007 , was arrested in july after the disputed presidential election and sentenced to 15 years in jail for spying . an appeals court later reduced his sentence to five years . the united states has no information about robert levinson , a former fbi agent who disappeared in iran almost three years ago . cnn 's elise labott contributed to this report .", "summary": " retired businessman reza taghavi was released saturday , his
