{"text": "with the debut of aaron sorkin 's new show the newsroom on hbo this sunday , i 've been thinking about the best film depictions of journalism in american history . any ` best-of ' list is inherently subjective , but you definitely do n't need to be a journalist to appreciate the sense of purpose these classic films provide . so without further ado and just for fun on a summer weekend , below are my nominations for the top five journalism films of all time .  network  : paddy chayefsky 's satire is still razor sharp after almost 40 years , offering a prophetic look at what would happen when news desks started answering to entertainment divisions . the film also managed to anticipate the rise of reality tv , with one surreal side plot in which a self-styled  liberation army  gets its own television show and immediately goes from talking about the proletariat to negotiating net versus gross contracts . but in the end it is a morality play , featuring william holden , faye dunaway and peter finch as howard beale , a network anchor over the edge of a nervous breakdown who shouts the immortal line  i 'm mad as hell and i 'm not gon na take it anymore !  during the meteoric rise and fall of glenn beck , i was half convinced that he 'd announce he was punking us by trying to make howard beale come alive . entertainment : what aaron sorkin learned from cnn for  newsroom   all the president 's men  : the genius of this dramatic depiction of watergate is that the movie keeps you in suspense even when everybody knows how the story is going to end . robert redford and dustin hoffman are a perfect pairing as bob woodward and carl bernstein , with jason robards playing ben bradlee , all capturing the chase of a great story as it unfolds . the film was made just a few years after nixon 's resignation , but somehow it does not sacrifice the film 's sense of perspective on a time when journalists uncovered a corrosive conspiracy at the highest level of the government and toppled a president who only 20 months before had won a 49-state landslide .  good night , and good luck  : this george clooney-directed 2005 film is a small masterpiece , filmed in black and white . david strathairn perfectly captures the integrity of edward r. murrow facing down joe mccarthy at a time when the witch hunt for the communist enemy within was ending careers and creating an atmosphere of fear . the film is funny and smart , with tight construction and an ensemble cast that includes robert downey jr. and a chubbed-up clooney as murrow 's producer fred friendly . the opening scene speech , taken from murrow 's own words , should be regular required viewing for anyone in the news industry . key line :  to be persuasive we must be believable ; to be believable we must be credible ; to be credible we must be truthful .   broadcast news  : armed with a perfect cast of albert brooks , william hurt and holly hunter ,  broadcast news  is a brilliant comedy that captures the outsized influence of the anchorman -- played by jack nicholson -- back in the days of the big three . adding depth are cutaway scenes depicting the characters as neurotic children . it is ultimately a story about ambition and unrequited love , offering a useful , if not particularly uplifting , meditation on the unsteady boundary between infatuation , love and trust .  his girl friday  : howard hawk directed this 1930s slapstick comedy , which is based on the ben hecht-penned screenplay for the front page . cary grant plays editor walter burns trying to woo his ex-wife and fellow journalist hildy johnson -lrb- rosalind russell -rrb- back to the world of the newsroom , with its roll-top desks , three-martini lunches , rotary phones and manual typewriters clacking away . in a nice bit of symmetry , the film debuted the overlapping dialogue technique that aaron sorkin later perfected . honorable mentions : falling outside this list include  the year of living dangrously ,   ace in the hole ,  will ferrell 's epic , hilarious performance as ron burgundy in  anchorman ,  and the fifth season of  the wire .  buy them , rent them , download them - but most of all , enjoy them . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of jon avlon .", "summary": " john avlon :  the newsroom  debuts this sunday , a modern depiction of journalism .   he names 5 good journalism movies that carry a sense of purpose , are entertaining .   they include  network ,   all the president 's men ,   broadcast news ,  he says .    good night and good luck  a small masterpiece , he says ;  his girl friday  a retro classic .
