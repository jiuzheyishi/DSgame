{"text": "against plans : bernard jenkin said bae should not be sold to the french and germans , to protect national security . britain 's biggest defence company should not be sold to the french and germans in order to protect national security , a senior tory mp said yesterday . bernard jenkin , the chairman of the public administration select committee , warned that government support for merging bae with franco-german aviation firm eads will undermine britain 's status as a ` major military power ' and waste taxpayers ' money . the former shadow defence secretary warned that giving the french and german governments , who own parts of eads , access to our military secrets would undermine the uk 's vital intelligence sharing with the united states . and he said it would also undermine britain 's ability to build submarines and make urgent changes to equipment in situations of national peril like the falklands war . in an article for the daily telegraph , mr jenkin said if the company must be sold off it should join forces with an american firm instead . ` the question of ownership with respect . to bae 's key uk assets is about whom the uk can trust , and to which . country 's influence the uk should choose to submit , ' he writes . concerns : mr jenkin warned that foreign ownership of bae would make it more difficult to hold the company to account for procurement delays and overruns . ` a us takeover of bae would be better : for british security , for access to technology ; and for economic resilience . ` better still , the uk should retain ownership of its defence supply chain , not only as the best guarantee that our armed forces will have what they need in a crisis , but so our defence industries can be atlanticist and european . it might not suit the shareholders , but it is in our national interest . ' and mr jenkin also took aim at cabinet secretary sir jeremy heywood , who has encouraged david cameron to back the deal on commercial grounds . sir jeremy previously worked at morgan stanley , the merchant bank which is advising bae in the deal . mr jenkin questioned whether sir jeremy might seek to return to the bank . ` who knows where sir jeremy may work when he retires ? ' he asked . ` is this a potential conflict of interest ? ' the cabinet office insists sir jeremy has behaved properly and it is his job to be involved in government discussion of the deal . positive : david cameron , pictured yesterday in new york , is backing the deal but has sought reassurances about national security and the relationship with the us . david cameron is backing the bae deal but has sought reassurances about national security and the relationship with the us . but mr jenkin argued that american spy chiefs will be concerned that bae 's relationship with the gchq listening post in cheltenham , which works closely with the national security agency in the us , could undermine signals intelligence . ' a us takeover of bae would be better : for british security , for access to technology ; and for economic resilience ' bernard jenkinpublic administration select committee chairman . ` bae supports operations at gchq through its security subsidiary , detica . how would the us feel if the eads equivalent , cassidian , gained access to detica 's intellectual property and even to sensitive intelligence itself ? ' mr jenkin writes . ` anyone who says this is  europhobia  simply betrays their own anti-us , pro-eu prejudice . mr jenkin warns that the newly merged company , which will be at least 60 per cent controlled by eads , could shut down key defence installations in the uk . ` bae 's astute nuclear-powered submarines , built in barrow , are possibly the best in the world . barrow is due to build the next generation of trident submarines , on which the future of britain 's nuclear deterrent depends . ` no assurance could guarantee that eads will sustain nuclear submarine design and construction in both the uk and france . ' fears : mr jenkin argues that selling off bae would rob britain of ` on shore capability ' - the ability to adapt defence equipment at home in times of crisis . mr jenkin said undermining submarine capability would also undercut the special relationship . ` submarines underline our closeness with the us . british subs use us facilities for battle-gaming and training . our sub crews ' readiness is certified by the us navy , and the royal navy certifies theirs . ` no assurance could guarantee that eads will sustain nuclear submarine design and construction in both the uk and france ' bernard jenkinpublic administration select committee chairman . ` neither france nor germany is trusted by the us , as they trust us . franco-german ownership of barrow would be bound to change the atmosphere of co-operation . ' mr jenkin argues that selling off bae would rob britain of ` on shore capability ' - the ability to adapt defence equipment at home in times of crisis . ` we could not have recovered the falkland islands in 1982 without on-shore capability . harland and woolf converted a roll-on/roll-off ferry into a helicopter platform and hospital ship in a matter of weeks , ' he explained . ` the sea harriers were fitted with air-to-air refuelling in a matter of days . lack of on-shore capability can leave us hostage to foreign interests . ' he also warned that foreign ownership of bae would make it more difficult to hold the company to account for procurement delays and overruns that have cost the taxpayer billions in the past . ` a foreign-owned bae will be even harder to shame for its failures , ' he said .", "summary": " comments made by former shadow defence secretary .   bernard jenkin says taxpayers ' money will be wasted .   deal could ` undermine uk intelligence sharing with us ' "}
