{"text": "google smartphones with next-generation 3d sensing technology are about to blast into orbit , where they will become the brains and eyes of ball-shaped hovering robots on the international space station . nasa plans to use the handsets to beef up its synchronized position hold , engage , reorient , experimental satellites , or spheres , which could eventually take over daily chores for astronauts or even handle risky duties outside of the vessel . the phones , part of google 's project tango augmented reality initiative , will be aboard a cargo spacecraft scheduled to launch on july 11 . scroll down for video . nasa plans to use android handsets to beef up its synchronized position hold , engage , reorient , experimental satellites , or spheres , which could eventually take over daily chores for astronauts or even handle risky duties outside of the vessel . smart spheres project manager chris provencher demonstrates one of nasa 's robots which will be powered by google smartphones with next-generation 3d sensing technology . the current prototype is a 5-inch phone containing customised hardware and software designed to track the full 3d motion of the device , while simultaneously creating a map of the environment . these sensors allow the phone to make over a quarter million 3d measurements every second , updating it 's position and orientation in real-time . it then combines that data into a single 3d model of the space around the user . the technology could be used to capture the dimensions of a person 's home simply by walking around the table . directions to a new location could continue beyond a street address into a building that had been mapped by someone else . project tango could also be used by the visually-impaired to navigated unassisted in unfamiliar indoor places . or , when shopping , the tablet could be used to find the exact shelf a project is located on . google also highlights some of the gaming aspects , such as playing hide-and-seek with a virtual character . inspired by a scene from the movie star wars where luke skywalker spars with a hovering globe , the soccer-ball sized robots can be guided around the space station 's microgravity interior , propelled by tiny blasts of co2 at about an inch per second . when nasa sent its spheres to the space station in 2006 they were capable of precise movement but little else . in 2010 , engineers at nasa 's ames research center in mountain view , california , looked for ways to make the devices smarter . ` we wanted to add communication , a camera , increase the processing capability , accelerometers and other sensors . ` as we were scratching our heads thinking about what to do , we realized the answer was in our hands , ' smart spheres project manager chris provencher told reuters in an interview last week . ` let 's just use smartphones . ' nasa 's robo-helpers floating on the iss : this week they will get an upgrade giving them 3d vision . they bought phones at best buy and altered them by adding extra batteries and a shatter-proof displays before sending the handsets to the space station , where astronauts used velcro to attach them to the side of the spheres . that gave the robots a wealth of new sensing and visual capabilities - but still not enough to move around the station as easily as the engineers wanted . looking to improve the robots , nasa recently turned to the experimental smartphones google created to encourage innovation in its push for consumer mobile devices that can make sense of space as easily as people do . the project tango handsets include a motion-tracking camera and an infrared depth sensor similar to microsoft 's kinect add-on for the xbox . the sensors will detect sharp angles inside the space station and create a 3d map that lets the spheres navigate from one module to another . ` this type of capability is exactly what we need for a robot that 's going to do tasks anywhere inside the space station , ' provencher said . ` it has to have a very robust navigation system . ` nasa 's phones have been split open so that the touchscreen and sensors face outward when mounted on the robots . they also include space-tested batteries and plastic connectors to replace the velcro . project tango was first announced for phones back in feburary , but is now being rolled out to about 4,000 prototype tablets for early adopters this month . the process for getting one of the development kit laptops is likely to be similar to how google glass was rolled out last year . google wants the technology showcased by project tango to become ubiquitous , helping retailers create detailed 3d representations of their shops and letting gamers make their homes into virtual battlegrounds . it also teamed up with lg recently to launch a project tango tablet to encourage developers to experiment with its features .", "summary": " google handsets can track motion in 3d and map their surroundings .   will become the brains and eyes of ball-shaped hovering robots on the international space station .   soccer-ball sized robots are propelled by tiny blasts of co2 .
