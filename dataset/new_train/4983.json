{"text": "police officers do heroic , often frightening work . and they do it for our sake -- to protect us . so , first of all , thank you . but the fact is that police in the united states are killing far too many people . that has to change . in the aftermath of michael brown 's killing in ferguson , there has been much discussion about race relations , the justice system , gun ownership and other factors that may have played a role in the incident . but the most urgent issue , the one that demands the most immediate attention , is the frequency with which police in this country shoot suspects , guilty or not . the difference in the number of killings in the u.s. and the rest of the world is startling . while police in other major countries typically kill a few people every year , the numbers here are enormous . -lrb- more on that in a moment . -rrb- . in the u.s. , hundreds of people are killed by law enforcement every year . a large percentage of them are mentally ill . and although all ethnic groups have become victims , minorities are getting shot in numbers much greater than their proportion in the population . how many people are shot by police every year ? nobody seems to know the exact number -lrb- something that is itself disturbing -- no official government agency tracks the full data for the entire country -rrb- . the fbi , compiling voluntarily submitted data from 750 out of 17,000 law enforcement agencies , reports about 400  justifiable homicides  by police each year . that figure , of course , is incomplete and does not include killings deemed  unjustifiable ,  or shootings that do not result in death . police officers are not necessarily guilty of misconduct when someone is killed . in most cases , they are following training and protocol when they shoot . but unless you believe that it is acceptable for police to kill hundreds every year -- people who still deserve due process even if they are guilty -- there is surely a need to review and revise those protocols . of course , there are situations in which police have no choice but to shoot to kill -- where members of the public or officers themselves are in imminent danger . but it should only happen when there is no other reasonable way to save the officer 's life or other people 's lives . in other cases , shooting to incapacitate -- or not shooting at all -- may be a better option . unfortunately there are far too many cases where our consciences have been shocked . take the case of a man widely reported to have had mental health issues , who was shot and killed not far from ferguson after allegedly stealing a doughnut and a couple of energy drinks just two weeks after michael brown 's death . he asked police  shoot me ! shoot me !  what he likely needed was medical care . many will have seen the images of a 12-year-old boy who was shot last month in cleveland after someone called police saying he was pointing a gun at people . the caller reportedly added that the gun was probably fake . it was indeed a toy , but the boy is dead . there has to be a better way . official nationwide statistics do n't exist for the number of people who have been killed who were suffering from a mental illness , but my own analysis of 2,800 entries compiled by the private fatal encounters project suggests that almost 500 of those killed were mentally ill . of those killed by law enforcement officials , 853 were white , 673 african-american , 305 hispanic , 4 middle eastern . many remain uncategorized , so the breakdowns are inexact , but the numbers are telling . regardless of ethnicity , every one of these people , guilty of a crime or not , died without a trial . some experts say police should aim not for the legs or arms but for the torso , the largest target in the body , which improves the odds of stopping an assailant . but the sheer number of deaths of unarmed suspects , or knife-wielding individuals who were not within reach of the officer , surely demands a rethink of the policy . in many cases , shooting to incapacitate would be sufficient and at least worth trying . of course , a split-second decision is difficult in the heat of the moment . that 's why thorough training is indispensable . on average , at least one person is killed by a cop every day in the u.s. . in contrast , not a single one was killed in britain last year , where police fired their guns a grand total of three times , according to the economist . in 2011 , when the fbi reported 404 justifiable law enforcement homicides in the u.s. , police killed six people in australia , two in england , six in germany . it goes without saying that no two countries are exactly the same , and the u.s. has its own specific characteristics , and many of the factors raised in the wake of the ferguson case are valid and deserving of attention . but in addition to the obvious costs in human lives and the weakening of trust in police and the legal system , the killings must surely be taking a toll on police officers . one can only imagine the emotional burden of having shot a civilian . cops have incredibly stressful jobs , particularly in the u.s. , where guns abound and thousands of people are shot to death every year . last year , 30 police officers were killed . we should therefore consider ourselves in the debt , not only of the brave men and women who are putting their lives on the line , but their families as well . so we should not see it as putting cops on trial when we review the system as a whole . but it is also in the interests of officers themselves that we engage in a systemic quest for solutions . the first step in this process should be to start keeping proper and comparable statistics , which would allow us see where the problem is most severe , how the numbers are trending , and where police departments are doing a particularly good job , so that they might share best practice . this would make it easier to review procedures and protocols . ultimately , our law enforcement officers should only kill people when there is no other alternative . yes , in the heat of the moment mistakes will sometimes be made . but the scale of what is happening now is unacceptable .", "summary": " frida ghitis : police in united states are killing far too many people .   lack of official statistics on shootings worrying , she says .   ghitis : police should rethink shoot-to-kill policy .
