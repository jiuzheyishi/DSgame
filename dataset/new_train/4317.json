{"text": "philadelphia , pennsylvania they were roaming the halls of south philadelphia high school looking for a fight . their target , according to police : asian students . by the end of the school day , as many as 30 students of asian descent had been physically attacked and many were sent to the hospital for treatment , according to school and law enforcement officials . wei chen , who was a senior at the time , remembers december 3 , 2009 , like it was yesterday .  they were sitting along the wall ,  he recalled .  i saw the one student , his whole t-shirt -lsb- was bloody -rsb- because his nose is broken .  wei was not injured in last year 's melee , but he said the violence was racial tension between black and asian immigrant students reaching its breaking point . after being attacked as a freshman and witnessing other attacks on asian students , wei founded the chinese student association to help new chinese students -- many who recently immigrated to the country -- adjust to life at south philly high . he also kept track of the incidents of violence against asian students . last year 's altercation was the final straw . wei and 50 other students organized an eight-day boycott of the school . they wanted to draw attention to what they felt was an inadequate response by the school staff to the ongoing harassment and violence leading up to the december 3 incident .  school should be safe ,  he said .  the school should be responsible for students ' safety . this is important .  bach tong , a native of vietnam , was one of the students who participated in the boycott . he said standing up for what he believed in helped him find his voice .  you know , i see not everyone speak up , so i need to stand up for myself 'cause i see myself in there , i see trouble in there ,  said tong , who was a sophomore at the time of the incident .  i can not be selfish and stay aside to watch other people fixing stuff for me . i mean , i need to stand up and -lsb- fix -rsb- stuff for myself .  during those eight days , wei , tong and the other students met in philadelphia 's chinatown neighborhood during school hours , doing their schoolwork , holding rallies , and talking about ways to deal with violence at the school . despite taking a stand , tong transferred out of south philly high a year later , fearing for his safety and concerned about his education . nevertheless , the boycott helped trigger nationwide attention to the violence against asian students at south philly high . months later , a federal investigation was launched following a formal civil rights complaint filed by the asian american legal defense fund .  it 's huge ,  said cecilia chen , staff attorney for the asian american legal defense fund .  it 's basically the federal government coming in and saying that the school district has failed to protect the constitutional rights of its students , which they have an obligation to do ,  chen said . according to the complaint ,  the district and the school acted with ` deliberate indifference ' to the harassment against asian students and ` intentional disregard for the welfare of asian students '  at the school . the justice department , which announced its investigation in august , has instructed the school system to improve the treatment of asian students . and today , the perception among students and their families is that things are slowly changing . the school 's principal resigned in may , security has been increased , and the school district has said there have been fewer reports of student assaults . the superintendent of schools did not return cnn 's calls for a comment , but the school 's new principal , otis hackney , says security at south philly high is his top priority .  there is no room for bullying at school ,  hackney said in a recent phone interview .  as principal , my no. 1 priority is to make sure my building is safe .  hackney is the fifth principal in six years at south philly high . a west philadelphia native , hackney wants his school off the state 's  persistently dangerous  list , as well as meeting the adequate yearly progress requirements , something his school has not achieved , he said . hackney used education  to change his situation ,  he said .  i care because i was built this way ,  he said .  i just truly see education as the way .  next month , south philly high students will launch a campaign for nonviolent schools with the help of the city 's youth-led philadelphia student union . the campaign seeks to improve school climate and enhance the trust between students and staff . student union member shania morris was in the eighth grade when last december 's violence erupted at south philly . moved by the boycott , she wanted to make a difference in schools .  we just want to fight to make a change in our schools so that they 're nonviolent ,  said morris , now a high school freshman .  what we believe is that nonviolence is power that helps people rather than hurts .  while things have improved , it is a bittersweet accomplishment , says advocate helen gym , a board member for asian americans united .  for all the wonderful students that we 've worked with who stood up around the issue , we 've lost dozens more ,  said gym , who helped many asian students document their experiences .  kids who just dropped out , kids who just gave up , kids who are lost . you know this is some small consolation , but ... we lost a generation of kids .  but for wei chen , who now attends community college of philadelphia , speaking out helped him find his inner strength .  we have the power to change ; we can do something ,  he said .  it 's not only adults who can do something , we can do something . i trust this .
