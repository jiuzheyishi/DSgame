{"text": "internet service providers did not raise the alarm about extreme messages posted by one of the killers of fusilier lee rigby in the six months before his death , it has been revealed . the companies - who have come under intense pressure to do more to help police and the security services - failed to inform authorities about material posted by michael adebolajo before the attack he carried out with michael adebowale . it meant mi5 missed internet messages that could have alerted them to the threat posed by the murderers . michael adebolajo -lrb- left -rrb- and michael adebowale -lrb- right -rrb- were sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of lee riga long-awaited report by parliament 's intelligence watchdog is expected to say adebolajo was posting extremist material on social media sites in the months leading up to the attack . the messages would have been sufficiently serious to justify the security services -- who had had adebolajo on their radar for eight years -- putting him under more detailed surveillance . but officers found out about them only after the sickening murder of the 25-year-old soldier outside woolwich barracks in may last year . the intelligence and security committee report is also expected to highlight a failed attempt by mi5 to recruit adebolajo as a source -- but , crucially , it will say that officials could not have prevented the attack on the day . the findings , due to be made public by the end of this month , come at a time of heightened concern about use of the internet and social media by would-be terrorists . earlier this month , the head of gchq accused firms such as twitter and facebook of turning into ` the command and control networks of choice ' for terrorists . fusilier lee rigby was killed in woolwich after crossing the road near his barracks . robert hannigan said some us-based tech firms were in denial about the misuse of their services by fanatics who could use them to facilitate mass murder . the isc report is expected to say that adebolajo had been known to mi5 for eight years . he was a regular member of a small group of fanatics closely linked to the extremist preacher anjem choudary . he was also pictured in violent scenes during a protest outside the old bailey in 2006 and spent three months in prison in 2008 for assault . the key incident came when he was stopped in kenya where he had been caught trying to join the al-shabaab terrorist group . he appeared in court in kenya but was not charged and returned home . his then-lawyer claimed he was freed on the recommendation of the british high commission and avoided a formal deportation . adebolajo told the old bailey there was ` more to the story ' . the report is expected to say the security services tried to recruit him as an informant but he rejected their approaches . officials argue that trying to recruit terror suspects and extremists is a vital part of mi5 's work and that not every attempt will succeed . they also point out that , with several thousand islamists on mi5 's radar , they are forced to prioritise on the basis of available intelligence . in a speech last year , director general andrew parker said it was impossible to stop all terrorist attacks . the evidence against adebolajo would have been enough for security services to justify more surveillance . the murder of lee rigby shocked the nation . a little boy places flowers near the site of his death in may 2013 . he added : ` knowing of an individual does not equate to knowing everything about them . ` being on our radar does not necessarily mean being under our microscope . the reality of intelligence work is that we only focus the most intense intrusive attention on a small number of cases at any one time .
