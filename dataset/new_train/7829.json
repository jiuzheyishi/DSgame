{"text": "fashion designer dame vivienne westwood has called jemima khan ` irresponsible ' and a ` blind feminist ' for denouncing wikileaks rape suspect julian assange . she criticised miss khan 's decision to condemn assange earlier this month for his refusal to face allegations of rape and sexual assault in sweden . assange , 41 , skipped bail when facing extradition to stockholm . he has been holed up in the ecuadorean embassy in london since june , facing instant arrest if he steps outside . dame vivienne westwood , pictured left , has accused jemima khan , pictured right , of ` blind feminism ' for saying wikileaks founder julian assange should go to sweden to face sexual assault allegations . he denies committing the sex attacks , and says he fears that , if extradited , he will be moved to america where he faces years in jail for publishing top secret us diplomatic communiques on the internet . miss khan , 39 , lost the # 20,000 she had provided as a surety for him to the uk courts when he jumped bail . she now believes he needs to go to sweden and fight the allegations . dame vivienne has criticised miss khan for turning on the wikileaks founder , less than 18 months after the pair were guests at assange 's 40th birthday party . writing on her blog , she said : ` i believe that misapplied feminism is holding julian in legal limbo , women living in the privileged world who blindly support feminism , not seeing the wood for the trees . ` the word  rape  has been mentioned though there are no facts to support the allegation . ` women want this cleared up .  i wish he would go to sweden to answer the claims  they say . holed up : jemima khan lost the # 20,000 she provided to the uk courts as a surety for julian assange when the wikileaks founder , pictured at the ecuadorian embassy , skipped bail when facing extradition to stockholm . ` do they really want our hero to satisfy their wish and vindicate himself by spending the rest of his life in a us supermax jail ? ` julian is in danger because through wikileaks he exposed the killings our authorities cover up in wars which cause death and rape . ` so i was sad and puzzled when my friend jemima khan joined the ranks of these irresponsible women . i phoned jemima . i hope she will change her mind . ' the designer 's suggestion that sexual assault allegations are worthless without additional evidence has angered campaigners . last night a spokesman for the women 's aid charity , which works to end domestic violence , criticised her assertion that there were no ` facts ' to support the case . she said : ` her comments are thoughtless and ill-advised . they do n't help the feminist cause and certainly do n't help victims of rape . ` we 're not talking about someone making a spurious claim , we 're talking about women who have made a complaint to the police . ` we should n't be giving credence to the suggestion that there needs to be more evidence than a woman 's claim she was raped . ` most people think jemima khan has done a noble thing saying  enough is enough  . ` i thought vivienne westwood was the archetypal feminist , i 'm not sure what 's changed in her life .
