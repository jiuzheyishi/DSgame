{"text": "star nfl linebacker junior seau -- just 43 years old when he took his own life last may -- suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy , a neurodegenerative brain disease that can follow multiple hits to the head , the national institutes of health said thursday . questions of cte came up immediately after seau 's body was found , with a handgun nearby , in the bedroom of his home in oceanside , california . cte can result in alzheimer 's - like symptoms such as dementia , memory loss , aggression and depression , but it can be diagnosed only after death . in a statement issued thursday , seau 's family said ,  while the nih 's findings have provided a measure of comfort , we remain heartbroken that junior is no longer with us , and are deeply saddened to receive confirmation that he suffered from such a debilitating condition .  junior was a loving father , teammate and committed member of his community ,  the statement continued .  that is how we will always remember him .  seau 's death adds to dark legacy of championship team . seau 's family donated his brain to the national institutes of health for research , and thursday the nih released a statement saying  abnormalities were found that are consistent with a form of -lrb- cte -rrb- .  according to the pathology report from the nih , five researchers -- two nih neuropathologists and three independent experts -- examined slides of seau 's brain and all confirmed that there were signs consistent with cte . none of the researchers was aware of the identity of the brain when initially looking at it . in a recent study , researchers found cte in 34 of 35 deceased nfl players whose brains were donated by family members . dr. ann mckee , the director of neuropathology at va boston and a co-author of that study , says the cte diagnosis in the seau case was not unexpected .  from what i 've read about the symptoms -lrb- seau -rrb- was experiencing the last couple of years -- the ones relayed by the family -- it is not surprising to me that he had this disease ,  said mckee , who was not involved in the seau case .  it does n't sound like it was early cte , that it was becoming quite widespread in the brain . and he was young at the time of death . it is another sad day to see another fairly well-established case of cte .  a brain with cte is riddled with dense clumps of a protein called tau . under a microscope , tau appears as brown tangles similar to dementia . however , the boston study showed this progressive , tau protein array in football players much too young for a dementia diagnosis , which typically occurs in people in their 70s or 80s . opinion : seau was hurting , and did n't know how to say it . what may be a surprise to some is that seau was never diagnosed with a concussion in all the years he played football . that points to the bigger mysteries of the disease that scientists such as dr. julian bailes , the co-director of the northshore neurological institute , hope to someday solve .  it is not unprecedented that he did n't have a concussion history . that 's part of the problem in figuring this out ,  bailes said .  it seemed logical at first that it would be people with multiple concussions that would be at risk of cte . as we 've learned more , it was surprising that some of those at risk for cte were players who did not have a history of concussion .  seau was one of a string of high-profile nfl players -- along with dave duerson , shane dronett and shane easterling -- who took their own lives and were later diagnosed with cte . not everyone who is exposed to repeated head trauma would develop the disease , experts say .  based on what we know thus far , i think we have to assume that the no. 1 risk factor we have is the degree or extent of exposure ,  bailes said .  and if anyone had high exposure , if there was anyone you 'd worry about , it 'd be junior seau . he played for 30 years . he played youth football , college football , for 20 years in the nfl .  the national football league responded to the announcement of seau 's diagnosis with a statement saying ,  we appreciate the seau family 's cooperation with the national institutes of health . the finding underscores the recognized need for additional research to accelerate a fuller understanding of cte .  the nfl player 's association issued a statement calling on congress to review the issues of health and safety in football , mentioning the $ 100 million it set aside of player funds for medical research during the term of the current collective bargaining agreement . the nflpa also said it has asked the league for independent sideline concussion experts , the certification and credentialing of professional football medical staff and better worker 's compensation .  the only way we can improve the safety of players , restore the confidence of our fans and secure the future of our game is to insist on the same quality of medical care , informed consent and ethical standards that we expect for ourselves and for our family members ,  the statement said .", "summary": " seau 's family is  deeply saddened to receive confirmation  of his condition .   seau took his own life in may ; his family donated his brain for research .   the national institutes of health says the brain shows signs of cte .   seau was one of several high-profile nfl players to take their own lives .
