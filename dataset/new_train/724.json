' i can only equate it with having a great bottle of wine . you would pay $ 300 to taste the best possible red , much like you would for the best steak in the world , ' said mr sherry . he added : ` buying japanese beef is about ten to 15 times the cost of buying american beef , and that 's where most of our overheads come in . but it 's not about the money , it 's just about enabling the public to try this exquisite piece for meat . ' according to the kobe patent , in order . to label a cut of meat kobe , it must have come from a pure lineage of . tajima-gyu breed cattle . however in the u.s. , japanese cattle which were . imported before the 2010 ban are crossbred with american cattle , which . has translated into a kobe-style product . must be pure-bred tajima calf born in hyōgo prefecture . farm fed only from grains and water from hyōgo prefecture . castrated bull or virgin cow , to purify the beef . processed at slaughterhouses in kobe , nishinomiya , sanda , kakogawa and himeji in hyōgo prefecture only . marbling ratio , called bms , of level 6 and above . meat quality score of 4 or 5 . gross weight of beef from one animal is 470kg or less . the cow must also have been born in the hyogo prefecture , raised on local grasses , water and soil since its birth . it must be a bull or virgin cow , and it must be processed in a hyogo slaughterhouse , which for two years have not been able to be exported to the u.s. , until now . there are only 3000 head of certified kobe beef cattle in the world , and each of them live in japan . the process is so strict that when the beef is sold , either in stores or restaurants , it must carry the 10-digit identification number so customers know what particular tajima-gyu cow it came from . but as an unregulated term , the american government has enabled vendors to misuse the kobe name , charging customers high prices under false pretenses . however with the ban now lifted , hopefully this will change . and while the american kobe-style beef is usually raised all-natural , antibiotic-free , hormone-free , and fed a vegetarian diet , it has nothing in common with actual kobe beef except that it comes from cows . restaurants currently have no legal obligation to label it as such , easily justifying a price tag to match the wool pulled over consumers eyes . mr sherry , who is excited about being one of the first american restaurants to serve the real deal , said : ` we 'll continue to serve it as long as the demand is there . ` it 's a food experience of orgasmic proportions -- really , ' he added . diners who order the pricey dish will also be able to take home an inscribed plate as a token of their experience .", "summary": " old homestead steakhouse is one of the first restaurants in america to sell real kobe beef .   the usda lifted a longstanding japanese meat import ban on august 17 , 2012 .
