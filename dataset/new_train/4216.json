{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- fandom is a tricky thing . people are willing to do some unusual and sometimes dangerous things because of their devotion for a team , player or entertainer . music fans often reach the height of fandom as they crush themselves to the front of the stage in an effort to get as close to the performers as possible . entertainment photographer gabriel quintao has been capturing the faces in the crowd for a few years now and likens their devotion to a battle scene .  the idea of the essay is to drive the audience into a war environment ,  quintao said about his  front row  project .  the shades of gray with a lot of contrast associated with the dramatic faces and the desperate acts of the crowd gave me the drama i wanted .  indeed , the images he captures depict the agony and frustration someone might feel in conflict . but amid the pain , there is also joy and excitement as music lovers get a taste of something most people at a concert do not . quintao 's photographs from the rock in rio festival in rio de janeiro are up-close , personal and intimate . the festival is one of the largest music concerts in the world and has brought together some of the most popular acts of their time : queen , prince , elton john , katy perry and , more recently , beyonce , bruce springsteen and metallica . it draws hundreds of thousands of fans from all over the world to see and hear their favorite acts . but for some people , it is the chance to show the performers how they feel about them .  i realized that people who stay at the first row in these situations do n't want just to listen to the music better or to see their idol closer ,  quintao said .  they want to prove love to the person on the stage and to prove to themselves that they 're brave .  the 30-year-old photographer , from sao paulo , brazil , said the crowds who press forward during the music festival is mostly younger and male . however , there is a woman he thinks is in her 60s who is ever-present at many of the venues and somehow makes her way to the first row . from quintao 's photos , it might appear that the action on the stage is secondary to the rush in the crowd . quintao trains his camera on what he believes is the most unpredictable places to get the most emotional images at the events .  sometimes the artist behind the microphone just does n't move , the light does n't change and a few pictures already present what the gig was ,  he said .  but the front row is always unpredictable ; it changes every time . people reaching their physical limit just to be as close as possible to their idol is much more interesting than the planned and controlled situation happening on the stage .  social media . follow @cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . the subjects of his lens have described themselves as proud to go through such pain for their musical adulation , and they proclaim  the front row is only for the real ones  on the facebook page of his projects .  people who face this situation until the end of the concert go home feeling they 've received an honor medal for being strong ,  quintao said .  who wants to see the concert comfortably from an empty space ?  while he 's never seen a serious injury from his position in the pit , the space between the stage and the crowd , quintao hopes his photos do justice to the level of emotions portrayed in the name of fandom . he thinks the people in the front row believe they answer to a higher calling .  the aim of this work is to show the power of fanaticism ,  he said .  i wanted to show how a rock concert can be similar to a religion cult , where sometimes people submit themselves to suffering just to prove their love to their idol .  gabriel quintao is a brazilian photographer based in sao paulo . you can follow his work on facebook .", "summary": " photographer gabriel quintao captures the excitement at the front row of a music concert .   he has been taking photos at the rock in rio festival for years in rio de janeiro .    the front row is always unpredictable ; it changes every time ,  he said .
