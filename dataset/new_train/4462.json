'  nonetheless , harris had his share of personal pain . he was born in flint , michigan , and grew up in little rock , arkansas . in his 2003 memoir , he wrote about enduring abuse by his stepfather and an attempted suicide in 1990 . and he had critics . some said harris was a mediocre writer who stumbled on a winning literary formula . boykin says harris was stung by some of the criticism .  he always said ` i 'm not a james baldwin , '  boykin said , referring to the openly gay black author from the 1960s .  he was writing accessible literature for the masses .  boykin said harris received most of his criticism not from outraged straight critics , but people within the black community .  he was hurt by some of the criticism from some black gay men who felt he was n't portraying them accurately and others who thought he was telling too much ,  boykin said . in a 2003 detroit free press interview , harris said he resisted becoming an advocate for gay rights .  it 's such a small part of who i am ,  he said .  it 's what i do when i 'm with my partner that puts this label on me . most of my friends are straight . i tend to have a regular life , if you will .  due said there has traditionally been a lot of pain associated with homosexuality in the black community . harris took a little of that pain away with his life and his books .  he really helped let the air in ,  due said .  he helped us all breathe a little better .
