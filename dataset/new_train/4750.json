{"text": "it 's a surfer 's paradise -- but diah rahayu is out on her own when it comes to professional women 's wave-riding in bali . unlike many indonesian girls , she 's right at home on the beach .  i think my soul is already in the water . the ocean just calls me , ` come , come , come . ' when i go to the beach , i feel like it 's my home ,  she tells cnn 's human to hero series . the 20-year-old is bali 's only native female pro surfer . the indonesian island is a mecca for wave-seekers and beach-loving tourists , but of the locals it 's mainly men who mix it up with the visitors .  a lot of my friends say , ` why do you like surfing ? surfing is dangerous . ' it 's not dangerous for me . it 's very fun ,  rahayu says .  indonesian girls are scared of getting dark skin and do n't want to go surfing . and i 'm the luckiest one , i love the beach .  born in seminyak , a coastal town in southern bali that has been absorbed by the major tourist resort of kuta , rahayu has lived by the sea all her life .  so many australians come and act like bad tourists and make everything dirty ,  she told surfing life website last month .  but no matter what i would never leave bali , because i can surf amazing waves all-year-round and you ca n't do that anywhere else .  her dad was a renowned local surfer , but he was n't so keen when she said she wanted to follow in his footsteps . so the 12-year-old went behind his back and learned from her uncle instead . two years later , she made a name for herself at a local talent contest and earned a sponsorship deal . the middle of three sisters , rahayu says surfing has given her an identity . unlike her father , who had to give up the sport to support the family , she has been able to combine competing with her university studies thanks to funding from rip curl -- one of surfing 's major brands .  i feel so lucky . no-one from bali can surf . i do n't want to be like any other girls ,  she says .  i feel great because i can do something different . everything in my life now is about surfing .  rahayu 's major breakthrough came when she won a bronze medal for indonesia at the 2008 asian beach games , which were held in bali .  i met the president , had an interview with him and we talked a lot ,  she recalls .  it was really cool . and my mom and my dad were proud of me , and my name was in every newspaper .  the silver medal winner that year was yasniar gea . from the island of nias , off the coast of sumatra , she has gone on to become the most successful female indonesian surfer . rahayu competes against gea on the asian surfing tour , but says her biggest inspiration comes from women riding on the world stage -- such as leading australians stephanie gilmore and sally fitzgibbons , and hawaii 's carissa moore . joining them is still a pipe dream ; she acknowledges she has yet to pay her dues on the asian circuit .  i want to win this tour . i want to focus on that -- it 's my dream ,  rahayu says .  i 'm not going to europe yet , but i will . and i want to go to australia , maybe next year .  but wherever she ends up , there 's no place like home -- where already she 's inspiring young girls to take up surfing .  it feels so amazing , because now young girls are surfing and then taking pictures with a hashtag , and then just following me ,  she says .  it 's really good to get more girls surfing in indonesia . i 'm just trying to keep encouraging everyone to get in the water and enjoy life .
