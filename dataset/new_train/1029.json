' i can not see him . i can not have a relationship with my father and be morally consistent ... i lived with all these adopted children , so they are my family . to say soon-yi was not my sister is an insult to all adopted children , ' ronan said of the relationship . ronan has not seen much of woody since his romantic relationship with soon-yi began in 1992 when ronan was only five years old . earlier bonds : woody allen and mia farrow walk as mia carries their son satchel , who later changed his name to ronan . together : woody and mia were a couple for 12 years before it ended in 1992 when farrow found naked pictures of her adopted daughter in woody 's home . following the discovery of naked photos of soon-yi in woody 's possession , mia split from woody and launched a messy custody battle over their three children . prodigy : ronan graduated from bard college at 15 and yale law school at 21 . during the proceedings , which were closely followed , mia claimed that woody had sexually abused ronan 's sister dylan , though the judge dismissed the claims because they were not substantiated . mia was awarded full custody , and woody was only allowed to have supervised visits with ronan , originally named satchel ronan o'sullivan farrow . woody was denied visits with dylan , who later changed her name to malone , and the couple 's other adopted child moshe , who changed his name to moses , chose not to see woody at all . in a pbs documentary titled american masters , woody is profiled in detail about his work and soon-yi is seen in clips . he never mentions ronan in the entire three-and-a-half hour series , the second portion of which airs tonight . in a 2005 interview , woody confirmed that he no longer has relationships with his three children from his relationship with mia . ` well , i feel terrible about it . i spent millions of dollars and fought in court for years to do it , but could not swing it , ' he told vanity fair . the strained relationship with his father does n't seem to have held ronan back , and he has been deemed a child prodigy . controversial : woody and soon-yi have been married since 1997 and have two adopted children together . he enrolled in bard college at the age of 11 , graduating at 15 , and moving on to the prestigious yale law school and graduating by the age of 21 -
