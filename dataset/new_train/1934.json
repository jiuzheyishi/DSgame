{"text": "top gambler : multi-millionaire mr ivey , 36 , has been dubbed ¿ the tiger woods of poker ¿ . one of the world 's top gamblers won # 7.8 million in a game of chance by ` reading ' the backs of the cards , claim the owners of britain 's oldest casino , who are refusing to pay out . phil ivey , dubbed ` the tiger woods of poker ' , is understood to have exploited tiny flaws in the card design during a game of punto banco , a type of baccarat based purely on luck . he insists he did nothing illegal , however , and is suing mayfair club crockfords in the high court in what is expected to be the biggest legal battle in casino history . the technique has echoes of kaleidoscope , a 1966 film starring warren beatty as a playboy who breaks into a card manufacturer to mark the cards and then beat the bank at every european casino . the mail on sunday , which revealed last october that mr ivey 's winnings had been withheld , understands the cards were flawed because of a mistake during the cutting process at an overseas manufacturing plant . crucially , it meant their geometric pattern was not symmetrical , though this would not have been noticeable to the untrained eye . cards should look exactly the same if turned 180 degrees . if they do not , it allows so-called advantage players to use a system known as ` playing the turn ' . multi-millionaire mr ivey , 36 , was accompanied by an unidentified chinese woman and was the only person playing against the croupier over three nights at the exclusive mayfair club last august . his remarkable winning streak was witnessed by a casino inspector and ten video cameras.initially gambling # 50,000 per hand , which can be over in less than a minute , he was later given permission by the management to increase his stake to # 150,000 . it is thought his companion , who is banned from at least two casinos around the world , was also able to spot the imperfections and helped mr ivey place his bets . like mr ivey , she lives in las vegas . along with two others , she is said to have won more than $ 1 million in similar fashion in the us in 2011 , but the money was similarly withheld and the casino 's decision was later upheld by a gaming commission . it is not clear if mr ivey and the woman heard about the rogue cards at crockfords before arranging the punto banco game or simply noticed them while playing . punto banco is the sister game of chemin de fer , the high-stakes card game favoured by james bond . the aim is to hold cards with a count of nine or closest to nine . you bet that either the hand held by the player -lrb- punto -rrb- or banker/croupier -lrb- banco -rrb- will win and place bets on the appropriate area on the table . tens and picture cards and multiples of ten count as zero . though mr ivey was not allowed to touch the cards at any point , he is thought to have instructed the dealer to tilt each card back to expose its value . break the bank : warren beatty in kaleidoscope about a marked-card scam . the key cards he was looking out for were nines and eights , and possibly sevens and sixes . when these cards appeared , his companion asked for them to be rotated 180 degrees , pretending that mr ivey was superstitious . as this appeared to give him no advantage , the dealer acquiesced . the rotated cards were returned to the shoe and were easily recognised by the player as different when they were eventually re-dealt , giving him a strong edge . at first , his losses were heading towards # 500,000 but he recovered , and at the end of the first night was # 2.3 million up . he is also thought to have persuaded the casino not to destroy the cards at the end of each session , which is normal practice . by ` holding the shoe ' his rotated cards were preserved for the following day 's play . the 184-year-old casino , the oldest private gaming club in the world , initially agreed to transfer his winnings to his bank account , but nine months on it has returned only his # 1 million stake . crockfords is owned by genting , a malaysian gaming corporation , which sent investigators to london to question employees and scrutinise hours of cctv footage . willy allison , a leading casino suveillance specialist , warned the gaming industry about flawed cards in november 2011 . he described their exploitation as the ` latest scam to hit las vegas casinos ' , adding : ` not every player who wins a lot of money at the casino is a cheat . you do n't have to be . legal battle : crockfords casino in mayfair is being sued by phil ivey after he played there for three nights last august . ` by turning an asymmetrical card 180 degrees it is possible to identify what the value of the card is before it is revealed . you simply glance at the edges on the back of the card . ` essentially , playing the turn has the same effect as marking the cards and gives players a huge house edge . ` who needs invisible ink and red-tinted sunglasses when you 've got manufacturer-made  marked cards  . ' mr allison said casino card manufacturers are under pressure to produce more and more cards , mainly due to massive demand in macau where millions are used -- and destroyed at the end of each session -- every day . ` inevitably quality control goes down because of this , ' he said last night . ` casino management should be vigilant when it comes to manufacturer defects and flaws . ' mr ivey said : ` i was given a receipt for my winnings but crockfords has withheld payment . i have no alternative but to take legal action . ' a spokesman for crockfords said : ` we shall be defending this claim vigorously .
