{"text": "a man who was shot 20 times with a pellet gun for appearing to be middle eastern refused to retaliate even though he had an actual gun on him at the time . ' i do n't know . i just could n't do it , ' cameron mohammed said when asked why he did not shoot back at daniel quinnell when quinnell attacked him in the parking lot of a walmart in lutz , florida . quinnell believed that mohammed was muslim or from the middle east but he is neither : he was born and raised in florida and his parents are from trinidad , and he is catholic . surveillance video shows quinnell , who has been arrested 10 times with a number of battery and assault charges , approached 24-year-old mohammed as he was walking into the store around 3am on wednesday with his girlfriend . scroll down for video . victim and attacker : cameron mohammed -lrb- left -rrb- was born in florida and his parents are from trinidad , but daniel quinnell -lrb- right -rrb- assumed that he was muslim and from the middle east , neither of which are true . he told police that as he and his girlfriend - whose name has not been released - walked from their car into the walmart to get some food , quinnell asked mohammed if he was muslim or if he was from the middle east . mohammed is neither , as his parents are from trinidad but he was born and raised in tampa , and he is catholic . mohammed simply replied no and kept walking , but that was not sufficient for quinnell . the 25-year-old allegedly yelled at mohammed for being a ` n ***** with a white girl ' as he shot him with a gas-propelled pellet gun . walking in : mohammed -lrb- second from left -rrb- is walking in from the parking lot with his girlfriend -lrb- left -rrb- as quinnell -lrb- right -rrb- follows them . the fourth person is unrelated and uninvolved in the incident . first shot : after asking if mohammed is muslim or from the middle east , quinnell begins to fire his pellet gun at close range and mohammed 's girlfriend takes his prior advice and looks for cover . firing : quinnell went on to fire 20 shots at mohammed before running away . when police finally captured quinnell and told him that mohammed was neither muslim nor middle eastern , he reportedly replied that he did n't care and ` they 're all the same ' . the security footage shows mohammed 's girlfriend quickly run to hide behind a column as the shooter begins to fire at close range at her boyfriend . mohammed told the tampa bay times that there was a reason for her move , as mohammed said that he previously told her that if they were ever in harm 's way , that she would stay quiet and find cover . the video also shows mohammed 's hand go for his waist where he kept his holstered gun , but he never chose to fire .
