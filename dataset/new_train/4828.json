{"text": "drinking a daily cup of coffee -- or even several cups -- is n't likely to harm your health , and it may even lower your risk of dying from chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease , a new study in the new england journal of medicine suggests . the relationship between coffee drinking and health has been a hot topic in recent years , but research has produced mixed results . some studies have linked coffee consumption to better health and a lower risk of premature death , while others suggest that coffee -- or rather caffeine -- might contribute to heart disease through negative effects on blood pressure , cholesterol , and heart rate . the new study is by far the largest of its kind to date . as part of a joint project with the aarp , researchers from the national institutes of health followed more than 400,000 healthy men and women between the ages of 50 and 71 for up to 13 years , during which 13 % of the participants died . health.com : big perks -- coffee 's health benefits . overall , coffee drinkers were less likely than their peers to die during the study , and the more coffee they drank , the lower their mortality risk tended to be . compared with people who drank no coffee at all , men and women who drank six or more cups per day were 10 % and 15 % less likely , respectively , to die during the study . this pattern held when the researchers broke out the data by specific causes of death , including heart disease , lung disease , pneumonia , stroke , diabetes , infections , and even injuries and accidents . cancer was the only major cause of death not associated with coffee consumption .  there has been some concern that coffee might increase the risk of death , and this provides some reassurance against that worry ,  says neal d. freedman , ph.d. , the lead author of the study and an investigator with the division of cancer epidemiology and genetics at the national cancer institute , in rockville , maryland . health.com : trying to cut back on coffee ? here 's how . even moderate coffee consumption was linked to better survival odds . drinking a single cup per day -- which was much more common than a six-cup-a-day habit -- was associated with a 6 % lower risk of dying among men and a 5 % lower risk among women . although these reductions in risk might seem modest , they could have potentially dramatic implications for public health if spread out over the tens of millions of coffee drinkers in the united states , says susan fisher , ph.d. , chair of community and preventive medicine at the university of rochester medical center , in rochester , new york .  even a small decrease , when you 're talking about a -lsb- behavior -rsb- that is so ubiquitous across the human population , could mean many , many lives saved ,  fisher says . health.com : is coffee healthier than you think ? the findings , however , stop short of saying that coffee drinking directly lowers the risk of chronic disease . like much of the previous research on coffee , the study was based on survey data -- in this case , a single questionnaire distributed in the mid-1990s -- that may provide an incomplete picture of the participants ' overall health and lifestyle . although the researchers took into account a wide range of extenuating factors , including diet and exercise regimens , smoking , alcohol consumption , body mass index , and marital status , it 's possible that people who drink coffee differ from the rest of the population in as-yet unidentified ways that make them less vulnerable to disease and early death . the explanation for the study findings  might not specifically be the coffee ,  fisher says .  it might be some characteristic of the coffee drinker .  health.com : surprising sources of caffeine . still , it 's plausible that coffee drinking actually improves health . coffee contains some 1,000 compounds , many of which are health-promoting antioxidants , freedman says .  there 's some data showing that some of these components may prevent insulin resistance and have a role in diabetes ,  he says . in the study , both regular and decaf were associated with a lower risk of dying , which suggests that these and other substances in coffee might be more important than caffeine . but even decaf contains trace amounts of caffeine , so the authors ca n't entirely rule out the possibility that caffeine has an effect on health , freedman says .", "summary": " daily cup may lower risk of dying from chronic diseases such as diabetes .   nih followed 400,000 men and women for 13 years , during which 13 % died .   in the study , both regular and decaf were associated with a lower risk of dying .
