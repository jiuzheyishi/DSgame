{"text": "tragic accident : maddox derkosh , two , was killed after falling 10 feet into the dog pit at the pittsburgh zoo and aquarium in november 2012 . the parents of a 2-year-old boy who was fatally mauled after falling into a wild african dogs exhibit have settled their lawsuit against the pittsburgh zoo . attorneys for the boy 's parents , jason and elizabeth derkosh , issued a joint statement monday with the pittsburgh zoo & ppg aquarium . ` details of the settlement will remain confidential . the derkosh family and the zoo request that the privacy of all parties involved be respected , ' the statement said . the couple 's son , maddox , lunged from . his mother 's grasp and fell some 10 feet from the top of a wooden . railing into an enclosed exhibit below in 2012 . he . had bounced off a net meant to catch falling debris and trash , then . into the exhibit , where several dogs fatally attacked him . the bespectacled boy , who had vision problems , became the only visitor in the zoo 's 116-year history to die . the derkoshes sued in may 2013 , and the . zoo countered in september by arguing his mother was to blame for his . death , because she lifted him atop the 4-foot-tall wooden railing that . surrounded the raised observation platform so he could get a better look . into the exhibit . blame : the zoo claims mom elizabeth derkosh , center , was at fault for her son 's death and that she should n't be allowed to sue them . desperate rescue attempts by zookeepers and armed police officers could not deter the 11 aggressive beasts as they savagely attacked the two-year-old -lrb- file image -rrb- . ` the injuries and damages sustained by maddox derkosh , including maddox derkosh 's death , were caused solely by the carelessness , negligence , and/or recklessness of elizabeth derkosh , ' the zoo 's attorney wrote in the court filing . she ` knew or should have known he could fall into the exhibit ' and failed ` to maintain a proper grasp of maddox derkosh after lifting him over the railing . ' the parents ' attorney , robert mongeluzzi , said then that the zoo ` failed miserably in their solemn responsibility to prevent the attack ' and ` shamelessly attacked maddox 's grieving mother . ' at rest : at maddox 's funeral his parents asked friends , relatives and other mourners to donate toy construction trucks in the boy 's name , to be given to a children 's charity . no hope : the wild dogs attacked the child so quickly at the zoo exhibit that by the time a veterinarian and other zoo staffers had arrived it would have been futile to try to rescue the boy . the african wild dog is an endangered species which typically roams the open plains and sparse woodlands of sub-saharan africa . the dog 's latin name lycaon pictus means ` painted wolf ' because of the animal 's patchy colored coat of red , black , brown , white and yellow fur , each with their own unique pattern . these dogs are very social , and packs have been known to share food and to assist weak or ill members . in fact after a successful hunt , the dogs regurgitate meat for those that remained at the den . they hunt in packs of six to 20 and despite their small size they prey on large animals like antelopes and wildebeests . they kill the larger prey by disemboweling , a technique that is rapid but has caused this species to have a negative , ferocious reputation . they are often hunted and killed by farmers who fear for their domestic animals and are susceptible to diseases spread by domestic animals . its large teeth allow it to consume a lot of bone in the same way a hyena does and it has a bite force quotient - bfq , the strength of bite relative to the animal 's mass - measured at 142 , the highest of any carnivore , except for the tasmanian devil . they are extremely aggressive and nearly 80 per cent of their hunts end in a kill - as opposed to a lion with a success rate of just 30 percent . there were once approximately 500,000 african wild dogs in 39 countries , and packs of 100 or more were not uncommon . now there are only about 3,000-5 ,500 in fewer than 25 countries . in october , mongeluzzi filed a . counterclaim on behalf of elizabeth derkosh , which included excerpts . from the minutes of several of the zoo 's safety committee meetings since . august 2006 . the first . excerpt says , ` wild dog exhibit has one side of the exhibit that is open . and a visitor was seen dangling a child over the exhibit through the . opening . ' according to the court filing , similar observations were brought to the safety committee 's attention on four more occasions by july 2007 -- including one that said , ` guest are dangling children over the railing at the wild dogs exhibit ' -- but mongeluzzi contends the exhibit still was not changed until after maddox was killed . allegheny county district attorney stephen a. zappala jr. investigated the boy 's death and deemed it a ` tragic accident , ' deciding not to prosecute his mother or zoo officials . but the standard of proof for criminal charges is greater than that needed to prove negligence or recklessness in a civil lawsuit , in which a jury could have decided that both sides share some responsibility . zoo spokeswoman tracy gray has said the zoo has met safety standards of the association of zoos & aquariums and that the u.s. department of agriculture found no problems with the exhibit in 35 inspections since 2006 . the dogs have been relocated to other zoos , and the pittsburgh exhibit now houses cheetahs . mongeluzzi and zoo officials said they had no comment beyond the brief joint statement .", "summary": " maddox derkosh died in november 2012 after falling over a four-foot railing into the exhibit after his mom had lifted him up to get a better look .   witnesses described the boy lunging forward , as if he thought there was some sort of clear barrier to stop him .   pittsburgh zoo blamed elizabeth derkosh for her son 's death and attempted to prevent her from suing .   she and husband jason were seeking unspecified damages from the zoo .   the couple have now settled out of court in a confidential settlement .
