{"text": "maddy schaffrick has a lot on her mind for a 15-year-old . along with schoolwork and friends , she 's also got a good shot at making the u.s. olympic snowboarding team . ranked among the world 's top 10 female snowboarders , schaffrick 's unique talents include riding up the steep walls of snow-covered  halfpipes  and vaulting herself off the edge and high into the air . being airborne with a board under your feet , she says ,  feels like nothing can touch you .  but a deadly h1n1 flu pandemic has added a new kind of hurdle for schaffrick and other olympic hopefuls , as athletes and authorities hope for the best while preparing for the worst .  if i do get the flu , it could really affect my asthma and then affect my performance and i would n't want that to happen .  the prospect of potential virus carriers converging on vancouver , british columbia , next month from all corners of the world has prompted canadian and u.s. authorities to exercise abundant caution . the u.s. olympic committee is strongly urging all its athletes traveling to vancouver to get the flu vaccination . but some athletes are ignoring the committee 's recommendation , and officials ca n't make the vaccines mandatory . although 40 percent of vancouver-area residents have been vaccinated , these games still offer the virus a nice , big playpen , say health officials . they point out that the west coast city of more than 2 million is the largest host of any winter olympics . like troops advancing across a battlefield , h1n1 has produced two global waves so far . the pandemic 's first wave in april 2009 got the attention of olympic hopefuls , who often tend to be young .  more young people were being hospitalized and ended up staying in hospitals longer ,  said dr. reka gustafson , director of communicable disease control for vancouver coastal health , the regional health care provider . h1n1 has claimed 10 lives and led to the hospitalization of more than 250 people in the vancouver area since the pandemic began , she said .  i do n't expect influenza to be a major issue during the olympic games ,  said gustafson .  however , you ca n't count on that .  as a result , officials are preparing for the possibility of a third wave .  we figure that we 'll be able to blunt it quite a bit ,  said vancouver coastal health spokeswoman anna marie d'angelo . experts say as few as a dozen flu carriers traveling to attend all 16 days of the games could spread h1n1 to hundreds of people . in an extreme scenario , illness could force olympics coaches to dig deeply into their player reserves for replacements , depending on each sport 's rules , which are set by international governing boards . would flu fears force officials to cancel olympic events ?  in all of pandemic planning it has been recognized for some time that cancellation of mass gatherings is not an effective way to control influenza ,  gustafson said .  i can categorically say that we are not planning that .  canadian health officials will be using a stockpile of vaccine to make the shots easily available during the games -- although experts point out that it takes seven to 10 days to develop immunity after the vaccine .  arriving here and getting a shot might not be the best way to protect yourself ,  said d'angelo , who recommends getting the vaccine well before traveling to the games . also included in vancouver 's arsenal against h1n1 : millions of doses of tamiflu anti-viral medication and media campaigns promoting hand washing . 30 ways to outsmart the flu . hospitals and clinics have been designated for an expected 5,500 athletes and staff , about 10,000 media workers and at least 250,000 spectators . lawmaker joyce murray has accused canada 's federal government of  dropping the ball  by not providing enough resources to deliver h1n1 vaccinations -- a charge the government disputes .  however , the local health authorities have a done a great job of putting an effective plan in place ,  said murray , who represents vancouver in the canadian parliament . providing security for the games will be about 20,500 military and police officers , according to the royal canadian mounted police . what if their ranks are thinned by a massive flu outbreak ? a backup army of about 750 military and civilian personnel will be on standby just in case .  they 've all been inoculated and they 're ready to go at a moment 's notice ,  said mounted police spokesman staff sgt. mike cote . ` just self-isolation -- nothing draconian ' vancouver 's plan during a worst-case outbreak does not include quarantining athletes or anyone else , said gustafson . quarantining an area , which means separating everyone including those who do n't show any symptoms , is n't an effective way to control influenza , she said . instead , emergency plans call for quickly isolating only those who show flu-like symptoms .  just self-isolation , nothing draconian ,  said gustafson . rooms have been set aside in case sick athletes need to be separated from their teammates , said top u.s. olympic committee chiropractic physician dr. mike reed . athletes are not more likely to contract the flu because of close contact with other athletes during competitions or in locker rooms , said gustafson . however , athletes who train too hard may be more susceptible , said reed . test your knowledge with the h1n1 quiz . the shot does n't affect athletic performance , said reed . neither will it taint a urine test for performance-enhancing drugs , according to the u.s. anti-doping agency , which oversees olympics drug testing . ` it 's not about fear ' although reed and other olympics officials around the globe are strongly urging all athletes to get the vaccine , some are refusing it .  it 's not about fear ,  said reed .  they do n't want something changing up in their training schedule . they do n't want something different and we have to accept that .  among those refusing the shot is u.s. olympic ski team member and 2006 gold medalist julia mancuso .  i have never taken a flu shot and would not consider the h1n1 vaccine , because i believe that you can stay healthier without the risk of any side effects or long term risks that come with vaccinations ,  mancuso said in an e-mail to cnn.com . side effects after an h1n1 vaccine would be rare , according to the centers for disease control and prevention . they include soreness , redness or swelling around where the shot was given , as well as fainting , headache , muscle aches , fever and nausea . medical observers will be conducting  very intense communicable disease surveillance  at hospital emergency rooms and elsewhere looking for signs of an outbreak , said gustafson . as they plan for the worst , vancouver health officials are expressing confidence . they say they have history on their side .  let 's remember : there was a flu pandemic during the 1968 olympics and it had no effect whatsoever on the games ,  said d'angelo .  we 're ready .
