{"text": "a canadian journalist working undercover in a bangladeshi sweatshop has revealed details of the back-breaking work and appalling conditions children as young as nine have to deal with . raveena aulakh traveled to dhaka to experience firsthand conditions in garment factories that mass produce products for the west . her account in the toronto star sheds light on the long hours , poor pay and dangerous and unsanitary conditions factory workers are subjected to . heart breaking : nine-year-old factory worker meem was in charge of training undercover reporter raveena aulakh . investigation : toronto star reporter raveena aulakh worked undercover at a dhaka garment factory . most shocking of all was how a nine-year-old girl named meem , forced into work to help raise money for her family , was put in charge of training ms aulakh . ` the first time i saw meem , which was . also my first day at work at a sweatshop , she was having a good day . despite the wretched heat . she sat cross-legged on the concrete floor , a . tiny , frail figure among piles of collars , cuffs and other parts of . unstitched shirts , ' ms aulakh wrote in the toronto star . the reporter 's investigation came in the wake of the rana plaza factory collapse in april , when more than 1,100 workers died . after what became known as the worst garment factory disaster in the world , there was intense scrutiny of working conditions and child labor . but the larger factories also brought in improved security and screening programs , making it harder for undercover investigators to gain access . ms aulakh was able to find work only after a bangladeshi driver told a small factory owner , named hamid , that she was related to his wife and had moved to the city for work . child labor : taaniya , 13 , was one of the youngsters working 12-hour days at the factory . after being offered a trial , ms aulakh found herself arriving at the sweatshop on an oppressively hot day in august . ` the factory was n't big : about two dozen . sewing machines lined the walls of the windowless room , about half the . size of a basketball court . two cutting machines sat in a corner . the . sewing machines had little benches for the operators , and almost all had . piles of colorful fabric by the side . three ceiling fans , covered with . layers of dirt , hummed quietly , ' she wrote . a quick tour of the building revealed no fire extinguishers , only one exit - the front door - and little more than a hole in the ground , down a rat-infested hall , for the toilet . staff worked from 9am to 9pm with only a lunch break . the girls tasked with snipping off threads from the men 's shirts being made , had to sit cross legged in the middle of the floor . ms aulakh joined the girls on the floor and , under meem 's direction , was taught how to snip away loose threads without marking the clothes . ` it was back-breaking , it was . finger-numbing . it was particularly rage-inducing , ' she said . ` not because it was . painfully hard work but because children like meem hunched over hour . after hour , squinted at the threads , cleaned one collar after another , . one cuff after another , one arm piece after another until the piles were . depleted . ' like many young factory workers , meem was taken out of school when the family ran into hardship . with her mother pregnant and unable to work , the family needed meem to help boost the income . disaster : more than 1,100 factory workers were killed when a dhaka sweatshop collapsed in april . focus : working conditions came under the spotlight after the rana plaza building collapsed . her father found her the job at hamid 's factory because the girl 's aunt also worked there and would be able to look after her . overnight , meem went from being a carefree schoolgirl to a factory worker , toiling for 12 hours a day . ` it works for everyone , ' smitha zaheed , of the dhaka-based independent garment workers ' union federation , said . ` factory . owners get workers who are not demanding ... while the parents get to . keep what the kids earn because the kids do n't know any better . ' meem 's wages are paid to her father and she is allowed to buy herself a glittery hair clip each month and an occasional ice-cream . ` it is not as if meem 's parents do n't . care for her , they simply had no choice , ' ms aulakh wrote . despite the long hours and aches caused from sitting hunched over for hours at a time , meem was always smiling and her only complaint was that she was yelled at if she chatted too much or hummed too loudly . workers like meem are paid about $ 25 a month . they are allowed half a day off every friday and do not get holidays or paid sick leave . in a country with widespread poverty however , such jobs are valued and meem had ambitions to move up the factory chain to become a better-paid sewing operator . ` when i become a sewing operator , i will make very good shirts , ' she said . ` no one will yell at me . ' the lifestyle is so common in bangladesh that meem and another of the girls , 13-year-old taaniya think nothing of ending their education early . even at their young ages they knew how the extra money could help and talked of how their families had been able to buy furniture and goats . ambition : becoming a sewing operator like lootfah , above , is the dream of girls like meem . taaniya also hoped she could earn enough to avoid being married off to a stranger . ` by all accounts , working women are changing their lives , . their families ' lives , ' ms aulakh said . ` there is more food in homes , and cleaner clothes . there is electricity , even if it 's one bulb , and there are toilets ... but it has come at a price . ' for children like meem , the factory has become their life . ms aulakh may have been able to return to her comfortable home and office job , but the knowledge that thousands of girls remain trapped in such back-breaking work has stayed with her .", "summary": " raveena aulakh documents life in garment factory .   co-workers were young children forced out of school through poverty .
