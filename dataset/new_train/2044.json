{"text": "no image is more central to the story of christmas than that of baby jesus in the arms of his mother , mary . it was painted and sculpted over and over again , by such artists as leonardo da vinci , michelangelo and raphael . it 's a picture of tender mercy and boundless love between a mother and her son . but these first gentle moments -lrb- even experienced in the humble environs of a manger -rrb- are perhaps the easiest of any parent-child relationship . the story that would develop for jesus and his mother , as presented in the gospels , was complicated , and not very unlike what happens in many families : a tale of enchantment , then disenchantment , of resistance and reconciliation . the first scene in the gospels after the nativity occurs when jesus is 12 , on the cusp of adolescence . the boy accompanies his family to jerusalem for passover week . after the celebrations , his family leaves -- failing to notice that jesus has been left behind . searching for three frantic days , at last they find him in herod 's great temple , among a group of elders , who are amazed by his knowledge of the scriptures . when mary questions him about his behavior , jesus replies somewhat testily :  why did you come looking for me ? did n't you know i must be about my father 's business ?  okay . he was smart , perhaps a bit sassy . as the only glimpse we get of jesus before the age of 30 , it 's a telling instance , however . flash forward 20 years or so , when jesus begins his ministry in galilee . his family , however , does n't seem happy . he is , for a start , attracting large crowds . he goes about healing people , casting out demons . in mark 3:21 , it 's clear the family wishes he would cease and desist .  he is out of his mind ,  they cry . soon after this , jesus says dismissively :  here are my mother and my brothers ! whoever does god 's will is my brother and sister and mother .  -lrb- mark 3:34 -35 -rrb- . at the marriage in cana , where jesus performs the first of his many  signs and wonders ,  mary accompanies him , complaining to her son that the hosts have run out of wine . he turns on her :  woman , what have i to do with thee ? mine hour is not yet come .  -lrb- john 2:4 -rrb- this sounds harsh . but jesus has a symbolic point , and he makes it , turning six stone pots of water into wine . it 's a sign that he will not be bound by the laws of nature . one does n't see mary again until she stands in all her sorrow at the foot of the cross with a few other women who were close to her son . she was presumably a widow by this point , as joseph is not mentioned . jesus , as her oldest son , is responsible for her well-being . and here he is , dying before her eyes in this public and humiliating way . intriguingly , he summons his most beloved disciple , probably john -lrb- though nobody knows for sure -rrb- , asking him to look after mary when he is gone .  here is your mother ,  he says . this was surely an act of love . our last view of mary in the gospels is in the upper room in jerusalem , where she meets with the 11 disciples after her son 's death . they are planning to pick a 12th disciple at this point -- to replace judas . this moment precedes the pentecost -- the arrival of the holy spirit in tongues of flame . obviously mary has , by this time , begun to play a role in the early christian movement , though the scriptures say little about this . much that we think about mary , in fact , is the stuff of legend -- things added to her story by later christian writers and artists . the gospels offer only a few glimpses of her , beginning in bethlehem , by the manger , with a helpless child bringing light into a fallen world . in the course of his three decades , jesus and mary had a tender but complex relationship , with misunderstandings -- again , the stuff of family life writ large . yet their relations ended on a note of deep accord , with mary taking on her role as  mother of god ,  becoming an important figure in the early church . and we think of her at christmas , this woman  full of grace ,  who , with christ child in arms , was  blessed among women .  the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of jay parini .", "summary": " jay parini : the image of jesus in arms of his mother , mary , is central to christmas story .   like many mother-child relationships , jesus ' with his mother grew complicated , he says .   he says records are scant , but gospels show sometimes testy , sassy exchanges .   parini : jesus , good son , would ultimately ask apostle to care for ` mother of god ' when he died .
