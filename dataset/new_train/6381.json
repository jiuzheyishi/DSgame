' the tragedy occurred on august 3 last year when jaye was cycling on the slip road heading from princess road in manchester onto the mancunian way . motorist matthew collier said : ' i stopped at a pelican crossing and a number of pedestrians went across . i saw jaye and from my recollection she was pushing her bike with her feet across it , straddling the bike . ` just before the lights changed i saw a car on the right coming around the corner . ' i commented to my wife that the car was going quite fast . shortly after we heard a loud bang and when we looked over we saw some debris on the road and i thought maybe someone had been hit . ' his wife sharon added : ' i saw jaye come across . i remembered her because she had electric blue shorts that you could see under her clothes . we saw a silver and black car come around at an exceedingly high speed . ` at the time we were not sure if it was the silver or black car that hit and we did n't know it was jaye . she had gone over at a normal walking pace . ' another witness noor abu spoke to campbell moments after the incident and said : ` he was in a shock . i told him to take it easy . ` he had his head in his hands and was sat on the floor . he was kind of mumbling although i could not make anything out from what he was saying . ' campbell , who had been driving a seat tdi , told the inquest : ` at the roundabout i looked right and there was nothing coming so i merged to the left . ' i could see the pedal cyclist under the bridge going the same direction as me . it was just a glance . the traffic lights were green so i accelerated . scene : the tragedy occurred on august 3 last year when jaye was cycling on the slip road heading from princess road in manchester onto the mancunian way -lrb- pictured -rrb- . ' i heard something hit the car and thought it had come from above . i immediately stopped in the middle of the road and looked to my left and saw someone in the road . i ran to the person , confused . ' i did not notice the red sign . it was saying 30mph on the roundabout but on the way to the motorway i thought it was 50 . i do n't think that sign was very visible . ' ms bloomfield suffered fatal head and chest injuries and died at the scene . senior investigating officer ian beaumont told the manchester inquest : ` we understand the seat leon tdi to have been travelling at around 41-49mph which is in excess of the 30mph speed limit . ` but i understand that the driver did not see jaye . damage : campbell was not charged after it emerged that instead of a standard 30mph sign , contractors had left a red ` unofficial ' speed limit sign on the road - which he had not seen . error : the inquest was told the official 30mph sign was due to be erected at this location . the mangled railings can be seen in this photo where the crash happened . ` the cps had a consultation and as a result of that they determined no further action against mr campbell would be taken in response to the matter . they deemed there was no realistic prospect of conviction in this case .  ` there should be a sign indicating the speed limit but this was incorrectly placed by contractors . there was no specific sign to indicate the speed limit was 30mph . ` the pedestrian crossing is placed in the middle of the motorway essentially . it is n't meant for cyclist but for the movement of pedestrians . ' the inquest was told the official 30mph sign was due to be erected . tributes left at the scene to the ` passionate cyclist ' . ms bloomfield had married her partner of eight years gemma godden , 37 , in a civil ceremony in august 2012 and the couple were making plans to celebrated their ` paper ' anniversary . recording a narrative verdict manchester assistant coroner fiona borrill said : ' i shall be writing a letter to manchester city council to find out when the signs will be in place and what progress has been made in respect to this improvement . i am looking to find a time scale . ' after the case in a statement , ms godden said : ' i have lost the partner i loved and wanted to spend the rest of my life with . i miss her every day as do her family and friends . ` we both loved cycling but this terrible accident once again highlights the dangers cyclists face from motorists driving at speed . ' i urge drivers to respect the speed limit . if the driver who hit jaye had been driving at 30mph or below as he should have been , he would almost certainly have seen her and been able to stop . ' i want police to clamp down on speeding drivers and i want drivers to realise that cyclists are all someone 's loved one . please look out for cyclists and give them space on the roads . ' the family solicitor carol jackson from manchester law firm pannone said , ` we are advising gemma as to the possibility of a civil action against the driver of the car .
