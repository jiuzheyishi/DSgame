{"text": "a ` nervous , happy and desperate to get on with it ' nick grimshaw made his debut as the new host of the bbc radio 1 breakfast show today . the oldham-native , 28 , took to the microphone at 6.30 am for his first day , kicking off the show with kanye west and jay-z 's duet n ***** in paris . before his first track , nick introduced himself : ` so this is happening , it 's actually happening . good morning britain , i 'm nick grimshaw . scroll down for video . new boy : nick grimshaw looks contemplative on his first day hosting the radio 1 breakfast show . ` it 's time to follow in the footsteps . of people i like , like chris moyles and sara cox . i 'm nervous , happy . and desperate to get on with it . ` it 's . time to start the difficult job of talking between records . i 've been . dreaming about this since i was a little boy . let 's do it . ' nick 's appointment in the role comes after previous breakfast show host chris moyles left following eight and half years . nick himself had previously hosted a late night show before his new role was announced in july . support : fellow radio 1 djs -lrb- l-r -rrb- scott mills , fearne cotton , dev , zane lowe and huw stephens came to visit . although nick played the radio edit . of the foul-mouthed jay-z and kanye track , he joked if he had played the . unedited version it would have been ` the world 's shortest stint on the radio 1 breakfast show - three and a half minutes ' . among . the celebrity guests on the show were his good friend harry styles , who . talked about one direction 's new video and album on the phone , and a . pre-recorded interview with justin bieber . nick ended up teasing a mumbling harry by playing a brief bit of the wrong track instead of one direction 's new song live while we 're young , joking : ` sorry , my finger slipped . ' after fellow radio 1 dj fearne cotton later noted harry did n't sound too happy by nick 's ` slip-up ' , the new breakfast show host replied : ` after he said radio 1 instead of capital radio by mistake at the brit awards , he needs us - where else is he going to go ?  oh i 'm just popping into heart  -- i do n't think so ! ' time to get up ! nick was greeted by people in chicken costumes for his first morning on the radio 1 breakfast show . ahead of his arrival at the radio 1 studios in central london , nick was greeted outside the building by two people in chicken costumes , who gave him a year 's supply of kenco coffee to help him get up in the morning . speaking to radio 1 's newsbeat after the show , he said :  it feels weird , i feel a relief now , the first day is done and it was the first show . obviously a lot of people were waiting to hear it and there was a lot of anticipation of what the show would sound like , so yes it 's good to get the first one done . ` today i guess was a lot like an introduction and repeating myself , saying my name a lot . tomorrow i can do a more regular show and tell a few more stories . ' on his own : nick is the main star of the show , in contrast to chris moyles 's ` zoo ' format . ` in between the celeb guests , nick was funny , cool , collected , and played actual - gasp - music . ' now magazine . ` grimmy 's first show was fast-paced , full of celebrity banter and , most importantly , fun . ' daily mirror . ' a promising start -- and a clear break from what went before . it was out with dad rock , cynicism and bloatedly self-indulgent banter ; in with dance beats , youthful energy and enthusiasm for new music ... the show has swapped one who prefers music to the sound of his own voice ; one much more in touch with its target audience of teens and twentysomethings . ' daily telegraph . ` the message in the opening show -- which was a likeable mix of music , self-deprecating chat , interaction on social media , interviews , silly features and funny , often quite bitchy quips -- was that the power here has shifted and lies squarely in the music ... a very promising , refreshing start that politely suggested the over-30s might like to retune . ' the guardian . the t4 presenter 's new role on the breakfast show is a bid to lower radio 1 's demographic after a report by the bbc trust found the station needed to work harder to attract younger listeners . in research published last november , it was claimed the average radio 1 listener was 32 and went up to 33 for 38-year-old moyles ' breakfast show . in a bid to attract younger listeners , the music policy seems a lot younger , with a heavier dance influence than had been broadcast on moyles ' show . nick will aim to play between eight to 10 songs an hour - double the amount played on moyles ' show . instead of moyles ' ` zoo ' format of his production team , the grimes show will mostly feature his voice with more phone-ins from the audience . nick previously admitted he had problems . getting up in the morning and told his listeners he had bought a . wake-up light that gradually uses light and bird song to wake him up . gently in the morning . showing . there was no hard feelings , chris actually sent a good luck gift to . nick , who read out the card live on air : ` good luck with the new show , . enjoy it see you soon , from chris , former owner of the breakfast show . ' nick told his listeners : ` ahh ! i texted him on holiday and said  thank you for being nice to me in the paper .  ` chris replied ,  you 'll be great , but not as great as me .  ` and . now he 's sent me some cakes , thank you christopher , very nice . no . pressure . and weird to not listen to him in the morning ! i used to be . able to tell how late i was based on which feature . ' friendly face : nick 's close friend pixie geldof and her dog paid a visit to the radio 1 studios . one of his biggest cheerleaders was close friend pixie geldof , who woke up early to listen to her pal , before heading in to visit him at the studio at the end of his shift . she . wrote on twitter : ` up early for @grimmers !!!!! so proud !!! epic music . at the beginning of the radio one breakfast show with nick grimshaw ! ' @grimmers obsessed with when they say  radio 1 breakfast show with nick grimshaw  so emo . ' among those to give him praise were veteran dj simon mayo , who presented the r1 morning show from 1987-1993 . simon tweeted : ` nick grimshaw sounding a lot less terrified and a lot more organised than i did . in 1987 . ' end of an era : chris moyles and his team -lrb- l-r -rrb- pippa taylor hackett , dominic byrne , tina daheley , aled jones , freya last and comedy dave on their last show on september 14 . video : move over chris ! nick grimshaw takes over .", "summary": " new show has less talk , more music than forerunner chris moyles .   show just features nick in the studio , as apposed to moyles ` zoo ' full of sidekicks .   critics heap praise on the ` cool ' and ` fun ' host for bringing radio 1 back to the youth .
