' influenza kills between 250,000 and 500,000 globally per year , according to the world health organisation . earlier this month experts warned a deadly bird flu virus sweeping through china had taken the first steps towards becoming a global threat to human populations . in the space of one month , the avian strain known as h7n9 spread through all 31 chinese provinces and claimed 125 victims , killing a fifth of those infected . scientists say it is mutating rapidly and already has two of five genetic changes believed to be necessary for human-to-human transmission . currently the virus has made its home in chickens , and only affected people who have had close contact with the birds , often at live markets . the sanofi team 's vaccine is built using protein ` self-assembling nanoparticles ' , which when injected create antibodies that attach themselves to parts of the virus that are common to different strains . in lab tests on ferrets , which can suffer the same strains of flu as humans , it was more potent and affected more strains than the current licensed vaccine , the team said . an employee wearing a protection suit sprays disinfectant on chickens at a poultry market in hefei , anhui , china following an outbreak of a deadly bird fly virus . it is also safer to make than standard vaccines , which are produced by growing the virus in a lab . the diy way it is made means similar methods could be used to create vaccines against other diseases . scientists gave a cautious welcome to the research , but said trials on humans were needed to see if it worked as well as hoped . professor wendy barclay , chair in influenza virology at imperial college london , said the research targeted a ` soft underbelly of the virus ' . ` in short this paper takes us a step closer to believing that a universal flu vaccine is possible , by thinking outside of the box in terms of how to synthesise and manufacture flu vaccines , ' she said . ` what 's more this route could be faster , cheaper and safer than the one we usually use . ' professor sarah gilbert , professor of vaccinology at the university of oxford , added : ` there 's no indication as to whether any clinical trials are planned , and since this is a new type of vaccine it might be some time before they could start . ` so at the moment it 's an interesting development in the lab , with some novel aspects , but definitely not a universal influenza vaccine and it needs to be tested in clinical trials before we get too excited .
