{"text": "eating out can be such a pleasure : someone else chops the veggies , cooks the entree and brings it steaming hot to your table , while you enjoy time with friends or family . but when we eat out , we tend to overdo it . while an occasional splurge is ok , if we 're not smart about our menu choices , we may be hunting for a larger wardrobe . on average , americans eat out about five times a week , according to the national restaurant association . because those meals are generally higher in calories and fat than what we make at home , they can create a recipe for weight gain . every meal away from home increases an adult 's average daily calorie count by about 135 calories , according to the u.s. department of agriculture . if we eat out five times a week , we stand to gain up to 10 pounds a year . business traveler tish davis frequently meets with clients over meals , and she 's seen her weight climb by about 20 pounds in the past few years . registered dietitian marisa moore gave davis some advice on how to eat healthy while on the road . davis knows she has some weaknesses .  i love things that are fried , like bacon , a burger , chicken tenders . i like crunchy ,  she says . 7 foods that fight fat . moore offered davis some tips -- and gave her some homework to help with her eating habits . order first . davis says she goes into the meal intending to eat healthy , but by the time she hears what others are ordering , she 's lost her resolve . moore suggests that davis order first .  there is an interesting study that shows that women tend to mirror each other when we go out to eat ,  moore says .  if you order your meal first , before everybody else starts to order , then you might actually set the tone for the table to order healthier options .  and , if possible , try to choose the restaurant where you 'll meet friends or business associates . look for places that have healthy options on the menu so you 'll have better choices . red flags . when you sit down to order , scrutinize the menu for red flags that indicate foods are high in calories : descriptions of creamy , crispy , fried , breaded or smothered .  instead , you want to opt for foods that are grilled , steamed or broiled . that generally is going to be a healthier cooking method ,  moore says . tailor the meal . do n't be afraid to ask the server to make changes to the menu . replace unhealthy sides such as french fries for steamed vegetables . if you know a sauce is going to be loaded with calories , ask that it be brought on the side . you tend to eat less that way . and always order your salad dressing on the side , moore says . though dressing can be healthy , restaurants tend to give us two to three times the amount we need , and those calories can add up . if you 're ordering pizza , ask the chef to go light on the cheese . box it up . a restaurant serving can usually feed two , so at the beginning of the meal , ask the server for a to-go box . put half of the meal away and take it home with you -- if food is in front of us , we tend to eat it , even when we 're full . gut-busting restaurant meals named ` dis-honorees ' soup and salad . another way to keep from overeating is to order a salad or broth-based soup as your first course , moore says .  there is some evidence to show that people who eat a broth-based soup or a veggie salad before their meal tend to eat fewer calories for the entire meal .  portion control . on average , americans need about 2,000 calories a day , and knowing how to judge a portion size can help us stick to that target . if you 're ordering pasta , a good rule of thumb is to eat a portion that looks to be about the size of your fist . with meat , try not to eat more than would fit in the palm of your hand . to help davis with portion control , moore suggests she order an appetizer in place of an entree . slow down . we 've heard it before , but when we eat too fast , we often eat too much .  it takes about 20 minutes for your brain to realize that your body is full ,  moore says . so slow down . enjoy the company of those you 're with , and try putting your fork down between bites . it might take a little practice , but it does make for a more leisurely meal . rethink the drink . it 's easy to forget about the calories from the drink we order , whether it 's an alcoholic beverage or a glass of tea . one serving of sweetened tea , for instance , can have 200 to 250 calories .  a glass of wine is only about 150 calories , but some of your mixed drinks can be well over 300 or 350 calories ,  moore says . she encourages davis to drink water with her meals and with her occasional glass of wine . water helps fill us up , so we tend to consume less alcohol . can mindfulness curb overeating ? one day at a time .  i 'm actually going to try some things ... when i 'm on the road ,  davis says .  i 'm going to just pay more attention to the menu and go for the broiled , not the fried , and start with a salad .  but she knows she 's going to struggle with her biggest challenge .  my lack of willpower in peer settings -- that 's my biggest downfall ,  davis says . it 's all about choices , moore says .  we have to be prepared to face those obstacles , those temptations and decide when you 're going to splurge and when you 're going to make sure that you stick to a healthy diet .
