{"text": "freedom of movement : royal horticultural society has agreed to lift its ban on garden gnomes at the chelsea flower show . it is a controversial and flagrant display of discrimination that has plagued one of britain 's most august institutions for decades . but now the 208-year-old royal horticultural society has caved in to public pressure -- and finally agreed to lift its ban on garden gnomes at the chelsea flower show . officials had previously been accused of taking a snobbish attitude to the ornaments , which many deride as ` tacky ' . but this year , on the 100th anniversary of the show , gnomes are not only to be allowed into the grounds -- but will be positively celebrated . celebrities will be invited to decorate the diminutive gentlemen ... and a parade of 150 of them will be lined up for official inspection by the queen . the u-turn marks a victory for green-fingered rebels who had taken to smuggling gnomes into their displays at the prestigious event . rhs director-general sue biggs admitted ` there were a few raised eyebrows ' when the rules were overturned last month , explaining : ` we are a learned society and a purveyor of excellence in horticulture . ' but she said that the society 's 17-member ruling council was unanimous in voting through the change , adding : ` it is important for people to realise we have got a sense of humour and we do n't take ourselves too seriously . there was not one gnomophobe on the council . ' previous years have seen placard-bearing protesters at the gates of the flower show , demanding ` equal rights for gnomes ' . the . most high-profile dissident was jekka mcvicar , a 13-time chelsea gold . medallist who was rebuked for sneaking her 8in lucky mascot , borage , . into her display in 2009 , defying the ban on ` brightly coloured . creatures ' . once unloved : gnome protestors outside the royal hospital after being denied access to the 2005 chelsea flower show . on hearing the rule had been overturned , a delighted mrs mcvicar said : ` it 's great news . i am so excited i 'm going to give borage a new jacket . it 's beige at the moment but it 's going to be bright green with pink spots . there 's no need for camouflage any more . ` it really shows how far the rhs has evolved . when borage was spotted in my garden , it caused a real stir and i was met with a lot of stony silences from colleagues . but it really is harmless fun . at last the rhs has grown up and recognised that garden gnomes are for all . ' ann atkin , who owns 2,000 gnomes at her gnome reserve in devon , added : ` it 's about time chelsea allowed them . i 've seen plastic windmills at chelsea , so why not gnomes ? they 're much nicer . some people are so snobbish about gnomes . ' rhs officials were previously branded ` stuffy old gits ' for the ban . the official explanation was that the ornaments might distract from the horticultural displays -- although the suspicion was always that they were considered too tacky . gnome celebration : on the chelsea flower show 's 100th anniversary of the show gnomes will be positively celebrated . however , gnomes were not always held in such low regard . when first introduced to britain they were expensive collectors ' items . they are believed to have been brought to britain in 1867 , when gardener sir charles isham brought 21 earthenware figurines from germany for the grounds of lamport hall in northamptonshire . sir charles was a spiritualist who believed they had protective powers . but gnomes lost their cachet when they were made from plastic . although the rhs has relaxed its ` no gnomes ' rule for this year 's flower show -- which runs from may 21 to 25 -- other items will remain on its prohibited list , including fairies and pixies , balloons and flags . stars decorating gnomes at the show include downton abbey writer lord fellowes . they will be sold in aid of the rhs campaign to install more gardens in schools .", "summary": " royal horticultural society has lifted the ban on show 's centenary year .   a parade of 150 gnomes will be lined up for inspection by the queen .   rhs 's ruling council was unanimous in voting through the change .   protestors have demanded ` equal rights for gnomes ' at previous shows .
