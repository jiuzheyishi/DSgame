{"text": "research into a new hiv vaccine has been halted after experts found it to be of no use . the u.s. government stopped trials of the experimental hiv vaccine after an independent review found it did not prevent hiv infection or reduce the amount of hiv in the blood . the research , started in 2009 , it is just the latest in a series of failed attempts to develop a vaccine for the virus . the study , called hvtn 505 , had enrolled 2,504 volunteers in 19 u.s. cities . scientists are trying to develop a vaccine for the hiv virus but progress is slow . ` this trial has provided a clear , swift answer about a specific vaccine strategy , ' mitchell warren , executive director of the nonprofit group avac : global advocacy for hiv prevention , told reuters . it 's not the answer we hoped for , but the search does n't end here . ` researchers need to unpack the data from this trial to understand more about why this strategy did n't prevent infection . ' the review board has recommended that no further vaccinations be given . the national institutes of allergy and infectious disease , which sponsored the study , said it would continue to follow study participants to further evaluate the trial data . the hvtn 505 trial tested a two-part vaccine strategy designed to first prime the immune system and then provide a vaccine ` boost ' . the vaccine itself was based on a common cold virus that was used to sneak hiv genes into the body and grab the attention of the immune system . so far , there are no vaccines approved to prevent infection with the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv , the virus that causes aids . several hiv trials are still underway or in planning stages , including a follow-up to a thai trial which in 2009 showed a vaccine combination cut hiv infections by 31.2 percent . killer : the hiv virus attacks the body 's immune system . although the finding was not strong enough to approve the vaccine , it offered the first glimpse that a vaccine could work . both of these vaccines - the one in the thai study and the hvtn 505 study - are largely designed to train immune system cells known as t-cells to recognize and kill cells already infected with hiv . researchers are studying other approaches , including vaccines that activate powerful antibodies to prevent hiv from infecting cells in the first place . matthew rose , a vaccine advocate for avac who participated in the hvtn 505 study , said he remains hopeful in the search for a vaccine . ` these results do not change the fundamental view that an aids vaccine remains critical to any long-term strategy to end the aids epidemic , ' he said .", "summary": " study called hvtn 505 was found not to prevent infection or reduce levels of virus in blood .   research is just one of many failed attempts to develop a vaccination for disease .
