{"text": "on a warm summer afternoon in buenos aires last february , an argentinian friend dropped me off in the charming historic neighborhood of san telmo on her way to work .  you should go see a murga tonight !  she said . my only association with murga was a love song by one of my favorite musicians , uruguayan singer jorge drexler , called  murga reggae  :  con mi amor yo quiero bailar/murga reggae .  my spanish was n't good enough to understand the entire song , but the lyrics i did get seemed pleasant : something about summertime , a shower of stars , the end of carnival and how he wanted to dance with his love . did i want to see a murga ? claro ! hearing the drums of the murga . so as the sun set over the río de la plata , i wandered away from the tourists sipping cappuccinos and mates as they watched tango dancers in plaza dorrego , one of the city 's historic squares . several blocks later , the tourists had vanished and the smoke of a sidewalk asado , a huge argentinian-style barbecue , filled the air as lanky men in tank tops demonstrated their grilling prowess . in the distance , i heard the drums of the murga . murga , it turned out , is far from a slow , romantic dance . it 's a lively form of street theater that became a prominent part of carnival celebrations in uruguay and argentina at the turn of the 20th century . if you happen to be in this part of the world during carnival , which generally begins in late january or early february , it 's also a great way to experience regional culture and history . murga originally came from càdiz , spain , but transformed in the río de la plata region into a unique cultural expression also rooted in other european and african traditions of music and dance . it first flourished in working-class , immigrant neighborhoods of argentina and uruguay , drawing on sounds of daily life : calls of street vendors , melodies of popular songs and , fundamentally , african drumming . african rhythm pulses through the music . during the 18th and early 19th century spanish colonial era , enslaved africans in the region developed elaborate drumming rhythms called candombe , which became a way of preserving their cultures and stories . today it continues to thrive , particularly in predominantly afro-uruguayan neighborhoods in montevideo . this is the pulse of murga . but murga also has distinct differences in each country . in argentina , murga corsos are parades in which performers from a given neighborhood , many dressed in satin frock coats and top hats , drum and dance through the streets until reaching a staging area . there the musicians sing and play nasally horns while agile dancers swirl and kick and jump to the rhythm of the bombo , tambor and cymbals in a blur of sequins and feathers . in uruguay , carnival lasts 40 days -lrb- it 's the longest in the world -rrb- . this year it started january 25 and will continue until early march . murga performances here are much more regimented and elaborate . they incorporate a greater variety of musical instruments , powerful choral song and costumes that recall commedia dell ` arte-like characters with painted faces , colorful capes and plumed hats or other outrageous headgear . filled with parody and political satire . murga competitions are televised , and groups practice exhaustively for months to develop and perfect their routines in secret -- serious prize money is at stake . the groups perform in theaters and tablados , outdoor staging areas constructed all over montevideo , and may travel to several venues in one night . murgas in both countries incorporate social and political criticism . but uruguayan murga places more explicit emphasis on parody and political satire , often achieved by playing with the lyrics of well-known songs and even advertising jingles to construct clever , humorous critiques of everything from presidents to soccer teams to social issues . in a country where people often feel overshadowed by neighboring argentina , these distinctions count .  murga is one of the only things that a lot of uruguayans feel is only theirs . so it 's viewed with a lot of pride ,  said natalie kirschstein , a professor of world music at regis university in denver who studies uruguayan murga . despite the differences , the tradition remains , in both countries , by and for the community . murguistas are not professional singers and dancers , but working people -- bakers , vendors , mechanics and factory workers . they achieve a certain celebrity status during carnival , but they derive their material from the joys and struggles of family and neighbors , placing everyday life in a larger sociopolitical context . repressive regimes banned the murga . murga 's association with working-class neighborhoods , unions and political satire made it a target of the countries ' right-wing dictatorships in the 1970s and 1980s , when thousands of people deemed threatening to the regime were forcibly disappeared . during this period , murgas tended to align with leftist ideals , in opposition to the repressive regimes , said kirschstein . officials responded by barring murga performances in public streets and censoring lyrics . political messages became more subtle as murguistas found new metaphors to circumvent the restrictions .  during dictatorship it became a place where people could in a coded way talk about what was going on ,  said kirschstein .  -lrb- murguistas -rrb- were saying what people want to say and what they could n't say . there are a lot of metaphors especially from that period around light , home , spring ... that was the role that the murga played during the dictatorship -- giving hope .  today murga is undergoing a renaissance . popular musicians are integrating the traditional rhythms of candombe and other characteristic murga elements into rock , jazz and other genres . dedicated murguista masters have introduced it to young people through neighborhood workshops , now with government support . and while many younger murguistas have abandoned some of the hard-edged political rhetoric that developed in response to dictatorship , murgas remain a venue for clever social and political commentary . buenos aires , argentina . carnival in argentina is february 2-24 . look for performances in the following neighborhoods , which offer among the most authentic murga experiences . and word to the wise : do n't dress up for murga . more than likely you 'll be caught in the crossfire of a popular carnival street fight involving water bombs , shaving cream and children who take no prisoners . trust me on that . barracas : high-end housing and restaurants are transforming this neighborhood of old factories and barracks near the city 's port area . but it retains vestiges of its working-class roots , even as it has begun to blossom as a center for art and community cultural events . la boca : this immigrant neighborhood maintains a rough-and-tumble reputation , but today it also has a well-established tourism industry . sit at a sidewalk cafe with a glass of wine against a backdrop of quaint , brightly painted houses known as coventillos before taking your place to watch the local murguistas . san telmo : one of the oldest neighborhoods of buenos aires , san telmo will meet every romantic 's expectations : cobblestone streets , wrought iron balconies , antique markets and tango . the outskirts of san telmo , away from the throngs of tourists , is a staging area for murga . montevideo , uruguay . it 's well worth spending a couple of days in montevideo -- a three-hour ferry journey from buenos aires across the río de la plata . carnival here is under way and continues into early march . teatro de verano : it 's one of the most important venues for official murga competitions , but smaller open-air tablados also host cheap murga performances throughout the carnival season . it 's best to buy tickets well in advance , especially if you 're planning to see the top acts compete in the finals . barrio sur and palermo : candombe drumming performances and llamadas , a call-and-response procession or parade , occur in these traditional afro-uruguayan neighborhoods . like murga , they are central features of carnival , but you generally do n't need a ticket . museo del carnaval is a great place to learn more about the history of murga and other carnival traditions . the museum can also recommend venues for murga , candombe and llamadas .", "summary": " both uruguay and argentina have rich traditions honoring murga .   murga is a lively form of street theater .   working people practice for months to star in televised competitions and street celebrations .   murga has its roots in spain but was transformed by the drumming of enslaved africans .
