{"text": "many female travelers are scrubbing india off their destination lists after the horrific gang rape and murder of a delhi student in december 2012 . according to the associated chambers of commerce and industry of india , 35 % less women visited india in the three months after the attack compared to the same period last year . since december , rapes have persisted and mass protests have erupted across the country , pointing at inefficiency in dealing with such crimes and an inherent patriarchal nature . but there 's one clear observation from the outcry : some of the voices belong to india 's men .  every time i look into the mirror , i want to see a man whose mother , sister , wife and daughter are proud to call their own ,  says renowned bollywood actor and director farhan akhtar on the website of his movement formed in march called mard -- men against rape and discrimination . distributing plastic moustaches -- a symbol of masculinity -- at the cricket ground of eden gardens in kolkata in april , farhan is using his influence to encourage men to become  real mards  -- also meaning  men  in the national language of hindi . he is setting out a plan of action with magic bus -- an established ngo in india -- that uses sport to engage children from poorer communities , teaching values such as the importance of education , health and gender equality .  young people in india do n't have good role models aside from bollywood and sports people ,  says matthew spacie , magic bus founder .  farhan is a great voice addressing young people .  parvati pujari , 22 , is one of around 10,000 youth leaders recruited from within communities to deliver the ngo 's programs . she says boys are aware of the rape problem and the need for change .  but somewhere in their minds , they see girls as weak ,  she adds . the programs focus on building confidence in girls , for example , to ask for the ball from boys in a game of football , and encouraging boys to believe girls can play as well as they can . deepak kashyap , a psychologist in mumbai , says the idea of boys being better than girls begins in childhood : .  we 're talking about a country where the female infanticide rate is so high . that says that women are not wanted . then boys grow up with a sense of entitlement .  but why do men , or boys , go on to rape ? kashyap says that although pinpointing the reasons are complicated :  sex , as much as it 's about sex , is about power . and the only thing that separates rape from usual sex is consent .  he adds that the definition of what it means to be a man can be unclear to children :  i am gay and when i was growing up , i was always told to be a man ,  says kashyap .  i just did n't understand what that meant ; does it mean abusing people ?  the reason why i became a psychologist is to understand myself , the culture , gender and sexuality .  kaizaad kotwal co-produces and directs american playwright eve ensler 's vagina monologues in india with his mother , mahabanoo mody kotwal . american woman allegedly gang-raped in india . at first , it was banned in several cities . the play speaks candidly of female sexuality , including issues such as rape and genital mutilation -- a conversation , kaizaad kotwal says , india was n't ready to have . but the play is in its 11th year :  the audiences , right from the start , embraced the play ,  says kotwal . he claims it were mainly theaters -- and sometimes women -- that opposed .  patriarchy knows no gender ; it 's a mindset ,  says kotwal .  it 's an attitude towards women which many women themselves perpetrate .  although female goddesses and figures are revered in hinduism , a dominating religion of the country , kotwal argues :  the goddess model is very hard for anyone to emulate .  we 're saying if women fall short of being a goddess , we 'll violate them . in hindu mythology , many virtuous women are only praised when in subservience to men .  kashyap says a change in this culture will influence reforms in the legal system . however , some men are worried about what stricter anti-rape laws might mean for them . goa citizen 's welfare trust formed an ngo in april to protect the region 's men or boys wrongfully accused of rape :  there are some women who are taking advantage of this law and misusing it ,  says founder , michael ferns . dadleancho ekvott , meaning the unity of men in the local language of konkani , will work alongside goa 's police to verify whether a complaint of sexual harassment or rape is genuine by speaking to people surrounding the case . if the accused is thought to be innocent , they will try to prevent his arrest . although ferns believes innocent men deserve protection , he admits the problem faced by women in india is in greater need of attention , and men need to take action . however , some believe that this is a battle for women only .  research shows -lsb- women 's movements -rsb- need autonomy and self determination ,  says natalie gyte , head of communications at the women 's resource center -lrb- w.r.c. -rrb- , the uk umbrella body for women 's charities .  we have to decide what we want and how we want to achieve it .  it 's not dissimilar from the civil rights movement which had to come from black people to progress it and have something of their own .  men ca n't live that reality -lsb- of women 's oppression -rsb- .  so what should men do ? gyte says :  men can listen , educate themselves and challenge sexist behavior whenever they observe it .  we -lsb- w.r.c. -rsb- are all for men creating their own organizations , but they should be about challenging patriarchal views .  opinion : empowered women make nations strong . some men are doing just that . on march 16 , men from different walks of life , from suited office workers to rugged delhi bikers , gathered in jantar mantar -- a well-known protest area in delhi -- to apologize to women . holding posters with words such as :  delhi women : i 'm sorry , i 'm changing ,  this was an alternative response to the rape crisis and the offense rate in the city , known as the crime capital of india . recent figures from the national crime records bureau show that in 2012 , more women were raped in delhi -- 585 cases -- than in any other of india 's largest cities . the so-called public apology was organized by india for integrity , a charity formed by a circle of male friends during the anti-corruption movement in 2011 . they encourage personal responsibility and follow the slogan :  i am corrupt and change starts with me .   this is n't our responsibility , what do you have to be sorry for ? it 's the girl 's fault ,  was one such comment co-founder jonathan abraham received on the group 's facebook page , which has over 4,600 likes .  this is the debate we need to have , encouraging people to introspect . that 's the first step to change ,  says abraham , echoing the philosophy of the late mohandas gandhi , leader of the indian nationalist movement . kotwal says that although the rape crisis in india can not be denied , this is a problem the world over , citing the u.s. military as one example , where recent pentagon estimates indicate a 37 % increase in sexual assaults to 26,000 cases last year . but abraham believes looking at the statistics of other countries is ignoring the fact that there 's a huge problem at home . nobody believes social overhauls happen overnight . spacie says change begins with educating today 's youth ; therefore it will take a generation before real transformation is seen . but the efforts of some of india 's gentlemen provide hope that chivalry is alive in a country where a rape crisis is at odds with its image of spirituality and gentleness . but how can the message reach the real culprits ? kotwal says :  the message has to constantly be out in the media , public , our discourse , education , corporate and political worlds .  it 's got to be this drone that you ca n't get away from . we all have to become the message .  anger , frustration over rapes in india : ` mindset has n't changed '", "summary": " female tourism to india has dropped 35 % in three months after a high-profile rape .   men in india are also trying to change mentality , holding protests and campaigns .   patriarchy is a mindset women can have as well , says advocate .
