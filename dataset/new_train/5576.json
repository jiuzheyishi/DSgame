{"text": "the company that runs britain 's train network today announced plans to invest # 37.5 billion on upgrading and expanding the country 's railways . network rail intends to provide 170,000 extra seats for commuters at peak times by 2019 . but with 225million more passengers expected to be travelling by that time , the firm said it would not make any attempt to crack down on trains running late . and there have been warnings that the plan will require a massive new injection of taxpayer funding and lead to even more inflation-busting fare hikes . expansion : new plans to upgrade britain 's train systems have been announced by network rail . the nr plans come at a time of passenger fury at the 4.2 per cent rise in the average price of season tickets which took effect this month , as public anger has grown at the lavish salaries and bonuses enjoyed by train bosses . the organisation 's chief executive warned that the industry had entered ` the era of trade-offs ' as it faced pressure to cut costs , and said fares may have to rise again to pay the bill for the latest expansion . ` increasingly we have to balance the need to build more infrastructure , run trains on time and cut costs , and in many areas choices will need to be made , ' sir david higgins said . the nr plans - which must be approved by the office of rail regulation to take effect - cover the period 2014-19 . they envisage 225million more passengers per year travelling and 355,000 more trains in service - the highest numbers ever . 20 per cent extra morning peak seats into central london will be provided , along with 32 per cent more into large regional cities in england and wales . hotspots : this map shows the main lines and stations which will benefit from the network rail programme . tight squeeze : nr hopes to introduce 170,000 extra seats on the morning commute . 700 more trains a day will link key northern cities , with a 10-minute reduction in journey time between manchester and leeds . carbon dioxide emissions per passenger will be reduced by 37 per cent , while the network of more than 800 signal boxes is intended to be streamlined into just 14 major operations centres . overall , nr hopes to reduce the cost of running britain 's railways by 18 per cent , and cut annual public subsidy to between # 2.6 billion and # 2.9 billion in 2019 - down from # 4.5 billion in 2009 and # 7billion in 2004 . projects include various electrification schemes , including the great western and midland main lines , station improvements at birmingham and reading , and reopening 31 miles of railways in scotland closed under the beeching cuts of 50 years ago . compromise : chief executive sir david higgins has warned a funding squeeze will lead to cutbacks . while the company has failed to meet its current target of 92.5 per cent punctuality for the current period , it insists that the goal will be achieved by the end of 2019 . but even with extra trains and seats this will ` not be enough ' on the busy west coast main line , according to nr , which insists the added capacity of the london to birmingham high-speed rail line is ` essential ' . sir david said : ` one million more trains run every year than 10 years ago , more passengers arrive on time than ever before , our safety record is one of the best in europe and , despite the daily challenges we face , customer satisfaction is at record levels . ` successive governments have made this possible by looking beyond the short term and recognising the critical importance of the railway to britain 's future . ' bob crow , general secretary of the rail maritime and transport union , said : ` while we support any plans to expand and invest in britain 's railways , you can not seriously expect to safely increase capacity while at the same time the government is looking to axe key frontline staff on trains , track and stations . ' ` if the government press on with the jobs cuts plans , they will simply be cramming more and more people into an overcrowded and unreliable service where safety is compromised and the profits of the private train operators are prioritised . that is simply a recipe for disaster . ' office of rail regulation -lrb- orr -rrb- chief executive richard price said : ` ministers have shown huge faith in what the railways can add to britain 's society and economy , committing to around # 20 billion-worth of public money at a time when there is little money to go around . ` key to maintaining rail 's success will be openly justifying this significant commitment of public money . taxpayers significantly fund the railways , and have every right see where this money is being spent . ' manuel cortes , leader of the tssa rail union , warned ministers against big annual fare hikes to pay for rail expansion . he said : ` we obviously back rail investment to improve the service but passengers have already suffered enough pain with a decade of annual inflation-plus fare increases . ` they should not now be expected to face another six years of even higher fares .
