{"text": "they met in elementary school , began a romance during world war ii and married not long afterward . they had a lifelong devotion to each other as husband and wife that lasted nearly 66 years -- and one day earlier this month they died , just 11 hours apart . their children call it their  final act of love .  harold knapke , 91 , and his wife , ruth , 89 , died august 11 at the versailles health care center nursing home in russia , ohio , spokeswoman teresa pohlmon said . their children said they were nine days short of their 66th wedding anniversary .  it 's consoling to us that they went together ,  said their daughter , margaret knapke .  on one hand it 's difficult to lose both parents at once when you did n't see it coming ... but it 's very consoling that they got to go together .  according to margaret , her father 's health had been deteriorating more quickly than her mother 's for about a year .  we would ask , ` why is he still here ? '  margaret said .  and the answer was that he was here for mom .   he loved her very dearly . he was extremely loyal . he wanted to be here with her ,  she added .  he would sleep all day toward the end but when he 'd wake the first thing he 'd ask is , ` where 's your mother ? how 's your mother ? '  decades of love sound like this . margaret said ruth contracted a rare infection shortly before her death and it was clear she was not going to recover . when margaret and her siblings told her father the news , she recalled , he took it calmly but they saw a  shift  in him . just a few days later , margaret and one of her sisters noticed that their father appeared to be very ill , she said .  my sister said , ` it 's almost like he 's trying to catch up to mom . '  three days later , harold died , at 7:30 a.m.  i think he realized what was happening and wanted to pave the way for her ,  the couple 's son , ted knapke , said . after their father died , the knapke children surrounded their mother -- who was not lucid -- and told her ,  dad 's up there waiting . they got the card game going and it 's time you got up there . do n't stick around for us ,  ted knapke said . ruth knapke died that night , at 6:30 p.m.  i think certainly when two people are that close for 66 years you become pretty in sync mentally . so regardless of their state i think they realized it was time ,  ted knapke said . ruth and harold knapke met when they were students at the same elementary school in ohio but were separated when harold 's family moved several towns away , according to carol romie , another daughter of the knapkes .  dad was a year ahead of mom and i remember mom would tell us , ' i had a crush on your dad when i was in the third grade , '  margaret knapke said . it was n't until harold was serving in world war ii and stationed in germany that their relationship began . ruth 's brother-in-law steve , who was also serving , overheard that harold was from the same county in ohio as ruth and suggested that harold write to her . their relationship grew from there , according to their daughter ginny reindl .  mom knew who he was right away ,  margaret knapke said of her mother 's reaction to the letter . the two continued to write each other until harold returned from the war in 1945 . the couple married two years later , on august 20 , 1947 , and had six children together : carol , pat , margaret , ginny , ted and tim . harold worked in ohio 's fort recovery school system as a principal , teacher and coach and ruth became a school secretary .  i guess to me , the most important part of the story was their dedication to each other -- loyal right to the end ,  romie said .  supportive and protective of each other , and that was the beautiful part . they worked at being married for 65 years . it did n't just happen . they went into it with the idea that this was forever , and it was . they made it that way .  the two were laid to rest together in a joint funeral .  mom and dad were ordinary people ,  reindl said .  i guess if people can learn from our story it 's that there is love that lasts , and that 's a good thing .
