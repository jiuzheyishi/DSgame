{"text": "iranian officials said sunday that the middle eastern nation will create a court focusing on  media crimes ,  according to state-run media reports , a move that has fueled fears tehran is further intensifying its crackdown on journalists . abbas zagholi , the head of iran 's government employees court , said the new judicial branch  was necessitated by the special media crimes ,  according to a report in khabar , a conservative publication run by backers of parliamentary speaker and tehran mayor ali larijani .  for certain reasons , such as great developments in mass media , the tehran prosecutor felt the need to create a more independent court to deal with media affairs ,  zagholi said . omid memarian , a native iranian and u.s.-based freelance journalist who said he talks regularly with journalists in iran , said the new apparatus could spell greater attention , and prosecution , of those who do n't mimic tehranian government positions .  the fear is that the media ... will be watched more intensely than in the past ,  said memarian .  they will have more money , more judges and more people to focus on the media and target journalists .  according to the committee to protect journalists , 34 journalists were detained at the end of last year in iran -- tying it with china for the most imprisoned journalists of any country . they include mohammad davari , editor of the news website saham news , who landed behind bars after reporting on detainees who were raped and tortured in kahrizak detention center . just last week , the advocacy group delivered a petition signed by 1,102 people to iran 's ambassador to the united nations urging iran to end what it called its  unjustifiable crackdown  on the media . memarian said that , in the present system , journalists can not publicize any information -- especially if it could be construed as critical -- unless it is from a government source or ran on a state-sponsored media outlet first . he himself was editor of a publication in iran from 2003 through 2005 , the same year that he won human rights watch 's human rights defender award .  you can not criticize government policies ... if somebody says something inappropriate , you can not report that ,  said memarian , whose work has appeared on the website huffington post , in the los angeles times and elsewhere .  the government has an official narrative -lrb- and -rrb- no one can challenge that .  currently , cases involving journalists are tried in iran 's government employees court . but zagholi told khabar that the explosion of mass media , including the internet and satellite communications , prompted the judicial system change . abbas jafari dolatabadi , tehran 's chief prosecutor , said  cultural and media crimes  will be addressed exclusively in the new court  so that they can be dealt with by specialists ,  according to the official islamic republic news agency .  the intention is not to replace the country 's cultural organizations with this court ,  dolatabadi said . the new media court will likely start on or around march , al akbar kasaian , secretary of iran 's supervising media board , told the semiofficial fars news agency . zhagoli predicted its judges will do a  great job -lrb- to -rrb- protect the rights of those working the media and will bring about judicial justice .   it is now much easier for people to connect with each other and , therefore , certain new crimes are being committed that can not be overlooked ,  he added , according to a translation of his remarks from khabar . sunday 's announcement comes days after the fall of egyptian president hosni mubarak . the head of iran 's national security council and other iranian authorities had lauded this development , comparing  the egyptian revolution with the victory of iran 's islamic revolution ,  according to iran 's state-run media . but while publicly praising the egyptian revolution , the iranian government has rounded up activists after iran 's two leading opposition figures called for a rally monday in support of the uprising in egypt . on saturday , iranian authorities had blocked key internet searches in an apparent effort to obstruct access to sites touting the rally , according to an opposition website and two tehran residents . iranian authorities on wednesday warned against any attempt by the opposition movement to hold a rally . revolutionary guard cmdr. hossein hamedani told the state-run islamic republic news agency ,  we definitely see them as enemies of the revolution and spies , and we will confront them with force .  the white house says such threats to stifle dissent and mass communication suggest that iran 's government is not willing to let its people voice their views and embrace freedom .  they are scared ,  press secretary robert gibbs said friday , hours after mubarak stepped down .  that 's why they threatened to kill anybody that tries to do this . that 's why they have shut off all measure of communication .  even with restrictions on journalists , memarian said many iranians have been able to track recent developments in egypt and elsewhere in forums beyond state-run media , including watching news reports from international media and viewing stories online . he said independent journalists still exist within iran , even after a massive crackdown following popular unrest after the 2009 elections . their accounts may become important if , as he predicts , opposition forces find renewed strength and voice their views publicly in the coming days .  we challenge the narrative of the government ,  memarian said , noting that reports get out funneled through journalists like himself and posted online more anonymously .  they do their role , even if they do n't go public in that role . ", "summary": " iranian officials say a new special court will focus on  media crimes ,  state media say .   the court will include justices specializing in media , cultural issues .   a u.s.-based iranian journalist say independent media will likely be even more targeted .   a journalist rights group says 34 journalists are jailed in iran , as much as in any nation .
