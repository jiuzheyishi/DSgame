{"text": "polls closed sunday after voters streamed into polling stations in eastern ukraine to vote in controversial referendums held by pro-russian activists eager to declare independence from kiev , an official said . voters in the city of donetsk faced this question on the ballot :  do you support the act of independence of the people 's republic of donetsk ?  the options are  yes  or  no .  a similar question is being put to voters in luhansk . many of the voters were not on the outdated registration lists but were allowed to vote after showing identification documents . there also seemed to be no system in place to prevent one person from voting at multiple polling stations . a cnn crew saw several people vote twice at one polling station , where the ballot boxes were decorated with new donetsk independence flags . there was also a report of video showing three men arrested near slovyansk with boxes of  yes  ballots in their car . but in a sunday afternoon news conference , the head of the people 's republic of donetsk central election committee , boris litvinov , disputed reports that people were voting twice in some areas . litivinov said the lines were so long that many people had a hard time voting once , let alone twice . he also denied the report about ballot fraud . litvinov said there was no reason for pro-russian activists to cheat because voter turnout was so high . the polls were told to stay open for 14 hours , rather than the usual 12 , to allow time to add people to the voter list if necessary , the election committee said , adding that access to the most recent electoral rolls has been barred by kiev . litvinov was the official to announce that polls had closed . results are expected later . two incidents heightened tensions at polling places sunday . rubber bullets were fired into the air at a station in donetsk , said election committee member sergey tretyakov . tretyakov also said police in krasnoarmeysk tried to prevent people from voting . the central government in kiev has declared the polls illegal . russia 's mixed messages . the message coming from moscow on the referendum appears mixed . russian police officers oversaw voting at a moscow polling station erected for expat ukrainians to vote in the donetsk and luhansk referendums . but last week , russian president vladimir putin also urged the pro-russian sympathizers to delay the referendum to give dialogue  the conditions it needs to have a chance .  putin 's unexpected call appears to have dented the confidence of some pro-russian activists . however , representatives of the pro-russian groups in donetsk and luhansk voted to go ahead with it . meanwhile , in slovyansk , a russian government-controlled tv channel was periodically showing a banner along the bottom of the screen that told viewers where they can vote in sunday 's referendum . that channel , russia 24 , is available over the air to residents of donetsk , who can access it in their homes . the banner listed the location and voting hours and advised voters to bring a passport . the banner was shown only on the russia 24 channel , not on other channels . blood and balaclavas . a vote for autonomy is a vote for the self-destruction of the east , ukraine 's acting president oleksandr turchynov has said . it would cut residents off from the national economy and social programs , he said .  it is a step -lsb- to -rsb- nowhere for these regions . it is euphoria that may lead to very complex consequences , and many people can already feel them .  they have felt the pain in bloodshed , at graves and in burned-out ruins still smoldering in the east , where ethnic russian militiamen have battled ukrainian security forces . at least seven people were killed and 39 others were injured friday in the southeastern city of mariupol , regional sources said . the electoral commission office in donetsk was ringed with sandbags and barbed wire on saturday . men in balaclavas lounged outside tents pitched nearby , looking relaxed . they wore the orange-and-black st. george ribbon , which has become a symbol of the pro-russian separatists . a dozen men lined up in front of the regional administration building to sign up for  military service  with the pro-russian donetsk people 's republic . they showed their id documents and registered at a small tent . deadly clashes have also stained mariupol and odessa , as well as slovyansk , where separatists hold key government buildings and remain in a standoff with ukrainian military forces . militants have erected concrete barricades on the roads into town there . ` illegitimate ' vote . if the referendum passes , it would offer a stark contrast to recent polling by the pew research center , which found 70 % of people in eastern ukraine want the country to remain united . litvinov said sunday that if voters agree to secede from ukraine , the next logical step is another referendum in the next several months on joining russia . whatever the outcome , the vote has already been condemned as illegitimate by several western powers . german chancellor angela merkel said saturday ,  we consider the referendum ... illegitimate and focus on the -lrb- presidential -rrb- election on may 25 in the entire ukraine .  the interim government in kiev , which took power after ousted pro-moscow president viktor yanukovych fled to russia in february , is due to hold presidential elections may 25 . russian meddling ? merkel and french president francois hollande have warned that russia could face consequences if the presidential vote does not go ahead as planned .  if no internationally recognized presidential election were to take place , this would inevitably further destabilize the country ,  merkel said . in that case , she said ,  we are ready to take further sanctions against russia .  merkel and hollande also said that russian troops along the ukrainian border  should undertake visible steps to reduce their readiness .  putin announced a troop pullback wednesday , but nato says it has seen no signs of a withdrawal of russian forces from the border area . russia annexed the southern region of crimea after announced results in a separatist referendum showed more than 90 % in favor of joining russia . in an independent pew survey , 54 % of crimea residents showed support for secession . the kremlin has said that it has no interest in annexing other parts of ukraine . but it is pushing for the country to adopt a constitution that would give regions where russian is widely spoken a larger voice in policy-making . critics fear that the creation of autonomous pro-russian regions in ukraine would cement alliances with the kremlin that would give it essential control over them . ukraine separatists vow to go ahead with controversial referendum .", "summary": " polls close ; results are expected later .   pro-russian separatist denies allegations of voter election fraud .   cnn crew sees some voting twice at one polling station .   kiev and west have condemned vote as illegitimate .
