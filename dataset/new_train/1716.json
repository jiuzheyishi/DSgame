{"text": "most people hop , skip and jump out of the way when a bee is in site . but this 22ft-high man-made hive allows those with a curious nature to step inside and watch how the fastidious creatures produce their honey - with little risk of getting stung . students at the state university of new york created the stainless steel tower for a project . more than 5,000 bees reside in this man-made hive , which is 22ft high . the insects produce more than five gallons of honey over the spring and summer . the impressive tower is made from stainless steel and was built on reclaimed land in buffalo for an environmental project . the project will act as an important conservation exercise for bees in the wake of their dropping numbers . called hive city , it is home to 5,000 bees , who produce an incredible five gallons of honey in the spring and summer months by flying up to five miles to collect pollen from local wild flowers . it was built on formally abandoned land in buffalo and is designed so human visitors can watch the bees go about their business in the hive . designer courtney creenan , 26 , explained the idea behind the giant home for bees . a child takes a look inside the impressive tower , which only holds one person at a time . the students say people soon lose their fear of the insects when they enter the tower . with the sheer volume of bees inside , it is no surprise a few strays seep outside . the students , from the state university of new york , reckon they have become bee enthusiasts for life since the tower went up . the bees travel up to five miles to get pollen from flowers before heading back to the hive to produce their honey . ` we won a competition to design a habitat for a large bee colony that needed to be relocated , ' he said . ` the entry to the bee cab is approximately ten feet off the ground which keeps the bees separated from their human visitors as well as protected from any animal predators . ` visitors are timid when they first enter hive city because of the stigma of being stung . scientists have been concerned for some time about the dwindling bee population . america is one of the largest consumers of honey in the world . bees are one of the most important creatures in the food chain and without them , scores of other species would n't survive . ` however , once inside the fear is usually overcome and rarely do humans come in contact with the bees . ` when people go inside , sunlight streams through the triangular perforations in the steel and makes for a beautiful , atmospheric experience . ` our team has become amateur bee keepers and we have assumed care for them since their move . ` we did work with a professional bee keeper , who moved them into their new home . ` hive city is meant to be a symbol of the economic and ecological transformation of the site .
