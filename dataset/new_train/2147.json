{"text": "london what do artificial whiskers and coffee-filled balloons have in common ? the answer is that they are both tools on experimental robots -- but they are also being put forward as possible ideas to help future planetary explorations .  shrewbot  is the latest in a line of robots developed by teams at the uk 's bristol robotics laboratory -lrb- brl -rrb- that aims to test whether artificial whiskers could help a robot find its way around . inspired by the etruscan shrew -- one of the world 's tiniest mammals -- scientists wanted to find out if a robot could explore its environment using touch instead of vision , just as rats , mice and shrews find food in the dark . team leader martin pearson , who works at the biotact project , said the research was primarily to assist biologists in their understanding of how an animal 's touch sensing works . but he added :  future robotic applications for this kind of sensing could be in search-and-rescue robots operating in smoke filled buildings or for sub-sea pipeline inspection robots in the murky depths of the sea .  the idea has also been suggested as a way to explore planetary surfaces where there is limited vision . speaking at a space conference at the uk 's rutherford appleton laboratory , robotics expert and co-founder of the brl , alan winfield , identified it as one of a number of advancements that might be useful to space scientists planning future missions .  i was speculating that whiskers could provide a planetary rover with the ability to feel its way around ,  he told cnn .  it may be that certain types of geology would be helped if you could , for instance , run the whiskers across the rock sample because you can get texture from whiskers .  you can also imagine planets with thick , heavy atmospheres where vision would be completely useless . one of the beauties of whiskers is that the whisker can get damaged but still works -- all the sensing is done at the root .  winfield also pointed to research carried out by cornell , the university of chicago , irobot corp and liquidia that produced a robotic gripper using coffee granules and a latex party balloon . it exploits the way vacuum-packed coffee is rigid until the seal is broken and then the coffee granules can flow , adapting to the shape of an object it is pressed against . the vacuum can then be restored and the balloon ` jams ' solid to form a grip . watch how the gripper works at cornell creative machines lab . in 2010  jamming gripper  researcher heinrich jaeger described in the cornell chronicle how the project had  opened the door to applications none of us had originally thought about .  one of those applications , winfield suggested , is a potential alternative for gathering samples on a planetary rover mission .  almost any planetary exploration robot is likely to need a gripper to pick up or collect rock samples for analysis or collection ,  he said on his blog .  something like the jaeger-lipson coffee balloon gripper would -- i think -- provide a much better solution . this soft gripper avoids the hard control and computation because the soft material adapts itself to the thing it is gripping .  speaking to cnn , jaeger said it would be exciting to work with space scientists .  it 's wonderful to see engineers and researchers come up with new ideas based on granular jamming .  the main advantage of the jamming gripper is that it can deal effectively with very irregularly shaped objects and needs to cover only a fraction of the sample 's surface in order to hold on to it .  perhaps even more importantly for a rover mission on mars -- there are no mechanical parts that can get clogged up by dust .  a third advantage is that the gripper is exceedingly gentle . it will put very little stress on the object to be gripped because it distributes the holding force over a large contact area that very closely conforms to the object 's shape .  winfield said this new field of  soft robotics  could be well suited to space exploration , explaining that the brl is now working on touch sensors for robots .  it 's easy to see that giving planetary robots touch sensing could be useful , but there 's another possibility ... the potential to allow earth scientists to feel what the robot 's sensor is feeling ,  he told cnn . looking further into the future , winfield believes so-called swarm robots -- large groups of simple robots that work together like social insects -- ones that can self-assemble and adapt to the environment in the way living creatures do , could also aid scientists exploring new worlds .  imagine that robots can actually remake parts of themselves -- we ca n't even do that in the lab yet -- but in theory you can imagine robots that can adapt their physical shape as well as their behaviors to meet a particular environment ... it 's almost like evolution except these are mechanical devices ,  he said . however , he also believes that this technology -- along with fully autonomous robots that can think for themselves -- is a long way off .  this field is very much a concept that we are developing in the lab -- i would n't expect these swarms of robots in space any time soon ,  he said .", "summary": "  shrewbot  aims to test whether artificial whiskers could help a robot navigate .   robotics expert alan winfield suggests they could be useful for planetary rovers .   he also points to work on soft robotics that could aid space exploration .   so-called ` swarm robots ' might be able to adapt to an alien planet 's environment , he says .
