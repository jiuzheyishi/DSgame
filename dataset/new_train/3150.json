{"text": "locked up : britain is spending # 35million jailing polish nationals so the country has time to build new prisons -lrb- library image -rrb- . britain is spending # 35million every year locking up poles who should be in jail in their own country -- because its prisons are full . there are almost 900 polish convicts in our packed prisons -- the largest foreign contingent , according to the ministry of justice . but under a deal agreed by the last labour government , none will have to serve their sentences back home until at least december 2016 to give poland time to build new jails . the deal is one of a string of similar arrangements between britain and the rest of the eu for so-called compulsory prisoner transfer agreements . these allow criminals convicted of crimes in the uk , who have at least six months to serve , to be forcibly removed to serve their sentences overseas . similar deals are in place with libya , albania and rwanda . a total of 1,064 inmates are eligible to be transferred . but by the end of last year , only 16 had been sent to prisons in belgium , latvia , malta and the netherlands . at the end of 2012 , none had been sent home at all . ministers insist the situation will improve as the agreements bed in . with prison places costing around # 40,000 a year , the government is desperate to save money by making greater use of the transfer deals . it would also create more room in britain 's own packed prisons , which have only 2,000 spare places . last night peter cuthbertson , of the centre for crime prevention , said : ` with so much crime committed by british people who we ca n't simply deport , sending foreign criminals home should be an easy decision . instead , one in eight prisoners are foreign nationals . ` these figures show an improvement upon labour 's poor record , but far more needs to be done . making foreign criminals face justice in their own countries would free up about 11,000 prison places for serious repeat offenders who are getting off with community service or a suspended sentence . ' the number of polish inmates has rocketed since the country joined the eu in 2004 . in the last 12 months , poland has overtaken ireland as the nation with the most citizens in british jails . of the 876 poles behind bars , 320 are eligible for the prisoner transfer deal . they will begin being sent to serve their time in poland in december 2016 when it should have more cells . expenditure : a prison place costs # 40,000 - an expense the government want to cut -lrb- library image -rrb- . britain has no prisoner transfer arrangement with ireland , which has a permanent opt-out . prisons minister jeremy wright said : ` the 1,064 figure of foreign national prisoners potentially eligible for compulsory transfer to their home countries includes around 700 who ca n't yet be returned because we 're waiting for implementation of the agreement from their home countries or because we 're waiting for them to improve prison capacity . ` of the remaining 300 , we are processing over 100 and the remaining 200 will be dealt with this year . prior to 2013 , not one prisoner had left the country under a compulsory transfer agreement . we expect more than a hundred to go in 2014 . ' david cameron has personally pledged to increase the number of foreign criminals sent home . last year , the prime minister said : ` when people are sent to prison we should do everything to make sure that if they 're foreign , they are sent back to their country to serve their sentence . ` it is not good enough , the situation we have in britain today . ' no one from the polish embassy was available for comment last night . magdelena luczak , left , was given a life sentence for the death of daniel pelka , right , this year . poles mariusz krezolek and magdelena luczak are serving life behind bars for the savage murder of her four-year-old son daniel pelka in coventry . the couple , who moved to britain from poland , tortured and killed daniel in a campaign of cruelty that culminated in his death from a head injury in march 2012 . he died completely emaciated , locked in a cold room on a soiled mattress . in horrific court testimony , it was revealed that luczak , 28 , and her 34-year-old partner krezolek starved daniel , force-fed him salt and held the child under water . sadistic krezolek had already been jailed in this country three times and arrested at least six times for offences including assault and burglary . but despite his serial offending , he was never put on a plane back to poland -- leaving him free to kill daniel . in august last year , the couple were both sentenced to a minimum of 30 years , and are eligible for the compulsory prisoner transfer agreement . luczak 's term is one of the longest jail terms given to a woman in britain , the same as child-killer beverley allitt and exceeded by only rose west and myra hindley . the cost of keeping krezolek and luczak locked up in a british jail is around # 80,000 a year . if both serve their entire sentence here , the bill to the taxpayer will be a minimum of # 2.4 million . yesterday , it emerged they had been refused leave to appeal . lawyers say they plan to continue their legal fight .", "summary": " polish are the largest foreign contingent in our prisons , the moj said .   none will have to serve their sentences back home until december 2016 .   deal agreed by labour to give poland time to build new jails .   prison places cost around # 40,000 every year .
