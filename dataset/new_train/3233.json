{"text": "alan miliburn , the government 's social mobility adviser , said the middle classes , as well as those on low incomes , struggle to make it to the top . middle class children are being held back by ` entrenched elitism ' which means the rich and privately-educated are a third more likely to get top jobs , a government adviser warned today . alan milburn , the social mobility tsar , said it was not just children from poorer families who struggled to ` move up and get on ' . in the latest high-profile attack on the privileged elite who run britain , he said it was time to ` break open the closed shop ' at the top of society . david cameron has been stung by criticism of the wealthy background of many in the cabinet . former tory prime minister sir john major took a swipe last month , warning the conservatives can not win if they fail to understand the ` silent have-nots ' who suffer in ` net curtain poverty ' . new research from the social mobility and child poverty commission found that privately-educated graduates are one-third more likely to get top jobs than state school-educated graduates . in a speech today mr miliburn said : ` a society where opportunities are frozen rather than fluid hurts more than those at the very bottom end . ` it hurts the people president clinton once famously called the  forgotten middle class  . ` they , and not just low income families , are the victims of entrenched elitism in our country . ' the former labour cabinet minister told social mobility experts that the problem did not affect just people from working class backgrounds , but was also a block on the aspirations of middle class families . part of this gap was explained by the fact that top employers continue to recruit from a narrow range of highly selective universities , where those who went to independent schools tend to be over-represented , said the commission . research shows the increased probability of working in a top job if privately educate , compared with attending a state school . but it also found that even where two similarly qualified graduates have attended the same university and got the same degree , a privately-schooled graduate is still 8 per cent more likely to get a top job than a state-schooled one . mr milburn added : ` social mobility relies on people across the income spectrum being able to move up and get on . ` we have a twin problem in our country : middle class aspirations and working class opportunities to advance are both being thwarted . ' commission analysis suggested that some of the career advantage for privately-educated graduates comes from having social connections that state-educated graduates are less likely to enjoy . but it found that most of the gap is unexplained . 10.5 % of all graduates work in a top professional job , while privately educated graduates are 6 percentage points more likely than state school graduates to work in these jobs . mr milburn said the expansion of the middle classes would help more people to break through into the top of society . he said : ` a twin solution is needed : we need to break open the closed shop at the top of british society and expand the middle . ` it should be our country 's ambition to create a bigger middle class with more avenues for advancement . a growing middle-class is the foundation for a more mobile country . ' mr milburn outlined a five-point policy agenda , involving expanding early years education ; paying the best teachers more for working in disadvantaged areas ; opening up universities to a wider pool of talent and making vocational education a national priority ; increasing the minimum wage ; and expanding entry to the professions by getting firms to recruit from a wider range of universities and ending unpaid internships .", "summary": " graduates who went to private schools still dominate modern britain .   social mobility and child poverty commission reveals scale of challenge .   alan milburn warns middle class children suffer as well as the poor .   ex-labour minister says they are victims of ` entrenched elitism ' "}
