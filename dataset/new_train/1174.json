{"text": "fossils of three squirrel-like species from the time of the dinosaurs suggest mammals have been around on earth for more than 200 million years . the discovery in liaoning province , china , pushes back the date that mammals roamed the planet by around 40 million years , researchers claim . the creatures , which are around the size of a mouse , also provide more clues about how the first mammals began diversifying . the discovery of three new squirrel-like rodents from the time of the dinosaurs suggests that mammals have been around on earth for more than 200 million years . pictured is a reconstruction of the new mammal species , xianshou songae . this mouse-sized animal was a tree dweller in the jurassic forests . scientists believe they later evolved into egg-laying monotremes such as the platypus , marsupials like the opossum , and placentals which include humans and whales . the six well-preserved fossil skulls and skeletons belong to an extinct group called haramiyida which until recently were only known from teeth . ` for decades scientists have been debating whether the extinct group , called haramiyida , belongs within or outside of mammalia , ' said dr jin meng , at the american museum of natural history in new york . ` previously everything we knew about these animals was based on fragmented jaws and isolated teeth . but the new specimens we discovered are extremely well preserved . the well-preserved fossil skulls and skeletons belong to an extinct group called haramiyida which until recently were only known from teeth . pictured is the fossil of senshou lui , which represents a new species of euharamiyidan mammal . it is a nearly complete skeleton that indicates a slender body with a tail . ` and based on these fossils we now have a good idea of what these animals really looked like which confirms they are indeed mammals . ' the six well-preserved fossil skulls and skeletons belong to an extinct group called haramiyida . haramiyidans represent one of the earliest known mammals and range from the late triassic to the mid jurassic . previously everything scientists knew about these animals was based on fragmented jaws and isolated teeth . but the new specimens discovered are extremely well preserved . from their structure scientists have learned euharamiyida , which were part of the haramiyda were good climbers and probably spent more time in trees than squirrels . the members of euharamiyida likely ate insects , nuts , and fruit with their ` strange ' teeth which have many cusps - or raised points - on the crowns . despite the unusual teeth the overall physical characteristics seen in the new haramiyidan fossils is mammalian . the animals have been named shenshou lui , xianshou linglong , and xianshou songae and lived about 160 million years ago during the jurassic period . the study , published in the journal nature , suggests they evolved from a common ancestor during the late triassic around 208 million years ago . they have placed in a new group - or clade - called euharamiyida and probably looked similar to small squirrels . they weighed between 1 and 10oz -lrb- 28g and 280g -rrb- and had tails and feet suggesting they were tree dwellers . ` they were good climbers and probably spent more time than squirrels in trees , ' said dr meng . ` their hands and feet were adapted for holding branches - but not good for running on the ground . ' the members of euharamiyida likely ate insects , nuts , and fruit with their ` strange ' teeth which have many cusps - or raised points - on the crowns . mammals are believed to evolve from a common ancestor that had three cusps - human molars can have up to five . but the newly discovered species had two parallel rows of cusps on each molar with up to seven cusps on each side . how this complex tooth pattern evolved in relation to those of other mammals has puzzled scientists for decades . but despite the unusual teeth the overall physical characteristics seen in the new haramiyidan fossils is mammalian . this reconstruction shows arboreal mammals in a jurassic forest . the three animals on the left side represent the three new species of euharamiyidan mammals . for example the specimens show evidence of a typical mammalian middle ear - the area just inside the eardrum that turns vibrations in the air into ripples in the ear 's fluids . the middle ears of mammals are unique in that they have three bones - as evidenced in the new fossils . based on the age of the euharamiyida , species the divergence of mammals from reptiles had to have happened much earlier than some research has estimated . instead of originating in the middle jurassic between 176 and 161 million years ago mammals likely first appeared in the late triassic between 235 and 201 million years ago - a finding corresponding with some studies using dna data . dr ming said : ` what we 're showing here is very convincing that these animals are mammals and we need to turn back the clock for mammal divergence . ` but even more importantly these new fossils present a new suite of characters that might help us tell many more stories about ancient mammals . ' the fossils were found in the tiaojishan formation , daxishan site of linglongta in liaoning province , china .", "summary": " fossils of 3 species were uncovered in liaoning province , china .   they lived 160 million years ago and looked like today 's squirrels .   find shows mammals have been around more than 200 million years .   creatures , weighing one to 10 oz -lrb- 28g to 283g -rrb- , belong to haramiyida group .   scientists have placed them in a new category , called euharamiyida .   they ate insects , nuts , and fruit and had ` strange ' pointed teeth .
