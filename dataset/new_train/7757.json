{"text": "rescued : babe is starting to enjoy her freedom at the animal sanctuary . she has spent the past year cooped up in a council house - about as far from the proverbial happy pig in muck as it is possible to be . but now babe , the sow who was discovered living in the small end-terrace home by stunned officials when they tried to evict her owner , has had her bacon saved . the daily mail has tracked her down to an animal rescue centre where caring workers say she is timid , and scared of human contact - but on the road to recovery . incredibly , her owner , sean varty , turned up with the unusual pet in the back of his car shortly after being ordered to leave his council house , and asked staff to look after her . they are now seeking to pair babe , named after the pig in the hit film , with a mate before rehoming the couple . lindsay newell , a veterinary nurse who runs the burton wildlife centre in etwall , derbys , said today : ` she does n't like being grabbed or picked up . if anyone tries to approach her she runs away . ` she 's in a stable on her own at the moment because she initially did n't like to be around other pigs , either . but she 's coming out of her shell a bit now and wanted to mix with the other pigs we have here . we 're taking it one day at a time . ' it is believed mr varty thought he was buying a micropig when he purchased babe as a piglet around a year ago . but miss newell said she was actually a kunekune , a breed that , although one of the smallest in the world , can grow to two feet tall and weigh 15 stone . babe , who now weighs around four stone , was discovered last week when council housing staff forced their way into mr varty 's home in sinfin , dereven experienced workers were shocked by what they found - babe had the run of the entire downstairs of the property , including the kitchen and bathroom , where it is believed she slept . the floor was covered in a thick carpet of her mess , and mud . cared for : veterinary nurse lindsay newall pictured with the pig rescued from a council house in derby . on the road to recovery : babe is still shy , but is slowly coming out of her shell . when mr varty returned home , he simply put her into the back of his renault megane in front of the stunned council employees , and drove away . he is now thought to be staying with friends , while the council has been left with a # 15,000 clean-up bill for the wrecked house . a spokesman for derby homes , which looks after derby city council 's housing stock , said they would be pursuing the 44-year-old for the cost of the operation . miss newell , 25 , said : ' a house is certainly not a suitable environment to keep a pig . in fact , i was disgusted when i heard how she had been living . ` they are quite clean creatures , and it would not have been good for her to be living in that mess . i was shocked . they 're also social animals , and she would n't have liked living alone . ` her owner called and asked if we took in pigs . he says he does n't want her back . we 'll try to pair her up with a mate and then look to rehome them in a month or so . ' new lease of life : babe is a lot cleaner than when rescuers found her in the council house . this little piggy stayed at home : this is the sight that greeted housing officials after they turned up to evict a tenant and found he had been using his council home as a pigsty . emma fahy , 41 , also volunteers at the centre . she said : ` she 's a bit scared and quite timid . she basically does not know how to be a pig . ` she 's okay physically , but it 's one step at a time right now . she simply should just not have been kept in a house as a pet . ' miss newell said the rescue centre was seeing an increasing number of people bringing in large pigs that they thought would remain tiny for life . she added : ` mr varty said he thought he 'd bought a micropig . we have had eight come in to the centre in the last six months or so . i think people have an unrealistic expectation of what they are buying . ` they see them on tv and with celebrities , sitting in their handbags , and think they remain tiny . but they get much bigger , and then the owners ca n't cope . i do n't understand why people buy them . ' neighbours think the pig had been kept in the house for more than a year and it is estimated that repairs to the damage of the home will be in the region of # 10,000 to # 15,000 . piles of junk was found in one of the bedrooms , left , while mud and muck covered the stairs , hallway and door . the front room with a dirty red leather sofa , faeces and piles of household junk stacked up on shelves . fancy a bath ? derby homes , which manages council housing in the city , said the tenant was an ` excessive hoarder ' and that some rooms were so full of junk that they could not get in at all . the garden is n't much better full of old bits of wood , a barbecue . at one point there were two ponies in the garden . the house looks fairly respectable from outside but behind the front door it was full of disgusting rubbish .", "summary": " ` babe ' slowly coming out of her shell after being rescued from derby council house .   carpets were muddied and covered in droppings and rooms full of junk .   it is thought the pig had been living in the house for a year .   council now trying to trace the tenant who is an ` excessive hoarder ' "}
