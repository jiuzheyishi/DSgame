' a carer is seen sticking her finger in mrs price 's food to check it is hot , while another changes an incontinence pad in view of the street . mrs price is diabetic and has special dietary needs , but one carer is filmed admitting she can not cook , adding : ` i ca n't fry an egg . i am really that rubbish at cooking . why they send me to people at dinner time , it 's beyond me . ' mrs price 's grandson darryl set up two cameras at her home in blackpool , lancashire , to monitor her and provide help if she fell . instead , footage taken over nearly a month shows carers turning up late or not at all at least 12 times . mr price said : ` to see someone in your family treated with no dignity -- you feel guilty . you 've trusted this company to look after them .

' the price family say they repeatedly contacted mosaic community care with their complaints . but the preston firm claimed it was not told of their concerns . it said : ` mosaic go above and beyond legal requirements when employing carers to ensure all staff are capable of delivering quality care . ' mosaic said the footage was taken in 2010 and a carer involved had not worked for the firm since . a spokesman said the family hired mosaic again in 2011 ` and were therefore clearly happy with the service ' .", "summary": " home care worker caught disrespecting her elderly charge .   muriel price , 83 , was also filmed in distress because carers failed to turn up .   care mp says the sector could become the next health controversy .
