' the audio of the tape was posted on youtube on tuesday and dated october 1998 . romney says it shows a clear division between the vision of america that he is offering and the ideals that obama espouses . ` frankly , we have two different views about america . the president 's view is one of a larger government . there is a tape that came out where is the president is saying he likes redistribution . i disagree , ' romney told fox news . ' i think a society based upon a government-centered nation where government plays a larger and larger role , redistributes money , that 's the wrong course for america . that will not build a strong america or help people out of poverty .
