{"text": "tories have despaired at cameron 's conduct over leveson after he forged a late-night press regulation policy at ed miliband 's office . it was meant to be the week when the tories ' election campaign began . the budget was designed to arm every tory mp with a message for the doorstep . but instead this became the week where david cameron landed himself with a problem that will bedevil him all the way to polling day . the problem is a system of press regulation that has alarmed nearly every newspaper in the land and infuriated several tory secretaries of state . compounding this problem is that this was n't a deal made in downing street , but in ed miliband 's office . one despairing cabinet minister says when he woke up and heard what had happened , he put his pillow over his head and considered resigning . it is little wonder then that lynton crosby , the man cameron hired to deliver a tory victory at the next election , is so concerned by events . a friend remarks ruefully : ` lynton told them to sort minimum alcohol pricing and leveson as they were both distractions from the main message . but this certainly is n't what he had in mind on leveson . ' this was a u-turn with added political incompetence -- for ten days previously , cameron had called off cross-party talks saying the distance between the parties was unbridgeable . even one of his longest-standing allies admits the deal was ` terrible and ridiculous ' . one no 10 aide defends the agreement but concedes : ` no one was thinking through how it looks . ' labour 's negotiators are incredulous at how the tories handled things -- allowing oliver letwin to be summoned from his bed to late-night talks and to arrive without any political support . one says : ` we could n't believe they had n't created a better , stronger team . they were so apolitical about it . ' the fact the mild-mannered , consensual letwin was doing this job at all reveals how politically naive no 10 can be . one secretary of state points out that ` when you 're in a knife fight with miliband on the issue he 's used to define himself , it is risky to send in a healer not a warrior ' . mild-mannered , consensual policy minister oliver letwin was called from his bed to the talks on press regulation . this week 's events have led to a growing feeling in tory circles that crosby , the man who led boris johnson to victory twice in london , needs to go full-time . if he does n't , political mistakes will keep on happening -- making his job and a general election victory impossible . one minister who knows the cameron operation well insists that crosby ` wo n't be able to do what he needs to do unless he 's around every day ' . crosby is already proving hugely influential . one osborne ally tells me ` to say that this was lynton 's budget as much as george 's budget is an exaggeration . but there 's some truth to it . ' so far , he has fitted into the team better than expected . many thought the straight-talking australian 's style would n't suit the more genteel cameron circle . but even andrew cooper , cameron 's chief strategist , who was expected to clash spectacularly with crosby , is getting on with him . the unpolitical nature of no 10 has long been a source of irritation to tory cabinet ministers . at a political cabinet meeting last year , several ministers complained forcefully to cameron about it . there are signs that their message is starting to get through . oliver dowden , the recently appointed deputy chief of staff , is proving adept at pushing tory changes through the whitehall machine . and ameet gill , who has been with cameron since he became leader , has now been put in charge of the government 's daily agenda , bringing a sense of energy and discipline to it . acknowledging that there 's a problem , cameron has taken to telling people he wants the government 's message to be ` cleaner and clearer ' . but if the tories are to be in with a fighting chance at the election , they 'll need to realise they 're in a political battle now . the budget showed that when they remember that , they are competitive . but last week revealed what disasters happen when they fail to grasp this . cyprus is in the middle of the longest . bank holiday in history and , when banks do reopen , there will be strict . limits on how much money people can take out . but the uk government . believes the island is n't going to end up being the first to quit the . single currency . one senior figure says : ` angela merkel is playing . hardball but she does n't want the economic danger of cyprus leaving the . euro . ' but one minister concedes that the situation is moving so fast it . is hard to know what will happen next , especially given that germany . was reluctant to see cyprus even join the eu in 2004 . if the cypriots do . leave , it 'll be the cheapest place in europe to holiday this summer . david cameron will head north of the border in the coming weeks as the government continues to plot how to beat alex salmond in the 2014 scottish independence referendum . salmond , for his part , is missing no opportunity to get under the skin of cabinet ministers , by signing off letters to them : ` yours for an independent scotland . ' but patrick mcloughlin , the no-nonsense transport secretary , has come up with a simple response . he finishes his own correspondence to salmond : ` yours for a united kingdom . ' former bbc producer thea rogers is said to be behind the budget 's slick presentation and improving osborne 's media performances . the night before the budget , george . osborne and his treasury team sat eating takeaway domino 's pizza as they . went through the details one last time . there was a certain . nervousness . they knew osborne could n't afford for this budget to . unravel as the last one had . today , it is clear it has n't . much of the damage done to the . chancellor 's reputation on the tory backbenches by last year 's events . has been repaired . osborne 's political capital and confidence are also . returning . as one cabinet ally proclaims : ` we 've got the full george . back . ' osborne has done much to try to avoid a repeat of last year 's problems . he 's strengthened his ministerial team , bringing in greg clark , one of . the cleverest tories in parliament , and sajid javid , a former banker and . one of the stars of the new tory intake . he 's also bolstered his office . with two new advisers . neil o'brien , former head of think-tank policy . exchange , is responsible for the chancellor 's refrain that the . government is for ` people who work hard and want to get on ' . the other . arrival is former bbc producer thea rogers , left , who worked with the . corporation 's political editor nick robinson . insiders credit her with . the slick presentation of the budget and improving osborne 's media . performances . but the real challenge for osborne and his team will come with the . spending review in june , which must set out a further # 11.5 billion of . cuts . it is hard to see how the numbers can be made to add up , given . there will be no further savings from welfare , and the lib dems are . determined to protect the budget of vince cable 's business department , . which they believe to be key to growth . this means the only option appears to be big cuts in the tory-run home . office and defence . this wo n't go down well with their ministers , who . have already spoken out against more cuts . one treasury source concedes the spending review will ` get noisy ' but is . adamant they ` will get it done ' . if osborne can manage to square this . circle , his political authority really will be restored .", "summary": " cameron summoned policy minister oliver letwin to press regulation talks .   cross-party talks cancelled due to ` unbridgeable ' distance between parties .
