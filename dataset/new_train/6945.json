{"text": "when . my mobile rang at around 1am on a sunday , i knew instinctively that . something was wrong . it was my sister , jane , and the anguish in her . voice confirmed my fears . her husband , david , had been rushed into . hospital after developing severe chest pains . the outlook was not good . and , unable to contact either of her daughters , louise and charlotte , . who lived nearby with their partners , she pleaded with me to get hold of . them . in the hours that followed , charlotte made it to stafford . hospital to be with her father . then the decision was made to transfer . david to the specialist vascular unit at the queen elizabeth hospital in . birmingham . david 's sister jane 's husband , david , 57 , died following an abdominal aortic aneurysm . during the 30-mile journey his condition deteriorated . further and paramedics battled to keep him alive . david 's eldest . daughter louise managed to see him before he was rushed into theatre . we waited in the family room clinging to the hope that he would pull through , but it was not to be . i . will never forget the outpouring of grief as the surgeon returned to . tell us that david had died , just over five hours after first being . admitted to hospital . he was 57 and the cause of death was a rupture of the aorta - the large artery that passes from the heart to the abdomen . it . had burst because of an abdominal aortic aneurysm -lrb- aaa -rrb- - where a weak . part of the artery starts to swell , causing it to bulge outwards like a . balloon . eventually , the wall bursts open causing massive internal . bleeding which can not be stemmed without immediate surgery . this can . lead to the heart being starved of oxygen , which can be fatal . since . his death on november 12 , 2006 , my family has struggled to come to terms . with why david died so suddenly . he enjoyed good health and there were . no signs that his life might end so abruptly . for my sister and her daughters , the loss of a wonderful husband and father has been devastating . he . did at least live to see the arrival of his first grandchild - and he . would have been overjoyed to see the arrival of four more . ` it is said that of patients with a ruptured aaa , half will die before they reach hospital ' on birthdays , anniversaries and at christmas there is still a feeling that someone is missing . there . is also the inevitable question as to whether or not he might still . have been here if his condition had been diagnosed sooner . an . abdominal aortic aneurysm can grow slowly over years . the aorta of a . healthy person is as wide and as tough as a garden hose , so someone can . live with a small aneurysm for years if it does not grow much . and . as dr mike knapton , the british heart foundation 's associate medical . director , explains : ` it usually causes no symptoms until it ruptures , . which is a medical emergency , and often proves fatal . ' aaas are responsible for nearly 6,000 deaths in england and wales every year - with men over 65 being more at risk than women . the exact reason for this is not clear , but genetic factors are important and female hormones are thought to offer protection . because of hereditary influences anyone whose brother , sister or parent has had the condition could also be at risk . aneurysms . may be exacerbated by the hardening of the arteries , due to things such . as smoking , an unhealthy diet , and high blood pressure . aaa has an . extremely high mortality rate , says dr jenny richards , a clinical . lecturer in vascular surgery from the centre of research excellence at . the university of edinburgh . ` it is said that of patients with a . ruptured aaa , half will die before they reach hospital . and half of . those who do reach hospital will die before they reach the operating . theatre and then half of those who have an operation to repair the tear . in the artery will not survive . ' in march 2009 , nhs england set up . the national aaa screening programme for all men reaching 65 , with . identical programmes rolled out in stages across the rest of britain . from 2012 . men over 65 , who have not previously been screened , can put . themselves forward for the programme , too . uptake for the screening . has been good - 76 per cent of the 226,901 men aged 65 invited for . screening attended their appointments . a further 13,164 men above 65 . referred themselves for screening . but with more than 2,627,000 men . aged 65 to 74 in the uk , according to the latest census , clearly more . lives could be saved if those who do not qualify for screening . self-referred . the screening test consists of a ten-minute ultrasound . scan . at less than 3cm there is no concern , but an aneurysm measuring 3 . to 4.4 cm needs annual surveillance . this increases to three-monthly . surveillance for measurements of 4.5 to 5.5 cm . anyone with an . aneurysm larger than 5.5 cm is referred to the consultant vascular . surgeon . anyone found to be at risk , that is with an aneurysm greater . than 5.5 cm in diameter , can then elect for surgical intervention . this . involves replacing the affected part of aorta with a piece of synthetic . tubing known as a graft - either via open surgery on the abdomen or fed . up from the groin . as dr knapton says : ` it is better to manage . things in a proactive way than to wait for a crisis . assuming a patient . survives the ruptured aorta , you then have the awful pressure it puts on . services in terms of the emergency trip to a&e before going into . the ` resus ' room to try to repair the thing , all of which is extremely . traumatic for patients , relatives and staff . ' one man who ca n't speak highly enough of the process is colin mcewan , from edinburgh , who had the ultrasound scan . ` the . machine beeped and as the measurements were taken the nurse 's . expression changed . she said :  i 'm afraid you have an aneurysm and it 's . quite big - around 4.9 cm .  within days i had an appointment with a . consultant vascular surgeon at the edinburgh royal infirmary . ' aneurysms may be exacerbated by the hardening of the arteries , due to things such as smoking or bad diet . told . later that the aneurysm was 5.9 cm and not 4.9 cm he was given a choice of . treatment - endovascular aneurysm repair -lrb- evar -rrb- , which involves a . synthetic graft being fed up through the arteries in the legs to repair . the aorta or open surgery , which , unlike evar , is a one-off procedure . without further checks . he opted for the latter , despite a slightly . higher mortality risk of 1 to 5 per cent . before his surgery , colin . agreed to take part in a trial of another , possibly more accurate . screening method for aaa . a magnetic resonance imaging -lrb- mri -rrb- . scanner , funded by the british heart foundation and the medical research . council , is being put to use in a study of 350 patients at edinburgh . royal infirmary . this provides instant , real-time moving images of . the inside of the body . it is being explored as a way to predict the . risk of rupture and help surgeons decide which patients would benefit . from preventative surgery , and possibly lead to even earlier . intervention . the proportion of men screened who will be found to have an aneurysm . colin had the mri scan before his initial assessment . day and another on the day of assessment . he will have a follow up in . two years to check for any changes . ` mri scanning is potentially . more accurate but more difficult to do because it is an expensive piece . of kit , ' says dr knapton . ` currently aaa screening can be done in any . surgery setting without specialist equipment , so the challenge for the . nhs would be a trade-off between something that is quick , easy and cheap . and something that 's less accessible . ' six days after his operation , . colin mcewan was allowed home . ` for the first couple of weeks i spent a . lot of time in bed feeling exhausted but i gradually got back to . fitness through walking - starting slowly and increasing the distance . each day . it has now been four months and i have started to play golf . again and feel fine . ' it is too late for david - and at 57 he was . too young to have been offered screening - but if advances in screening . techniques can lead to more outcomes such as colin 's , costs will , . hopefully , become a secondary consideration . aaa.screening.nhs.uk .", "summary": " david : ` my sister jane 's husband , david , 57 , died after five hours in hospital '   he died due to rupture of the aorta - artery passing from heart to abdomen .   it burst due to abdominal aortic aneurysm - swelling weak part of artery .   aaas are responsible for nearly 6,000 deaths in england and wales annually .   men over 65 are more at risk ; female hormones thought to offer protection .
