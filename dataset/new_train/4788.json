{"text": "washington president bush on wednesday signed the economic stimulus act of 2008 , calling it a  booster shot  for the american economy .  the bill i 'm signing today is large enough to have an impact , amounting to more than $ 152 billion this year , or about 1 percent of the gdp -lrb- gross domestic product -rrb- ,  the president said in the brief ceremony in the east room of the white house . the government hopes the measure , which will send most americans tax rebate checks by may , will either prevent a recession or make one relatively brief . the package also includes tax breaks for equipment purchases by businesses , as well as payments to disabled veterans and some senior citizens . the bipartisan measure moved through congress at relative break-neck speed , going from initial discussions to enactment in less than four weeks . the package will pay $ 600 to most individual taxpayers and $ 1,200 to married taxpayers filing joint returns , so long as they are below income caps of $ 75,000 for individuals and $ 150,000 for couples . there is also a $ 300 per child tax credit . watch bush sign stimulus bill into law  the rebates will put about $ 120 billion in the hands of individuals in the hope that they will spend it and boost a faltering u.s. economy . economists generally agree that the economy should see a boost from the rebate checks . but most also agree that the full impact will be less than the total value of the stimulus package . that 's because some recipients are expected to save their rebates or use them to pay down credit cards or other debt instead of spending it . in addition , some consumers may spend their rebates on imported items , which would provide a more limited lift to the u.s. economy .  my guess is that of the $ 110 billion to $ 120 billion of tax rebates , about half will go to u.s. products and services ,  said david wyss , chief economist for standard & poor 's . there also are questions about whether the stimulus will actually be the key to ending or preventing a recession . treasury secretary henry paulson said last week that the internal revenue service planned to send the rebate checks to about 130 million americans .  they 're going to be getting ready to get checks out , and believe me , they will . ... and this is largely going to be done by the time summer 's over . and so we 're going to move quickly and make a difference ,  he said . bush praised the quick work of the house and senate and urged americans not to  overreact  to the current economic troubles .  in the past seven years , the system has absorbed shocks : recession , corporate scandals , terror attacks , global war ; yet the genius of our system is that it can absorb such shocks and emerge even stronger ,  he said .  in a dynamic market economy , our economy will prosper and it will continue to be the marvel of the world .  e-mail to a friend . cnn 's adam levine contributed to this report .", "summary": " president bush signs $ 152 billion economic stimulus bill .   congress passed the bipartisan bill last week .   plan would send rebate checks up to $ 600 for individuals and $ 1,200 for couples .   treasury secretary henry paulson says irs should mail checks by early may .
