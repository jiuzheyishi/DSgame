{"text": "spiders disguise themselves as innocuous-looking ladybirds , tree stumps and many more natural objects in order to avoid being eaten . but there is one that mimics something much more disgusting . the cyclosa ginnaga decorates its web . with a spiral pattern and pieces of dead leaves to make its nest look like bird droppings , in a bid to confuse predators . although scientists have known about this practice for some time , researchers have only just discovered the reasons why the spider chooses this particular disguise . scientists have identified a spider called cyclosa ginnaga that disguises itself as bird droppings to evade predators hunting in forests of south east asia - and even weaves its web in a way that looks like white bird droppings -lrb- pictured -rrb- . cyclosa ginnaga is a species of spider found in taiwan , china , japan , and south korea . spiders in the genus cyclosa spin elaborate webs in concentric circles and add debris , such as plant material , prey carcasses and twigs to disguise them from predators , and to sometimes attract dinner . cyclosa ginnaga uses dead leaves and silk to make a white blob on its webs that looks like a bird dropping . because it has a silvery body , the spider is well disguised from predators such as wasps . the disguise is effective as it helps the creature catch food , while evading becoming dinner itself , according to researchers from tunghai university and the endemic species research institute in taiwan . it creates a white disc on its web that functions to attract prey , but because the spider has a silver body , this also makes it inconspicuous to predatory wasps . ` to the human eye , the size , colour and shape of the body against its decoration resemble bird droppings , and it has been hypothesised that these spiders masquerade as bird droppings to avoid predation , ' according to the study published in scientific reports . the scientists showed that the spiders . and their web ornaments look almost identical to bird droppings , both in . colour and in size , when viewed under conditions that replicate how . wasps see them . the disguise is particularly effective as it helps the creature catch food , while evading becoming dinner itself . researchers studied how both the spiders and their webs -lrb- pictured second and fourth row -rrb- , as well as bird droppings on leaves -lrb- top row and third row -rrb- appear to wasps , which eat cyclosa ginnaga . they collected 10 of the spiders and used a spectrometer to measure the wavelengths of light emitted by the spider 's bodies , their webs and bird droppings against a forest backdrop , smithsonian reported . a computer program was used that mimics the sensory eye cells of bees , enabling the team to see whether wasps - which have similar eye to bees - could distinguish between a potential meal and a dropping . in another experiment , they set up video cameras in front of 12 spider webs and covered some of the spiders ' bodies with black ink and hid web decorations of others , while leaving a handful untouched . they found that wasp attacks were far greater on spiders that had either their webs or bodies blackened with carbon powder or ink , than those remained sliver and had their webs intact . ` we provide empirical evidence for the first time that bird dropping masquerading can effectively reduce the predation risk of an organism , ' ecologist i-min tso of tunghai university said . other spiders in the genus cyclosa decorate their webs - sometimes with plant material and the bodies of prey , as well as weaving thick circles . one particular species even makes a decoy spider to baffle predators . the scientists showed that the spiders . and their web ornaments -lrb- pictured top -rrb- look almost identical to bird droppings -lrb- pictured bottom -rrb- , both in . colour and in size , when viewed under conditions that replicate how . wasps see them . the spiders create a white disc on its web -lrb- pictured -rrb- that functions to attract prey , but because the spider has a silver body , this also makes it inconspicuous to predatory wasps .", "summary": " cyclosa ginnaga is silver-coloured and weaves white spirals on its web .   the spiders blend in with the faux faeces in the forests of south east asia .   this protects the spiders from predators such as wasps .   decorations added to the spirals are also used to confuse these predators .   scientists from tunghai university and the endemic species research institute used computer programmes and ink to make the discovery .
