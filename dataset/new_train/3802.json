{"text": "the scale of britain 's dependence on foreign energy was laid bare yesterday in a set of official figures . according to a report from the department for energy and climate change , the amount of coal , oil and gas imported by the uk hit a record high in 2012 . at the same time domestic production dwindled , falling by more than 10 per cent last year after a slump in output from the north sea . last year the uk imported 173million tons of oil equivalent -- a measure of energy potential that covers all fuels including gas , coal and oil . this was 7.1 per cent more than 2011 and is the highest level ever recorded . last week the uk had only 36 hours of domestic gas reserves left , after plummeting temperatures saw a surge in demand . but the amount exported fell 5 per cent to 80million tons -- the lowest level since 1989 . overall some 43 per cent of the energy used in the uk came from overseas -- the most since 1976 , when the country was on the cusp of its own oil boom . energy analyst angelos anastasiou , from cantor fitzgerald , said : ` we 're rolling towards a crisis scenario . ` we do need new generating capacity , and the likelihood is we 'll end with more gas-fired power stations . ` but the problem is at the moment they 're not economical to build because of the returns . ' he added : ` that 's the way of world now , because sadly we are running out of north sea oil and gas . the situation is unlikely to improve . ' last week , the uk had only 36 hours of domestic gas reserves left , after plunging temperatures saw millions of homes switch on the heating .", "summary": " 43 per cent of energy used came from abroad last year .   uk imported 173 tons of oil equivalent - 7.1 per cent increase on 2011 .
