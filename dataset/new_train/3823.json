{"text": "joe biden made another gaffe on the campaign trail on wednesday by mistaking what century it was less than 24 hours after his ` put y' all back in chains ' race-baiting caused uproar . biden seemed to mistake this century for the 1900s when he told a virginia crowd : ` folks , where 's it written we can not lead the world in the 20th century in making automobiles ? ' in a statement to the weekly standard , romney campaign spokesman ryan williams was quick to take a jab at biden . williams said : ` mitt romney and paul ryan will ensure america leads the world in the 21st century by strengthening middle-class families and creating jobs . scroll down for video . standing by his vp : president obama , pictured on wednesday during a campaign stop in davenport , iowa , defended biden and clarified the comments . gaffe : biden , pictured on august 14 , sparked outrage with his ` put y' all back in chains ' speech . ` president obama and vice president biden have taken our nation backward with failed policies that have resulted in higher unemployment , more debt , and a weaker economy . a campaign based on rage and divisiveness ca n't hide the president 's failed record . ' even as he 's faced with a chorus of republican uproar , president obama is standing by his man . the commander-in-chief fended off criticism of joe biden after the vice president declared during a campaign stop on tuesday that obama 's opponent mitt romney wanted to ` put ya 'll back in chains . ' hours after those comment hit the airwaves , republicans came out in force to suggest that it might be time for the president to put the 69-year-old biden out to pasture . among them was former alaska gov sarah palin , who went so far as to propose that biden should be replaced with hillary clinton if obama wants to be re-elected . speaking on wednesday , obama clarified biden 's remarks , telling people magazine that he meant consumers would be worse off if the gop succeeded in doing away with new restraints on financial institutions .  in no sense was he trying to connote something other than that ,  obama said . in iowa for a bus tour , obama said the reaction to biden 's remarks was a function of politics , but he did not blame him . backlash : sarah palin called biden 's remark ` disgusting ' ` the truth is that during the course of these campaigns , folks like to get obsessed with how something was phrased even if everybody personally understands that 's not how it was meant , ' obama told the magazine . he added : ` that 's sort of the nature of modern campaigns and modern coverage of campaigns . but i tell you , when i 'm traveling around iowa , that 's not what 's on people 's minds . ' on tuesday in danville , virginia , biden told a crowd : ` ` he -lsb- romney -rsb- said in the first 100 days he 's going to let the big banks write their own rules , unchain wall street . ' before an audience that included hundreds of black people , biden added : ` they 're going to put yâ€™ all back in chains . ' palin , who was john mccain 's running mate during his failed presidential bid in 2008 , called the quote ` disgusting . ' shake up : sarah palin has said obama should replace joe biden with hillary clinton as vice president . swap : palin suggested that obama , pictured at a campaign stop on tuesday in iowa , replace biden with his secretary of state , hillary clinton , right . she suggested that the obama campaign would be much better off if it dumped biden for hillary clinton . palin told fox news host greta van susteren on tuesday : ` the strategists there in the obama campaign have got to look at a diplomatic way of replacing joe biden on the ticket with hillary ... joe biden really drags down that ticket . ' she added that she hoped obama would not take such a step because ` an obama/clinton ticket would have a darn good chance of winning . ' palin was joined by another prominent republican , former new york city mayor rudy giuliani , who questioned the vice president 's ` mental capacity . ' giuliani told cnbc : ` i 've never seen a vice president that has made as many mistakes , said as many stupid things . ' questions : former new york mayor rudy giuliani has called biden ` not very bright ' in life of his recent gaffes . ' i mean , there 's a real fear if , god forbid , he ever had to be entrusted with the presidency , whether he really has the mental capacity to handle it . ' i mean , this guy just is n't bright . he 's never been bright . he is n't bright . and people think ,  well , he just talks a little too much .  actually he 's just not very smart . ' there is , however , very little chance that obama would drop biden as his running mate and it is doubtful that clinton would even want the job . even as obama stuck up for his no. 2 , it did n't stop biden from making yet another gaffe on the campaign trail . he 's at it again : biden made another gaffe on wednesday when he told a virginia crowd when he seemed to mistake this century for the 1900s . january 2012 : . during speech at a manufacturing plant in new hampshire the vice . president spoke about outsourcing to india and put on a bad indian . accent while asking ` how many times do you get the call , ' i like to talk . to you about your credit card . ` december 2010 : . during the swearing in of a republican senator mark kirk in congress , . biden told the capitol hill newcomer to put that hand on the bible and . raise his left . according to the congressional rulebook , it should have . been the other way round.march 2010 : . he dropped the f-bomb during the signing of the administration 's . historic health reforms , apparently unaware that the microphones would . catch him out when he whispered into the president 's ear immediately . before the announcement , declaring : ` this is a big f ****** deal ! ` march 2010 : . mr biden said ` god rest her soul ' in reference to the mother of irish . prime minister brian cowen . mr cowen 's mother is alive ; his father had . died . realising his misstep , he corrected with : ` god bless her soul ' . october 2008 : . speaking in athens , ohio about john mccain 's economic strategy , he . said : ` look , john 's last-minute economic plan does nothing to tackle the . number-one job facing the middle class , and it happens to be , as barack . says , a three-letter word : jobs . j-o-b-s , jobs . ` september 2008 : . during a political rally in missouri , he urged wheelchair-bound state . senator chuck graham to rise and be recognised , saying : ` stand up , . chuck , let 'em see ya . ' realizing his mistake , he said : ` oh , god love . you ... what am i talking about ? 's eptember 2008 : . after he was named the vice presidential nominee , he addressed a crowd . in nashua , new hampshire , questioning how he beat out hillary clinton : . ` hillary clinton is as qualified or more qualified than i am to be vice . president of the united states of america , ' he said in new hampshire . ` quite frankly it might have been a better pick than me . ` august 2008 : . he also mixed up barack obama 's name at his first campaign rally with . the president , introducing him as : ' a man i 'm proud to call my friend . a . man who will be the next president of the united states - barack . america !
