{"text": "here 's a new year 's resolution that 's easy to keep , good for your health and beneficial for your relationships . and it wo n't cost you a penny . sound too good to be true ? read on . in recent months , i 've been working with a group of creative thinkers who are mining the meaning of a good life . mihaly csikszentmihalyi , bill damon and howard gardner are renowned psychologists who 've collaborated to create the good project , which explores the behaviors and mindsets that add up to good work , good play and good citizenship . together , with lynn barendsen , we 've developed a simple set of questions for the new year . they 're catalysts for reflection rather than formulas for imitation . their purpose is to get us thinking about our purpose , in both private and community life . we originally developed these questions for young people , on the belief that the new generation does n't get enough structured opportunities to explore meaning and values . but the truth is , it 's not just millennials today who might lack purpose , feel uncertain about shared beliefs and goals or wish they could be part of something greater than themselves . it 's people of all ages . we americans rarely get to make a truly mindful assessment of who we are , what 's shaped us and why we hope to change . if we did that first , we 'd probably be more capable of making wise resolutions and keeping them . we 'd become more conscious of the web of relationship and mutual obligation that holds us together and that makes our freedom truly worth cherishing . and we might just end up being better humans . so i invite you , whatever your stage of life , to explore these questions . ask them of yourself . talk with family and friends about them . write and share your reflections . feel free to adapt and revise the questions to suit your circumstances . and let us know on twitter what the experience is like for you and those close to you . if you make it your first resolution to consider these questions well , your other resolutions will almost certainly end up being more honest , more meaningful to you and more useful to others . enjoy reflecting , and may your new year be happy -- and deeply good . who you are . 1 . think of something -lrb- an activity , a job -rrb- to which you 're really committed and that takes up a lot of your time . why do you do it ? do you consider it time well spent ? why or why not ? what would make you stop being involved ? 2 . who or what do you consider your community ? what do you do for the community ? what would you expect the community to do it for you ? 3 . to whom or what do you feel responsible ? what does that entail ? what happens when you do n't meet that responsibility ? 4 . are you a good worker ? a good citizen ? a good person ? how do you distinguish among them ? which is most important to you ? influences . 5 . who 's influenced you , and how do you pass it on ? 6 . what individuals and institutions do you admire and why -lrb- current or past -rrb- ? 7 . what/whom do n't you admire and why ? 8 . what and whom do you love ? aspirations . 9 . what would it mean for you to be successful ? how important is recognition , through money or esteem ? what about unheralded acts or contributions ? 10 . what would it mean for you fail ? who or what will make that judgment for you and about you ? 11 . what kind of person do you want to be right now ? 12 . what should -- and should n't -- be written in your obituary ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of eric liu .", "summary": " eric liu : i 've been working with creative thinkers who are mining the meaning of a good life .   liu : this new year 's , resolve to reflect on your life .   here are a list of questions to ask yourself , including who are your influences , aspirations .   liu : the questions were originally developed for young people , but they 're really for all .
