{"text": "new york protesters poured onto the streets of new york late wednesday , upset over a grand jury 's decision not to indict a police officer in the death of eric garner . they marched at the same time u.s. attorney general eric holder announced that federal officials were moving ahead with a civil rights investigation . garner , an unarmed black man , died in july after a white officer , daniel pantaleo , put him in a chokehold . garner 's death was later ruled a homicide .  this fight ai n't over . it just begun . i 'm determined to get justice for my husband because he should n't have been killed in that way . he should n't have been killed in any way ,  said esaw garner , his widow .  he should be here , celebrating christmas and thanksgiving and everything else , with his children and his grandchildren . and he ca n't . why ? because a cop did wrong . somebody that gets paid to do right did wrong and he 's not held accountable for it . but my husband 's death will not be in vain . as long as i have a breath in my body i will fight the fight till the end .  protesters gathered at various points in manhattan , including times square and union square , marching peacefully north as crowds formed near rockefeller center for the lighting of the christmas tree . columbus circle was blocked for a time . there were demonstrations in other cities too , including washington , d.c. , philadelphia and oakland , california .  no justice . no peace ,  protesters chanted in new york .  no racist police .  garner 's mother , who spoke alongside his widow , said she was disappointed by the grand jury 's decision . she called for calm .  we want you to rally , but rally in peace . make a statement , but make it in peace ,  said gwen carr . on new york city 's west side highway , a group of protesters stood face to face with rows of police officers , shouting ,  i ca n't breathe , i ca n't breathe .  the protesters sat down on the road , crying out ,  what do we want ? justice . when do we want it ? now !   ferguson is everywhere ,  one demonstrator 's sign read , referring to the michael brown shooting in ferguson , missouri . ' i ca n't breathe ' during the fatal encounter july 17 on staten island , garner raised both hands in the air and told the officers not to touch him . seconds later , a video shows an officer behind garner grab him in a chokehold and pull him to the sidewalk , rolling him onto his stomach . the new york city police department prohibits chokeholds .  i ca n't breathe ! i ca n't breathe !  garner said repeatedly , his cries muffled into the pavement . garner , 43 , was pronounced dead that day . police had suspected garner of selling cigarettes illegally . the grand jury was made up of 14 white and nine nonwhite members , according to law enforcement sources . a total of 12 jurors who have heard all the evidence must be in agreement for a decision . the grand jury found that there was no  reasonable cause  to indict . the case became emblematic of longstanding tensions between police and minority communities , especially given that the majority of people stopped under the former  stop-and-frisk  police policy were african-american or hispanic . a federal court ruled that stop-and-frisk was unconstitutional and tantamount to racial profiling . the garner death led to demonstrations around the city and came weeks before the racially charged police shooting of brown , who was unarmed , in ferguson . ` national moment of grief  president barack obama said the garner case reflected a longtime  concern on the part of too many minority communities that law enforcement is not working with them , and dealing with them in a fair way .   we are not going to let up until we see a strengthening of the trust , and a strengthening of the accountability that exists between our communities and our law enforcement ,  he said . standing outside the staten island store where his son was put into a fatal chokehold , garner 's father , ben , told a crowd that he was hopeful about the federal investigation and urged demonstrators to remain peaceful .  we want justice for eric ,  he said .  we ai n't tearing up nothing . we ai n't burning up nothing ... the police is our problem . no violence . that is all i ask .  mayor bill de blasio sought to allay tensions , saying that he had received assurances from washington that the federal investigation of garner 's death would move forward  expeditiously and with a clear sense of independence .  de blasio said the grand jury decision has created  a national moment of pain , a national moment of grief and searching for a solution .  pantaleo , according to a statement from his union , the patrolmen 's benevolent association , said :  i became a police officer to help people and to protect those who ca n't protect themselves . it is never my intention to harm anyone and i feel very bad about the death of mr. garner . my family and i include him and his family in our prayers and i hope that they will accept my personal condolences for their loss .  staten island district attorney daniel donovan jr. said the grand jury conducted dozens of interviews with witnesses , including 22 civilians , and met between september 29 and december 3 . an attorney for pantaleo said his client testified for approximately two hours on november 21 in front of the grand jury . u.s. rep. hakeem jeffries , who represents parts of brooklyn and queens , called the decision  a miscarriage of justice  an  outrage  and a  disgrace .   he was killed in plain sight for all of america to see because this was captured on video . and so it 's inexplicable that this grand jury could not return a single charge ,  said jeffries . patrolmen 's benevolent association president patrick lynch said ,  there are no winners  from the grand jury decision .  it is clear that the officer 's intention was to do nothing more than take mr. garner into custody as instructed and that he used the take-down technique that he learned in the academy when mr. garner refused ,  lynch said .  no police officer starts a shift intending to take another human being 's life and we are all saddened by this tragedy .  brown and garner . the grand jury 's decision came on the same day that the new york police department , in an attempt to bolster public confidence , announced plans to start having some officers wear body cameras .  when something happens , to have a video record of it , from the police officers ' perspective , is going to help in many , many ways ,  de blasio told reporters .  and god forbid , when something goes wrong , we are going to have a clearer understanding of what happened .  parallels mark the deaths of garner and brown , both black , starting with crimes they were suspected of : brown allegedly stole cigars from a convenience store ; garner was allegedly selling cigarettes tax-free . another similarity that has become the hallmark of protests in ferguson : garner put his hands up in the air , as the crook of pantaleo 's elbow tightened around his throat . some eyewitnesses have said brown also made that gesture in surrender . but other witnesses contradicted them . no video was rolling , so doubts over that and other details will always hang over the moment that former ferguson police officer darren wilson shot the unarmed teen . that has led obama to call for law officers all over the country to record their operations with body cameras . in garner 's case , there can be little doubt what happened . before he gasped what appeared to be his final breaths , someone hit record on a cell phone camera . the details of his takedown spread through the internet as the video went viral . wilson and pantaleo . in the ferguson case , wilson argued before the missouri grand jury that he shot brown -- who wilson said tried to wrest away his gun and then charged at him -- in self-defense . in the staten island cell phone video , garner did not go after pantaleo but had his back to him ; the officer jumped him from behind then tackled him to the ground . the new york medical examiner has ruled garner 's death a homicide . the cause of death was  compression of neck -lrb- chokehold -rrb- , compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police .  but the medical examiner also listed acute and chronic bronchial asthma , obesity and hypertensive cardiovascular disease as contributing factors in garner 's death . in ferguson , wilson went into hiding after death threats and kept his status of police officer but was placed on leave . he resigned shortly after the grand jury decision . after the chokehold , pantaleo was put on modified assignment and stripped of his badge and gun amid the investigation , and the nypd 's commissioner ordered an extensive review of training procedures . two lawsuits have previously been filed against pantaleo . the plaintiffs in both suits allege false arrest , unlawful imprisonment , civil rights violations and other charges . one suit from 2013 was dismissed in january 2014 , while the second , from february 2014 , remains open . ferguson and new york . in both ferguson and new york , mostly african-american protesters took to the streets for weeks after both men died to decry police violence . demonstrators in new york have called the police response during garner 's arrest excessive and criminal , but during protests , the contact between police and demonstrators has been largely cordial . missing were the tear gas canisters , assault rifles , armored vehicles and the lootings and flying bottles that marred the st. louis suburb in the wake of brown 's death . when the missouri grand jury declined to charge wilson , violence returned to ferguson , as shot were fired , stores were looted and cars were set on fire . cnn 's dana ford , catherine e. shoichet , dominique debucquoy-dodley , ben brumfield , daniel verello and leigh remizowski contributed to this report .", "summary": " new :  make a statement , but make it in peace ,  says eric garner 's mother .   protesters gather across new york , other u.s. cities .   garner , an unarmed black man , died after a white police officer put him in a chokehold .   a grand jury decided not to indict the officer ;
