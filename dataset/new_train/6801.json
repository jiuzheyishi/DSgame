{"text": "david cameron and angela merkel have clashed in a meeting over the future of direction of europe . downing street sources said the pair had a ` candid ' exchange over the prospect of arch-federalist jean-claude juncker becoming president of the european commission . mr cameron has warned that britain could leave the eu if he fails in his bid to block mr juncker 's appointment , which is backed by mrs merkel . david cameron and angela merkel had a ` candid ' meeting last night over who should become the next president of the european commission . mr cameron and mrs merkel sat across the table from one another at a breakfast meeting of g7 leaders this morning . the british prime minister and german chancellor are usually close allies , including on future reform of europe . just yesterday mrs merkel gave a speech criticising those urging britain to leave the eu . she told german mps it was ` grossly negligent , actually unacceptable , how easily some talk about it not mattering whether great britain agrees or not , even whether great britain remains a member of the european union or not . this is anything but irrelevant , unimportant or trivial . ' however , she later met mr cameron for a bilateral meeting at the g7 summit in brussels , where the pair had a frank exchange of views . they have been at loggerheads over the choice of a successor to jose manuel barroso - with mr cameron vehemently opposed to mrs merkel 's favoured candidate , the arch-federalist former prime minister of luxembourg jean-claude juncker . a no 10 source said : ` they had friendly , candid and constructive discussions in keeping with how their bilaterals usually are and in the spirit of finding consensus . ' mr cameron had further discussions today on the issue with mr barroso , president of the european council herman van rompuy and italian prime minister matteo renzi , no 10 said . angela merkel is pushing for arch-federalist jean-claude juncker -lrb- left -rrb- to become the new ec president , but imf chief christine lagarde -lrb- second left -rrb- has emerged as a compromise candidate favoured by david cameron . other politicians in line for europe 's most powerful position include danish pm helle thorning-schmidt and irish taoiseach enda kenny . jean-claude juncker is the favourite to become the new european commission president - replacing the outgoing former portuguese prime minister jose manuel barroso . the former luxembourg prime minister was chosen as the candidate for the top job by the european parliament 's main conservative group , the european people 's party . the epp emerged from last week 's elections with the most seats - leaving mr junker in poll position for the eu 's most powerful job . but the commission president is chosen by european leaders including david cameron - and not by the parliament . meps do however have to confirm the leaders ' choice for the job in a vote . the other candidates for the top eu job include the imf chief christine lagarde . miss lagarde was finance minister under former president nicolas sarkozy before moving to the imf at the height of the euro zone 's debt crisis in 2011 to replace disgraced french politician dominique strauss-kahn . her term runs until 2016 . a fluent english-speaker who headed a major us law firm before holding ministerial office in france , she is highly regarded by german leader angela merkel . center-left danish prime minister helle thorning-schmidt is also under consideration . the former mep is the daughter-in-law of neil kinnock , the ex labour leader and european commissioner . if mrs merkel was open to a french candidate for one of the top jobs , paris might offer socialist former prime minister jean-marc ayrault - a fluent german-speaker who was replaced in march but is well regarded in berlin . another candidate for the eu commission president is the current irish taoiseach enda kenny . the fine gael leader became ireland 's leader in 2011 , so might be open to moving to brussels . mrs merkel appeared to offer mr cameron a lifeline last night with a speech warning against letting britain leave the eu , but they remain at loggerheads over the ec job . mr cameron seemed to be getting on better with us president barack obama during a working session of the g7 summit in brussels . g7 leaders have gathered in brussels for a summit , including -lrb- l-r -rrb- italy 's prime minister matteo renzi , canada 's prime minister stephen harperm , us president barack obama , president of the european council herman van rompuy , germany 's chancellor angela merkel , britain 's prime minister david cameron , head of the european commission jose manuel barroso , france 's president francois hollande and japan 's prime minister shinzo abe . the summit is supposed to focus on ukraine and ensuring economic growth , but the european leaders have remained focussed on the future direction of the eu . mrs merkel has insisted she is ` trying to ensure that jean-claude juncker receives the qualified majority he needs to become the next president of the european commission ' . but her comments suggest she does not believe mr juncker can command a majority among european leaders . italy , sweden , the netherlands and hungary are among a number of eu countries said to share mr cameron 's concerns about the luxembourger . mr cameron has branded mr juncker a ` face from the 1980s ' who no-one has heard of . he fears that his bid to renegotiate britain 's membership of the eu will be hampered if mr juncker hold such a key role . mrs merkel is reported to have sounded out french president francois hollande about nominating miss lagarde for the commission job . miss lagarde , who will travel to london on imf business tomorrow , would be a popular candidate in both the uk and germany . but she is said to harbour ambitions of standing for the french presidency -- which would be incompatible with taking the top job in brussels . by . matt chorley , mailonline political editor . a former french prime minister has angrily called on britain to leave the european union - to stop it dying . michel rocard said the uk had only joined the eu to help big business - and called on it to leave before it caused further damage . mr rocard also accused david cameron of ` pretending ' to want to leave - and of provoking a crisis in order to serve the interest of britain 's banks . former french socialist prime minister michel rocard , being greeted here by the british prime minister margaret thatcher at number 10 in 1988 , has called on britain to regain its ` elegance ' by quitting the eu . in a scathing article in the french newspaper le monde said : ` so leave , then , before you destroy everything . ' the remarks by the 83-year-old rocard comes amid growing anger of mr cameron 's bid to block the former luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker from running the european commission . mr junker is the lead candidate of the biggest group in the european parliament - the conservative european people 's party - which scopped the most seats in last week 's european elections . mr cameron has publicly opposed the nomination of mr juncker , whose european people 's party . france said before the election that the leading candidate of whichever party won the vote should be put forward for the job . the pm has dismissed a report in germany 's der spiegel magazine that claimed he had threatened at an eu summit last week to bring forward a referendum on british membership of the eu if mr juncker became commission president . the latest fall out between europe and the uk threatens to turn nasty , the former french pm claimed . former socialist prime minister michel rocard spent 15 years in the european parliament after leaving french politics . princess diana appeared to have charmed mr rocard on a visit in paris in 1988 - but the former french pm said britain had lost its esteem in the eyes of europe . he said : ` between you and us , the continental europeans , there is a disagreement that is turning ugly . europe is dying from it . ' the socialist rocard has been a backer of closer european integration since the bloc 's founding in the decade after world war two and spent 15 years as a member of european parliament after leaving french politics in 1997 . he said britain had lost the respect of its neighbours in europe over its position on europe . the former pm wrote : ` there was a time when being british was synonymous with elegance . let us rebuild europe . regain your elegance and you will regain our esteem . ' britain -- which joined the eu , then known as the european economic community , in 1973 after france 's general charles de gaulle had resisted a previous attempt to enter the bloc -- has long been accused by some of the zone 's founder members of seeking to slow down european political union . mr cameron has vowed to hold a referendum on britain 's membership of the union in 2017 . before the poll he has promised to ` renegotiate ' the terms of britain 's membership - by winning back powers from brussels . last week he accused the union of being ` too bossy ' .", "summary": " british pm and german chancellor clash during bilateral at g7 summit .   merkel backs arch-federalist juncker as european commission president .   but cameron fears it will thwart his plan for radical reform of the eu .   ex-french pm rocard tells uk : get out of europe before you kill it .
