{"text": "if manchester united rallies to win the english premier league , it might look back at thursday 's boxing day clash at hull as a turning point . united trailed 2-0 within 13 minutes against a side that had lost only one home game in the league all season but wayne rooney inspired a comeback and the red devils prevailed 3-2 for a fifth straight victory in all competitions . rooney set up chris smalling , scored a stunner to make it 2-2 in the first half and was on hand to pressure james chester as the defender headed the own goal winner in the second half . chester -- briefly a united player -- had opened the scoring and was thwarted in injury time by keeper david de gea as hull pushed forward in the dying stages . united finished the game with 10 men after antonio valencia 's late red . defending champion united , once 13 points off the pace in the premier league , moved to within five of leader liverpool ahead of thursday 's later kickoffs .  we had some poor results at the start of the season and we 're showing some real quality in the last few weeks ,  rooney told sky sports .  we 're having a go . we 're fighting for each other , we 're working hard and we 're ready for the challenge .  hopefully we can surprise a few people .  chester took advantage of slack marking in the united box on a corner to lash a shot into the roof of the net in the fourth minute and united defender jonny evans failed to clear in the 13th , allowing david meyler to double the lead on a low effort that deflected off the northern irishman .  it was my fault for the first one ,  said rooney . but rooney 's perfect delivery teed up smalling in the 19th minute and the england striker scored his 150th premier league goal for manchester united with a volley in the 26th minute . alex bruce -- the son of hull manager and former united defender steve bruce -- struck the crossbar as united 's defense wobbled again in the 63rd minute before chester 's gaffe from ashley young 's dangerous cross in the 66th . hull had more than a few opportunities to equalize in the final 10 minutes . danny graham 's tame header went straight to de gea , the spaniard 's poor punch led to panic and following valencia 's second yellow for kicking the ball away in the 90th minute , de gea stopped chester with his legs .", "summary": " manchester united beats hull 3-2 for a fifth straight win in all competitions .   united trailed 2-0 within 13 minutes before wayne rooney sparks a comeback .   rooney sets up one goal , scores another and played a part in united 's winner .   it was only the second home defeat of the season for steve bruce 's hull .
