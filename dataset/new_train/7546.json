' where it went wrong : this sign shows that the banks should have turned left for their ferry , but instead went straight on . bob and pat were allowed to straight on and off in cornwall and then taken back to plymouth where they were let off first . a good samaritan driver then volunteered to guide them the right ferry which they boarded just in time for their 20-hour overnight crossing . bob added : ` we 'll be forever grateful for the kindness shown by a gentleman in the adjacent queue who we happened to speak to . ' i told him of our hopeless situation and he at once asked if we knew our way to the ferry . ` he said that if we waited for him once we were off then he would lead us there . ` we arrived by the skin of our teeth and were the last car to board . ` our good samaritan just turned around and waved to us , not waiting for any thanks for what seemed like a miracle to us .
