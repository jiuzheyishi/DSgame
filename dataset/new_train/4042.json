{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- thailand could soon recognize a third gender category for the first time in the country 's constitution .  it is a human right if you were born a male or female and you want to have a sex change or lead a life of a different gender ,  said kamnoon sittisamarn , the spokesperson of constitution drafting committee , which is working on a new draft of the country 's constitution .  people should have -lsb- that -rsb- freedom to change sex and they should be equally protected by the constitution and the law and treated fairly .  third gender means that an individual does not have to identify as either male or female , and gives their right to self-identify . if enacted , thailand would join several asian countries , including india , pakistan and nepal , that have recently moved to recognize third gender . this week , the constitution drafting committee , a panel tapped by the current thai military junta , started work on a new draft . the junta , which calls itself the national council for peace and order , took power in may after a military coup . the old constitution recognizes people of different religion , age , gender -- but had not extended to transgender people .  it is now time to recognize the existence of the third gender in thai society ,  said sittisamarn .  so we expand the region of protection as well .   hopefully introducing third gender will help reduce discrimination in society .  the constitution drafting committee is expected to consider various components of thai law and submit it to review by april . the decision to legalize the constitution will be made on august 6 . acceptance in thailand . there 's a perception that transgender people are well accepted in thailand , due to the availability of gender reassignment surgery . but challenges still exist , several transgender people living in bangkok told cnn .  first of all in thailand , we 're pretty well-accepted , we can walk in the street and we do n't have to fear that someone 's going to shoot you in the head . at the same time , the most difficult thing is at a professional level , that people do n't accept people like us ,  said jenisa limpanilchart , a businessperson . it 's difficult for transgender people , despite their education level , to get hired and accepted by companies , she added . and matters like which locker room or bathroom to use become a human resources issue . and there is no legal recourse when discrimination occurs , because there have been no laws to protect them , said kath khangpiboon , a transgender activist with the thai transgender alliance in bangkok . another problem is that the gender marked on government documents does n't match how individuals identify their gender . when khangpiboon travels , she gets pulled out of immigration lines for questioning by officials because of the gender marked on her passport .  for trans people , we can not change our title name . i 'm still a ` mister ' in my country . i can not change my title . my name is mr. kath ,  said khangpiboon , a transgender woman . while recognizing the third gender would not resolve all the challenges , it would be  history  for our advocacy work , she added . more nations recognize third gender . earlier last year , india 's supreme court granted the country 's transsexual and transgender individuals the right to self-identify their gender . asian countries including nepal , pakistan and bangladesh have implemented policies recognizing third gender in recent years . australia started allowing a third gender option in passports in 2011 . according to a 2012 report by the global commission on hiv and the law , 20 countries have passed progressive legislation on the issue , including argentina , uruguay , and portugal . even as transgender people are no longer forced to conform to specific genders in certain countries , they are still denied acceptance in many societies . same-sex marriage remains illegal in countries like pakistan , sri lanka , bangladesh and bhutan . and thailand does not have plans to legalize same sex marriages in its constitution , said sittisamarn .", "summary": " thailand constitution looks to recognize third gender .   people have right to change sex and be protected by thai constitution , says spokesman .
