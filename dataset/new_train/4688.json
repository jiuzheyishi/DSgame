{"text": "english football fans have been warned they face criminal prosecution if they continue to chant a word which has been deemed anti-semitic . the english football association -lrb- fa -rrb- have told fans to stop using the word  yid  , a term which at different times throughout history has been used by jews and also to abuse them . tottenham hotspur , a north london-based club , are known for having a large number of jewish supporters . a section of spurs fans have attempting to reclaim the  y word  by referring to themselves as the  yid army  and chanting it at matches . but the fa has warned that such practices are no longer acceptable as it continues its fight against discrimination in the english game .  we are committed to tackling discrimination in all its forms and that includes anti-semitic behavior in football ,  fa general secretary alex horne said in a statement .  the y-word has no place in our game and its use in stadiums can result in a football banning order . we are determined that everyone can enjoy football in a fan friendly and safe environment .  the fa also stated that , while it understands the motives of fans attempting to reclaim an offensive term , it still deems the word a discriminatory slur .  the fa appreciates that language is a complex issue : the use and meaning of words is constantly evolving ,  read a statement .  this means that , over time , sometimes neutral words or phrases can come to be understood as offensive ; and , similarly , words or phrases previously considered as offensive can become more acceptable .  although the term derives from the yiddish word for a jew , its use in the english language has been , both historically and in contemporary use , derogatory and offensive .  it is noted that many minority communities have sought to reclaim historic terms of abuse such as this as a means of empowerment . the process of empowerment through reclaiming language is complex and can often divide opinion within the same community .  in light of the historic and contemporary use of the term , the fa considers that the use of the term ` yid ' is likely to be considered offensive by the reasonable observer .  speaking on behalf of maccabi gb , a british charity aimed at promoting jewish participation in sports , dave rich declared the word does not have a place in modern language due to its associations with fascist views of oswald mosley , a politician during the early decades of the 20th century .  the y-word causes offense to many people , jewish and non-jewish , however it is intended ,  said rich .  its historic association with mosley 's fascists and continued use by antisemites outside football mean that it has no place in football grounds or anywhere else .  raymond simonson , chief executive of the jewish community center in london , says he has no problem with fellow tottenham fans using the word , although he can not bring himself to say it out loud . he told cnn world sport :  i 've had that word spat at me in the street , had the word scrawled over my exercise book at school and been held up by the scruff of my neck and had that word shouted at me .  that word has a lot of meaning for me and it 's the reason i ca n't say the word .  the problems with words which have racist connotations is that it 's about context .  when i go to football matches and i have to listen to fans , a minority mind you , hissing to make the sounds of the gas chambers , i do n't believe anybody can tell me the reason they do it is because some spurs fans are singing a song about jermain defoe which rhymes with the  y  word .  tottenham explained how the uses of the term by their fans was a  defense mechanism  rather than a deliberate attempt to insult the jewish community .  last season saw a number of incidents where fans were targeted by allegedly far-right activists on the continent and subjected to anti-semitic abuse by opposition fans ,  said a club spokesman .  subsequently , the debate on this issue has two key considerations .  firstly , whether or not its use now plays a role in deflecting or attracting unjustified abuse , abuse that is inexcusable on any grounds ; and secondly , whether it is liable to cause offense to others even if unintentionally . our fans have themselves engaged in this debate following the events of last season .  we recognize that this is a complex debate and that , in the interests of encouraging a positive and safe environment for all supporters , consideration should be given to the appropriateness and suitability of its continued use .  we are already in the process of engaging with our fans and shall be consulting more widely in due course .  but peter herbert , chairman of the society of black lawyers , believes tottenham supporters must take more responsibility in tackling the issue .  we 're not blaming spurs fans ,  he told cnn world sport .  but they have to take responsibility . those same fans would not dare use that word on a saturday afternoon outside the ground . you can not have an area of london which is ring fenced for racism or anti-semitism .  in recent years , the fa has shown its sensitivity to the concerns of the english football 's jewish community . the england national team paid a visit to the world war ii concentration camp auschwitz i in berkanau ahead of the euro 2012 tournament in poland and ukraine last year . in october , england manager roy hodgson will open the  four four jew  exhibition at the jewish museum london . the exhibition celebrates the jewish community 's contribution to british football .", "summary": " english football fans could face criminal charges for using an offensive term .   the football association is warned fans not to use the term  yid    the word has been used by jews and to insult them throughout history .   english premier league club tottenham hotspur has a large jewish fan base .
