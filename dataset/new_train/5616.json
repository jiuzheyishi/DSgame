{"text": "nick clegg will appear on lbc 97.3 every thursday morning , in an attempt to find out what people are thinking . nick clegg is to host a weekly radio phone-in an extraordinary attempt to win over voters as lib dem strategists warn they have a year to turn the party 's poll ratings around . in an unprecedented move for a party leader , the deputy prime minister is to take calls from listeners every thursday to find out what ` people are thinking ' . named ` call clegg ' the weekly show is a massive gamble and could see the lib dem boss berated for every government gaffe and unpopular policy in the news . tory mps branded the show ` bizarre ' and claimed he would spend more time answering questions on the radio than from mps in the commons . it comes as mr clegg has been put on notice that he only has until the end of 2013 to rescue dozens of his mps from wipeout . the bizarre move to swap the despatch box for the dj 's studio also risked over-shadowing the coalition 's mid-term review , which is supposed to present a united front with the conservatives . mr clegg , who celebrates his 46th birthday today , staged a joint press conference with david cameron yesterday afternoon , setting out a raft of new policies to be implemented before the 2015 election . but the decision to announce that he will be putting himself at the mercy of radio listeners will be seen as an attempt to distance himself from the coalition . mr clegg , who has seen his party over-taken in the polls by the uk independence party , hopes to turn his ratings around by appearing on london 's lbc 97.3 radio station every thursday morning . aides say he is ` comfortable with the format ' which will see him spend half an hour every week answering calls , texts and emails . it means he will spend two hours-a-month responding to questions on the radio , three times the 40 minutes he spends dealing with oral questions at the despatch box as deputy prime minister . call clegg will be hosted by lbc presenter nick ferrari , who hols regular phone-ins with london mayor boris johnson . tory mp ian liddel-grainger said : . ` having sat and listened to him at deputy pm 's questions , he has never . answered a question yet so he is n't likely to break the habit of a . lifetime on the radio . ` why . does n't he just get on with the job ? he is completely invisible anyway , . so it 's a good job it 's on the radio not the television because viewers . would n't be able to see him . ' tory mp peter bone said the idea of the call clegg show was ` bizarre ' . ` the public will get more chance to . question him than mps . i would have thought he should be spending his . time as deputy prime minister supporting the prime minister in his . activities . ` i am quite amazed that he has got enough time to go off and do a radio programme every thursday . ' nick clegg is not the first politician to use tv and radio shows to broaden his appeal , but not all have been successful . tory mp nadine dorries entered the i 'm a celebrity jungle in november , claiming she was going where the voters are and would highlight important policies like lowering the abortion limit . instead she was seen eating camel toe and was the first star to be kicked off the show in a public vote . ken clarke , the former tory chancellor who joined the coalition cabinet , hosted nine series of his radio 4 series jazz greats . vince cable , the lib dem business secretary , scored an impressive 36-40 when he appeared on the christmas special of strictly come dancing in 2010 . lib dem mp adrian sanders moonlights as a rock dj on community station riviera fm in his torbay constituency . but he risked controversy when he claimed rock giants muse were not the best bad to emerge from the bay , preferring instead 70s act wishbone ash . transport minister norman baker hosts anything goes on seahaven fm , promising ` an eclectic mix of jazz , blues , swing , country and a lot more besides , from the 1920s to the present day , with the emphasis on the laid back ' . the lib dem admits his records ` are a little bit offbeat ' . respect mp george galloway did little to improve the reputation of politicians when he entered the celebrity big brother house in 2006 , donning a red cat suit to purr and lick milk from the hand of actress rula lenska . he later hosted a show on talksport for six years until 2012 . mr clegg will be co-hosting with lbc . presenter nick ferrari , following in the footsteps of london mayor boris . johnson who also takes part in regular phone-ins on the station . ` i 'm doing this because i do n't think politicians get to hear enough from people directly , ' mr clegg said . ` you ca n't do the right thing in government unless you keep in touch with how people are thinking and feeling . ` nick . ferrari is known as the interviewer that all politicians fear . he can . be very tough but he 's generally fair , very well informed and i hope . we 'll make a good combination for the show we 're doing together . ' but labour mp john mann said : ` it . shows how irrelevant he is to the running of the country . my question to . ask nick is : what 's the point of nick clegg ? is he kilroy in disguise ? ' in a mail on sunday opinion poll . yesterday the lib dems were on 11 per cent , well behind ukip which has . surged to 16 per cent on the back of rising dissatisfaction with the . government 's stance on europe . lib dems have repeatedly stressed that the five-year parliament gives them chance to reverse their woeful ratings . however , senior party figures now admit that without a major change in fortunes in the next 12 months , mr clegg could be in trouble . ` we have kept saying we have got . plenty of time but we 've really got to see things turning around this . year , ' a senior lib dem source told mailonline . ` if we get to the end of 2013 and the polls are still bad for nick , we will be in trouble . ' lib dem insiders say they hope the clips of mr clegg 's show will be used across the global radio network , which owns lbc as well as stations like heart and classic fm . mr clegg 's latest attempt to reach out to voters comes after his youtube video apology for promising to vote against tuition fees was remixed , ridiculed and released as a single , reaching 143 in the charts . by putting himself at the mercy of angry voters every week , mr clegg 's attempt to connect with voters could backfire . ` it wo n't be faultless every week , ' an advisor said . ` that 's the risk of doing live radio . ' richard park , global radio 's director of broadcasting , said : ` once again , lbc 97.3 delivers a first , as we welcome the deputy prime minister to london 's biggest conversation . ` no other station offers its listeners such unique access to a senior member of government . this will be must-listen radio . ' the show , for which mr clegg is not being paid , starts this thursday from 9am . the decision may go down badly with mr clegg 's constituents in sheffield hallam , where he has been mp since 2005 . local liberal democrats blamed him for losing control of the city council to labour last year . paul blomfield , labour mp for sheffield central said : ` that is extraordinary . i think that his constituents in sheffield are right to ask why he 's chosen to engage in a conversation with london voters , on a regional programme every week , instead of the people of the city he purports to represent . ` is he too unnerved by what he knows he would hear from sheffield voters ? ` also i would have thought that at a time when working families are facing rising costs , and tightening budgets , he ought to be concentrating on his day job of running the country instead of doing a talk show with london radio listeners . ' david laws , lib dem education minister and a key ally of mr clegg , insisted that despite wofeul poll ratings and local election results , the party 's remaining supporters are ` realistic ' about the need for difficult decisions . ` lib dems , like everybody else , can count . they can count that when we came to power we had a deficit of # 160 thousand million pounds , ' he told bbc radio 4 's today programme . ` our supporters are realistic about this . they know there are tough times . they do not believe that every decision made by the government in these circumstances can be an easy and popular one . ` we are still united as a party in believing that we need to be in coalition to deliver for the country , put our policies into practice , and also because the electorate in may 2010 did not give a majority to any one party . ' mr cameron and mr clegg today sought to prevent the break-up of the coalition for another two and a half years , unveiling a raft of new ideas to last them until 2015 . making a rare joint appearance in downing street , the tory and lib dem leaders dismissed calls from their backbenchers for an early ` divorce ' to insist their commitment to the power-sharing deal was ` unwavering ' . launching the 52-page mid-term review , the two men hailed their progress in tackling the vast debts inherited from the labour party and pledged action on cutting childcare costs , increasing the state pension and investing in new roads , rail links and affordable homes .", "summary": " lib dem leader to appear on lbc 97.3 every thursday .   deputy pm says he wants to know ` what people are thinking '   party strategists warn he must improve poll ratings before the end of 2013 .   half-hour radio show means he will spend three times as long on radio than at the despatch box answering questions each month .   tories condemn ` bizarre ' move when he should be supporting the pm .
