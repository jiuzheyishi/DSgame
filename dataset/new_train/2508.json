{"text": "he spends most of his time playing golf courses all over the world , but sergio garcia 's thoughts are never too far away from what 's happening on a football pitch much closer to home . for the past seven years , garcia has been president and part-time player at cf borriol , his hometown club in the province of castellon on spain 's east coast .  it 's good fun and whenever i 'm around i get to practice with them a little bit and play a little bit here and there . this season , i 've played probably five games , so not a lot , but i enjoy it ,  garcia told cnn 's living golf show .  as any good spaniard will tell you , we love football . sport in general in spain has been great for the last 10 years or so , but football has been great with the euro cups -lrb- wins in 2008 & 2012 -rrb- and the world cup -lrb- in 2010 -rrb- .  the 33-year-old is a long-term supporter of real madrid , but his domestic allegiances have always been divided between the bernabeu and borriol 's more modest 1,000-seater stadium , where his attachment is not only emotional but financial . garcia 's business involvement with borriol began in 2003 , explains club vice-president , pedro fernandez , when one of his friends persuaded him to help out . three years later , garcia was installed as club president of the club , which plays in group six of spain 's third division and now has more than 150 members .  we put together a working group headed by sergio , as president , his brother victor and other friends . we make all the management decisions as it relates to the team ,  said fernandez .  sergio has done a tremendous job in the past seven years to create a football academy for borriol 's young boys and girls .  cf borriol 's goal is to expand the academy and hopefully promote players from the junior teams to the first team .  spain 's dominance of international football and barcelona 's european champions league success in recent years has been attributed to strong grassroots support for the game . borriol captain raul caballero says garcia 's assistance has been key to the club 's prosperity .  it is very exciting and refreshing to see sergio and his team support and work for the team . it is just a group of friends who love football and they have a common goal to see the team succeed ,  caballero said .  the team would not be here if it was not for sergio 's involvement , so hopefully he will be around for a long time to support the club and the village .  garcia made his playing debut for cf borriol in september 2010 . swapping golf shoes for football boots is something he does whenever his schedule permits , as it helps him to relax .  playing football is not as much pressure because you do n't have that much time to think ... everything is quicker , faster and you are moving all the time ,  said garcia .  i have always enjoyed being part of a team and sharing things with your teammates .  garcia will be looking to rejoin his golfing teammates at next year 's ryder cup in gleneagles , scotland where , if selected , he will make a seventh appearance for europe in the biennial match against the u.s. for now , garcia will be reflecting on mixed fortunes in 2013 . the season was largely overshadowed by the public spat with tiger woods at the players championship in may -- a precursor to some unsavory comments about the world no. 1 during a private dinner at wentworth later that month for which he subsequently apologized . but at least the spaniard has ended the season on a high , lifting his first trophy of the year with a win at the thailand golf championship earlier this month -- a result that took garcia back into the world 's top 10 . as golfers around the world take a break for christmas , garcia will be keen to recharge his golfing batteries in the way he knows best -- indulging his other sporting passions .  i 've always said i could n't just do golf by itself ,  he said .  i would probably get tired of it quickly . i obviously play football , tennis , paddle tennis and i love watching formula one on tv and obviously watching football too .  i love my sports and try to keep as busy as i can with them .  read more : garcia reflects on ` horrible ' tiger slur . read more : crazy golf : waterfalls , wooden heads , a 50-foot volcano .", "summary": " golfer sergio garcia is president of his hometown football club .   world no. 10 has helped cf borriol to nurture young talent with academy .   garcia occasionally plays for the spanish third division team .
