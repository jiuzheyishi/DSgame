{"text": "when perfect dark zero graced the xbox 360 , it served as a stunning showpiece of the console 's power . entertaining it was not . the same can be said for dead rising 3 . indeed , when you 're first treated to hundreds of the undead roaming the streets of los perdidos , california , it 's a wonderful glimpse inside the xbox one 's graphical potential . sadly , within 30 minutes , boring , repetitive mission structure sets in and undoes all the hard work . view to a kill : make too much noise and you 'll quickly be surrounded by hordes of the undead . set 10 years after the events of dead rising 2 , you play nick ramos , who has to escape the city before the army levels it with airstrikes . basic plot , yes -- but in similar vein to the other games , dead rising 3 tries to make the battle for survival as entertaining as possible . a large part of this revolves around the combat . los perdidos is littered with potential weapons -- from plant pots and hairdryers , to more damaging kitanas , baseball bats , guns and machetes . but it 's the ability to create and combine weapons that hold the most intrigue , the best of which involves splicing a motorcycle engine with some boxing gloves . vehicles , too , can be modified . full steam ahead : the rollerhawg -lrb- above -rrb- is easily the best combination vehicle in the game . strewn around the city , usable cars , bikes and lorries are indicated by flashing lights . in their ` naked ' form , they 're easily damaged -- with several zombies hanging on to your bumper and bonnet within seconds of starting the engine . but when spliced with other vehicles , they become different beasts all together . the rollerhawg is perhaps the best example -- a mix of motorbike and a steamroller , mounted with flamethrowers and capable of mowing down undead hordes within seconds . there are also plenty of costumes around -- ranging from sports wear , full-on mascot outfits and more casual offerings . dead rising 3 tries so hard to please , but sadly the gimmicks ca n't hide the paper-thin gameplay . mission structure too often involves running from one place to another , bashing some baddies or finding some item of interest , before returning . psycho : this fellow is one of the game 's early , human bosses - yet he takes hundreds of bullets to bring down . backtracking is a soul-destroying affair , and it plagues dead rising 3 . boss battles , too -- although the foes remain as varied as ever -- are not particularly enjoyable . often involving human foes rather than the undead , it 's ironic and absurd when watching a boss take 100s of bullets to the face , only to watch them shake it off and carry on . it just jars with the rest of the game ... driving too , is n't as fun as it could be . although there 's a variety of sports cars and motorbikes , the inclusion of these high-performance vehicles is odd , as - given how cramped the roads are -- you 'll never come close to their top speed . crash landing : the city may be large in scale , but roads are cramped and cumbersome to meander . the driving sections also highlight a more sinister problem ... slowdown . as impressive the hordes of zombies are , the console does struggle when things get hectic -lrb- and this happens a lot -rrb- . textures will pop up , items will float in the air for no reason . these are problems expected of a launch title , but are nevertheless slightly disheartening . still , it 's a solid entry into the series , even though it 's largely a case of style over substance . dead rising 3 is an xbox one exclusive . it is released on friday . follow us on twitter : @dailymailgames and on facebook : daily mail games .", "summary": " staggering number of zombies on-screen shows off the xbox one 's power .   hundreds of weapons and vehicles to use , plus plenty of customisation .   gameplay wears thin after a while - especially mission structure .   boring lead character and script .   boss battles grate .
