{"text": "montevideo , uruguay the passage of a landmark marijuana legalization measure tuesday means uruguay is set to become the first country in the world to have a system regulating legal production , sale and consumption of the drug . it 's practically a done deal . president jose mujica has to sign the bill before it becomes a law . but he 's long backed the measure , and there 's little doubt that he remains behind it . applause and cheers rang out in uruguay 's senate on tuesday after the high-profile vote at the end of a lengthy debate on the bill . the measure passed uruguay 's lower house in july . supporters of the proposal have said it marks a turning point and could inspire other latin american nations to take a similar approach . it places the south american country at the vanguard of liberal drug policies , surpassing even the netherlands , where recreational drugs are illegal but a policy of tolerance is in place .  it is understood that a regulation-based policy has positive consequences for health and public security , given that , on the one hand , it can produce better results when it comes to education , prevention , information , treatment and rehabilitation in relation to the problematic uses of drugs ,  said sen. roberto conde of uruguay 's broad front coalition , which supported the measure .  on the other hand , it helps fight drug trafficking , which fuels organized crime and criminal activities that affect the security of the population .  critics said legalizing marijuana could have dangerous consequences .  this bill , which proposes an experiment in social engineering , as it was described in the public health commission , does not comply with any of the ethical safeguards of experimentation with human beings ,  said sen. alfredo solari of the colorado party .  those safeguards are extremely important ... given that we 're talking about marijuana , a substance that harms human beings .  a letter sent by mujica 's government to lawmakers last year presented the bill . he told cnn en espaÃ ± ol last year that he supported legalizing marijuana .  if we legalize it , we think that we will spoil the market -lrb- for drug traffickers -rrb- because we are going to sell it for cheaper than it is sold on the black market ,  he said .  and we are going to have people identified .  conservative critics of the measure have said it promotes drug addiction and have suggested that mujica 's comments were uninformed . details still in the works . the proposed law would allow individuals to grow up to six plants of marijuana and possess as many as 480 grams for personal use . marijuana clubs of anywhere from 15 to 45 members would also be allowed and granted permission to grow up to 99 plants at a time . users would have to register , and those claiming to use cannabis for medical reasons would have to show a doctor 's prescription . marijuana would also be sold at licensed pharmacies . once the bill becomes law , there will be a 120-day period to give the government time to adopt regulations and implement it . consumption of marijuana has been legal uruguay , but its production and sale are not .  we seek to eliminate that incongruence ,  the country 's top drug official , julio calzada , told cnn earlier this year . the same debates about marijuana that exist in the united states -- about medicinal properties , recreational use , the impact on the justice system -- have been happening in uruguay for a long time , calzada said . the decision to push legislation to overhaul its drug policies did not come overnight .  we have reflected on our problems ,  calzada said , and the government felt that uruguay 's tradition of tolerance and equality merited action on the marijuana issue . widespread debate . but many in the traditionally catholic country of 3.3 million people feel supporters are espousing the wrong policy for the wrong reasons . in a july poll from cifra/gonzalez , raga and associates , 63 % of uruguayan respondents said they disagreed with the bill . only 26 % said they approved of the measure in the poll , which surveyed more than 1,000 uruguayans and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points . opponent solari says making marijuana widely available has the potential to create even higher levels of addiction .  it 's a very bad piece of legislation , mainly because it increases the availability of marijuana in the market ,  he said . backers of the bill say the legislation addresses some of the concerns expressed by the opposition . for one , violators of the law would face sentences of 20 months to 10 years in prison . those younger than 18 would not be allowed to use marijuana under any circumstances . the legislation also calls for mandatory classes in public schools aimed at drug prevention and bans the advertising of cannabis in any form . video : seattle marks one year of legalized marijuana .
