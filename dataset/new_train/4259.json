{"text": "ukraine 's president announced progress on a ceasefire agreement wednesday with russia , but u.s. president barack obama greeted it with skepticism and moscow downplayed it . obama , speaking in estonia ahead of a nato summit in wales , said he was aware of the reported deal , as conflicting accounts emerged from russia and ukraine . but he said it was too early to see if all sides would follow through . any ceasefire effort has not worked up to now , he said ,  either because russia has not supported it or pretended it is not controlling the separatists  in eastern ukraine .  having said that , if in fact russia is prepared to stop financing , arming , training and in many cases joining with russian troops ' activities in ukraine , and is serious about a political settlement , that is something that we all hope for ,  obama said . meanwhile , france , a member of nato , wo n't be delivering the first warship it is due to deliver russia as part of a 2011 contract , the office of french president francois hollande said .  the president of the republic has noted that , despite the prospect of a ceasefire that remains to be confirmed and implemented , the conditions for france to authorize the delivery of the first -lrb- warship -rrb- are not authorized ,  the statement said . since mid-april , ukrainian forces have been battling pro-russian rebels in eastern ukraine . kiev and the west say the rebels are supported by moscow -- a claim moscow denies . ukrainian president petro poroshenko 's office initially said he and russian president vladimir putin had agreed to  a full ceasefire  following a phone call , but subsequently indicated they had agreed on a process that could lead to a truce .  the conversation resulted in an agreement on ceasefire regime in the donbas -lrb- eastern ukraine region -rrb- ,  said the statement from the presidential press office .  the parties reached mutual understanding on the steps that will facilitate the establishment of peace .  earlier , putin spokesman dmitry peskov told cnn there was  no confirmation of a ceasefire because putin can not agree -lrb- to -rrb- a ceasefire because he is not party to the conflict .  what was agreed were steps that would lead to a ceasefire . the important thing is to bring an end to the bloodshed and to stop the firing . everyone is trying to de-escalate the conflict .  peskov also said the longer term issue of constitutional reform in ukraine was not discussed . however , the spokesman told russian state news agency itar-tass that putin 's view on possible ways out of the crisis  largely coincides  with that of poroshenko . putin 's roadmap . russia 's president presented his roadmap for a ceasefire to journalists wednesday , the state-run ria novosti news agency reported . setting out his seven-point plan , putin said both parties in the conflict must negotiate immediately and stop  any offensive military operations by the army , armed forces and self-defense groups of the southeast of ukraine towards donetsk and luhansk .  russia routinely refers to the rebels as self-defense forces . putin called for ukrainian troops to pull back to a distance that would mean they ca n't fire shells on communities . he also urged an end to the use of military aircraft against civilians and an exchange of all hostages . the russian president said the sides should  provide full and objective international control over the conditions for the ceasefire and monitoring of the situation .  humanitarian corridors also should be opened to permit delivery of aid to communities in donetsk and luhansk , he added , and workers should get access so they can rebuild cities ' infrastructure . ukrainian prime minister arseniy yatsenyuk dismissed putin 's roadmap as looking like a  rescue plan  for the rebels , and said russia could not be trusted to stick to any agreement .  this plan is yet another attempt to trick the international community on the eve of nato summit and avoid the eu decision of the next level of sanctions against russia ,  he said , according to the cabinet 's press office .  putin 's real plan is to destroy ukraine and renew the ussr .  obama flies to europe with a warning for putin . rebels question ceasefire . a rebel spokesman in eastern ukraine expressed doubt a ceasefire could hold and demanded federal troops withdraw from the region , according to ria novosti . an aide to another rebel leader , the dpr 's first deputy prime minister andrei purgin , told the news agency that poroshenko 's ceasefire move was unilateral and was  impractical  while there were still ukrainian forces in the disputed region .  this is some sort of a game by kiev . this was completely unexpected . this decision was made without us ,  purgin 's aide quoted him as saying , according to the news agency . putin has consistently argued that russia has no say over ending the conflict because it is not involved in it on the ground . u.s. and nato officials say that in recent days russia has sent its own troops and heavy weaponry into ukraine , as well as training and arming the rebels . obama vows support . obama , giving a speech in tallinn , estonia , ahead of a nato summit this week , said a vision of a europe dedicated to peace and freedom is  threatened by russia 's aggression against ukraine .  it challenges the most basic principles of the international system : that no border can be redrawn at the barrel of a gun , obama said . he vowed nato will always come to the defense of its member states , including the baltic nations .  we will defend our nato allies , and that means every ally ,  he said , including estonia . ukraine is not part of nato , but the alliance has said it will support kiev in the face of what it says is russian aggression . defense secretary chuck hagel defended the u.s. response to the ukraine conflict and dismissed any criticism that the diplomatic efforts have failed to de-escalate the tension . hagel blamed putin for fueling the ukraine crisis . the russian president  continues to take very dangerous escalatory actions ,  hagel told cnn . the continued escalation by putin would bring further consequences , but hagel added that  we 're not going to get into a military engagement , a war , over this with russia .  on the battlefield . traces of warfare remained starkly evident in eastern ukraine near the town of illovaisk . one road was a graveyard for burned-out military vehicles stretching for 1.5 miles : tanks , trucks , armored personnel vehicles . there was even a surface-to-surface missile laying on the side of the road . shallow graves were dug a distance from the roadway , and an odor of decomposition permeated the air . cnn 's diana magnay found a russian military food box labeled  army of russia ,  an apparent indication that russia has some involvement in the conflict , though moscow vehemently denies it . apparel belonging to the ukrainian national guard was also found among battlefield debris , but it was unclear wednesday what happened in the recent fire fight between pro-russian separatists and ukrainian forces . military exercises . ukraine 's national security and defense council announced wednesday that ukraine would host multinational exercises later this month with the united states , nato and other nations . it said 200 american soldiers are expected to take part in the exercise , alongside about 1,000 servicemen from ukraine , azerbaijan , britain , canada , georgia , germany , latvia , lithuania , moldova , norway , poland , romania and spain . earlier , speaking alongside the estonian president , obama announced that additional u.s. personnel and aircraft are being rotated through the baltics as part of nato operations . obama 's trip to estonia , before he heads to the nato summit in wales , is meant to reassure nervous eastern europe that putin 's support for separatists in ukraine does n't mean he has a free pass for territorial gains elsewhere . the united states and european union have agreed that additional economic sanctions are needed to curb russia 's actions in ukraine .  the sanctions that we 've applied so far have had a real effect on russia , and i think it 's important for us to continue to impose costs on russia , so long as it is violating basic principles of international law ,  said obama . european nations will consider proposals for  significant further steps  against russia on wednesday afternoon , an eu statement said . the proposed sanctions regard  access to capital markets , defense , dual use goods , and sensitive technologies ,  the statement added .", "summary": " putin may face consequences but u.s. wo n't go to  war  with russia , hagel says .   vladimir putin presents a series of steps he says would restore peace to ukraine .   obama says a peaceful europe  is threatened by russia 's aggression against ukraine    putin spokesman says russia ca n't agree to a ceasefire because it 's not party in conflict .
