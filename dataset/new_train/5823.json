' he said the calculation of the rpi index is ` fatally flawed ' . rpi was introduced in 1947 and uses a way of working out average prices known as the carli method . every country , including america , which used to adopt this method has scrapped it , apart from britain . rpij will begin to be published in march and uses the alternative jevons ' method from which the j in the index title is derived . the method is named after english economist william stanley jevons who died in 1882 and proposed a different way of calculating indexes . but rpi will continue to be used for the interest on national savings and investments ' index-linked savings certificates in which some 905,000 savers have more than # 25billion invested . jil matheson , the national statistician , yesterday admitted that rpi ` does not meet international standards ' and that ` rpij uses a better method ' . but the treasury said yesterday it will continue to use rpi for index-linked gilts , although sajid javid , economic secretary to the treasury , hinted that this policy might change in the future . pensioners should welcome this brave decision . alex brummer , analysis . among those who will be regretting the ons determination to stick with the old formulation will be the chancellor george osborne . it is a long time since a decision against change had such a big impact on all our lives . a brave ruling by the national statistician jil matheson to leave the formula for the calculation of the retail prices index -lrb- rpi -rrb- unchanged has been given an enthusiastic welcome by financial markets and pensioner groups . it had been feared that matheson would cave in to political pressure for a new modern approach to rpi that would have lowered the measure of inflation , the level of annual increases to state pensions and therefore the bill to the exchequer . but when it turned out the opposite was the case , the price of british government stocks or gilts , which offer returns linked to inflation , climbed sharply and people dependent on state pensions or in company schemes also required to uprate each year by the retail prices index , can breathe much easier . if the office for national statistics had chosen to replace rpi with something based on a more modern statistical formula then the annual increase in these pensions could have been cut by as much as 0.9 per cent a year . by holding the line on rpi , at a time when faith in pensions and the savings culture has been undermined by constant tax changes and government interference , matheson has struck a rare blow for stability and the independence of the statistical service . a change in the retail prices index at present might have destroyed the nation 's faith in savings.this does not mean that the ons ruling will be regarded as an unalloyed success for everyone . one consequence is that utility and rail prices , that are currently set on the basis of a formula based on the retail prices index , will increase more speedily than would otherwise be the case . paradoxically , some elderly people could be particularly affected by this in that fuel bills tend to eat up such a large proportion of their disposable income . he ons has , however , built itself an escape route . it plans to create a new measure of retail prices , rpij , that includes the same items as in the current retail prices index , but is calculated using a different mathematical formula . this will be published alongside the old rpi and , if divergence is significant over several years , the pressure for a new approach may become too much to withstand . among those who will be regretting the ons determination to stick with the old formulation will be the chancellor george osborne . a change to a less generous measure of inflation would have saved the government an estimated # 3billion a year in the interest it pays on index-linked gilts and other products . another group likely to be dissatisfied are companies locked into supporting final salary pension schemes that are adjusted upwards by rpi each year . at a time when the government is constantly changing inflation adjustments , for everything from benefits payments to pensions and wages in the public sector , the chief statistician has seen off the governor of the bank of england sir mervyn king , the politicians and some of the experts .", "summary": " pensioners and savers will see the benefits after the office for national statistics not to scrap a key measure of inflation .   it will continue to produce the retail prices index method of calculating inflation even though it is inaccurate .   many .   pensioners have annuities linked to rpi - scrapping it could have cut # 10,000 off a pension over 20 years .
