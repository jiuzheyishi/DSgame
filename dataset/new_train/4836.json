{"text": "tour bus driver rasoul mousavi has been seeing less and less of his wife this month . mousavi says a sharp increase in tourists has kept him so busy that for four nights in a row he did something his wife does n't like very much -- he showed up late for dinner .  my wife is n't very happy but during the past few years , i 've rarely seen it this busy ,  mousavi said .  thank god it 's getting better . we 're getting more tourists .  mousavi 's heavy workload comes amid a push by iran 's new president hassan rouhani to attract more foreign travelers to iran , home to some of the world 's oldest civilizations and historical sites that date back several thousand years . iranian officials have announced plans to ease visa requirements for most foreign visitors within the next several months . according to state media , once the new visa guidelines are in place , tourists from most countries will be able to pick up their visas on arrival , with the exception of travelers from at least ten countries -- including the u.s. and the uk . iran used to be a top destination in the region , but the 1979 iranian revolution delivered a huge blow to the tourism industry . the number of tourists dropped sharply , due in large part to iran 's political and economic isolation and warnings by western governments that iran was a rogue and dangerous nation led by a radical regime . president rouhani is clearly looking to leave a more positive impression on the international community with a campaign to solve iran 's nuclear dispute and improve relations with the west . according to the iranian cultural heritage , tourism , and handicrafts organization , iran attracted roughly four million tourists last year and generated about $ 8 billion in revenue . tourism officials predict less restrictive visa guidelines and rouhani 's policy of moderation will help those numbers increase significantly .  the number of tourists has been increasing day by day and we 're feeling the increase ,  says mohammad eslami , a tour guide for the tehran-based azadi international tourism organization . on a typical day in tehran it 's not hard to find tour buses filled with tourists weaving through the capital 's historic neighborhoods .  people are amazingly warm and generous here . it 's been a wonderful ,  says ryan hendricks , who is visiting iran with his wife and daughter from the netherlands .  what we see of iran on tv news is not true ,  says finnish tourist janna kauppinn .  this is a country full of history with wonderful people and amazing food .  the apparent comeback in iran 's tourism industry could mean more late nights for mousavi . but the tour bus driver says that as long as tourists keep coming and helping the economy and leaving with fond memories , that 's perfectly fine with him and his wife .  i really shed tears of joy because they come here and see iran , and they leave with pride ,  he says .", "summary": " long-isolated iran to ease visa requirements amid tourism boom .   iran 's new president rouhani has struck a moderate tone with west since taking office .   tourism workers in iran say numbers of visitors  increasing day by day  "}
