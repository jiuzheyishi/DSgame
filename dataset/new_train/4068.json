{"text": "the senate voted wednesday to avert at least one chronic washington political crisis for more than a year . with a snowstorm bearing down on the capital , it approved a house-passed measure that allows the government to borrow more money to pay its bills through march 2015 . president barack obama signaled that he would sign the legislation , so the senate vote was the last hurdle to resolving the debt ceiling issue until after the november congressional elections .  i 'm pleased that republicans and democrats in congress have come together to pay for what they 've already spent , and remove the threat of default from our economy once and for all ,  obama said in a statement , adding that he hoped  this puts an end to politics by brinkmanship .  wednesday 's result was a blow to tea party conservatives who oppose any kind of increase in federal borrowing . filibuster denied . sen. ted cruz of texas , a leader of the gop tea party wing , mounted a filibuster attempt to force a 60-vote threshold for proceeding on the debt ceiling measure . however , a dozen republicans , including senate minority leader mitch mcconnell , joined democrats to overcome the filibuster on a 67-31 procedural vote that avoided another politically damaging legislative impasse over spending . the democratic-controlled senate then gave final approval by a 55-43 margin on strict party lines , with mcconnell and the other republicans who helped overcome the filibuster voting against the measure to reduce their political risk .  we got a good outcome ,  said gop sen. lisa murkowski of alaska , one of the 12 who helped defeat the filibuster but then opposed the measure on the final vote . treasury secretary jack lew said last week the debt ceiling must be raised by february 27 , or the nation would risk a technical default . after wednesday 's senate votes , lew said the debt ceiling plan along with a recent budget agreement and spending bill  will provide certainty and stability to businesses and financial markets and should add momentum to the economic growth forecasted in 2014 .  to democratic sen. chuck schumer of new york , the defeat of the filibuster bid by cruz signaled that  the american political world is moving in our direction .   republicans are trying to put tea party politics in the rear view mirror ,  he said . after the house and senate consideration of the politically charged matter , obama added that the  full faith and credit of the united states is too important to use as leverage or a tool for extortion .  cruz sticks to his guns . cruz , however , was unapologetic .  today 's vote is yet another example that establishment politicians from both parties are simply not listening to the american people ,  he said .  outside the beltway , americans of all political stripes understand that we can not keep spending money we do n't have .  with congress on break next week for the president 's day holiday , failure to pass the debt ceiling measure wednesday would have brought the nation close enough to the deadline to possibly shake financial markets . on tuesday , the gop-controlled house passed the debt-ceiling measure on a 221-201 vote , with only 28 republicans supporting it compared to the 199 who opposed it . meanwhile , 193 democrats backed the measure with only two voting  no .  the house vote followed an internal republican fight over efforts to attach deficit reduction provisions to the debt-limit legislation . obama and democrats rejected any attempt to negotiate on the issue , which previously led to political brinkmanship that caused the first-ever downgrade of the u.s. credit rating in 2011 . in the end , house speaker john boehner gave up efforts to link the measure to a provision repealing a cut in some military pension benefits . the ohio republican allowed a vote on a  clean  bill demanded by democrats and despised by conservatives . the shift by boehner evoked rare praise for the speaker from the senate 's top democrat .  it is encouraging that some of my republican colleagues seem to be regaining their grip on sanity this week ,  senate majority leader harry reid said wednesday before the senate vote . gop change in tactics . until it happened , house republicans insisted that any increase in the borrowing limit had to come attached to deficit-reduction provisions . at a closed-door meeting on monday , they discussed a plan to increase the debt ceiling until march 2015 -- past the upcoming congressional elections in november -- while also repealing cuts to military pensions that were part of the recently passed federal budget . less than 18 hours later , though , boehner told reporters the gop proposal could n't pass because  we do n't have 218 votes .  some conservatives oppose raising the debt ceiling under any circumstance , while democrats had made it clear they would unanimously reject any measure that tacked other provisions onto an increase in the borrowing limit . without a purely republican majority , boehner decided to split up the gop plan by holding separate votes on repealing the military pension cuts and a clean debt ceiling increase . the house easily passed the military pension measure earlier on tuesday , then passed the clean debt ceiling legislation . both boehner and his top deputy -- house majority leader eric cantor of virginia -- were among the 28 republicans who supported the measure . on wednesday , the senate also passed the military pension measure after the votes on the debt ceiling legislation . republicans facing pressure from conservatives ahead of the november vote were reluctant to back any kind of hike in the borrowing limit , a core issue for the political right because it represents rising federal debt . boehner blames obama . despite his support for the proposal , boehner put the blame for needing a  clean  debt-ceiling bill with no deficit reduction provisions on obama , saying the rising federal debt was his fault .  it 's the president driving up the debt and the president wanted to do nothing about the debt that 's occurring , will not engage in our long-term spending problem ,  boehner said .  and so , let his party give him the debt ceiling increase that he wants .  at the same time , boehner declared himself disappointed about what he called a  lost opportunity  to address unsustainable federal spending . republicans across the ideological spectrum agree that another round of political brinkmanship could harm their party after it got blamed for october 's federal government shutdown . a recent cnn/orc international poll found that 54 % of respondents would blame congressional republicans for a failure to raise the debt ceiling , while 29 % would blame obama and 12 % would blame both .", "summary": " senate also approves measure to repeal cuts to military pension benefits .   12 republicans join democrats to defeat a filibuster bid by sen. ted cruz .   under the measure , no debt ceiling showdown until 2015 at the earliest .   obama signals he 'll sign bill , says he hopes it ends  politics by brinkmanship  "}
