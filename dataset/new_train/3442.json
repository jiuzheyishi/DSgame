{"text": "any move by our national game to bring back football in place of professional wrestling can expect the support of sepp blatter . when fifa 's president revealed exclusively to me in an interview screened at the soccerex convention in manchester that he would be pioneering more new technology , we also discussed the plague of arm-grappling , head-locking , shirt-pulling and body slamming which is infecting and disfiguring the beautiful game . having disclosed his plans for following up goal-line technology with video challenges by managers and coaches against refereeing decisions , blatter addressed the epidemic use of arms in challenges , saying : ` this is the next issue we need to examine . ' sportsmail has now launched a campaign entitled hands off in the box , which highlights how this abuse of the laws and spirit of the game is at its ugliest from corners and free kicks . this penalty box incident caused controversy in sunday 's manchester united vs chelsea clash - on the left , branislav ivanovic wrestles with chris smalling while on the right , john terry grapples marcos rojo . this reverse angle shows rojo push terry to the floor while smalling can be seen with his arm around the neck of ivanovic in the background . proposals are being tabled for a summit meeting between leading referees and officials of the fa , the premier and football leagues and the pfa . since the laws of the game already prohibit the use of hands and arms , all it will take is for a consensus to be reached . then club managers can be advised how rules are to be applied more strictly . no matter how draconian the implementation of the regulations , they can act confident of approval from the governing body of the world game . in fact , they can set an example to be followed around the planet , all the way up to world cups . blatter added : ` the name of the game is football and that needs to be respected . ' stoke 's ryan shawcross -lrb- right -rrb- did concede a penalty for this grapple with swansea 's wilfried bony last week . liverpool 's martin skrtel has also been penalised in the past for penalty area blocking . similarly , the proper art of defending needs to be revived . attacking the ball rather than the opponent , clever positioning and well-timed tackling without loss of balance are skills being substituted by primitive tactics more suited to the wwe . there is a revealing sequence of photographs which show bobby moore relieving george best of the ball with an intervention of such immaculate precision that england 's world cup-winning captain kept his footing throughout . if the most gifted of all british footballers -- and one of the greatest of all time -- could be dispossessed with such brilliant dexterity while in full flight , it should not be beyond today 's super-fit defenders to deny comparatively lesser forwards without dragging them bodily to the ground . bobby moore -lrb- right -rrb- shows how it should be done , tackling chelsea 's charlie cooke in 1970 . sepp blatter -lrb- left -rrb- and jeff powell spoke at length about the weighty issues facing the beautiful game . cynically , the most blatant culprits are those who end to badger the referees to their faces whenever decisions go against them . that is another ill of which the game needs curing . but one step at a time . it is the wrestling which is spoiling our game as a spectacle . so hands off in the box - and all over the pitch for the matter .", "summary": " sportsmail has launched a campaign to stop premier league footballers wrestling , grappling and shirt pulling opponents in the penalty box .   our campaign is called hands off in the box .   any efforts to remove wrestling from the professional game can expect sepp blatter 's support .   ` this is the next issue we need to examine , ' blatter exclusively told me .   the premier league and football league can start a wave of reform which goes across the globe and will be enacted at world cups .
