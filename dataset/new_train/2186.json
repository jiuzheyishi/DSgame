{"text": "newark , new jersey they arrived in the united states from west africa , young girls held against their will and forced to work for hours on end . but this time , it did n't happen hundreds of years ago . nicole 's journey started in 2002 , when she was barely 12 , in her small village in western ghana . she and about 20 other girls were held in plain sight , but always under the watchful eyes of their captors .  it was like being trapped , like being in a cage ,  said  nicole ,  now 19 . cnn agreed not to use her real name .  i always have to behave , behave , behave , behave . no freedom at all .  the girls ' families sent them to the united states after being assured they would receive a better education . but once they arrived , they were forced to work in hair braiding shops across the newark area -- just a short drive from new york city , right in the shadow of the statue of liberty . the girls , who are now young women , have never spoken publicly before , until now .  it was horrible ,  said zena amevor , who was 15 when she was brought over from togo .  sometimes there was not enough food for us to eat . ... it was like a prison . i was just stuck there . ... it was horrible .  for the first time , the former slaves provided details about their horrifying odyssey and an intimate view into the world of human trafficking and contemporary slavery .  jacqueline  was 13 when her family sent her to the united states , not knowing that a woman she called  auntie  was a human trafficker . it was unclear if the woman was a blood relative .  my dad ... worked hard so i could go to school , so when my auntie came and told my family that i could go to a school in the u.s. ... they trusted her ,  she said .  everyone was happy about it .  the girls worked in the salons right out in the open , in front of customers . they were on their feet all day , sometimes for more than 12 hours , weaving intricate and elaborate hair braids , seven days a week . this went on for more than five years .  we stood there all day , just braiding ,  jacqueline said .  if they want really small braids , you stay there sometimes until 2 a.m. ... that 's every day .  at times , they were forced to braid the hair of american teenagers no older than they were -- girls who were free and had no idea the people braiding their hair were slaves .  i wished i could go with them ,  nicole said .  most of the time , i 'd end up just breaking down later crying ... because when i see teenagers going around , going to the movies and just being a teen ... i just could n't understand why my life has to be this way ...  in one of the many ironies in the case , the customers whose hair was braided by the slave girls were mostly african-american women , many of whom could have been descendants of slaves brought to america generations ago . slavery through trafficking continues widely today in the united states , though often undetected , according to law enforcement officials . nicole , zena , jacqueline and the other girls were held in groups in several houses around newark and east orange , new jersey . the girls were brought to the united states at different times between 2002 and 2007 , according to court documents . as the group grew , the traffickers ran out of places to put them and had to rent more living quarters . the homes were always in the middle of residential areas with manicured lawns and nice houses , often near churches , schools and community buildings .  i think it 's hard for people to believe that in 2010 , we have people who actually put people in slavery ,  said paul fishman , the u.s. attorney for new jersey , whose office successfully prosecuted the case .  it 's the most fundamental and intolerable violation of human rights .  the traffickers convicted in this case were a mother , father and son who also came from west africa , according to court documents and law enforcement officials . nicole , zena and jacqueline described living in fear shortly after they arrived in the united states , forced to work by day at the hair salons and sleeping in groups on the floor at night .  when i got here ... i asked her if i was going to school , and she said there was no school ,  jacqueline said , referring to her auntie , the trafficking ringleader .  i said , ` i 'm not going to school ? ' -lsb- and -rsb- she said , ` no ' ... and that was her decision and she was n't going to change it .  the captors controlled the girls by beating them , withholding food , keeping them separated from anyone else and , at times , through sexual abuse , according to court documents . the young women who spoke to cnn described years of cruelty , physical abuse , beatings with wood or metal objects , extreme isolation and sleeping on mattresses on floors in filthy conditions . even their phone calls back to their families were monitored by their captors .  i always thought of running -lsb- away -rsb- , but i know nobody ,  zena said .  i do n't know where to go , did n't have -lsb- any -rsb- friends , nobody to talk to , so it was kind of hard . ... i had nowhere to go to .  five years after the girls began arriving , u.s. immigration and customs enforcement agents received a tip and began extensive surveillance on the houses where the girls were kept . after months of surveillance , the ice agents raided the houses in 2007 . inside , they found the girls and mattresses on the floor . the traffickers had hidden bags of cash and the girls ' passports . peter edge , who led the team of agents , said none of the girls ' customers ever called officials to help .  hundreds of people came into these salons , they probably witnessed things out of the ordinary ,  said edge , special agent in charge of ice 's homeland security investigations in newark .  these girls were shielded from the outside world , virtually hidden in plain sight ... from everything else that was around them .  edge and the girls said several customers asked about the girls ' ages , and the girls -- following the orders of their captors -- lied and said they were 18 .  i wish one of my customers ... would have gone to police ,  nicole said .  i wish they would have helped me .  in the 2007 raid , the ice agents found a notebook the girls used to track the tips they received , but could n't keep , at the hair salon . ironically , on the cover of the notebook was a picture of the statue of liberty . more than two years later , akouavi afolabi ; her husband , lassissi afolabi ; and their son , dereck hounakey , were convicted of running the trafficking ring . akouavi afolabi was the ringleader , while her husband and son were accomplices , according to court documents . in september of this year , a newark court sentenced akouavi afolabi to 27 years in prison , while her husband received 24 years and their son received 4 1/2 years . the girls had to testify against the afolabis in court .  i remember crying . all i did was cry . it was overwhelming ,  nicole said .  i told myself , ` she finally got what she deserved ' ... she did really , really wrong . she treated us bad . and she was heartless ... and i 'm happy she was caught .  court records show the afolabis knew many of the families whose girls they lured away to become their slaves . they had an elaborate scheme to lure the girls : mrs. afolabi would approach families of young girls in ghana and togo , where she had connections , and tell the families she would give the girls an education in the united states . they then used fraudulent visa papers to sneak the girls into the country . experts say the main reason for most modern-day human trafficking is money .  human trafficking is extremely profitable ,  said bridgette carr , a law professor and a national expert on human trafficking . the customers at the hair braiding salon where zena and nicole were forced to work would sometimes pay as much as $ 200 to $ 400 for elaborate braiding that would take many hours to complete . the traffickers took every penny made by the girls , both in tips and payments for their hair braiding . they made about $ 4 million , according to court documents .  it 's so profitable that we are seeing some drug traffickers get out of drug trafficking and into human trafficking ,  said carr , who teaches law at the university of michigan law school in ann arbor . carr heads a clinic that is helping nicole and many of the other girls move ahead with their lives .  sadly , the work of our clinic is necessary in every community in america ,  she said .  human trafficking , also known as modern-day slavery , exists in big cities , in small towns , in rural areas with no towns , exists in restaurants , in hair salons , in hotels and in farmwork .  almost every industry you can think of , there is an opportunity there for someone to be exploited . this is everywhere in the u.s.  today , nicole , zena , jacqueline and the other girls are trying to move on with their lives . several are in high school , and one has recently been accepted into college . most of the girls have not been able to return home to see their families in west africa . when asked why she agreed to finally talk out about such a painful chapter of her life , nicole said she wanted to raise awareness about what other young girls may be going through .  i want to tell people that slavery exists ,  she said .  it 's huge , and it 's really happening here .  watch anderson cooper 360 ° weeknights 10pm et . for the latest from ac360 ° click here .", "summary": " zena and nicole were sent from west africa to the u.s. with promise of an education .   they and others ended up working as slaves in hair braiding salons in new jersey .   they spoke out for the first time about their ordeal to cnn .    american slaves : hiding in plain sight  airs tonight on ac360 ° at 10 et on cnn .
