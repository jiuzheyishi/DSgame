{"text": "when the cheers subside in tahrir square , mohamed morsi will assume an egyptian presidency straightjacketed by the country 's military , start work under intense international scrutiny and inherit a country on its back economically . he 'll face the skepticism of people like mohamed saleh , one of the throng that waited for sunday 's declaration of morsi 's victory in tahrir square . even as he cheered the result , saleh said the real power in egypt still lies with the supreme council of the armed forces , which took power after the ouster of longtime strongman hosni mubarak .  they do n't give us power . mohamed morsi is just a name of president ,  saleh said .  he does n't have the power , scaf has the power .  egypt 's electoral commission declared morsi the country 's president-elect sunday after a runoff with ahmed shafik , a former air force general who served as mubarak 's last prime minister . with the announcement of morsi 's victory , cheers erupted in tahrir square , the cairo plaza that was the center of the 2011 revolt that toppled mubarak . morsi urges unity in first speech . his supporters already are pushing for a confrontation with the generals , who recently ordered an elected , islamist-dominated parliament dissolved and announced they would retain legislative power for an indefinite time .  will the military council respect the egyptian will or not ?  asked abdoul mawgoud dardery , a member of parliament from morsi 's freedom and justice party , the political arm of egypt 's long-suppressed muslim brotherhood .  if it respects it , we will be able to work together . if it does not , the military council knows very well where mubarak is right now .  dardery said the brotherhood and its supporters would remain in tahrir square until they get what they want . khaled fahmy , a historian at the american university in cairo , said that determination is born of the hard lessons that followed the ouster of mubarak , who has been sentenced to life in prison for ordering the killings of anti-government protesters in the 2011 revolt . world leaders , regular folks react to morsi 's victory .  we thought the revolution was over , that we won when we forced the president to resign , and we went back home ,  fahmy told cnn .  and obviously , the revolution was far from being over , and our demands were far from being answered .  scaf dissolved parliament elected earlier this year following a ruling by egypt 's high court that the law governing the parliamentary elections was invalid . the generals said the new president would set a date for parliamentary elections and would have the power to appoint government officials , name ambassadors to foreign countries and grant pardons -- but the junta will keep legislative power and the budget in its hands until new lawmakers are elected . the brotherhood and the secular liberal groups that launched the 2011 protests have to maintain that presence to keep pressure on the government , fahmy said . meanwhile , he said , the military 's announcement that it would retain legislative and budgetary power  is effectively a recipe for at best a paralysis in the executive branch of the government .  the muslim brotherhood explained . at worst , it could mean a fight with the generals at a time when egypt 's economy is still recovering from the nosedive that accompanied the revolution .  they 've lost 2 million jobs since february of last year ,  said u.s. congressman david dreier , an election observer during the runoff .  by virtue of that , they really need to get the economy growing and get people back to work .  dreier , a california republican , told cnn 's  state of the union  that he is backing a u.s.-egyptian free trade bill in congress in hopes of boosting egyptian fortunes . before the revolution , about 40 % of egyptians lived in poverty . tourism was the bedrock of the country 's economy ,  and it has come to standstill  amid the past year 's turmoil ,  fahmy said .  the unemployment rate has hiked up . there 's not much inflation , but occasionally shortages in fuel and shortages of basic supplies ,  he said . who is mohamed morsi ? morsi vowed to revive the economy in the speech he delivered to the nation late sunday , telling egyptians their resources were plentiful but had been  squandered and mismanaged .  and cairo 's stock market jumped more than 3 % on sunday , which fahmy called  an indication of how sensitive the markets are for stability .   in a sense , it 's a vote for the fact that it 's democracy that brings stability rather than the military or the police ,  he said .  it 's not a flight of capital out of egypt because of islamists winning , it 's the exact opposite . it 's a vote of confidence not so much in the brotherhood itself , but in the democratic process .  egypt has long been the leading u.s. ally in the arab world , receiving $ 1.3 billion annually in american military aid for decades . its peace treaty with israel is a cornerstone of regional diplomacy . israel has reacted cautiously to the elections , issuing a statement sunday that it  appreciates the democratic process in egypt and respects the results of the presidential elections .   israel looks forward to continuing cooperation with the egyptian government on the basis of the peace treaty between the two countries , which is a joint interest of both peoples and contributes to regional stability ,  the statement said . despite his previous fierce criticism of israel -- including calling israeli leaders  vampires  and  killers  -- morsi pledged sunday night that egypt  will preserve all national and international agreements  under his leadership . edwin walker , a former u.s. ambassador to egypt , told cnn that abandoning the treaty was  not going to be possible .   you ca n't just tear up the peace treaty and start over again ,  he said . and fahmy said the hard realities of the economy and the still-unsettled revolution are likely to make revisiting the egyptian-israeli pact a distant prospect .  i do n't think foreign relations , or specifically relations with israel , will be on the top of their priority list ,  he said .  they are way too smart to open up this question now , and i do n't think they 're too keen on opening it on the medium front .  why hosni mubarak 's death would n't change egypt 's future . morsi also may have to deal with a split in the ranks of his own party , between those who may advocate smoothing things over with the generals and others who want to cultivate ties with secular liberals and leftists .  the brotherhood is a huge organization . it is a very venerable organization . it is an old one ,  fahmy said .  but i think it is also facing its greatest threat , and it 's a threat paradoxically prompted by its victory .  the group survived years of crackdowns by egyptian rulers by staying underground , insisting on cohesion and secrecy and not tolerating dissent . but now ,  we 're seeing youthful brothers who , in my reading , have much more in common with the secularist revolutionaries than with the elderly muslim brotherhood members .  nevertheless , the arrival of a democratically elected leader is a moment egyptians have awaited  for the past 7,000 years ,  dardery said .  this is a great moment in history , and we 're going to be making history from now on ,  he said .", "summary": " mohamed morsi , egypt 's president-elect , now inherits a variety of problems .   egypt 's military still claims legislative and budget power , restricting his authority .   the country 's economy  has come to standstill  since the 2011 revolt , historian says .   nevertheless ,  this is a great moment in history ,  says a morsi-allied lawmaker .
