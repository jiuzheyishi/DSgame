{"text": "a company called 4sphere is putting a new - pardon the pun - spin on a 5,500-year-old classic : the wheel . wheels , as most everyone knows , are round . but not 4sphere 's shark wheel - rather , a shark wheel , designed for skateboards , is formed around a cubed center , which its inventor claims allows it to ride faster and smoother than your traditional round skateboard wheel . in other words , the company has literally reinvented the wheel . scroll down for video . behold ! the wheel - reinvented . shark wheels . ` when used on hard surfaces , the shark wheel produces a low friction profile similar to a high performance , low rolling resistance tire , ' the company says on its kickstarter page . ` this allows for less energy to be used as the contact patch is very small . conversely , a wheel that would normally work well as a low resistance wheel would perform poorly in something like soft sand . ' shark wheels are made up of three , helical-shaped strips that , when rolling , form a sine wave pattern when they make contact with the ground . this pattern allows the wheel to roll faster than a traditional round wheel , the company claims , and provides better handling on rough , wet terrain . the man who reinvented the wheel : david patrick says he 's been an avid skateboarder all his life . ` it kept on going ' : patrick says he dropped this ` rectangle ' accidentally and noticed that it rolled . ` when encountering soft surfaces , the patented design of the shark wheel . produces a much wider , high friction profile which creates a wide . surface area and unsurpassed grip , the company says . ` this ability to travel on soft . surfaces is very similar to the way a sidewinder snake moves through the . sand . ' shark wheel inventor david patrick says he got the idea for the wheel when he used six different shapes to form a perfect cube . he dropped the cube accidentally and it rolled . ` not only did it roll , ' he says in a promotional video for the shark wheel , ` it kept on going . the helix shape of it was perfectly balanced so no matter what the terrain , it kept on going . ' shark wheels . lame : round wheels are sooo 3000 b.c. sidewinder : patrick says the shark wheel works similar to how a ` sidewinder snake moves through the sand ' the company recently started a campaign on kickstarter - an online fundraising website where the general public can contribute money to creative ideas - that already has garnered more than $ 30,000 in 10 days . the company 's initial fundraising goal was $ 10,000 . patrick says the company already has plans for the wheel designed and tested . he says it will use the money from kickstarter to start mass-producing the square-shaped wheels soon .", "summary": " ` shark wheels ' are made of three , helical-shaped strips that , when rolling , form a sine wave pattern when they make contact with the ground .   the inventor of the shark wheel says he came up with the idea accidentally .   the company already has raised more than $ 30,000 and plans to start mass-producing the wheels soon .
