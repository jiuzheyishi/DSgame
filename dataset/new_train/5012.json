{"text": "charlotte volante on a jersey beach . now she is walking her new ambition is to learn how to drive . a teenager who was told to get on with life in a wheelchair life because she would never walk again is now walking after a pioneering operation . charlotte volante , from jersey , had been confined to a wheelchair since the age of 11 after being born with spina bifida and hydrocephalus -lrb- water on the brain -rrb- . but children 's orthopaedic expert caroline edwards was confident she could get charlotte standing again . after a complex operation in july this year to lengthen the tight muscles at the hips , knees and feet , charlotte amazed her family by standing up next to her hospital bed . supported by a nurse and her mother bernadette , 52 , the teenager then walked around her ward and the nurses ' station at southampton general hospital . the breakthrough was just 10 days before her 18th birthday and left charlotte and her family with a double reason to celebrate . charlotte , . the youngest of five girls and two boys , said : ` when i was 11 , i was . given an electric wheelchair and told to just get on with it . ` after i met caroline , i agreed to let her do the op she suggested but i did n't really know if it would work . ` walking again after my operation did not feel strange and it did n't hurt ; it just felt completely natural . ' it has been a long road for charlotte as she and her parents have made more than 500 return trips to southampton for treatment . she had already undergone 42 surgical procedures on her head , legs , back and stomach . charlotte was born with spina bifida - a fault in . the development of the spinal cord and surrounding bones -lrb- vertebrae -rrb- that had left a gap in her spine . she also developed the related condition hydrocephalus - where cerebro-spinal fluid does n't drain into the blood stream properly . she will still need to return to southampton for further treatment including having new splints fitted . her father tony , 50 , said : ` we have been coming to southampton general hospital regularly since charlotte was just a day old and have nothing but good things to say about it . ` the staff have been brilliant and there are still one or two we remember from when we first came in all those years ago . ' meanwhile , charlotte is hoping to fulfil another dream - learning to drive . ` caroline has given me the drive to go on and make all my dreams a reality and i now hope to begin to drive - and i 'm already saving for a car , ' she said . charlotte with her mother bernadette and father tony : they have all been impressed with charlotte 's treatment at southampton general hospital . charlotte is one of 15 children and young people who have benefited from a pioneering accelerated rehabilitation programme developed by the hospital . the programme can see patients walking within six weeks of hip surgery through the use of a removable brace . conventionally , patients are placed in plaster shorts - known as a spica - for six to eight weeks . these hold the hip in place but limit movement , causing muscle wastage , delaying the start of therapy treatment and preventing them from standing for at least three months . under accelerated rehabilitation , patients are placed in their brace at night or during periods of rest following surgery , allowing early movement and standing to preserve muscle strength or comfortable seating . the programme is already helping young cerebral palsy patients as well as those with spina bifida , where a series of birth defects affect the development of the spine and nervous system . ` it is fantastic to see children and young people like charlotte to be up on their feet so soon after major invasive surgery - the early movement with the brace seems to be the key , ' said miss edwards . ' i am delighted for charlotte and her family , especially as they thought she would never walk again .
