{"text": "unsafe devices are often made in china for as little as 3p . on first examination the small white plug that arrived in bubble wrap in the post appeared perfectly innocuous . hundreds of thousands of devices much like it are currently plugged into sockets in offices , children 's bedrooms , living rooms and kitchens around the country , powering up mobile phones -- of which 30 million are sold in the uk each year . but the bang that resounded , with a puff of black smoke , moments after new mother katie vines plugged this device into her bedroom wall was anything but harmless . so powerful was the explosion , that the charger actually split in two and left a large , sooty circle around the socket . this was n't a one-off , however : it would go on to happen a second time with an identical device . the thought of what could have been still makes care assistant katie , who lives in bristol with partner chris smitherman and their 19-month-old daughter aimee , shudder . the incident , last november , has taken on a chilling significance since it emerged that a fire which claimed victims from three generations of one family last month , including a nine-week-old baby , was probably caused by a faulty charger . the blaze started in the living room and swept through the terrace home in sheffield overnight on april 28 , killing brothers adyan parwaiz kayani , nine , and amaan parwaiz kayani , seven , their baby sister minahil , aunt anum parwaiz , 20 , and grandmother shabina begum , 53 . such was the extent of the damage that it may be many weeks before fire investigators are able to confirm what caused the blaze , or even what type of charger was in use . but a spokesman for south yorkshire police said that ` the most probable cause ' of the fatal fire was an ` electrical fault involving a faulty charging device ' . the tragedy highlights growing concerns about the dangers that may be hidden behind the casing of the ubiquitous charger in the wall . while the chargers which are supplied with branded electronic goods are made to the highest standard and are no cause for concern , it 's cheap , unauthorised , ` unbranded ' chargers -- the type usually bought on the internet , from market stalls or abroad , rather than from reputable shops and suppliers -- that can be hazardous . according to the charity electrical safety first , many of the cheap devices it tests fail to meet the requirements of the electrical equipment -lrb- safety -rrb- regulations act 1994 . product safety manager steve curtler warns : ` it 's driven by demand . people want multiple chargers to keep their lives going , one for home , one to take on holiday . . . when you can see one for # 5 it seems worth taking the risk -- at least that 's how it seems at the time . ' unsafe devices are often made in china for as little as 3p . victims : adyan parwaiz kayani -lrb- left -rrb- and his brother amaan , seven -lrb- right -rrb- died in their home in sheffield . there have even been allegations that manufacturers may submit well-engineered products for testing , only to remove non-essential components to reduce costs -- thereby increasing the risk of disastrous malfunctions . with an estimated 1.8 million mains mobile phone chargers bought online in the uk each year , safety experts are concerned that thousands of lives are being put at risk . the evidence speaks for itself : last year , air stewardess ma ailun , 23 , was electrocuted at home in china when she answered her iphone while it was charging . in 2007 , seven-year-old connor o'keefe , from south-east london , died playing with his game boy -- he had been using a cheap , unbranded charger his family had bought on holiday in thailand . he was electrocuted and found dead in his hotel room . tests revealed the charger had ` serious defects ' . his mother , patsy , said : ` until this happened to me , i would never have thought twice about buying a charger online . but you do n't have to go to a foreign country to get a dodgy plug , you can get them here , or get them sent here . ' what to watch out for graphic.jpg . indeed you can . while mains plugs for the iphone cost # 15 from the apple store , add in a usb cable and you 're looking at another # 15 . more generic usb mains chargers at carphone warehouse sell for # 17.99 and nokia small-pin chargers are # 14.99 . but venture online and there are all manner of deals to be found . an iphone 5 mains adaptor can be picked up for as little as # 3.69 . for less than # 5 you can also add an in-car charger . the same goes for devices which are compatible with samsung , blackberry and nokia phones . it was this price discrepancy that drove katie vines , 33 , to buy a cheap charger online last year . her branded iphone charger had broken and she wanted to buy a replacement . ` aimee was only about three months old and i was on maternity leave , so we did n't have a great deal of income , ' she says . ` the branded products were quite expensive , so i decided to look online and found a charger being sold for about # 4 . the seller had good ratings and seemed to be in the uk , so i decided to buy it . ' ` people think it 's worth the risk to buy a # 5 charger ' when the charger arrived , it looked entirely safe . katie thought nothing of popping it into her bedroom wall , a few feet from her daughter 's cot , attaching her phone , and walking into the bathroom , leaving partner chris changing their baby 's nappy . ` i 'd only just got to the bathroom when i heard a huge bang and ran back into the bedroom , ' says katie . ` the charger had exploded and was practically fused to the wall . ' putting the experience down to bad luck , katie contacted the seller , who apologised and dispatched a replacement charger . she was stunned when exactly the same thing happened . this time , it was in her living room wall and the plug itself blew apart . ` i was naive buying something off the internet because it was cheap . i thought if it had happened once , it would n't happen again . but the damage could have been so much worse . ` as soon as i heard about the house fire in sheffield i thought :  that could have been us .  when i think that aimee 's cot was near the socket i used , it makes me sick . ' the mail found multiple reports from around the country of house fires being attributed to an issue with a mobile phone battery or charging device in the past month alone . only days ago , mother-of-two julie swift , of bearsted , in kent , was woken by a flash and a ` bang ' from her mobile . she had been charging it with a cheap plug purchased online while she lay sleeping in bed . with an estimated 1.8 Â¿ million mains mobile phone chargers bought online in the uk each year , safety experts are concerned that thousands of lives are being put at risk . while the explosion tripped all the electrics in the house , fortunately it caused no damage . ` i still charge my phone overnight now , but only with an official apple charger and not near my head , ' says julie , 48 . ` i feel very lucky that this happened to me and not to my 12-year-old daughter . ' fire chiefs confirm that the problem is growing . meanwhile , european rules governing reduction of electrical waste have seen many manufacturers now selling new phones with only a usb cable , which are used to charge via your computer , and no traditional wall plug . this , say experts , will only make people seek out cheap plug-in alternatives all the more . last year , it emerged that the uk had seen a six-fold increase in the number of counterfeit electrical goods seized over the previous four years . and the value of such goods seized by councils and the border force rose from just over # 2.6 million in 2009 to more than # 15.7 million in 2012 . the most-seized items were chargers . some 67,000 potentially dangerous mobile chargers were uncovered in a single raid by trading standards officers in ealing , west london , last year . so what can go wrong to make a charger blow up ? unfortunately , most faults are not visible to the buyer , but instead involve the internal components . for example , the device may lack a suitable fuse to ensure that if something else on the phone fails , such as the battery , it safely contains any power surge or explosion . steve curtler says dodgy devices often lack this . this means that if the charger overheats , pressure will build , blowing the charger apart , creating a risk of fire and electric shock . cheaper products are often found to have pins that are too small or incorrectly placed . if they are the wrong size , they can damage the socket and lead to overheating . even without a naked flame , a charger can ignite under extreme heat , which is why fire safety experts stress that chargers should never be covered . by law , pins must be 9.5 mm away from the edge of the charger body . if the distance is less -- as it was with nine out of ten chargers in a recent sample test -- there is a very real risk of electric shock from skin contact . as a consumer you might like to think that a ce mark -- a declaration by the manufacturer that the product meets requirements of european law -- means your product is safe . sadly , this can be all too easily faked . and many mobile phone users leave their devices charging overnight . is this safe ? while apple insists its devices are designed so ` you can keep your device plugged in as long as you would like ' , steve curtler still advises caution . ` it does extend the risk unnecessarily . and the risk is exacerbated by using a cheap , unbranded charger . and when you are asleep you are less alert and less able to react . ' he says if you must leave your phone charging overnight , make sure you have a working smoke detector . similarly you should switch your power off at the wall if you leave your charger plugged in when not in use . simple tips -- but as katie vines knows only too well , they could be life-saving .", "summary": " many cheap devices fail to meet requirements of the electrical equipment -lrb- safety -rrb- regulations act 1994 .   unsafe devices are often made in china for as little as 3p .   1.8 million mobile phone chargers are bought online in uk each year .
