' it added : ` although often used as a means of pain relief , it can treat people with a wide range of illnesses ... . its focus is on improving the overall well-being of the patient , rather than the isolated treatment of specific symptoms . ' however , it then went on to give a long list of conditions treated by the hospital 's doctors using acupuncture . the hospital subsequently admitted to the asa that there was insufficient evidence to back up its claims that acupuncture could treat many of the conditions identified in the leaflets . the hospital admitted to the asa that there was insufficient evidence to back up its claims that acupuncture could treat many of the conditions identified in the leaflets . these included disturbances of the . menstrual cycle , gynaecological disorders , men 's health issues including . prostatitis , urinary disorders and fertility , emotional issues , stress , . anxiety , depression , addictions , tinnitus , dizziness , vertigo , immune . system imbalances , allergies , shingles , gastro-intestinal conditions , . upper respiratory disorders such as sinusitis and asthma , and . hypertension . the rlhim submitted 43 papers as evidence to support its other claims , which were then checked by a medical expert in one of the most complex investigations ever run by the asa . it found that claims made for the treatment of hot flushes in menopausal women , period pain , overactive bladder syndrome and facial pain were not substantiated or misleading . the asa said there was some evidence that the therapy could offer temporary relief from tension headaches , but not for the hospital 's claims it could treat chronic headache and migraine . in a damning ruling , the asa said : ` we told rlhim they should not state or imply that acupuncture was efficacious for conditions for which they did not hold adequate evidence . ' the ruling raises questions as to why millions of pounds taxpayers money is being used to fund alternative health treatments where there is little or no evidence that they work . the complaint against the hospital was brought by the nightingale collaboration , a campaigning group which was set up to challenge claims made for quack treatments . its director , alan henness , said : ` when misleading claims are made in adverts for healthcare products and services , consumers are unable to make fully informed healthcare choices . ' he said : ` this adjudication is particularly important since the rlhim is funded by the taxpayer and is part of university college london hospitals . the legitimacy that being part of the nhs gives must not be abused by making misleading claims . ` this is a win for consumer choice . we all should expect advertising to only make claims that can be backed by good evidence . ` the same rules apply to everyone regardless of what product or service they advertise and we certainly should not be lowering standards for health claims .
