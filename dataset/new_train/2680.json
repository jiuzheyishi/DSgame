{"text": " obama did worse .   christie 's toast .  those are the two main things media commentators , from the right and the left , said about new jersey gov. chris christie this week . together , they expose the carelessness of the way we talk and think about the people who aspire to the presidency . start from this point : many on christie 's staff are implicated in an abuse of power that inflicted harm upon tens of thousands of people . perhaps the governor did n't know that his staffers had gleefully ordered a traffic disruption on the george washington bridge last year . there is no evidence that he did know . on the other hand , these were the people the governor had chosen . this was the culture of the office he led . opinion : a chris christie prosecution would be political dynamite . the phrase  the buck stops here  -- used by the governor at his news conference last week -- does n't just mean the boss makes the final decision . it means the boss accepts blame for things that go wrong , just as he gains credit from things that go right . it means that  i did n't know  is not an acceptable excuse . but now proceed to this point : almost everybody who seeks the presidency has demons to slay on his or her way to the office . the long road to the highest office in the land is a contest not only against political rivals but against the flaws of a candidate 's own character and temperament . we all have such flaws . in would-be presidents , they tend to be outsized and to carry outsized importance . what we are looking for in a president is not a person without such flaws but a person who has struggled with them and overcome them . when a politician gets into trouble , as christie has done , pundits suddenly decide that it 's their job to mimic crisis managers . they offer advice on what the politician should say , what gestures he should offer , so as to escape blame and deflect criticism . opinion : christie 's bogus ` stages of grief ' but what matters after an episode like the bridge story is not the show of contrition but the real lessons learned . trouble now can even be a politician 's friend , if it jolts him off a path leading to worse trouble later . what christie faces in the bridge uproar is not a communications challenge but a personal growth challenge . can this combative politician recruit and run a team that understands better what is acceptable in political combat -- and what is not ? at his news conference after the damning bridge e-mails came to light , christie repeatedly denounced the abuse of conduct as contrary to his personal standards . can he enforce higher standards in the future ? christie has a style and sensibility that has brought him far as a politician . he 's just received a sharp warning that this style and sensibility will take him no further . conflict is intrinsic to politics -- but conflict governed by rules , written and unwritten . opinion : christie 's choice -- be seen as a crook or schnook ? christie 's team broke the rules to score revenge against a political opponent . would a christie white house govern the country in the same score-settling way ? even people inclined to support christie are now wondering . his future will depend on convincing people that he 's learned his lesson and changed his ways , and the best way to convince people that you have learned a lesson is actually to learn that lesson and actually to change your ways . at the end of his own career , richard nixon delivered an eloquent self-assessment of his own failure as president :  always remember others may hate you , but those who hate you do n't win unless you hate them , and then you destroy yourself .  unlike nixon , christie can benefit from that wisdom at the beginning of a presidential career rather than at its tragic end . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of david frum .", "summary": " david frum : chris christie 's team broke rules to gain revenge against opponent .   he says question for governor is whether he can learn from this episode .   running for president is a test of character , frum says ; can christie overcome his flaws ?   frum : ex-president nixon realized too late that hating his opponents was his undoing .
