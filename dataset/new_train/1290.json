{"text": "in the small australian city of townsville , locals assume the name of their football club is a nod towards the tropical cyclones that batter the northern queensland coast at this time of the year . spend 30 minutes in conversation with the man who doubles as manager and director of football at northern fury , though , and you could be forgiven for believing the team were named after him . ask ian ferguson -- formerly of this manor -- about his hopes and ambitions for the fledgling queensland state side and he speaks in calm , measured tones . ian ferguson -lrb- right -rrb- argues with the fourth official during his time in charge of perth glory in 2012 . yet , when the topic turns to his first love , you appreciate it is maybe no bad thing that 10,000 miles currently separates him from ibrox . if absence does indeed make the heart grow fonder , then what the 47-year-old has witnessed from afar over the past four years has threatened to break his . one of just three players to have featured in every one of the nine-in-a-row seasons , ferguson now barely recognises the emaciated beast a once proud club has become . ` it 's really sad . it breaks my heart sitting over here and seeing what 's going on , ' he tells sportsmail . ` it actually makes it more frustrating when you are so far away . ' distance and a sizeable time difference have proven no barriers to one of the club 's great midfield war horses keeping up to speed on the whole sorry saga . but it 's long since got to the stage where flicking on the tablet for a daily update is an act undertaken with considerablme trepidation . like the vast majority of rangers supporters , as far as ferguson is concerned , there is no ambiguity as to where the blame for the current shambles lies . ` we just want our club back and for it to be in good hands , ' he states . ` at this moment in time , it 's not in good hands . ` every single day , you look online and it 's story after story after story -- each one more negative than the last . ` you just wonder what these guys -lrb- in the boardroom -rrb- are doing . do n't treat the rangers fans like idiots because that 's one thing they are not . they know the game and what 's going on here . ` they wo n't stand for mediocre people in the club . ' ferguson is now the manager and director of football at northern fury in australia . an # 850,000 capture from st mirren in 1988 , it was ferguson 's good fortune to join rangers at the outset of an unprecedented period of dominance in the scottish game . and yet , as a lifelong supporter of the club , he needed no one to point out the folly in taking the good times for granted . before the arrival of graeme souness as player/manager in 1986 , the ibrox outfit had been also-rans in the premier league since 1978 . under john greig in the early 80s , crowds often struggled to reach five figures -- the kind of paltry numbers no one inside the club ever thought they 'd witness again . ` you always thought :  this is rangers fc  and it would never fall so far . not in a million years , ' ferguson reflects . ` when you see rangers playing to an 11,000 crowd -lrb- against raith rovers -rrb- , when is the penny going to drop ? it 's just diabolical . ` not so long ago , they were getting 50,000 every second week . what the hell has been going on for it to reach this point ? ' the question is rhetorical . ferguson knows well the whole sorry story involving sir david murray , craig whyte , charles green , the easdale brothers and mike ashley . a catalogue of self-inflicted wounds by the so-called custodians of the club . a general view of ibrox during the scottish cup match between rangers and raith rovers on sunday . that the scale of the mess is nuclear is beyond dispute . the pertinent question now is what happens to clean it up . ` i think the whole place needs a total clear-out from top to bottom . we 've got to start afresh , ' ferguson muses . ` the board just do n't listen . i hope that -lrb- dave -rrb- king and the three bears get in and the shareholders vote this board out . they are treating rangers fans and shareholders with total contempt . ` why are they taking this egm to london ? is it to prevent people coming down and voting ? ` if it is , they really are vastly underestimating rangers fans . they are sick and tired of what 's happening . ` how can these guys believe that they are doing a good job ? ` what is it they do n't understand ? they are not liked or wanted . rangers fans want them out and people who will bring the club forward in . ` whether that takes another four , five , six years , then so be it . that 's what we have to do . ' while ferguson holds the men at the top ultimately responsible for the mess beneath them , they are not the only targets of his considerable ire . a man who seemed born to play in old firm matches , he tuned on his television a week past on sunday to watch the league cup semi-final with celtic far more in hope than expectation . he was wise to approach the game with pessimism . not only did rangers fail to progress , they failed to lay a glove on their great rivals . ferguson -lrb- left -rrb- pictured with ally mccoist after rangers won the skol cup in 1988 . for ferguson , not even managing to ruffle celtic 's feathers was entirely unacceptable . ` they should at least have a bit of pride and passion , ' he adds . ` it was the first old firm game for three years and the boy -lrb- scott -rrb- brown was right -- it was probably the easiest derby win in history . ` it was heartbreaking to see a rangers team lose so easily . ` do n't make excuses . i 've heard the boy ian black making plenty about the referee bottling it and not sending brown off . he got intimidated , bullied and his backside kicked . it 's as simple as that . ` then i see someone else -lrb- fraser aird -rrb- saying they wanted to play celtic in the scottish cup because they wanted another crack at them . ` he should have been worrying about beating raith rovers first . ` there are absolutely no excuses for what they 've been turning in on the park . ' there is , however , boundless sympathy for kenny mcdowall . a team-mate of ferguson 's when st mirren won the 1987 scottish cup , the caretaker manager presently looks like he 'd rather be working in siberian salt mines . ` the fact kenny is working his notice tells you a story about him , ' ferguson says . ` he has basically had enough and has n't been able to do what he wants . ` i 'm reading in the papers that this guy derek llambias told kenny to play these -lrb- newcastle -rrb- players and then llambias comes out and says he never . he 's basically calling kenny mcdowall a liar . ferguson -lrb- left -rrb- on the ball during a match between rangers and celtic at parkhead in 1989 . ` i know who i believe . i 've known kenny for a number of years and he does n't shirk out of decisions or anything he 's been told to do . ` if he does n't agree with something , he 'll tell you . but these guys are putting that much pressure on him . ` it 's a shame he 's landed the job in these circumstances . it 's the same with ally mccoist . ` the club is in such a sad , stricken way . i do n't think any other manager has had to put up with what these guys have had to and i really feel for them . ' mccoist , like ferguson , is now watching matters unfold from afar . does the latter believe the ibrox icon -- and the club at large -- missed a trick three years ago by not flooding the first team with youth ? ` i do n't think it was a missed opportunity , ' he insists . ` there are still kids coming through but are they ready to play for rangers ? ` do they understand what it means to play for that club and the pressures that brings ? ` some people handle pressure differently . not everyone can handle it . some just get on with it . ` the premiership next season is going to be a really tough gig for those kids . ' that is , of course , assuming rangers get there .", "summary": " ian ferguson is saddened by the current state of the ibrox club .   ferguson played for rangers for 12 years from 1988-2000 .   the scot is now the manager and director of football at northern fury .
