{"text": "on monday , the world 's leading technology companies , including google and microsoft , published an open letter to president obama and congress demanding reform of u.s. privacy laws to restore the public 's  trust in the internet .  this comes after what seems like an endless series of revelations about government surveillance from the secret documents leaked by edward snowden . let 's start with the latest : american and british spies have gone into online fantasy games to snoop on players , and to see if any militants are communicating with each other dressed as elves or gnomes . last week , the washington post reported that the national security agency is  collecting billions of records a day to track the location of mobile phone users around the world .  and we learned recently that the nsa hacked fiber-optic cables and infected 50,000 networks with malware . big brother spying is happening at a scale we could never have imagined . this new awareness has prompted people -- even those with nothing to hide and who support broad surveillance for national security reasons -- to try to regain some control over their online privacy . according to a fall pew report , 86 % of people  have taken steps online to remove or mask their digital footprints .  another study concluded that 64 % of internet users concerned about privacy have taken action to protect themselves in direct response to the nsa prism program . revelations of nsa spying even contributed to president obama 's approval rating sinking to a new low . americans are very worried that they 've lost control of their personal data . in this atmosphere of anxiety and mistrust , people are adopting privacy solutions in unprecedented numbers . for example , silent circle , a global encrypted communications company that provides secure phone and text solutions , has experienced explosive 400 % growth . my company , disconnect , anonymized more than three million search queries in the first 30 days after launch . and sites like prism break are becoming popular destinations to learn about ways to protect your online privacy . it 's hard not to feel that we 've lost too much control when secret laws and new technologies empower governments and a handful of giant companies to secretly track , analyze and record virtually every detail about any of our lives -lrb- even leaders of world superpowers -rrb- . without suspicion , it appears that untold millions of us have or will be subject to unconstitutional searches and seizures of our most personal information . no wonder many people believe that the nsa 's actions violate our privacy . what 's even scarier is that government spy programs are rapidly expanding . for example , significant progress is being made to improve the use and capabilities of video surveillance . law enforcement agencies are partnering with technology firms to create video surveillance systems capable of facial recognition , scanning license plates and detecting radiation levels emitted by cars . in new york city , mayor michael bloomberg cited a joint nypd-microsoft project and suggested that within five years there will be 24/7 video surveillance of the entire city . on big brother , bloomberg said ,  get used to it !  the government is also upgrading its ability to process and store the enormous amount of data it is acquiring . during the summer when snowden 's disclosures were sending shock waves around the world , u.s. taxpayers paid for a brand new $ 1.2 billion data farm that will serve as the nsa 's external hard drive , designed specifically to improve  data acquisition , storage and processing effort .  meanwhile , consumer trust that companies can or will protect their personal information has been dealt a major blow as evidence emerged that the nsa collects information  at will  from google 's and yahoo 's data hubs without those companies ' knowledge and that nine leading internet companies provided the government access directly to user information as part of the prism program . so it comes as no surprise that 58 % of people do n't trust internet companies to protect privacy . tech leaders have even publicly acknowledged that news about prism has hurt their brand trust to a far greater extent than any previous uproar over privacy violations . we ca n't assume any company can protect us from government snooping . so until existing laws change , we have to focus on controlling what we can . it 's possible that over time , consumers will increasingly avoid or limit sharing personal information . companies that collect huge silos of personal data may be viewed as unattractive -- as sources of intel the government can easily and secretly tap into . ironically , the companies known as the biggest online privacy offenders who 've created business models that rely on monetizing user data are now calling for limits on surveillance . though , really , what these companies seek has nothing to do with making their collection and use of our data more transparent . still , their point is well taken . the government must change surveillance laws to avoid destroying our trust and the current internet economy . those familiar with the entire cache of snowden 's leaked documents insist that the most shocking and significant revelations are yet to come . and there 's a lot we 'll never know . according to the u.s. government , snowden , a low-level contract engineer , had very limited access and no knowledge about the  crown jewels  of the nsa 's surveillance program . what could those  crown jewels  be ? are n't you terrified to find out ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of casey oppenheim .", "summary": " the world 's leading tech companies asked president obama to reform privacy laws .   casey oppenheim : the scale of big brother spying is beyond our imagination .   he says even those who have nothing to hide want to regain some control of their privacy .   oppenheim : in this atmosphere of anxiety , more people are trying to find privacy solutions .
