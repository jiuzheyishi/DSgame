{"text": "a teenager has spoken of her ` total shock ' at being told at the age of 17 she had no vagina . jacqui beck , 19 , has mrkh , an rare syndrome which affects the reproductive system - meaning she has no womb , cervix or vaginal opening . she was only diagnosed after she went to her gp about back pain - and mentioned in passing that she had n't started her periods . shock : jacqui beck was told at the age of 17 she had no vagina . she was diagnosed with mrkh , an unusual syndrome which affects the reproductive system - meaning she has no womb , cervix or vaginal opening . tests revealed her condition and that where her vagina should be , there is simply an ident , or ` dimple ' - meaning she is unable to have sex or carry her own child . women with the condition appear completely normal externally - which means it is usually not discovered until a woman tries to have sex , or has not had her first period . miss beck , from the isle of wight , admits when she was first diagnosed , she felt ` like a freak ' . ` i 'd never considered myself different from other women and the news was so shocking , i could n't believe what i was . hearing . ` i . was sure the doctor had got it wrong , but when she explained that . was why i was n't having periods , it all started to make sense . ` she then explained that i would never be able . to carry a child and might have to have surgery before i could have sex . ` i left the doctors in tears - i . would never know what it was like to give birth , be pregnant , have a . period . all the things i had imagined doing suddenly got erased from my . future . ' i was really angry and felt like i was n't a real woman any more . ' unaware : miss beck explained she has a ` dimple ' where her vagina should be so from the outside it looks normal - hence why the condition was n't detected in her younger years . unexpected : miss beck was only diagnosed after she went to her gp about back pain - and mentioned in passing that she had n't started her periods . tests revealed her condition , which means she is unable to have sex or carry her own child . because she had never attempted to have a physical relationship , miss beck had never noticed the problem herself . had she tried , she would have discovered it was . impossible for her to have sex . mrkh -lrb- mayer rokitansky k√ºster hauser -rrb- . is a congenital abnormality which affects one in 5,000 women in . the uk . it is characterised by the absence of the vagina , womb and . cervix . women suffering from the condition will have normally functioning ovaries and so will experience the normal signs of puberty but will not have periods or be able to conceive . the external genatalia are completely normal which is why mrkh is n't usually discovered until women are in their teenage years . it 's usually discovered when the woman tries to has sex or fails to get her period . many women are able to create a vaginal canal using dilation treatment , which uses cylinder shaped dilators of different sizes to stretch the muscles . however , if this is unsuccessful then surgery will be used to stretch the vaginal canal . following treatment women are able to have intercourse and can have their eggs removed and fertilised to be used in surrogacy . she said : ` it . was n't really a conscious decision not to have a boyfriend , i just . did n't really fancy any of the boys in my area , which is lucky , . considering what i know now ' . mrkh affects one in 5,000 women in the uk . most discover they have the condition because they have n't started their periods , but some find out when they struggle to have intercourse . miss beck explained she has a ` dimple ' where her vagina should be so from the outside it looks normal - which explains why the condition was n't detected earlier . despite the shocking news , she is trying to see her condition in a positive light - and even as a way of making sure she meets the right man . she said : ` if he has a problem with it , then he 's not the kind of . guy i want to go out with . ` i 'm . a hopeless romantic and i see it as a great test of someone 's . character . instead of focusing on it putting off men , i actually think it . will help me find ,  the one  . ' i want to be upfront with . any men i meet and tell them straight away about my condition . i do n't . want them to feel tricked into being with me . ` i . will feel more comfortable if they know the truth and besides , if they . run at the mention of mrkh then i do n't want to be intimate with them . ' she says that as a teenager , she was blissfully unaware of her condition - with no idea that the development she was waiting for would never happen . ` when i was 14 , my friends . started talking to me about their periods . they started carrying tampons . around , complaining about cramps and sharing notes on what it was like . ` for a year i waited to go through the same , until at 15 , everyone i knew had started their period apart from me . despite the shocking news , she is trying to see . her condition in a positive light - and even as a way of making sure she . meets the right man . she said : ` if he has a problem with it , then he 's . not the kind of guy i want to see ' ` i did n't panic though , i 'm tall and skinny and thought that might be something to do with me being a late developer . ' instead , she focused on her future . and when she was 17 , applied to attend a music college in . guildford . but after suffering from pain in her neck in summer 2012 , she went to see her gp . ` while i was there , i mentioned i had n't started my period yet . i still was n't overly worried . but i thought it was worth saying something . ` my . doctor was very surprised but did n't seem to think it was serious . he . just suggested that he would do some scans to see what the problem was . ' hindsight : miss beck says that as a teenager , she was blissfully unaware of her condition - with no idea that the development she was waiting for would never happen . women with mrkh appear completely normal externally - which means it is often not discovered in childhood , but in the teenage years . when scans showed nothing , she was referred to a gynaecologist , who immediately spotted something was wrong . miss beck said : ` my other scan results had been sent to her and just from looking at them , she knew i had mrkh . ` she . sat me down and basically explained that i did n't have a womb , or a . vagina , that i was born without them and instead just had a small dimple . in it 's place . ' so mortified by what she had heard , she was too embarrassed to admit to family and friends she had the condition - let alone the prospect of telling . any future boyfriends . she said : ` i . was too embarrassed to call my mum and talk it through with her , so . instead , i sent her an email . youtube jacqui beck . help : miss beck is now undergoing treatment to help her try and have intercourse in the future . ` she called straight back and came over to . guildford the next day from the isle of wight . ` although . mum was upset for me , she tried to focus on finding out as much about . the condition as possible , so we could understand it . ` she . also encouraged me to focus on the bright side . we laughed as we listed . all the things i would n't have to go through , period cramps , . childbirth , smear tests - to try and look on the bright side . ' focusing on her treatment , miss beck was . admitted to the queen charlotte and chelsea hospital in london , which . specialises in the condition . there , she was given dilation treatment , which . involved using different sized dilators to try and stretch her vaginal . canal - but was told if it did n't work , she would have to be operated on . honest : miss beck says she now wants to speak out about her condition to raise awareness of it . she said : ` i spent two days there , getting taught how to use the dilator and learning more about mrkh . ` the first time the nurse showed me how to use a dilator i nearly died of embarrassment . but now i 've got used to it , i see it as any other form of treatment . ` at the hospital , they referred me to a network of other women who have the same condition . it was great to speak to other girls who felt like me . ` i stopped feeling so lonely and it also gave me hope as i spoke to women who had gone on to have a full sex life . ' thankfully , her treatment has worked and if she continues she will not need surgery and when she chooses to , will be able to have intercourse . further down the line there are more difficult conversations she will have to have to have when she wants to have children . she said : ` i 'm not at an age when i 'm thinking about kids , but i think that will hit me later on . i will use a surrogate , or adopt , but i will have to make sure any guy i meet is ok with that too . ` again , i try and take it as a blessing that , unlike woman who discover they ca n't conceive when they are already trying for a baby , i have time to get used to the idea . ' for miss beck , her one hope is that the condition becomes more well known , so that other women realise they have it earlier than she did . ` i had only told five of my best friends , but then i realised it 's not something i should be ashamed of . ` if i had cancer , or , any other medical issue , people would be supportive . so , i recently came out to everyone on facebook , telling them about my condition . ` i was surprised at how positive everyone was , they said i was brave and beautiful , now i wish i had been open about it from the beginning .
