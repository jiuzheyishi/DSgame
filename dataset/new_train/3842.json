{"text": "these magnificent mountains look almost unreal as they constantly change colour with the light and weather . british photographer andro loria , 50 , said the altering shadows it was like watching an ` everlasting show ' pass over the landscape . he took the shots on a hiking tour through the landmannalaugar highlands in iceland 's fjallabak nature reserve . mr loria , a scientist from north west london , said the scene was ` unearthly ' and at times he felt like he was walking across the moon . captivated by the area 's beauty , he said he slowed the rest of the group down because he kept stopping to take ` hundreds ' of photos . british photographer andro loria captured the iceland landscape beautifully , and included this 70-year-old walker . the mountains appear to change colour dependent on the light and the weather . mr loria , who is engaged to be married , said : ` the colourful mountains change colours constantly according to the light and weather . ` the patches of ice or snow in spring or early summer add more contrast to the scenery ; some ice patches on slopes survive into late summer . the hills are usually yellow and gold with splashes of grey and blue and red or purple from sulphur rich minerals due to volcanic activity . green moss adds an extra colour . ` as the relief is rather ragged you have a constant interplay between light , colour and shades creating a never ending show . it is a paradise for photography . ' the shots include mt. brennisteinsalda , which means ` sulphur wave ' , an 850 metre high active volcano with hot sulphur springs on its slopes . mr loria added : ` the combination of contrasting colour and light in ever-changing shapes due to variable light was absolutely unique . i had never seen anything like it before . colours added by volcanic activity made it all look almost unreal and unearthy . ` you almost feel like you are crossing a lunar landscape at times . ` the majority of peaks in landmannalaugar are between 800-1200m above sea level . due to the location of the highlands the view from the top spots allows you to see incredible panoramas . the constant interplay of light , shapes , shades and colour is very captivating . ` the views from the tops of the highest hills or mountains are very impressive , they are easy to get to and at places are almost flat and barren . ' the photographer loria described it as almost like passing over a lunar landscape . the photos were taken on a hiking tour through the landmannalaugar highlands in iceland 's fjallabak nature reserve . the photographs are so vivid they look more like paintings , with the array of colours captured beautifully . he described the walker shown in one of the shots - an american man from the group who is more than 70 years old - inspired some of his best snaps . mr loria added : ' i wish i will still be travelling like him when i get to that age . he was also a reason i took a couple of my favourite shots . they were taken late , the sun was low providing beautiful light and lighting up hills with extra splashes of gold and pink . ' i turned back to see if my fellow walker was ok and after seeing the scene took a few shots . the way he walked along the ridge , blending into the landscape , was fantastic . it was one of those men and nature being united feelings . ' the rock formations at a mountain range in iceland are unique , and unlike others in the world . the colours made by the volcanic activity give the photos an unearthly feel to them . photographer loria was amazed at the views atop the mountain range in iceland .", "summary": " british photographer andro loria took the photos on an iceland hiking trip .   describes the experience as ` like walking across the moon .
