{"text": "in one of the most closely-watched senate races of the year , incumbent democratic sen. kay hagan of north carolina holds a narrow three-point advantage over her republican challenger , according to a new cnn/orc international survey . but the poll indicates that thom tillis , the gop nominee , may be falling behind hagan because a libertarian candidate could be siphoning off republican votes . hagan edges tillis , 46 % -43 % , while libertarian sean haugh has support from 7 % likely voters , according to the poll . the three-point gap between tillis and hagan , however , is well within the poll 's sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points among likely voters , meaning the candidates are about even . the race is one of eight senate contests that cnn rates as  up for grabs  this fall . as republicans seek to retake the senate majority , they consider north carolina one of their best chances to pick up a democratic seat . politics of fear -- how the gop is using isis against dems . since hagan was first elected in 2008 , north carolina has transitioned from somewhat of a purple state to solid red territory . republicans took the governorship and seized both houses in the state legislature , and north carolina was one of two states that voted for barack obama in 2008 but mitt romney in 2012 . hagan 's favorable rating is 46 % , indicating that everyone who likes her is going to vote for her . but tillis gets a 47 % favorable rating among likely voters , yet only 43 % of the vote .  that suggests that there are voters who would probably choose tillis in a two-way race but are n't going to vote for him in a three-way contest ,  said cnn polling director keating holland . while haugh only has the backing of 7 % of voters , his presence in the race could be hugely influential if tillis ends up losing to hagan by just a few percentage points . amid worrisome polls , democrats make new pitch for women . president barack obama 's low approval rate in north carolina -- 42 % -- has forced hagan to keep some distance from the president . when he came to her state last month to speak to the american legion convention in charlotte , for example , she publicly criticized him and his administration 's handling of the veterans affairs scandal this summer . emily 's list , a political action committee that backs female democratic candidates , has spent millions to support hagan and make the debate over equal pay a big issue in the race . the equal pay issue is one that democrats nationwide believe will help bolster their general lead among women voters . according to the cnn/orc poll , hagan has a seven-point advantage among women , while tillis has a six-point margin among men . outside spending groups have helped make the north carolina battle the most expensive senate race this year , with nearly $ 44 million spent by candidates and third parties , according to the center for responsive politics . tillis , the north carolina house speaker , has seen a big turnout in support from high-profile republicans , including romney , former florida gov. jeb bush , and new jersey gov. chris christie . sen. rand paul will campaign for tillis next week . obamadale : the secret weapon that could save iowa democrats ? according to the poll , hagan wins among likely voters with higher incomes , while tillis does better among lower-income voters .  that may be explained by the way wealth is spread across the state -- hagan does best in the charlotte area and around the raleigh-durham triangle , the two geographical areas with a large share of higher-income voters in north carolina ,  holland said . the poll was conducted for cnn by orc international by telephone with 1,010 adult americans on september 22-25 .", "summary": " a new cnn poll shows that the u.s. senate race in north carolina remains tight .   sen. kay hagan holds a narrow edge over her gop challenger .   a libertarian candidate may be pulling part of the republican vote .
