{"text": "misrata , libya on the front lines of libya 's war , rebel fighters say they are finding more than weapons on captured or killed soldiers loyal to ruler moammar gadhafi . rebels say they have confiscated cell phones that contain video showing gadhafi loyalists raping women and torturing people . cnn has obtained a copy of a video shot on a cell phone that appears to show a woman being sexually abused . the person who gave the video to cnn says it was on a cell phone that was confiscated from a gadhafi loyalist . it shows two men in civilian clothes standing over a naked woman who is bent over with her face on the floor . the man standing behind her is sodomizing her with what appears to be a broomstick .  i ca n't bear it ! i ca n't bear it !  the woman cries .  let 's push it farther ,  a male voice says off-camera .  no , no , that 's enough !  the woman begs . eventually , one of the men puts his sock-covered foot on her face . in arab culture , that is considered a major insult . but in this case , it pales in comparison to what the victim is already enduring . arabic speakers who listened to the video at cnn 's request say the voices have tripoli accents . there is no date on the video and the men in it are not wearing military uniforms . cnn has been unable to verify the video 's authenticity , when it was shot , or by whom . the person who gave it to cnn asked not to be identified for fear of being punished by libya 's conservative society . the gadhafi government did not respond to cnn requests for comment on the allegations of abuse . but officials have said in response to similar accusations in the past that the government has not been able to verify the claims and would  welcome  a fact-finding mission . an opposition spokesman says the video illustrates a pattern of abuse .  we were able to confirm that rape was used as a weapon of war , because it was systematic ,  rebel spokesman abdullah al-kabeir said . the rebels have many videos showing other types of torture , and a few depict rape , he said . he did not know exactly how many videos there were showing abuse . one of the most famous faces of libya 's revolution , eman al-obeidy , dramatically claimed in march she had been gang-raped by pro-gadhafi forces . she has since fled the country . a libyan psychologist who has conducted an investigation of her own says al-obeidy 's case is not unique . siham sergewa says she has evidence of hundreds of cases of rape by pro-gadhafi troops . she began her investigation after receiving phone calls from women who said they had been sexually assaulted . her survey of 50,000 people in refugee camps turned up 259 people who said they had been raped , she said last month .  they tie up my husband , they rape me in front of my husband and then they kill my husband ,  sergewa said one woman told her .  i 'm a psychologist and i 've seen lots of things , really . but sometimes after i leave some of these families i just sit in my car and cry because it 's really so painful ,  she said . she has compiled a number of distressing images that she says demonstrate the abuse of alleged victims . one appears to show a cigarette burn on a woman 's breast , another a faded bite mark , while several others show the deep purple hue of nasty bruises . sergewa shared her research , complete with pictures and recordings , with the international criminal court at the hague , netherlands , where prosecutors are investigating accusations that the gadhafi regime has used rape as a tool of war .  the victims are starting to come out ,  the court 's chief prosecutor , luis moreno-ocampo , told cnn thursday .  but in our court the crimes are massive and the crimes we are charging gadhafi with are crimes against humanity , meaning a widespread and systematic attack -- in this case through rapes -- so we do n't need to prove one case ; we need to prove massive numbers of cases .  in this case , the evidence can be different . it could be soldiers who were given instructions on how to do it . the evidence could be doctors or psychologists who have spoken to the victims . that 's the kind of evidence we are collecting .  the court is still in the evidence-collecting stage , he said . for the video to be part of that evidence , its authenticity would have to be certified , he said .  these are interesting pieces , but it is n't the only way to put forward the case . for instance , we have some information of people saying that gadhafi himself was giving instructions . so if we can confirm this evidence , that will be enough to present this type of case as a crime against humanity -- as a widespread campaign of rapes .  moreno-ocampo said he was hoping the judge would soon issue an arrest warrant for gadhafi .  and then the challenge will be to arrest him , because arresting him will be the end to these crimes ,  he said . rebel spokesman al-kabeir , however , said some of the evidence of war crimes that prosecutors want to present in court has been destroyed by a rebel leader .  there was a commander here at the eastern front in misrata named mohamed al-halboos ; he ordered all the -lrb- rebel -rrb- fighters to give him all the rape videos they find on gadhafi soldiers ' cell phones . i heard that he used to destroy every rape video he got ,  al-kabeir said . asked why potential evidence of war crimes being carried out by pro-gadhafi forces would be destroyed by rebel forces , he cited the heavy stigma that libyan culture attaches to the victims of such crimes .  aside from being a heinous crime , rape is perceived here in our culture as damaging not only for the girl , but also the whole family ,  he said . in fact , he added , rape is such a taboo here that some victims ' families would rather erase potential evidence than risk living with the shame . in washington , secretary of state hillary clinton said the united states was  deeply concerned  over the reports of wide-scale rape in libya .  a thorough investigation of this matter is needed to bring perpetrators to justice ,  she said in a statement .  gadhafi 's security forces and other groups in the region are trying to divide the people by using violence against women and rape as tools of war , and the united states condemns this in the strongest possible terms .  cnn 's amir ahmed contributed to this story .", "summary": " cnn sees a video showing a woman being abused by two men .   cnn can not confirm when or where the video was shot .   rebels and experts claim pro-gadhafi forces are raping and torturing .   the stigma of the brutality has reportedly led a rebel commander to erase evidence .
