{"text": "president barack obama 's national security adviser said friday that her full-throated praise of army sgt. bowe bergdahl was appropriate given the former taliban prisoner 's willingness to go to war for his country -- despite questions about whether or not he deserted his army colleagues . susan rice , who on sunday said bergdahl served the united states with  honor and distinction ,  told cnn in an interview that she was speaking about the fact the idaho native enlisted and went to afghanistan in the service of his country .  i realize there has been lots of discussion and controversy around this ,  rice said .  but what i was referring to was the fact that this was a young man who volunteered to serve his country in uniform at a time of war . that , in and of itself , is a very honorable thing .  the obama administration has come under fire for the decision to trade five taliban prisoners previously held at guantanamo bay for bergdahl , who was held for nearly five years . some soldiers who served with bergdahl have claimed he deserted his post in afghanistan . an army-led investigation , which was conducted in the months after bergdahl disappeared in 2009 , found he left the outpost deliberately and on his own free will , according to a military official who was briefed on the report . rice on syria aid . there was no definitive finding that bergdahl deserted , because that would require knowing his intent -- something army officials could n't do without talking to the soldier . the military said it is investigating the matter further . rice said friday that it was essential for the military to hear bergdahl 's side of the story before coming to conclusions about what prompted his capture by the taliban . the six soldiers at center of bergdahl debate .  this is a young man whose circumstances we are still going to learn about ,  she said .  he is , as all americans , innocent until proven guilty . he 's now being tried in the court of public opinion after having gone through enormously traumatic five years of captivity .  if the military finds reason to believe bergdahl deserted his army comrades , consequences will be delivered , rice said .  but in the meantime , let 's remember this is a young man who volunteered to serve his country . he was taken as a prisoner of war . he suffered in captivity ,  she continued .  he 's now trying to begin the process of recovery . let 's let that happen . and then let 's know the facts including his side of the story , and then we can make a judgment .  rice 's comments last weekend were n't the first time she prompted criticism over an appearance on one of washington 's sunday talk shows . in september 2012 , she appeared on several programs following the attack on the american diplomatic post in benghazi , libya -- and asserted the incident was prompted by a spontaneous protest against an anti-muslim video made in the united states . the administration later acknowledged the attack was a terrorist assault on the u.s. compound . the  susan rice talking points  have become a political flashpoint , spurring congressional investigations , administration explanations , and -- potentially -- a major headache for former secretary of state hillary clinton if she runs for president in 2016 . rice has said she was simply providing the best information the administration had at the time -- and on friday , she contended that just because the information she provided that day turned out to be inaccurate does n't mean she 's willfully misleading americans .  i 'm upfront with the american people and i always do my best on behalf of my country and i do my best to tell the facts as i know them ,  she said . in the case of benghazi , rice said she  provided the best information that the u.s. government had at the time .  parts of it turned out to be wrong ,  she said .  i regret that the information i was provided was wrong , that i delivered to the american people . that does n't make me a liar . that makes me a public servant trying to say what we knew at the time .
