{"text": "parents have renamed a christian primary school the ` scrooge academy ' after it banned christmas from the timetable . oasis academy has decided there will be no nativity play for its pupils because of its poor academic performance . the school in nunsthorpe , near grimsby , whose students are aged four to 11 , says the festivities would interrupt pupil learning as it strives to improve achievements in maths and english . stolen christmas : oasis academy has axed its nativity play because it wants children in class because it wants to improve academic performance -lrb- file picture -rrb- . parents believe the children are being deliberately punished because the move came just days after the school , prior to its academy conversion , was ranked last out of 44 in north east lincolnshire in department of education key stage 2 rankings in department of education key stage 2 rankings . amanda markey , whose child attends the school , said : ` they have stolen christmas from the children.it should be called the scrooge academy . where is the fun ? ` they can take children out of class for assemblies but they ca n't find the time to organise a play ? to say they can not have christmas until their grades improve is really unfair . ` surely getting the students to learn a script for a festive play would aid learning , and the performance would build confidence . how can that not be of benefit to their education ? the children are really disappointed ; it has really affected them . ` why ca n't they have a bit of fun on the last days of school ? ' helen merriman-sellars , 38 , whose daughter bethanie , 6 , attends the school , said christmas could have been incorporated into the children 's lessons . she said : ` while i agree that the school needs to focus on education , with a bit of planning they could easily have incorporated things like a nativity into lessons . it 's educational for the children to learn about things like that and it 's also an important part of their childhood . ` they are not at secondary school level , they are just primary school children.there 's also been a lot of bad feeling because the school left it so late in the day to tell us . if they were going to do this , they should have communicated it earlier to save as much upset . ' a spokesperson from oasis academy nunsthorpe said : ` the academy realises that some parents are disappointed that we 're not putting on a christmas play this year . ` this is because such plays take many weeks of rehearsal time and , given the current context at oasis academy nunsthorpe with very low standards of attainment , the academy needs to prioritise and focus rigorously on raising standards in english and maths for all our students . ` to do this , our students need to focus on their school work throughout the term . however , this far from means that we 're not having any other christmas activities and celebrations at the academy and these include a visiting theatre company , special christmas assemblies , a christmas fair , carols around the tree and a christmas dinner for students and their parents to attend . ` in the future , when education standards have been notably raised at the academy , there will be an opportunity to re-introduce termly music and drama productions without compromising the students ' entitlement to success and progress in key areas such and reading , writing and maths . ' and a spokesperson from the oasis group , which runs the academy , said : ` there is a certain irony to the situation , in that people would think a christian organisation would try to cancel christmas . ` christmas has not been cancelled and there have been other festive events put on instead of a nativity play.we understand that might upset some parents but we are trying to do what is best for the students . '", "summary": " oasis academy staff believe weeks of rehearsals would be better used as lessons .   primary school is desperate to improve maths and english standards .   parents say their children are being unfairly punished and teachers have ` stolen ' christmas .
