' the itching sensation is caused by nerves re-growing , or by dry skin due to the lack of natural oil produced because oil glands are often damaged by the burn . as the nerves grow and start to receive and send messages , they can create a severe itching sensation . mrs croule , a family support worker , was enjoying a day out with her family at her allotment when a stray spark from a garden chimney set her jacket alight , causing an instant fireball . her quick-thinking son pushed her to the ground to try to put out the blaze but she had already suffered horrendous burns . mrs croule was taken to the specialist burns unit at nottingham 's queen 's medical centre by air ambulance . she said : ' i had to be operated on sat up and needed lots of skin grafts . they had to rebuild my neck . i was on a lot of morphine and it was all horrendous , but the staff were fantastic . ' she suffered serious burns to her face , neck and hands and needed several skin grafts . but as the burns healed , she was left with an unbearably itchy neck which meant she was unable to sleep . mrs croule even had to have balloons placed underneath the skin of her neck to stretch it - this created undamaged skin that could be used to repair the wounds . medics would not allow her to look at her injuries and no mirrors were allowed in her room . she said : ` they said i had to come to terms with it when i was ready . ' after a month in hospital she was allowed home and saw her disfigurement for the first time . she said : ' i just burst into tears . ' but as her wounds healed , she started experiencing itching day and night . she said : ` once i started , i could n't stop . i 'd often draw blood . i was desperate . ' doctors tried various treatments but nothing worked . it was then that consultant plastic surgeon , mr peter brooks , came up with the idea of using botox . consultant peter brooks thought he could relieve the itching using botox injections . mrs croule was the first person in the world to have this treatment for burns . he said : ` botox can be used to treat . various things . there are lots of good medical uses for botox including . sweating . it 's not just used for cosmetic surgery . ' he had been researching the subject for . some time and asked mrs croule if she would like to take part in a trial . - the first of its kind in the world . mrs croule had balloons placed under her skin to stretch it as a way of creating new undamaged skin . she said : ' i was quite taken aback . when mr brooks mentioned botox . i just thought celebrities used it but i . was willing to try anything . ' i had relief as soon as i had the first injection . there was no itching whatsoever . ` it was a total life saver because i could start sleeping . now , i 'm back at work . i 've got my life back . ` i 'm not sure if it 's made me look any younger though ! ' mr brooks said : ` botox blocks muscle contraction and reduces sweating . people with burns often have their sweat glands destroyed but the nerves are still there , which could , i believed , be the cause of itching . ' i put those things together and thought there was a good chance botox would work . ` karen had relief almost immediately . we have now treated over 50 patients successfully without problems . ' the hospital is now planning to run a trial across the world to show botox is better for chronic burns itching than any other treatments are . the queen 's medical centre will lead the trial and there will also be centres across the uk looking into the effects .", "summary": " karen croule was left fighting for life after a bonfire spark ignited her jacket .   she suffered burns to her face , neck and hands and needed skin grafts .   as the burns healed they were so itchy that she could n't sleep .   she became the first person to have burn scar itching treated with botox .   works by reducing sweating as damaged sweat glands are cause of itching .
