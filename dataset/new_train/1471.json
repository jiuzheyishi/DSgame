{"text": "the kitchen of the future could see all our fancy devices -- even refrigerators and ovens - replaced by a 3d printer which will create meals from cartridges full of carbohydrates , protein powders and oils . the concept might sound rather far-fetched today , but nasa has just given 3d printer firm systems & materials research corporation -lrb- smrc -rrb- a six month , $ 125,000 grant to focus on developing a universal food synthesizer . the device is similar to the ` replicator ' used in several of the star trek tv series which enabled crew members to create their favorite foods . food of the future ? experts are predicting the food in the future could be created using 3d printing technology . nasa is investing in the project because it wants to make it easier to transport nutrients in bulk through space , but smrc 's founder anjan contractor believes the device will ultimately help solve the earth 's looming food crisis . with the earth 's population one day predicted to reach 12 billion people , the strain on our food sources will become immense . ` i think , and many economists think , that current food systems ca n't supply 12 billion people sufficiently , ' contractor told quartz . ` so we eventually have to change our perception of what we see as food . ' in star trek crew members used the ` replicator ' to create their favorite foods and now experts are developing similar devices . the pizza of the future could contain insects instead of cheese and pepperoni . while only the very rich will be able to afford to eat real meat , fish and vegetables , contractor predicts everyone else will eat customized , nutritionally-appropriate meals synthesized one layer at a time , from cartridges of powder and oil they buy at the corner grocery store . with traditional food sources extremely rare , those powders could be anything containing the right organic molecules including insects . dutch technology company tno research has suggested that 3d printing could make it possible to turn food-like starting material , such as algae , insects and grass , into edible meals . pizza is an obvious candidate for 3d printing because it has distinct layers and only requires the print head to create one substance at a time . smrc is working on a prototype 3d food printer which founder anjan contractor believes will ultimately help solve the earth 's looming food crisis . dutch technology company tno research has suggested that 3d printing could make it possible to turn food-like starting material , such as algae , insects and grass , into edible meals . contractor plans to start building his ` pizza printer ' within the next couple of weeks , he has already printed a chocolate bar using the technology . it will work by first ` printing ' a layer of dough , which is baked at the same time it 's printed , by a heated plate at the bottom of the printer . then it will lay down a tomato base , ` which is also stored in a powdered form , and then mixed with water and oil , ' says contractor . finally , the pizza will be topped with a ` protein layer , ' which could come from any source - which eventually might mean insects or algae . video : could 3d printing be the future of food ?", "summary": " nasa is investing in a 3d printer which can create food .   the company behind it believe it could solve the earth 's looming food shortage .   meals would be made from cartridges containing carbohydrates and protein powders .   insects , grass and algae could replace meat and vegetables as the main sources of our protein .
