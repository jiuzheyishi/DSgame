{"text": "a primary school which banned pupils from using black country slang to halt a ` decline in standards ' has revealed the controversial policy seems to have improved children 's reading and writing . parents were furious when school chiefs ordered children to stop speaking the dialect , saying it should be preserved to protect the local identity . staff at colley lane primary school , halesowen , west midlands , drew up a list of ten outlawed phrases such as ' i cor do that ' instead of ' i ca n't do that , ' and ` it wor me ' . parents including alana willetts with her son george , nine , were angry with the ban on black country dialect , but grades in reading and writing have improved . it has emerged that the ban has been a success in the classroom , with pupils achieving higher grades in reading and writing . the number of children gaining key stage 2 reading had improved by seven per cent with 79 per cent of pupils gaining level four . children achieving the higher level five grade in reading has also gone up nine per cent to 41 per cent . headteacher john white said : ` our intention was not to remove any local culture or identity but to give our children the spoken language skills to compete against the best . headteacher john white defended his school 's dialect ` ban ' , saying it will help pupils achieve success . the letter sent out to parents last year gave a list of outlawed phrases , such as ' i cor do that ' instead of ' i ca n't do that , ' and ` it wor me ' ` it would be great to see a more positive view on what we are trying to achieve here . ' last year mr white enraged parents when he told them about the black country ban . here are the phrases pupils at colley lane primary school , in halesowen , have been banned from using : . 1 . ` they was ' instead of ` they were . ' 2 . ' i cor do that ' instead of ' i ca n't do that . ' 3 . ` ya ' instead of ` you . ' 4 . ` gon na ' instead of ` going to . ' 5 . ` woz ' instead of ` was . ' 6 . ' i day ' instead of ' i did n't . ' 7 . ' i ai n't ' instead of ' i have n't . ' 8 . ` somefink ' instead of ` something . ' 9 . ` it wor me ' instead of ` it was n't me . ' 10 . ` ay ? ' instead of ` pardon ? ' in a letter to parents , he said : ` recently we asked each class teacher to write a list of the top ten most damaging phrases used by children in the classroom . ` we are introducing a ` zero tolerance ' in the classroom to get children out of the habit of using the phrases on the list . ` we want the children in our school to have the best start possible : understanding when it is and is not acceptable to use slang and colloquial language . ` we value the local dialect but are encouraging children to learn the skill of turning it on and off in different situations . ' the black country includes dudley , sandwell , walsall , and southern parts of wolverhampton . other words and phrases on the prohibited list include ` ay ' , meaning ` pardon ' , and ' i day ' , meaning ' i did n't ' . alana willetts , 30 , whose nine-year-old son george goes to the school , said staff should be teaching pupils about the black country and its dialect . ` some of my friends have gone on to be doctors and lawyers and i 'm an engineer -- -lsb- the accent -rsb- does n't affect you as a person , ' she said . ' i think it is patronising and insulting to say that people with a black country accent are disadvantaged . all the parents are outraged . ' but zheyan kareem , 31 , who moved to the uk eight years ago and whose seven-year-old son is a pupil , supported the ban , saying : ` english is my second language . so for me ... it is good if my child speaks english in the house and not slang picked up at school . ' the primary school , which has 592 children aged four to 11 and was judged ` good ' at its last ofsted inspection . the number of children gaining key stage 2 at colley lane primary school , halesowen , west midlands , has improved by seven per cent with 79 per cent of pupils gaining level four . the distinctive black country dialect of the ` yam yams ' is spoken in towns like wolverhampton , sandwell , tipton and dudley , and can be very confusing to outsiders . scholars find it fascinating because it has preserved grammar from early modern english and even middle english . ` thee ' , ` thy ' and ` thou ' are still in use , as is the case in parts of yorkshire and lancashire . ` ow b'ist ' , meaning ` how beist thou ? ' is a common greeting , with the typical answer being ` bay too bah ' , meaning ' i bay n't be too bad ' . ' i have n't seen her ' becomes ' i ay sid ` er ' . black country dialect often substitutes the word ` ar ' for ` yes ' . several word pronunciations are also different : ` you ' is pronounced ` yow ' -lrb- pronounced yo with a silent w -rrb- , whereas ` go ' , which is often pronounced ` goo ' or ` gooin  for ` going ' , is more in line with pronunciations in the midlands . the heritage of the west midlands is brought to life at the black country living museum and locals are keen to retain their distinctive dialect . it is also quite common for broad black country speakers to say ` agooin ' instead of ` going ' . inhabitants are proud to be known as black country ` folk ' and resist hints at any relationship to people living in birmingham , calling birmingham ` brum-a-jum ' -lrb- birmingham 's colloquial name is ` brummagem ' , a corruption of its older name of ` bromwicham ' and hence west bromwich -rrb- or ` birminam ' -lrb- missing the g and h out and saying it the way it 's spelt -rrb- . residents of birmingham -lrb- ` brummies ' -rrb- meanwhile often refer to their black country neighbours as ` yam yams ' , a reference to the use of ` yow am ' -lrb- or yow 'm -rrb- instead of ` you are ' , and not because they say ' i yam ' instead of ' i am ' . dudley residents often refer to the people of birmingham as ` dummy brummies ' . also , the town of walsall can be pronounced either ` war-sall ' or ` wor-sull ' , with a strong walsall accent considered to be typical ` yam-yam ' . the strong black country dialect is less commonly heard today than in the past . however , a stronger variation of the dialect -lrb- than the one frequently used -rrb- appears to be heard quite often in conversations between older black country folk . the word endings with ` en ' are still noticeable in conversation as in ` gooen ' -lrb- going -rrb- , ` callen ' -lrb- calling -rrb- and the vowel ` a ' is pronounced as ` o ' as in ` sond ' -lrb- sand -rrb- , ` hond ' -lrb- hand -rrb- and ` mon ' -lrb- man -rrb- . other pronunciations are ` winder ' for window , ` fer ' for ` far ' , and ` loff ' for ` laugh ' exactly as chaucer 's english was spoken . local dialect was -lrb- and probably still is to a lesser degree -rrb- quite distinctive between the different towns and villages of the black country . although most outsiders to the black country ca n't tell this difference , black country folk can quiet fiercely defend the difference between the accent . here is a glossary of black country vocabulary : . aive - lift , heave . bawk - confuse . beesum - a pert young woman . bibble - pebble , stone . blithyed - a fool . bowler - a large moth . boffle - to hinder . bonk - a small hill . broo'us - a brewery . cagmag - a gossipy old woman . caw - can not . chicklings - pig 's intestines -lrb- a black country delicacy -rrb- . codding - joking . fizog - face . flen - a flea . jed - dead . kench - back strain . miskin - an outside toilet . carradiddle - a lie , fib . tranklements - miscellaneous items , paraphernalia . werit - worry .", "summary": " a west midlands primary drew up a list of outlawed black country phrases .   list includes ' i cor do that ' instead of ' i ca n't do that ' and ` it wor me '   staff at colley lane primary school revealed the ban has been a success .   number of pupils with key stage 2 reading has improved by seven per cent .   children achieving higher level five in reading has also gone up nine per cent .
