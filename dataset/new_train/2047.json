{"text": "washington remember rep. paul ryan ? the 2012 republican vice presidential candidate ? he 's still a member of congress . he still represents wisconsin 's 1st congressional district . and he still sits atop of the house budget committee . ryan has fallen out of the national spotlight since the gop election loss , and he has remained largely silent while republicans and democrats battle amid a federal shutdown over how to move forward on a government funding bill and raise the debt ceiling . ryan 's recent reticence is more noticeable because the prominent fiscal matters front and center now highlight his area of expertise . he is known in congress as the budget wonk , the expert on federal government and spending . his colleagues look to him for guidance . in recent years , he unveiled controversial budget blueprints that dramatically cut spending and altered entitlement programs such as social security and medicare . his budgets , titled  path to prosperity ,  became the defining documents for republican fiscal policy . after stepping into the limelight of the presidential campaign last year , he became just as well known for his biceps as his budget , thanks to a time magazine photo shoot . silence shattered . while president barack obama and house speaker john boehner remain at odds over the shutdown and the debt ceiling , and while house republicans are involved in infighting , ryan dipped his toe into the shark tank . he broke his months-long silence with an opinion piece in the wall street journal , putting forward a new path -- how to break the crippling stalemate in washington with ideas that even some democrats support . he did not emerge unscathed . op-ed does n't mention obamacare . ryan took a measured tone in the op-ed . he placed blame on obama for not being willing to negotiate but he implored both sides both sides to sit down at the negotiating table . ryan responds to criticism over op-ed . his idea : his old idea . he proposed  commonsense reforms of the country 's entitlement programs .  2016 ambitions ? ultimately , his timely emergence could be part of a larger plot . as a young politician with a bright future , speculation is rampant that he might be running for the republican presidential nomination in 2016 . that speculation grows louder especially as he plans trips to iowa and new hampshire , the first presidential nominating states . he will keynote a birthday fundraiser for iowa 's republican governor next month and he is to attend a fundraising breakfast for a congressional candidate in new hampshire . while ryan released the op-ed , he continues to play the cautious card , however . cnn has asked every congressional member if they would support a  clean  government funding or debt ceiling bill with no strings attached -- something many republicans are demanding . ryan 's office has not commented . in new book , paul ryan asks ` where do we go from here ? ' ears opened . if his strategy is to speak little but make a big impact , ryan definitely made an impact . it might not have been the one he had hoped . republican sen. john mccain of arizona , who has broken with his party on various issues , championed ryan 's op-ed . via twitter , mccain said ryan 's proposal is a  must read .  but not everyone was so enthusiastic . conservatives jumped on ryan 's for omitting their central demand -- dismantling obamacare - in the government shutdown and debt limit fight . a spokeswoman for the leader of that crusade , sen. ted cruz of texas , aptly noticed the omission .  there is one big work missing from this op-ed . it 's start with an o and ends with bamacare ,  she tweeted . ryan was forced to go on defense instead of push his agenda . appearing on conservative talk show  bill bennett 's morning in america ,  bennett asked ryan if dismantling obamacare was no longer a priority . ryan insisted that it still was .  obamacare 's an entitlement just like any other entitlement ,  ryan said , according to politico .  if you look at the op-ed , i say we have to - ultimately we have to rethink all of our nation 's health care laws .  head of the republican national committee , reince priebus , came to ryan 's defense . he echoed ryan 's defense and said his op-ed included  obamacare ,  even though it did n't specifically mention it . at a weekly meeting of house conservative lawmakers that ryan regularly attends , he attempted to explain the position he laid out in the wall street journal . but some conservatives still insist that obamacare be tied to any deal . ryan dodged reporters after the meeting . opinion : goodbye to the strategy republicans knew was a fantasy . the dilemma . twenty years ago , ryan worked for the conservative organization empower america , which later became freedomworks . while that organization successfully morphed from a group that promoted traditional fiscal conservatism and neoconservative foreign policies into a limited government tea party aligned group . is paul ryan an empower america republican ? or a freedomworks republican ? there lies ryan 's dilemma . it 's the same scenario that is plaguing the republican party and also dictating the current debate in washington . republican strategist and former romney spokesman ryan williams his op-ed shows that he 's  the adult in the room .   he felt that it was important for him to speak up to address the seemingly never-ending stalemate that we 're witnessing in washington ,  williams added . but the conservatives intent on stopping the health care law at all political costs are n't interested in ending the stalemate if it does n't end obamacare . lisa miller , founder of the washington-based tea party wdc , said she hopes the government shutdown leads to the chipping away of the health care law .  paul ryan is a numbers guy ; i just do n't like his numbers ,  miller said . williams insisted that ryan has already proven his conservative credentials but his op-ed shows he 's a  realist  given the miniscule probability that republicans have in undoing the health care law . given the push back ryan has received , three years before the presidential election , ryan might have to decide if he 's going to be a  realist  or a modern day , tea party conservative if he aspires to higher political office . supporters stand by representatives , and government shutdown .", "summary": " paul ryan has fallen out of the national spotlight since last year 's gop loss in presidential election .   and the wisconsin republican house member has remained largely silent during budget crisis .   but he now has dipped is toe into the controversy , writing an opinion piece that grabbed attention .   ryan offered ideas , called for negotiation but omitting gop obamacare demands was noticed .
