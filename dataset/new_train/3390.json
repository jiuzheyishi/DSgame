{"text": "scientists have developed breakthrough drugs that cure skin cancer . the treatment is already having ` spectacular ' effects in seriously ill melanoma patients -- and could soon be used to defeat other types of cancer . one scientist said it was ` amazing ' that researchers could talk of ` using the c-word -- cure ' for the first time , while another said trials among kidney and lung cancer patients are ` very exciting ' . each year almost 13,000 people in britain are diagnosed with melanoma , including two people aged 15 to 34 every day . one in six patients ravaged by deadly skin cancer are already being cured by the drugs , the european cancer congress was told yesterday , with the possibility of more than half being saved with an new combination . the astonishing development will save the lives of thousands of patients with advanced melanoma , who usually die within months of being diagnosed . the new treatment , which will bring hope to hundreds of thousands of people in britain with terminal conditions , involves the combination of two different types of drug that ` reboot ' the immune system . the first is ipilimumab -- or ` ipi ' . according to research presented to the european congress in amsterdam yesterday , 17 per cent of patients are cured by this drug alone . but many more -- perhaps more than half -- could be ` clinically cured ' by combining them with even newer drugs called anti-pd1s which break down cancer cells ' defences . professor alexander eggermont of the institut gustave roussy in france said : ` -lsb- advanced -rsb- melanoma could become a curable disease for perhaps more than 50 per cent of patients within five to 10 years . ' he told the mail on sunday : ` if i 'd made this bizarre prediction five years ago , people would have said i was mad . but it now looks like we are going to have control of advanced melanoma for years , in a substantial proportion of patients . ' each year almost 13,000 people in britain are diagnosed with melanoma , including two people aged 15 to 34 every day . it kills 2,200 a year , accounting for four in five skin cancer deaths . the number of cases has quadrupled in 30 years , due in part to our fondness for foreign holidays to sunny destinations . if caught early enough , malignant moles can be cut out before the cancer spreads , but if it is missed and the cancer turns ` metastatic ' -- spreading to other organs -- chances of long term survival plummet . at that stage patients are usually told they have just months to live . currently , less than a quarter survive a year or more . prof eggermont believed these new immunotherapy drugs would be adopted ` across the board ' to successfully treat a wide range of other advanced ` solid tumour ' cancers . he said : ` these drugs are going to help a large number of people . it 's a massive deal . reports from trials with patients who have advanced kidney and lung cancer are very exciting . ' in one lung cancer trial using anti-pd1 drugs , tumours markedly shrank in a quarter of very ill patients who had failed to respond to chemotherapy , he said . trials had also been started in patients with prostate , bowel and breast cancer . prof stephen hodi , of the dana-farber cancer institute in boston , found encouraging results in the survival chances of almost 5,000 melanoma patients put on ipi . ` this is a really amazing time , ' he said . ` a few years ago we could never have imagined using the c-word -- cure -- in melanoma . but we are headed that way . ' cancer scientists have tried for decades to create drugs which help the immune system fight cancer , but until very recently immunotherapy appeared to be a dead-end . prof eggermont said 24 of his 27 years in the field had been ` very difficult . . . i could n't see the light at the end of the tunnel . ' most attempts had failed because they had concentrated on the wrong thing : activating cancer-fighting t-cells , rather than breaking down the tumours ' defences . he said : ` all these attempts ended when they came up against the wall of defence . we needed to break down that wall and open up the tumour to attack , which ipi and the anti-pd1s do in different ways . now it 's a totally different ball game . ' british experts yesterday said there was ` enormous excitement ' at the new drugs -- although they stressed it was still early days . professor peter johnson , chief clinician at cancer research uk , said : ` we have always thought that if you can get the immune system to respond to a tumour , then it 's likely to be a long-lasting effect , because the immune system is designed to last for life . so it 's very exciting that we are starting to see it working . ' dr james larkin , of the royal marsden hospital in london , said ipi alone was ` a vast improvement ' on previous treatment . ` traditionally , when melanoma has spread to other organs , it is regarded as incurable . so this is big news . ` it 's difficult to know that we have actually ` cured ' people , because we have to wait to see if they die from something else . but all this new ipi data points to the fact that if you respond to the drug and are still alive three years after treatment , then it 's very likely that you are clinically cured . it 's a very big story . ' the breakthrough comes after david cameron announced the extension of a # 200 million-a-year budget to pay for cancer treatments denied to nhs patients because rationing body nice believes they are poor value for money . ipi is already available on the nhs , under the brand name yervoy , although its course of four treatments is very expensive . dr larkin is now working on a trial to combine ipi with anti-pd1 and said early results have shown ` spectacular levels of tumour shrinkage ' . initial trial results presented earlier this year showed that tumours shrank by more than half in 11 per cent of patients put on ipi , in 41 per cent put on anti-pd1s -- but in 53 per cent of those given both . professor paul workman of the institute of cancer research described the immune-boosters as ` a real breakthrough ' , adding : ` i think we will have the expertise to take more patients to five , ten years -lsb- of life -rsb- and eventually cure them . ' charlotte fionda of the karen clifford skin cancer charity said : ` it is really encouraging to see positive data . we hope that this is just the beginning .
