{"text": "hong kong conservationists are optimistic hong kong will move to destroy its huge stockpile of confiscated ivory -- believed to be one of the world 's biggest -- following china 's landmark destruction of six tons of tusks and ivory sculptures this week . hong kong , one of the principal gateways to mainland china , has previously opted not to destroy its stockpile of the illegal  white gold  -- most of which is seized en route to the mainland -- opting instead to hold it in secret warehouses , sending small amounts to schools for educational purposes . china is the world 's largest ivory market , accounting for an estimated 70 % of global consumption , according to the international fund for animal welfare -lrb- ifaw -rrb- . but a spokeswoman for hong kong 's agriculture , fisheries and conservation department said a committee would consider alternate means of dealing with the stockpile of  about 30 tons  of contraband ivory held by the chinese special administrative region -lrb- sar -rrb- , a hub of the global ivory trade , at a meeting later this month . the department had been trialing means of destroying ivory , including incineration , she said . activists are hopeful hong kong will be encouraged to emulate the recent example of china , which took the symbolic gesture of crushing of tons of ivory in the southern guangdong province monday . the public demolition , which took place before diplomats , conservationists and media , came a month after china pledged at an african elephant summit in botswana to take action to combat ivory trading . the quantity destroyed by china -- the first occasion the superpower has destroyed any of its stockpile -- amounted to about one-sixth of the illegal ivory confiscated worldwide in 2012 , according to ifaw estimates .  the government of china took a stand finally on the issue and made a symbolic gesture to say to the world they want to join the global fight against the illegal wildlife trade ,  said activist alex hofford of lobby group hong kong for elephants . given hong kong 's close relationship with china and with key trading partner the united states , which similarly destroyed its entire 6-ton stockpile of ivory in november ,  i do n't very well see how -lrb- hong kong -rrb- can not  follow suit , he said . the destruction of seized ivory hordes has also taken place in the philippines , gabon , and kenya in recent years .  there 's a bit of a pattern emerging , a global trend now to get rid of the ivory stockpiles ,  said hofford , adding that hong kong 's trove would be by far the largest to be destroyed . read more : chinese construction camps eyed as ivory conduits in republic of congo . conservation groups have been calling on governments to destroy their stockpiles , which often require substantial resources to keep secure , in order to help wipe out the demand for ivory and prevent the product returning to market . according to the convention on international trade on endangered species , a large amount of confiscated african ivory goes missing every year . more crucially , said hofford , public destruction also sends a powerful message to potential buyers .  it sends a really strong signal to consumers in china that it 's morally reprehensible -- it 's the wrong thing to do , and by buying illegal wildlife products , they 're directly contributing to the poaching crisis in africa ,  he said . a survey of 900 middle and upper middle class chinese , commissioned by national geographic last year , found nearly 60 % of respondents believed that strong government directives not to purchase ivory would be the most effective way to counter the trade . the survey also found that chinese consumers associated ivory products with luxury and prestige . according to jeff he , special assistant to the asia regional director at the international fund for animal welfare , a rise in demand from asia , and especially china , in recent years has fueled the black market and put increasing pressure on african elephants in the wild . the elephant population in africa has now shrunk to around half a million , from 1.2 million in 1980 . nearly one hundred african elephants are killed for their tusks every day , according to the wildlife conservation society . hofford said that incinerating , not merely crushing , the ivory was a key consideration , as the crushing process would chunks of ivory large enough that they could still be worked into trinkets and returned to the ivory market . read more : hong kong 's seized ivory

confiscated ivory .   they want it incinerated to wipe out demand and prevent it returning to market .   as gateway to china , world 's biggest ivory consumer , hong kong has enormous stockpile .   china 's move to crush tons of ivory this week may inspire hong kong to follow suit .
