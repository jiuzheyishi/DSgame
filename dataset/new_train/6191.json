{"text": "hope : the prime minister said he aims to increase devolution after the 2015 general election . david cameron has warned left-wing parties they will ` reap what they sow ' if they punish scots with higher taxes . writing exclusively in today 's scottish daily mail , the prime minister says he will ` seek support ' from other parties to deliver the biggest shake-up of devolution after the 2015 general election . his predecessor gordon brown also paved the way for a formal cross-party pact on devolution yesterday as he argued that westminster is united on the issue . if there is a no vote in september , the . scottish conservatives have proposed giving msps full control over . income tax , allowing them to raise and lower each rate . the party also wants to give holyrood a share of the vat raised in scotland , the ability to increase welfare payments and control of housing benefit . labour wants the scottish parliament to be in charge of a 15p share of the basic 20p rate of income tax , and be able to increase higher bands -- but not lower them unless all levels are reduced . the party also believes there should be the power to create a new council tax band , allowing the scottish government to introduce a ` mansion tax ' . the snp favours a ` progressive ' tax system and could use the new powers -- if there is a no vote -- to hammer higher earners . but mr cameron writes in today 's mail : ` you can be sure that scottish conservatives will be at the forefront of promoting low-tax , pro-enterprise policies within a scottish parliament with enhanced responsibilities . ` if the parties of the left want to argue for higher personal taxes for scotland compared to the rest of the uk , then let them reap what they sow . ' agreeing to disagree : david cameron -lrb- right -rrb- and scotland 's first minister alex salmond -lrb- left -rrb- sign the scottish independence referendum agreement at st andrews house in edinburgh . he adds : ` the strathclyde report -lsb- on further devolution -rsb- is a clear , coherent and conservative blueprint for the next stage of scotland 's devolution journey . we will take them forward in our 2015 general election manifesto and seek support to deliver them in the new parliament . ` all the mainstream pro-uk parties believe in further devolution , so whilst we would want to build consensus for a set of measure and legislation , there is no reason why these changes should n't happen early in the next parliament . ' mr brown said : ` it is definitely possible now to see an agreement about extra tax powers and extra policy powers for the scottish parliament . ` so the argument that the scottish national party have been putting across over these last few months that nothing will happen if there is a no vote in september is completely wrong . ' i believe in devolution because i 'm a conservative , not despite being one . two principles that i hold dear are that governments have a responsibility carefully to spend public money ; and that where possible decisions should be taken as close to the people affected by them . these two principles are at the heart of the scottish conservatives ' proposals for improving scotland 's devolution settlement , outlined this week by ruth davidson and strongly supported by me . the strathclyde report is a clear , coherent and conservative blueprint for the next stage of scotland 's devolution journey . we will take them forward in our 2015 general election manifesto and seek support to deliver them in the new parliament . all the mainstream pro-uk parties believe in further devolution , so whilst we would want to build consensus for a set of measure and legislation , there is no reason why these changes should n't happen early in the next parliament . the scottish parliament already runs schools , hospitals and other vital services and decides how to spend two-thirds of all public expenditure in scotland . however the scottish parliament has to date had little responsibility for raising the money it spends . we have started to put that right . in 2012 the coalition government passed legislation to give the scottish parliament more responsibility for funding scottish public services . the strathclyde recommendations go further . under these proposals the scottish parliament would have the power to decide how to fund up to half of what it spends . these are real powers with real consequences . for the first time the scottish government and msps in holyrood will be accountable for how much of your pay packet stays in your wallet and how much goes to the tax man . and when you buy goods or services in scotland , the report says a share of that money should stay in scotland , to make up part of the scottish government 's budget . it gives the scottish parliament a greater stake in supporting a thriving economy . and you can be sure that scottish conservatives will be at the forefront of promoting low-tax , pro-enterprise policies within a scottish parliament with enhanced responsibilities . if the parties of the left want to argue for higher personal taxes for scotland compared to the rest of the uk , then let them reap what they sow . it is the conservatives who are delivering on devolution . we are at the heart of the constitutional debate . we do n't just talk a good game -- we lead and we act . a referendum in wales to give its assembly new law-making powers - delivered . the recommendations of the calman commission -- the biggest act of fiscal devolution to scotland for over 300 years - delivered . first time tax powers to the welsh assembly -- being delivered . city deals to enhance local democracy -- being delivered . but there 's more to do -- and we have a plan for the future . and the people of scotland understand that the only threat to devolution is alex salmond and his separation plans . they know that opportunity to take domestic decisions within scotland whilst retaining the strength , security and stability of being part of the united kingdom is the best of both worlds . ruth has charted a very clear course for the future of the country she loves . she has my wholehearted support as together we seek to build an even stronger scotland with our uk family of nations . we delivered on devolution in this parliament . we will deliver in the next .", "summary": " prime minister aims to increase devolution after 2015 general election .   says he will ` seek support ' from other parties for a shake-up of powers .   warned left-wing parties they are encouraging scots to seek independence .   said a ` yes ' vote at referendum is more likely after threats to increase taxes .
