{"text": "a cash-strapped spanish baroness is hoping one of her prized constable paintings will fetch # 25million at auction so she can ` ease her cash flow situation ' . baroness carmen thyssen-bornemisza , who founded the madrid art museum bearing her surname , said her country 's recession was ` also affecting collectors ' . it had forced her , she said , to sell british painter john constable 's the lock - finished in 1824 and the last of the stour series , which includes his famous work the hay wain , to be privately owned . for sale : the lock , by british painter john constable , is up for grabs at christie 's auction house in london in july . reluctant : baroness carmen thyssen-bornemisza said she did not want to sell her constable painting . ' i need the money , i really need it , i have no liquidity , ' the owner of an art collection worth more than # 800million told spanish reporters in a staggeringly frank admission . she added : ' i am very austere with my life , but to maintain the collection requires lots of costs . ' i have had # 640million of art work lent for free to the spanish state over the last 13 years . i did not want to sell this . ` it has given me a lot of pain to lose this painting , that myself and my husband bought at an auction in 1990 , but if god chooses i will not have to sell any more . ' art home : the thyssen-bonemisza museum is located in the 19th century villahermosa palace in madrid . couple : carmen thyssen-bornemisza -lrb- left -rrb- and her late husband baron hans heinrich -lrb- right -rrb- build up a formidable art collection which has become the envy of the world . the lock , to be sold at christie 's auction house in london on july 3 , depicts a man operating a wooden canal lock gate in preparation for a boat to pass through . a rural church is visible in the distance . it was first acquired by 19th century collector james morrison at the royal academy 's summer exhibition in the year it was completed . baron hans heinrich thyssen-bornemisza was one of europe 's richest men in the latter half of the 20th century - and following in his father baron heinrich 's footsteps he became one of the world 's greatest art collectors . using wealth generated from the large industrial conglomerate inherited from his father , he preserved and augmented the outstanding collection of old master pictures formed in the 1920s and 1930s . he also significantly expanded the range through his own acquisitions , most particularly of the work of european and american artists from the 19th and 20th centuries . his father 's collection included masterpieces by european masters including hans holbein the younger , albrecht durer , jan van eyck , domenico ghirlandaio and caravaggio . it was largely displayed at the villa favorita , a 17th century mansion on lake lugano acquired from prince friedrich leopold of prussia in 1932 . baron hans heinrich added more than 200 paintings , as well acquiring over 900 more modern works which were completely outside his father 's range of interest . as his collection increased in scale , he began to focus on the possibility of finding it a suitable , permanent home . in the mid-1980s , the main body of the collection was placed into a trust and in 1992 the thyssen-bornemisza museum was opened in the newly refurbished 19th century villahermosa palace in madrid . carmen thyssen-bornemisza shared her now deceased husband 's passion for collecting and they spent much of their marriage visiting museums , art galleries and auction houses . the thyssen-bornemisza 's bought it at auction for # 10.8 million in 1990 - at the time a world record price for any british work of art . it has since been in the collection at the madrid museum - which the couple opened in 1992 in the refurbished 19th century villahermosa palace after placing their collection into a trust some years before . the baroness tried to sell it to a british collector last year for # 30million , but the deal was never sealed . she also tried to negotiate with the spanish state , saying : ' i offered it at a special price , to be paid in installments , but we could not reach a deal . ' she also revealed that the museum has been been hit the country 's economic crisis , with caja madrid recently cancelling its long-standing annual # 1.75 million sponsorship . but it is not her most valuable painting , which is the mata mua by gauguin , which has been valued at around # 120million . constable himself said of the lock : ` it looks most beautifully silvery , windy and delicious - it is all health - and the absence of everything stagnant , and is wonderfully got together . ' jussi pylkkanen , president of christie 's europe , middle east , russia and india , called the piece ` an outstanding masterpiece of european art ' . he said : ` this superb landscape , coming from the same series as the hay wain , represents british landscape painting at its very best . ' richard knight , co-chairman of old master and british paintings department , and john stainton , international director , british paintings , said : ` the sale of this painting will be a moment of huge significance for the art market , and for that of old master paintings in particular . ` in 2006 we combined the forces of our old master and early british paintings departments due to the broadening international appeal for works dependent on their quality , as opposed to the nationality of the artist . ` since then we have seen british art reach new heights and have broken records for a number of the greatest british artists including stubbs , gainsborough and lawrence . ` we look forward very much to presenting this hugely significant work of art to the world 's leading collectors and museums .
