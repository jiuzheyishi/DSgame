{"text": "chengdu , china miss chen stares curiously at the ipad . even though she works overtime in a factory in southwestern china that manufactures them , she 's never seen the finished product .  wow , i want it ,  said chen , brushing her finger across the glossy screen with curiosity and amazement . the 18-year-old student from a village outside of the southern megacity of chongqing is one of more than one million factory workers at a chinese company that helps manufacture products for apple inc. 's lucrative global empire , which raked in a record $ 46.3 billion in sales last quarter . at a factory about an hour west of sichuan 's capital chengdu , foxconn technology group , one of apple 's biggest manufacturing partners . foxconn employs hundreds of thousands who work day or night shifts , eating and sleeping at company facilities , as they help build electronics products for apple and many other global brand names , such as amazon 's kindle and microsoft 's xbox . chen 's name has been changed for this story . she told cnn that all her foxconn colleagues have been instructed not to talk to any reporter or  criminal liability shall be investigated according to law .  rights groups like hong kong-based china labour bulletin and students and scholars against corporate misbehavior say that foxconn 's stringent military-like culture is one of surveillance , obedience and not challenging authority . workers are told obey or leave . it 's an oppressive culture that labor groups say contributed to a slew of suicides in 2010 at the company 's shenzhen plant -- prompting foxconn to install nets in an effort to prevent employees from jumping . as a poor college student with no work experience , looking for job in china 's competitive market is an uphill battle . so when chen was offered a one-month position at foxconn during the spring festival -- with promises of great benefits and little overtime , she jumped at the chance . her heart fell after arriving at the foxconn factory , when she found out only senior employees get such benefits and sick leaves . ms. chen said she 's also forced to work overtime on a regular basis .  during my first day of work , an older worker said to me , ` why did you come to foxconn ? do n't ever think about it again and leave right now ' ,  said chen , who plans to return to her studies at a chongqing university soon .  foxconn employees have a saying ,  they use women as men and men as machines .  foxconn is a part of taiwan 's hon hai precision industry co. which supplies ipads and iphones . foxconn recently released a statement defending its corporate practices , stating its employees are entitled to numerous benefits including access to health care and opportunities for promotions and training .  foxconn takes our responsibility to our employees very seriously and we work hard to give our 1.2 million employees in china a safe and positive working environment and compensation and benefits that are competitive with all of our industry peers in that location ,  said foxconn in an email statement to cnn . in response to questions from cnn , apple released this statement :  we care about every worker in our worldwide supply chain . we insist that our suppliers provide safe working conditions , treat workers with dignity and respect , and use environmentally responsible manufacturing processes wherever apple products are made . our suppliers must live up to these requirements if they want to keep doing business with apple .  apple officials also noted last month it became the first company admitted to the fair labor association ,  a leading nonprofit organization dedicated to improving conditions for workers around the world .  in an email to apple employees , ceo tim cook said the company cares about every worker and  any accident is deeply troubling , and any issue with working conditions is cause for concern .  despite widespread reports of poor working conditions , some experts say foxconn factories still offer better benefits and surroundings than most factories in china -- providing air conditioning , heating and clean dorms for its employees .  these companies are making huge profits but workers feel that they are not getting a fair share ,  said geoffrey crothall of china labour bulletin .  but just because apple is making a profit does n't mean they are passing that onto foxconn ; the margins are slim .  crothall said it 's important to empower workers . but it 's also a challenge for apple to find a manufacturer that delivers the quality and speed foxconn can with its vast resources , he added . after three weeks of applying more than 4,000 stickers a day onto ipad screens by hand and working 60 hours a week in an assembly line , chen says she 's ready to go back to school and study hard so she 'll never have to return to foxconn .  it 's so boring , i ca n't bear it anymore . everyday is like : i get off from work and i go to bed . i get up in the morning , and i go to work . it is my daily routine and i almost feel like an animal ,  said ms. chen , who aspires to become a biologist . when asked why humans do machine-like work at foxconn , she responds ,  well , humans are cheaper .
