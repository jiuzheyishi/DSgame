{"text": "i grew up under the impression that i was the best trick-or-treater in the whole wide world , because my grandmother invented it ! the whole thing was her idea ! my grandmother and her friend unicef started it way back when she was born in the early 1500s . i thought unicef must be a pretty cool lady if she was hanging out with my grandmother . occasionally i 'll ask people if they know about unicef , and sometimes they do n't . but if i then mention the little orange trick-or-treat boxes on halloween , suddenly everyone knows unicef . we grew up carrying those trick-or-treat for unicef boxes on halloween night , and now our kids do . these days , the candy bags may be fancier than pillowcases , and the costumes may come from the store , but the orange boxes remain the same . in 1950 when trick-or-treat for unicef began , kids simply decorated old milk cartons to collect change . the idea was as simple then as it is today : on halloween , besides asking for candy , why not also ask for unicef donations ? nothing that might sting , nothing big -- just the pennies , nickels , dimes and quarters that normally languish behind the couch , in old winter coats , on the floor of the car , or in the good ole spare-change-bowl-by-the-door . the money that falls through the cracks -- so american kids may raise a little money for their peers who are suffering , far away from costumes and candy . since halloween 1950 , that  simple plan ,  that  nothing big ,  has raised more than $ 144 million for unicef . that 's $ 144 million in pennies , nickels , dimes and quarters ! for many kids who are threatened by disease , natural disasters and war in places like somalia , bangladesh , myanmar and too many other developing countries , this spare change has meant the difference between thriving and merely surviving , health and illness , even life and death . in fact , the $ 144 million in small change has contributed to some remarkable news : about 50 years ago , the number of children who died every day from preventable causes before their fifth birthday was more than 50,000 . three years ago , that number was 25,500 . despite a recession , despite the continuing effects of a global food crisis , despite other seemingly unbeatable odds , that number has now dropped to 24,000 . trick-or-treaters like you and me , your kids and mine , and members of civic groups like key club , can feel some pride that we have helped make this happen . but the appalling fact remains : 24,000 children die every day from preventable causes like hunger , measles , pneumonia and tetanus . the vaccines , medicines and technologies that can prevent and treat such illnesses already exist . not one child should die from these illnesses in the year 2009 . it 's projected that americans will spend about $ 4.75 billion on halloween this year , buying everything from candy and costumes , smoke machines and life-size inflatable lawn ornaments . but i bet that this year , like last year and many years prior , there 's still change behind that couch and in those old coats . we need that simple plan : a  nothing big  again this year . not only to help those children , but to teach our own kids . we can get 24,000 down to zero . and we can show our kids that they can make a difference ; that every penny counts , that they can save a child and change the world . so they 'll carry the boxes now , you and i can fill the bowl by the door to the brim and be ready , and this year trick-or-treat for unicef can make that change . it turns out that although my grandmother did establish the u.s. fund for unicef , and was president for over 25 years , and while she was a great lady , she did not , in fact , invent halloween . or trick-or-treating . she just perfected it . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of téa leoni .", "summary": " téa leoni suggests that trick-or-treaters ask for unicef donations along with candy .   actress urges readers to gather up their spare change for a worthy cause .   small donations help keep children from dying of hunger and disease .   leoni 's grandmother established the u.s. fund for unicef and was its president .
