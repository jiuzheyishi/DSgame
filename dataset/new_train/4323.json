{"text": "even after the identification of the boston bombing suspects through grainy security-camera images , officials say that blanketing a city in surveillance cameras can create as many problems as it solves . a network of cameras on city streets and other public spaces increases the chances of capturing a criminal on video but can generate an overwhelming amount of evidence to sift through . the cameras make some people feel more secure , knowing that bad guys are being watched . but privacy advocates and other citizens are uneasy with the idea that big brother is monitoring their every public move . meanwhile , facial-recognition software and other technologies are making security-camera images more valuable to law enforcement . now , software can automatically mine surveillance footage for information , such as a specific person 's face , and create a giant searchable database . after last week 's bombings at the boston marathon , authorities had to sift through a mountain of footage from government surveillance cameras , private security cameras and imagery shot by bystanders on smartphones . it took the fbi only three days to release blurry shots of the two suspects , taken by a department store 's cameras . compare their quick turnaround with the 2005 london bombings , when it took thousands of investigators weeks to parse the city 's cctv -lrb- closed-circuit television -rrb- footage after the attacks . the cameras , software and algorithms have come a long way in eight years . cities under surveillance . in major cities , in the age of terrorism , someone is almost always watching . the cameras used in london are part of the city 's extensive and sophisticated  ring of steel  surveillance system that combines nearly a half million cameras , roadblocks and license plate readers to monitor the heart of the city . set up in 1998 , the system is one of the most advanced in the world and allows authorities to track anyone going into or out of central london . many residents question the effectiveness of london 's system , however . in 2008 , only one crime was solved for every 1,000 cameras , according to the city 's police . cctv cameras across britain also cost authorities nearly $ 800 million over the past four years , according to civil liberties group big brother watch . modeled after london 's system , new york 's lower manhattan security initiative monitors 4,000 security cameras and license plate readers south of canal street . the project uses feeds from both private and public security cameras , which are are all monitored 24 hours a day by the nypd . using face and object-detection technology , the police can track cars and people moving through 1.7 square miles in lower manhattan and even detect unattended packages . the $ 150 million initiative also includes a number of radiation detectors and automatic roadblocks that can can be used to stop traffic in an emergency . boston 's camera network is smaller than those in london and new york , though that is likely to change soon . in 2007 , boston law enforcement had an estimated 55 cctv cameras set up around the city . since then , the city has expanded its surveillance system , though authorities there are not commenting on the exact scope of the current camera setup . boston 's example has shown the power of these systems to help solve crimes , causing many to call for even more cameras . but it 's still not clear whether they are effective at preventing crimes . according to the surveillance studies centre at queen 's university in ontario , urban surveillance systems have not been proven to have any effect on deterring criminals . facial recognition . as the volume and quality of cameras and sensors are ramped up , cities are turning to more advanced face - and object-recognition software to makes sense of the data .  we describe what 's in the video , and we store that in a database ,  said al shipp , ceo of san francisco-based 3vr , one of several companies that makes this type of facial-recognition technology . the company 's first investor was in-q-tel , the cia 's venture-capital arm , which finds and funds promising security-related technology . now , 3vr works with federal and local law enforcement agencies , as well as private companies and banks . its software can identify objects by shape , size and color . it can read license plates and recognize cars . when it comes to people , it can detect their gender , approximate age , mood and other demographic information . using multiple cameras , it can track their patterns and some behaviors . it automatically zooms in on any person 's face and identifies them based on things like the distance between their eyes or the shape of their nose . all that information is stored in a database . big clues that would take a traditional investigator untold hours of watching video to uncover can be found with a 15-second search query . opinion : surveillance state no answer to terror . for example , they could do a search for anyone who entered a 7-eleven store between 8 and 11 p.m. on a specific night , pull up the times that certain cars have entered and left a parking lot , or ask for images of every person who has entered a certain building over the past year .  it instantaneously gives you a picture of everybody who has walked in the door in the past based on the geometries of their face ,  shipp said . privacy concerns . civil-liberties activists are concerned about how this technology could be abused . with cameras in far-flung cities all connecting to the same database , a person 's movements can be tracked across states or continents . for example , it could be used to single out a person attending multiple political protests .  we like to think we have some privacy in our lives , that we can go places that we do n't necessarily want the government to know about ,  said said jennifer lynch , an attorney at the electronic frontier foundation , an internet civil-liberties group .  what concerns me is if all of those cameras get linked together at some point , and if we apply facial recognition on the back end , we 'll be able to track people wherever they go .  for now , many of the biometrics databases in the united states are still separated . some are scattered across various federal and local government agencies , and connecting them will take time and big budgets . the fbi is in the process of building out its own facial-recognition database and is working with state dmvs to access their photos . it 's less likely the government will be able to tap into private databases anytime soon , but it 's still a cause for concern down the line , privacy advocates say . facebook has the largest facial-recognition database in the world , a potentially rich vein of data for any government agency . another worry is the misidentification of suspects . shipp acknowledges that these systems can make mistakes but says the computers are n't there to take over for humans but to assist investigators by weeding out useless information .  the cameras themselves are not a panacea . they 're not going to solve the problem . it 's one of the steps ,  he said . but at least one prominent tech blogger thinks the benefits of surveillance cameras outweigh our fears about privacy .  the idea of submitting to constant monitoring feels wrong , nearly un-american , to most of us . cameras in the sky are the ultimate manifestation of big brother -- way for the government to watch you all the time , everywhere ,  farhad manjoo wrote last week in slate . but manjoo thinks we need to be thinking about ways to make cameras work for us , not reasons to abolish them .  when you weigh cameras against other security measures , they emerge as the least costly and most effective choice . in the aftermath of 9/11 , we 've turned most public spaces into fortresses -- now , it 's impossible for you to get into tall buildings , airports , many museums , concerts , and even public celebrations without being subjected to pat-downs and metal detectors . when combined with competent law enforcement , surveillance cameras are more effective , less intrusive , less psychologically draining , and much more pleasant than these alternatives . ", "summary": " new technology makes it easier to identify suspects in surveillance photos and video .   the boston bombing suspects were identified on security-camera footage .   cities such as new york and london now have thousands of cameras on the streets .   facial-recognition software can detect age , gender and even moods .
