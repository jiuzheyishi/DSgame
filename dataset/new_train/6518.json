{"text": "a swiss zoo has provoked an outcry after putting down a brown bear cub because it was being bullied by its ` jealous ' father . the cub was among two born earlier this year to misha and masha , who were gifts from then-russian president dmitry medvedev in 2009 . but keepers at bern 's dahlholzi zoo refused to separate the animals - even after misha killed his other cub in front of horrified families last week . horrified : the cub , pictured , was put down by keepers this week at dahlholzi zoo in the swiss capital bern . distress : the cub , nicknamed baby bear 4 , was not separated from its father even after its twin baby bear 3 was killed in the enclosure . it is common for males and even females to kill their own cubs . keepers claimed the mother of the cub , right , was neglecting it and they could not account for nature 's course . when 360kg male misha started being aggressive towards baby bear 4 , as the cub was called , zoo chiefs decided to kill it instead of raising it in solitude . but . swiss animal protection , the country 's oldest and largest animal rights group , was in uproar . it condemned the action in the ` strongest possible terms ' and said the zoo has massively . mishandled the situation . a . spokesman for the group added : ` it is not natural to keep the male bear . with the offspring , and there was more than enough space to have kept . him in a separate part of the cage . ' in . the wild , female bears typically drive away males to protect cubs because . males can see them as rivals and attempt to kill them . despite this , the zoo defended its position even after the first cub was killed last wednesday . keepers said separating misha or masha from their cub would lead to other problems , and cause lasting damage for the welfare of all the bears involved . attack : horrified families looked on last week as misha killed the first of the two cubs , pictured . males often turn against their cubs because they see them as competition , and even females can attack their young . killed : the other cub , baby bear 3 , being mauled by its father last week . torn apart : 360kg male misha killed his other cub -lrb- pictured -rrb- last wednesday but keepers kept their policy . pictured : the cub which was killed last week . switzerland 's animal rights group condemned the decision . j√ºrg hadorn , the zoo 's deputy director , said : ` after 12 weeks it was clear that masha was irreparably neglecting her role as mother of cub number four . ` together with the fact that the male bear misha had started demonstrating the same aggressive behaviour as he did to cub number three , in order to protect cub number four from more stress and pain , we decided to act . as a result the baby bear was euthanised by a vet . ` it remains unclear now as then as to why our bears behaved in this way . after killing cub number three on april 2 there was an uneasy truce for 48 hours but since the weekend misha again started to show the same aggression . ` attempting to distract them and temporarily separating the older animals has only brought short-term easing of the situation . but it also resulted in masha ignoring the cub even more . ` misha and masha are lovely hand-reared orphaned bears who came to us in 2009 . they never had the chance to learn from other bears how to behave and their mothers were killed by poachers . euthanised : the cub put down by the zoo -lrb- pictured -rrb- was born in january and was one of two . expert : brown bear specialist prof djuro huber said bears ' natural aggression was well-known and it was ' a shame to allow the male to kill his cub in the zoo ' ` we have tried when they were here to keep as much distance between them and humans as possible . our priority is the two adult bears . ` having young animals is a natural part of the life cycle of every animal and we wanted to ensure that misha and masha had the chance as well . but the loss of the young animals in a biological sense and also according to basic principles of good animal protection are less serious than the loss of an adult . ` the loss of cub number four has affected all of us here . because misha and masha appeared to be clearly unable to fulfil their role as parents , misha will be sterilised in the next few weeks . ' he . added he did not want to see a repeat of knut the polar bear - who was . effectively sentenced to a life of solitude in a berlin zoo after being . rejected by his mother . in 2007 , an animal rights activist controversially said knut should have been killed rather than being held in captivity alone . yet . when two cubs were born at another swiss zoo in january this year , . keepers solved the problem by separating the parents and leaving the . cubs with their mother . different policy : sixty miles away , two cubs born at the juraparc animal park were separated from their father . happy family : a cub in jaraparc with its mother . the bern zoo said it was worse to lose an adult than a cub . ursina gave birth to king and zoe at juraparc animal park near vallorbe - just 60 miles from bern . professor djuro huber , chairman of the brown bear expert team for the international union for the conservation of nature , said bears ' natural aggression was well-known and it was ' a shame to allow the male to kill his cub in the zoo ' . he told mailonline : ` in nature the male bear separates from the female after mating season and is not present with his cubs . ` it is not unusual that the male kills his cubs in captivity . even the mother sometimes does . ' but he added : ` zoos have too many captive bears and it is almost impossible to send them somewhere . surplus bears have to be euthanised , and it is better to do that at a very young age when the mortality in nature is also the highest .
