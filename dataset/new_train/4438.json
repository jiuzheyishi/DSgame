{"text": "with arms around each other 's shoulders , wu yebin and an wei strolled past rows of food booths and game stalls along the main road cutting through their small village in northern china one recent friday morning . looking like two buddies soaking in the sights and sounds of the village fair , the young men wearing matching rings blended in perfectly with the local crowd . their story , however , stands out : they are an openly gay couple living in the chinese countryside , where homosexuality remains largely taboo .  they sought medical treatment for me and hired a shaman to exorcise me ,  recalled wu of his family 's reaction when he came out .  i had to comply -- but at the same time i found information on homosexuality online and shared with them .  the more they learned , the more accepting they became ,  he added . it took his parents several years to come around , but wu and an -- who had met online and quickly fallen in love -- now live together and run a roadside convenience store next to the wu family home in rural hebei province . as news of advancements in gay rights in other countries spreads , the two partners in life and business have been thinking more about cementing their own relationship .  i hope to see same-sex marriage become legal in china one day ,  an , 32 , said .  we 'll go get the license right away to enjoy all the rights like married straight couples .   it 's going to happen ,  wu , 29 , chimed in .  i bet next year .  not everyone is so optimistic though . a lesbian couple in beijing recently saw their marriage application rejected by local officials and video of their futile attempt made the rounds on the internet . activists also complain about periodic government crackdowns , citing a recent case in may . in the central city of changsha , a 19-year-old activist leading a street rally against homophobia was jailed for 12 days . local police accused him of  holding an illegal protest  in a statement .  they are n't just targeting gay groups ,  said xiaogang wei , a prominent gay rights advocate who heads the beijing gender health education institute .  the authorities are increasingly worried about the organizational capability of various rights groups , especially when we band together , because it could challenge their political power .  sometimes we have to take to the streets to raise the visibility of our cause ,  he added .  it stirs discussion and debate , which could eventually lead to more understanding and acceptance .  homosexuality is not illegal in china and the communist government has long removed it from the official list of mental disorders , but activists and experts agree that prejudices and discrimination persist .  gay people still ca n't make their voices heard and they have no representation in the legislature ,  said li yinhe , a renowned sociologist with the chinese academy of social science . in china , lgbt citizens seek acceptance . li conducted china 's first comprehensive surveys on gay men and published her findings in a popular 1992 book . for more than a decade , she has been calling on national legislators to legalize same-sex marriage but sees a prolonged uphill battle ahead .  this is an issue affecting a minority group and ranks really low on the government 's agenda ,  she said . opposition to a different kind of  gay marriage ,  however , has become a priority for many activists . unlike in the west , experts say the vast majority of gay people in china -- especially men -- stay in the closet and marry the opposite sex . noting the lack of hostility toward homosexuality throughout chinese history , li explains that the confucian concept of carrying on the family line is  the only thing akin to religion in traditional chinese culture .  that 's why so many gay men are put under tremendous pressure to get married and have children , especially in the countryside .  an had three girlfriends and almost tied the knot with the last one . wu was married to a woman for 40 days -- and regrets have dogged him since .  sometimes when i lie on bed , i think of my ex-wife and still feel guilty ,  he said , recalling how much she cried during their brief sexless marriage .  my momentary lapse of judgment ruined her life : even though i never touched her , it 'd be hard for her to find an ideal husband as a divorcee .  state media has cited one estimate putting the number of chinese women married to gay men at more than 10 million . sociologist li calls those unions  tragedies  and has counseled many women in such marriages . while a nationwide support network has emerged to help so-called  gay wives  -- or  tongqi  in chinese -- break free , observers note a small but growing number of young gay men in big cities marrying lesbians to placate families and maintain their lifestyles at the same time . wu and an are no fans of such arrangements , and predict personal and financial complications . after he met an , wu started tweeting on sina weibo , china 's equivalent of twitter with more than 300 million users . by telling his own story and re-posting news on global gay rights campaigns , wu hopes to inspire more closeted gay chinese to come out . remembering his own days of feeling lonely , helpless and even suicidal , wu points to his experience as evidence of progress and hope in gay acceptance in china -- even in the most unlikely families and places . back at the village fair , wu and an -- whose rural hometown has no cinemas let alone gay bars -- paused for a  face-changing  opera performance as an actor quickly switched colorful masks on stage without revealing his identity . after cheering the entertainer , the two young men who have taken off their  masks  in real life moved on to buy groceries as meat and vegetable sellers greeted them as old friends .  many people say they admire us -- they say we did something amazing ,  wu said .  we are just two ordinary people who came out to our families so that we can live with our loved ones .  and maybe one day , get married .", "summary": " wu yebin and an wei live in rural china where homosexuality remains largely taboo .   they dream of seeing same-sex marriage becoming legal in china one day .   homosexuality not illegal in china , long-removed from official list of  mental disorders    activists and experts agree
