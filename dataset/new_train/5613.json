{"text": "farmers across europe have ignored an eu ban on ` pig cages ' , meaning uk families will continue to eat pork , ham and bacon from cruel factory farms . british farmers stopped using the cages or sow stalls in 1999 because they were so small the huge animals did not even have enough room to turn around . the eu finally agreed to outlaw the system across member states from today , but it has emerged that thousands across the continent have failed to meet the deadline . caged : farmers across europe have ignored the ban . some 60 per cent of all pig meat sold in the high street and through restaurants is imported , suggesting at least some will be from illegal foreign factory farms . in natural conditions , sows live in small groups with their young and will spend much of their day foraging and rooting for food . factory farming methods have brought the breeding of supersize pigs that find it difficult to move and bear little resemblance to their wild ancestors . the pregnant sows turn out vast litters of piglets to be reared for meat and farmers developed a system of cages to restrict their movement . these are so narrow that the sows can not turn around or move more than 18 inches forwards or backwards . this system has been recognised as cruel for many years , not least because pigs are highly intelligent creatures and are denied any semblance of a natural existence . the cramped conditions mean the animals suffer from severe psychological and physical harm . cruel : farming minister david heath said sow stalls are cruel and said shoppers want to know where their meat comes from . farmers across the eu were given 11 years notice that the ban would come into effect in january 2013 , however they and their governments have failed to meet the deadline . data published by the european commission in december revealed that only one third of french farms have removed the cages . at the same time around half of german farms still use them and some 43per cent of those in ireland . other countries unable to meet the deadline include belgium , italy , the netherlands and spain . british farmers are at a commercial disadvantage because it costs more to rear pigs without using the cages . british farming minister , david heath , said : ` sow stalls are cruel , they restrict the sow to such an extent that she ca n't turn around for almost her entire life . ` shoppers care about where their meat comes from and what conditions the animals are reared in . ' he said responsibility for enforcing the ban is up to the european commission , however this is unlikely to trigger any meaningful sanctions . sow stalls were banned in britain in 1999 because they caused psychological and physical harm to pigs -lrb- file picture -rrb- . britain 's national pig association estimates that around 40,000 ` illegal ' pigs an hour will be entering the european food chain in january . it predicted bacon , ham and pizzas containing their meat will reach our supermarkets , corner shops and restaurants . npa chairman , richard longthorp , said : ` this makes a mockery of europe 's animal welfare legislation . ` shoppers will need to be very careful about what they choose from supermarket shelves and when eating out in restaurants . ' the organisation is advising consumers to buy british bacon as the only guarantee of avoiding meat from the cage system . chief executive of compassion in world farming , philip lymbery , said there is ` no excuse ' for the failure of farmers to miss the cage ban deadline . he urged all british stores and producers to boycott pork from countries which fail to impose a total ban on the cages . jamie oliver has slammed the sow stalls as worse that battery chicken cages . he said : ` in my view , it 's pretty inhumane . a pig can stand up , it can sit down , but it ca n't turn around and it ca n't scratch itself . and basically they 'll eat in one end and s -- out the other , and they 've got nothing to do .
