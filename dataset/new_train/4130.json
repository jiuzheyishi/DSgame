{"text": "when a reporter asked navy cmdr. tim jirus whether he felt building 197 at the washington navy yard was secure , he answered the only way he could monday .  not today .  in addition to the gunman , authorities said 12 people were killed and eight others injured when a shooter opened fire in building 197 at the navy yard . earlier , navy vice adm. william d. french had said 14 people were injured . located in the heart of the nation 's capital , the navy yard is home to high-level naval personnel . about 3,000 people work there , including junior service members and civilian employees . it 's supposed to be a secure facility . so what went wrong ?  it 'll be interesting to see as this develops who the shooter is , how he got in , those type of questions answered . i think right now a lot of people are wondering , you know , just how safe the building is , or how safe the office environment is ,  jirus said . the fbi has identified the suspected shooter as aaron alexis , a 34-year-old military contractor from texas . he had access to the yard because of his contracting work , and he used a valid pass to gain entry , said valerie parlave , assistant director in charge of the washington fbi field office . jirus described how access typically works .  i have a cac card ,  he said , referring to a common access card , the standard id for active duty uniformed service personnel , selected reserve , defense department civilian employees and eligible contractor personnel . audit reports navy risked security to cut costs , says source . the id also is the main card used to grant physical access to buildings and other controlled spaces .  as a military person , we all have badges that we have to key the door to get in -- that allows us automatic access to the building .  but again , if you 're a contractor , if you 're coming to visit the building , you can go through security and walk right in -- not walk right in , but you would check in through security ,  jirus said . even to drive or walk onto the base , a person would be required to present credentials , said navy capt. mark vandroff . building 197 has armed security at the door .  there 's a kiosk you go through , and it either gives you a green or a red light , but the green light shows that your credentials are recognized as someone who is supposed to be in that building .  so you have to go through a couple of layers of security to get into building 197 -- first to get access onto the yard , and then through the doors to get in ,  vandroff said . cnn pentagon correspondent barbara starr has visited the navy yard several times over the years for stories . victims identified . in her experience , security is extensive . everyone must have clearance to be there or valid identification that allows them entry . if you were an employee of the facility , you would have a parking sticker and go through a checkpoint , starr said . a guard would see your sticker , know that you were authorized to be on the compound and allow you to proceed . if you were a visitor , as starr would be , you 'd call ahead and have an appointment . guards would have your name at the gate , and you would be escorted to wherever you needed to go .  so the question , of course , is -- how did somebody get a weapon onto the base ?  she asked .  look , it is always possible in these types of situations , theoretically , to find your way around security measures . somebody could have had a weapon in their car , unseen , hidden and taken it out .  there 's any number of ways it might have happened ,  starr said .", "summary": " shooting suspect aaron alexis had access to the yard because of his contracting work .   eight people were injured in monday morning 's shooting .   cnn 's barbara starr :  it is always possible ... theoretically , to find your way around security  "}
