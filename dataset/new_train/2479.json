{"text": "apple , as the reports go , is working on a  smart watch ,  although the secretive company wo n't say anything about it , of course . so , after months of speculation , what does its chief rival in the mobile world do ? announce that it definitely is working on a smart watch . lee young hee , executive vice president of samsung 's mobile business , said as much during an interview in south korea , where the company is based . and he said it 's not a knee-jerk reaction to apple 's rumored plans .  we 've been preparing the watch product for so long ,  lee told bloomberg .  we are working very hard to get ready for it . we are preparing products for the future , and the watch is definitely one of them .  he did not give any details on when the watch may be released , what features it will have or how much it will cost . with its galaxy s line of smartphones , samsung has become the first competitor to provide a real challenge to the dominant iphone . while apple 's iconic phone remains the single-most popular mobile device -- the release of the iphone 5 led to a record sales quarter and was the most popular of the 75 million devices running apple 's ios system that were sold in those three months -- samsung moved into a solid second place with its galaxy s iii . the s iii outsold the iphone 4s during the third quarter of last year before the iphone 5 's release , and the company announced last week that the galaxy s4 is on its way . now the companies seem poised to go head-to-head again in what appears to be an emerging market -- wearable tech . nike 's fitness-oriented fuelband has led the charge . but few new products have captured the imagination of the tech-minded such as google glass , an eyewear-like headset that offers augmented-reality images as well as basic smartphone-like features . the device is due later this year and has started popping up on the faces of field testers . then there is pebble , the smartwatch that raked in about $ 8 million on kickstarter and has begun shipping to backers . but will there be a market for these devices outside of early-adopter technophiles and loyalists who will scoop up any new product their favorite company creates ? early signs say the public might need a little more information first . according to an unscientific survey of users by mobile deals site buyvia , 26 % of respondents said they were interested in buying a rumored iwatch , 38 % said they were not interested and more than a third , 36 % , said they were n't sure . -lrb- the survey was conducted before samsung confirmed it 's in the game as well . -rrb- . the top five features respondents said they 'd like to see in a watch were e-mail and texting , phone calls , gps , wi-fi and weather updates .  while consumers are seemingly divided about their desire to own the rumored apple iwatch , it 's fascinating that the most desired features for the watch mirror popular iphone capabilities ,  said buyvia ceo norman fong .  it 's as though consumers are only interested in a watch that offers everything the smartphone does , only in a more convenient ` package . ' what they seem to crave is a way to more easily access iphone features everywhere they go .
