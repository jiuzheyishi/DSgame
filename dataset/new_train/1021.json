{"text": "your 3 p.m. walk to the office vending machine may soon get a lot happier . at least three companies are currently developing vending machines for marijuana after colorado and washington state recently legalized it 's recreational use . retail sale is expected to start in colorado by january 2014 with washington state following shortly after . only one company has an actual model in use , and that 's california-based medbox inc. - run by chiropractor bruce bedrick , ` the steve jobs of medical marijuana dispensing . ' c5 or d2 ? : medbox 's machine , right , is the only patented marijuana . vending machine and can currently be used at medical dispensaries in . california . a newer option from endexx corp. , left , was developed with . the recreational user in mind . ` we 're the only patented game in town , ' bedrick told the huffington post . ` i 'm not concerned necessarily about the competition , generally speaking . ' medbox made $ 1.75 million last quarter . but there are other companies creeping up on his business model - and tailoring to the two states that have already legalized recreational marijuana . phoenix-based endexx corp. has already bought up two smaller firms , canncan and dispense labs and aims to distribute machines in legalized states . customers of endexx 's machines would n't be medical patients like medbox 's users . they would be recreational users just wanting to pick up weed , and not deal with the hassle of the middle man . users would be able to order an amount of marijuana from the machine 's app on their iphone , and then go to a retail center to pick it up . at the machine , they would also be able to add rolling papers or a cigarette lighter to their order . the machines could also be used to sell pre-packaged cannabis goodies , such as brownies or cookies . cannabis confections : in addition to marijuana , davis envisions his machines being able to sell rolling papers , lighters , and even sweets spiked with pot such as pre-packaged brownies and cookies . ` the way we see it , when you walk into a shop , you do n't need the expert or aficionado to help with your selection , ' said endexx 's ceo todd davis . ` the people who are using this in the recreational space - they know what they want , and they do n't want to hear the whole spiel every time . ' davis has high hopes for this burgeoning industry : ` it 's like a gold rush . once significant investment capital comes to the market who knows ? ' but bedrick thinks that 's still a ways off - even in legalized states where selling weed in vending machines would need to get approval . ' i think that 's still a couple of years down the road . ' slow and steady is how he sees the marijuana vending industry going : ` some people want to see this free-flowing marijuana . they want to go from federal and state ban to marijuana for everybody , ' bedrick said . ` we do n't believe that can happen . in order to gain respect and trust , it 's better to go through gradual , medical adoption . ' another company , tranzbyte corp. , announced in april that they would be entering the marijuana vending business as well . david levine , who sold canncan to endexx , has been in the vending machine industry for almost a 10 years and has seen how quickly the industry has changed when it 's come to weed vending . ` back in 2009 , you 'd go to these conventions and you 'd see people trying to unload 80 pounds of weed , ' levine said . ` now , you 'll see people buttoned up and trying to figure out solutions for what 's a real industry . ' not yet : bedrick believes it 's going to take longer for vending machines to get approved - even in legalized states .", "summary": " entrepreneurs are looking to cash in on the marijuana vending machine market in colorado and washington state , where marijuana was recently legalized .   there are already a few machines on the market in california medical dispensaries , but new machines will focus on the recreational user .
