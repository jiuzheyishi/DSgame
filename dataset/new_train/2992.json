{"text": "in many ways , the middle east makes a strange -- and at times perilous -- hotbed for caricature . many of the region 's leaders have a poor reputation for humor , and often , the list of banned topics makes for a long read . for those that dare to satirize a taboo , the punishments can be harsh : arrest , torture , exile , even death .  the one thing a tyrant ca n't stand is to be laughed at ,  says robert russell , the executive director of the cartoonists rights network international , a group that monitors the threats facing editorial cartoonists globally .  if there 's rebellion in the streets , they can bring out the tanks , but if everyone is laughing at you , what defense do you have ? it undermines the authority of a tyrant to be laughed at .  despite the dangers that await many arab cartoonists , some of the region 's more contentious countries are actually experiencing a political satire renaissance . according to jonathan guyer , a cairo-based fullbright scholar who is translating egypt 's cartoons into english for his blog , oum cartoon , the country is experiencing  a golden age of caricature .   on any given day , a newspaper could have ten comics . you 'll see dozens of morsys above the a1 fold being mocked ,  he says , referring to the ousted egyptian president .  you just would n't see that in american papers .  video : the artist that sculpted saddam . still , he notes , the country 's media is more reticent about publishing images critical of the military .  a couple of artists told me they got warning calls from the military , but more as a kind of gentle , backroom nudge ,  he explains . in other countries , the nudges are less gentle . the assault of syrian cartoonist ali ferzat in 2011 brought international attention to the dangers awaiting those that -- pen and ink in hand -- poke fun at the arab world 's more tyrannical leaders . for much of his career , ferzat satirized the political and military order in syria without singling out any individual . in the months leading up to the syrian revolution , he broke what he called  the barrier of fear  and started drawing president bashar al-assad . in one daring image , the syrian ruler was depicted standing on the side of the road , thumbing for a lift from deposed -lrb- and , at the time , living -rrb- libyan dictator moammar gadhafi . read more : iran 's cartoonists find new lines of expression . less than a week after the cartoon was published , ferzat was accosted outside of his office by masked gunmen .  the president 's boot is better than you ,  they told him , before breaking every finger in his hands and leaving him for dead .  at that moment , i thought that i was going to say good-bye to life . but i also thought i had to accept the outcome of what i 'd done . i had to stand behind what i believed in ,  admits ferzat , who was recently in london for an exhibition of syrian art organized by the charity mosaic syria , who is using proceeds from the sales to fund their relief work . hands healed , ferzat continues to draw politically charged cartoons , but now lives outside syria . if he was ever reticent about caricaturing the atrocities taking place in his home country , he is n't now .  i was really happy to start drawing again . it was like a second chance . after what happened to me , i had more resolve to tell the whole world . i went to the front line . it 's been even more important for me to speak out against the regime ,  he says . video : egypt 's first comedy factory . though exile is not an easy life , those cartoonists that have n't managed to escape face a potentially worse fate . last year , another syrian artist , akram raslan , was arrested and has n't been heard from since . russell , who has been lobbying for raslan 's release , fears he may be dead .  we sent a letter to syrian ambassador in washington , d.c , and a few days later heard his trial had been delayed . we thought , ` oh , how wonderful . ' two weeks later , we heard he 'd been killed ,  he says . recognizing the dangers that many cartoonists face , iranian nikahang kowsar who fled iran in 2003 , is working on an online platform that allows cartoonists to use templates to create their own satires anonymously .  that way , people can use those characters to question the authorities , without having it traced back to , say , the syrian or iranian cyber army ,  he says .  it 's our way of giving a voice to the voiceless . ", "summary": " some countries in the middle east , like egypt , are experiencing a ` golden age ' of caricature .   many cartoonists in the region can face arrest , torture and exile .   syrian cartoonist ali ferzat thought he 'd say ` good-bye to life ' when assaulted by thugs in 2011 .   iranian cartoonist nikahang kowsar is working on a platform to make cartooning safe .
