{"text": "deposed egyptian president mohamed morsy on sunday taunted court officials who placed him in a soundproof glass box during his trial on conspiracy charges , a proceeding cut short by his lawyers ' objections .  if this farce continues , leave the trial ,  morsy told his lawyers through a microphone .  those who are afraid of my appearance before the people have no public support ,  he added . morsy , egypt 's first democratically elected president , was toppled in a military coup in july and faces trial on a variety of charges -- the most recent being allegations that he spied for an unnamed foreign power . sunday 's session marked the second time he was placed in a glass enclosure . when he was hauled into court along with nearly three dozen co-defendants , his lawyers complained the soundproof enclosure hindered their ability to communicate with their client .  the glass dock is to humiliate the defendants ,  said mohamed selim el-awa , his lead attorney .  this is unprecedented in the world .  el-awa told cnn that the defendants ca n't hear inside the glass-enclosed dock and that presiding judge shaaban el-shamy is n't the only one controlling the sound . the judge refused requests to discuss this issue in private , making it impossible for the lawyers to do their job , he said . and ahmed morsy , the ex-leader 's son , said ,  this is what the coup authorities want .  with defense lawyers refusing to participate , proceedings were adjourned until february 23 . the judge threatened to appoint new lawyers , and the defense attorneys appeared divided over whether they should return . el-awa said the withdrawal would remain in effect until the glass barrier is removed .  what is important is that i have n't gone against my conscience ,  el-awa said . but defense spokesman mohamed el damaty said that given the court 's threat to appoint new attorneys , morsy 's lawyers may have to submit to the  bitter reality  and continue their defense in later sessions . the trial is one of several that morsy is facing amid egypt 's seesaw power struggles . the latest charges against him include spying for foreign organizations outside egypt , committing terrorist acts inside the country , disclosing classified defense information to a foreign country and funding terrorism . he already has been charged with inciting the killings of political opponents and organizing a 2011 jailbreak by members of his then-banned muslim brotherhood . morsy , the former head of the brotherhood 's political arm , won office in 2012 . shortly after he was elected , he resigned from the muslim brotherhood and its freedom and justice party in an effort to show he would represent all egyptians . but he was ousted in a coup about a year later amid widespread protests against his rule , with opponents accusing him of pursuing an islamist agenda and excluding other factions from the government . morsy and other brotherhood leaders were rounded up after the coup and now face a variety of counts , including organizing attacks on egyptian troops in the sinai peninsula and fueling  sectarian sedition with the aim of igniting civil war in egypt .  the brotherhood had long been suppressed during the 29-year rule of former strongman hosni mubarak . but it became the most powerful political force in egypt after the popular revolt that toppled mubarak in 2011 . supporters say the military-backed government that replaced morsy has returned to the authoritarian practices of mubarak .", "summary": " those who fear his appearance  have no public support ,  morsy declares .   defense lawyers object to the placement of soundproof glass where defendants stand .   morsy became president in 2012 , but was deposed in a military coup one year later .   his supporters say the military has returned to the authoritarian practices of hosni mubarak .
