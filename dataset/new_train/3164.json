{"text": "a three-month-old baby boy was found dead after sharing a double bed with his mother , an inquest heard . mother-of-four angela williams brought the infant into her bed because she ` wanted to be with him ' , after separating from his father . she found three-month-old bobby blakemore unresponsive the next morning and despite attempts at resuscitation he was declared dead at the scene . three-month-old bobby blakemore was found dead after sharing a double bed with his mother , an inquest in bolton heard . the bolton hearing was told bobby was born prematurely at 34 weeks and had weighed 5lbs 3 oz , but had been feeding well and there had been no medical concerns . miss williams of clifton , near swinton , greater manchester , told the hearing her son had a routine in which he would wake up in the morning at around 7am . the company team leader said : ' i would wake up about 12 and then 3am , he always struggled to get back to sleep after the 3 o'clock feed . ' on october 19 last year bobby 's father liam blakemore , an insurance worker , took him out before returning before 1pm . the youngster slept until 2.45 pm before waking for a feed and was a ` bit sick . ' after that he was said to be fine . bobby had another feed at 6.30 pm before being placed in his pram where he fell asleep . that evening miss williams was joined at her home by a work colleague and she had a glass of wine before going to bed - leaving her friend to sleep on her sofa . the inquest was told that bobby did have a moses basket but miss williams said : ` he did n't like sleeping in it , he had a crib in our room . ` that night i put him in our bed instead of putting him in the crib . i wanted to be with him . i was playing songs he liked listening to . ' little bobby , pictured with his father liam blakemore , had been perfectly healthy before he died . she said she lay on her back and put herself between bobby and the adjacent bedroom wall and covered them both with the duvet . she woke at around 6am to find bobby unresponsive . despite mouth-to-mouth resuscitation attempts and instructions from a 999 operator , bobby was pronounced dead at the scene . when asked by the coroner alan walsh if she had been aware of any overlying miss williams replied ` no . ' she said that when she woke bobby was in the same position in which she had left him . the nhs advise that the safest place for a baby to sleep in its first six months is in a cot in its parents room . they advise against sharing a bed if either parent is a smoker , has recently drunk alcohol , taken medication or drugs that make them sleep more heavily or are tired . they say the risks of sharing a bed with an infant are also increased if they were born premature or were of a low birth weight . the nhs say there is also a risk parents could role over in their sleep and suffocate their bashe also said that he had n't cried in the night . the pathologist who carried out the post mortem examination was unable to ascertain a cause of death for the child . recording a narrative cause of death mr walsh said : ` it 's accepted in some case that prematurity is a factor in sudden unexpected death . ` although born prematurely bobby did grow and thrive and that 's largely due to the good care he was given by his parents . ` he was obviously well fed and cared for and well looked after by parents that cared and helped him to overcome the immediate dangers of prematurity . ` he was placed in bed with angela because she wanted to be close to him that day . ` he usually slept in a crib , sadly he did n't disturb his mother that night and she found him in the morning unresponsive . ` it 's important that some of the factors that arise in sudden infant death syndrome are given as a warning , there is nothing to suggest that is the cause of death . ` prematurity is one of the factors , co-sleeping is another factor as well as overheating and smoking . i 'm satisfied there was no smoking in the house . it is not right to reach any conclusion that these factors caused the sids . i make no comment other than that they exist and people should be aware of this .
