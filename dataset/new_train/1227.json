{"text": "nasa 's curiosity rover has captured the passing of mars ' two miniature moons in a fascinating photo sequence taken from the surface of the red planet . the eclipse of the moons - phobos and deimos - was captured for the first time from mars using curiosity 's telephoto-lens camera and it is so detailed that craters are visible . the larger moon , phobos , passes in front of deimos in the 30-second video comprised of 41 images taken by the robotic vehicle that were stitched together by scientists working at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory . scroll down for video . this view of the two moons of mars comes from a set of images taken by nasa 's mars-based rover , curiosity , as the larger moon , phobos , passed in front of the smaller one , deimos , from the rover 's perspective , on 1 august . curiosity recorded the spectacle on 1 august using one of the two cameras on its mast , known as mastcam . the video will enable scientists to learn more about the moons , including giving a more precise picture of the moons ' orbits . mark lemmon of texas a&m university , college station , said : ` the ultimate goal is to improve orbit . knowledge enough that we can improve the measurement of the tides phobos . raises on the martian solid surface , giving knowledge of the martian . interior . ' ` we may also get data good enough to . detect density variations within phobos and to determine if deimos ' orbit is systematically changing , ' he said . the orbit of the larger moon , phobos , is slowly getting closer to mars , while smaller deimos ' orbit is gradually moving away from the red planet . phobos has a diameter of less than one per cent of the earth 's moon and it orbits much closer to mars than our moon 's distance from earth . the larger of mars ' moons measures just 22 kilometres in diameter but orbits just 3,700 miles from mars ' surface . when viewed from the surface of mars , phobos looks about half as wide the earth 's moon appears to viewers on earth , according to the scientists . the larger of the two moons -lrb- pictured -rrb- , phobos , . passes in front of deimos in the 30-second video comprised of 41 images . taken by the robotic vehicle that were stitched together by scientists . working at nasa 's jpl . here phobos is seen just before the eclipse . here , phobos eclipses deimos , as seen by the curiosity rover on mars . the smaller moon becomes visible once more in the right-hand image . the earth 's moon is vast compared to the martian moons , with a diameter of around 2,160 miles but orbits much further away from it 's planet 's surface at an average of 239,000 miles . dr lemmon and his colleagues said the two moons would be visible crossing paths at a time shortly after curiosity would be awake for transmitting data to nasa 's mars reconnaissance orbiter for relay to earth . this made the moon observations feasible with minimal impact on the rover 's energy budget . nasa 's mars science laboratory project is using curiosity and the rover 's 10 science instruments to investigate the environmental history within gale crater , a location where the project has found that conditions were long ago favorable for microbial life . this illustration provides a comparison for how big the moons of mars appear to be , as seen from the surface of mars , in relation to how big the earth 's moon looks from the surface of earth . earth 's moon actually has a diameter more than 100 times greater than the larger martian moon , phobos . the rover recently celebrated . its first anniversary on mars by using its sample analysis at mars . -lrb- sam -rrb- instrument to ` sing ' happy birthday by vibrating at different . frequencies . since completing its dramatic landing sequence just over a year ago , the rover has already achieved its mission aim by discovering that mars could have supported life and is sending back information about its surroundings to inform future missions to mars . the mobile laboratory has provided more than 190 gigabits of data , returned more than 36,700 full images and 35,000 thumbnail images , fired more than 75,000 laser shots to investigate the composition of targets , collected and analyzed sample material from two rocks and driven more than one mile . nasa 's mars science laboratory project is using curiosity -lrb- a computer-generated illustration is pictured -rrb- landed on mars in august last year for a two-year mission to determine if the planet most like earth in the solar system has , or ever had , the an environment to sustain life . the rover has travelled almost 700 metres in the past month since leaving an area of mars where it has been analysing rocks for around six months . cuiosity is now trundling along to its final destination - mount sharp - where it will look at the lower layers of the mountain that towers over the centre of gale crater by almost three and a half miles . mount sharp is of interest to scientists because its layers of rock can reveal information about the planet 's changing environment over time .", "summary": " nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory said the larger of the two moons , phobos , passed in front of deimos on 1 august .   scientists created a video of the event by stitchng together 41 images taken by the curiosity rover on mars .   first time the martian moon eclipse has been captured from the red planet .
