' the move risks angering the jewish community in the east london borough and fuelling divisions in a borough increasingly used to making headlines for the wrong reasons . a recent review found the council 's handling of the local and european election count was ` inadequate ' . tonight tory party chairman grant shapps told mailonline : ` this is an administration that can not even organise their own election count , let alone intervene on foreign affairs in the middle east . ` what we need is an immediate ceasefire and continued humanitarian aid , rather than empty , flag-waving gesture politics . ' mayor rahman should remember that he is flying a flag from a british town hall in support of an organisation that is regarded across europe and the world as terrorist . it is totally inappropriate . it is also destructive of relations between the communities that make up our capital city . it is not thought that there are any rules stopping the flying of the flag over a public building . jonathan arkush , vice president of the board of deputies of british jews , said : ` mayor rahman should remember that he is flying a flag from a british town hall in support of an organisation that is regarded across europe and the world as terrorist . ` it is totally inappropriate . it is also destructive of relations between the communities that make up our capital city .

' an estimated 1,200 palestinians and 55 israelis have been killed in the conflict . israel launched its offensive in gaza after a surge in rocket fire from the territory . hamas , which controls gaza , has said it will not stop fighting until a blockade on the area , maintained by both israel and egypt , is lifted . already this month there have been angry rows about preston town council and bradford council flying the palestinian flag . david israel of the leeds jewish community said the preston council was wrong to take sides in the conflict . innocent israeli civilians have suffered through war and conflict , ' he told the bbc . ` if you 're going to put up one flag you need to put up the other flag to show support for innocent civilians on both sides on the conflict . ' others backed the move , saying they were ` proud ' of mr lutfur for taking the controversial decision . earlier mr cameron announced an extra # 3 million aid for gaza as he repeated his call for an unconditional ceasefire to stop the conflict . britain has already given # 7 million in aid . speaking during a q&a session with workers in warrington , mr cameron said the # 3 million would ` help make sure the people in gaza have the basic necessities of life , the food , the shelter and the assistance that they need ' . prime minister david cameron today announced an extra # 3million for the humanitarian crisis in gaza . he went on : ` we should be very clear that we want an unconditional , immediate , humanitarian ceasefire that applies to everybody . ` what we are seeing happening in gaza is completely tragic and ghastly , the loss of life is appalling , it is heart-rending watching these scenes on our television . ` but while calling for an unconditional , immediate ceasefire , we do have to be clear about a couple of points . ' mr cameron added : ` yes , it is awful what is happening in gaza and the loss of life , but we do have to remember , whenever we have had a ceasefire in the last few days , it has been a ceasefire that has been obeyed and observed by the israelis but it has not been observed by hamas . ` hamas continue the rocket attacks that are not aimed at military targets or political targets . they are aimed , indiscriminately , into israel in order to do the maximum damage they possibly can . ` and so we do have to understand that that has to stop in order for there to be a lasting ceasefire .
