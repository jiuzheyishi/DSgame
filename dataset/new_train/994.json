' dr johnson says that seems a relatively obvious attraction and even makes evolutionary sense in terms of safety and protection . ` but if a woman was coming to the end of her fertility window and she wanted to get pregnant and needed a sperm donor , she would definitely choose a young male over an older one , right ? ' she told stuff.co.nz . she says studies show a marked differences in semen volume , sperm motility and morphology in men in their thirties and fifties , which means they should be less attractive to women looking to have a child . increasing male age has also been linked to a number of medical complications , such as miscarriage and higher rates of autism and down 's syndrome according to dr johnson . but the number of men between 35 and 49 years old fathering children had increased in the past few decades , reports stuff.co.nz . john peek , group manager of fertility associates , said a man 's age did increase the chance of a cell disorder , but not as much as a woman 's age . ` jumping 30 years in the male 's age -- from 20 to 50 -- might be the equivalent of jumping two or three years in a woman in her late 30s , ' he said . mr peek said said dr johnson 's study could be very useful as current knowledge was based on indirect evidence and small samples sizes . ` there 's going to be a bit of a difference between tiny little fish and people but it 's a lot clearer if you know what the basics are and you can say ` ok , what might be different between zebrafish and humans ? ' rather than saying we do n't actually know the fundamentals at all .
