{"text": "every superhero movie is , on some level , an attempt to demonstrate that a godlike being with flabbergasting powers â $  he flies ! he wields a megaton hammer ! â $  also has an inner life . the success of the film hinges on how well it yokes together the external and the internal .  thor : the dark world ,  a watchable but technologically over-scaled slab of marvel boilerplate , is far from a great superhero movie â $  it 's more like the diagram for one . having done his time as a magical norse hunk-out-of-water in  thor  -lrb- 2011 -rrb- and  the avengers  -lrb- 2012 -rrb- , our hero -lrb- chris hemsworth -rrb- now finds himself back on asgard . there , his father , odin -lrb- anthony hopkins , serving up his own special brand of highbrow scenery chewing -rrb- , enlists him in a battle for the cosmos . muggles rejoice ! butterbeer is now being served at starbucks . the nine realms are about to converge , which means that the dark elves , led by the scowling malekith -lrb- christopher eccleston -rrb- , can now finally seize their moment to destroy asgard . are your eyes already glazing over ? to succeed , the elves must gain control of the aether -lrb- pronounced  ether  -rrb- , a supreme energy force in the form of what looks like a floating spill of red wine . in the film 's rather desperate attempt to personalize the plot , the aether , which requires a host organism , has leaped inside the body of jane foster -lrb- natalie portman -rrb- , the astrophysicist who fell for thor and has been waiting two years for him to return . portman plays her like a petulant schoolgirl , and that 's the movie 's notion of a joke : jane just wants a boyfriend , while thor , who loves her back , has weightier concerns . really , though ,  the dark world  should have given jane a better reason for hanging around than the fact that she 's playing host body to a glob of extraterrestrial protoplasm . the first  thor  was directed by kenneth branagh with an elegant verve that made the special effects at once witty and spectacular . alan taylor , who directed this sequel , is a prestige veteran of the small screen -lrb-  mad men ,   the sopranos ,   game of thrones  -rrb- , but he brings little of that avid storytelling tightness to  the dark world .  which ` star wars ' personality are you ? see the characters ' myers-briggs chart . the new film sprawls , often with more spirit than reason . and though its images can be exciting -lrb- the oz-like palace of asgard , airships that glide like daggers -rrb- , the battles have a videogame medieval dazzle that temporarily heightens the senses , then leaves you numb . hemsworth 's thor is once again a charismatically fast and bold stud-viking warrior , but now that he 's mostly on his home planet -lrb- with occasional forays down to london -rrb- , he somehow seems less super . only when tom hiddleston is on screen , as thor 's dark-souled stepbrother , loki , does any real drama take hold . loki has been imprisoned for his treachery , but it turns out that thor needs his help to defeat the dark elves . can he trust loki not to betray him ? hiddleston , with pleading eyes and a mad-dog grin , plays loki as a wounded sociopath who 's cackling at the world but seething on the inside . which makes you realize he 's just about the only character in the movie who has an inside . grade : b - . see the original story at ew.com . click here to try 2 risk free issues of entertainment weekly . © 2011 entertainment weekly and time inc. . all rights reserved .", "summary": " critic gives  thor : the dark world  a b - grade .   far from a great superhero movie , it 's more like a diagram for one .   director alan taylor brings little storytelling tightness to  dark world    tom hiddleston 's loki is about the only fully realized character .
