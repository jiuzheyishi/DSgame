{"text": "an ohio mother-of-two is suing an abortion clinic after it failed to terminate her pregnancy . ariel knights , 22 , and her fiance adore their ` miracle baby ' daughter who was born in september . but doctors had originally warned the couple that a medical condition knights suffers meant her life was at serious risk if they went ahead with the pregnancy . she agonized over the decision , but , with a preschool-aged son and a fiance to think of , she called akron women 's medical group and booked in the march 2012 abortion . miracle baby : ariel knights , pictured left with her fiance , he son and the ` miracle baby ' girl she delivered in september . ` it was a decision i made because my life was in danger , ' she said . ' i was put in jeopardy . ' on the morning of her appointment , in march 2012 , knights said women were being herded into the clinic 's waiting room like cattle . ` every seat was full . people were standing , ' knights told the beacon journal . ` it was pretty much like a slaughterhouse ; it was like ok , next , next . ' she described how , when her name was called , she walked into a cramped room , hopped onto a table and , as instructed , positioned her lower body over a trash bag . when the doctor was finished , and she was still woozy from the sedation , knights was handed her belongings and shown the door . ' -lrb- the doctor -rrb- said ,  all right , everything 's good and clear , everything went well ,  ' she recalled , thinking that was it . but days later , she said she became . severely ill and in pain . she visited her family doctor then she went to . er where an obstetrician gave her an internal ultrasound . ` the . look on -lrb- the doctor 's -rrb- face when he found out , he was like ,  oh my . goodness , honey , you 're still pregnant ,  ' she told the journal . ` my . fiance and i , we both were kind of in shock . ' cutie : knights and her fiance are thrilled to have their healthy baby girl , pictured . lawsuit : the 22-year-old woman , pictured right before the delivery , filed the malpractice lawsuit last month alleging negligence on behalf of the clinic and two doctors . she called the akron abortion clinic , who are denying the allegations against them , and she said she was told she could visit their cleveland-area office but declined . knights then contacted another clinic , which , according to the lawsuit , told her it would not treat her for ` somebody else 's mistake . ' at that point , knights and her fiance decided to go ahead with the pregnancy . but because she suffered uterine didelphys , which results in a double uterus with individual cervices , it was dangerous and extremely stressful , she said . she first learned she had the genetic condition while carrying her son . he , however , was carried in the left uterus which was healthy enough to hold a baby to near full-term but doctors said in a february 2012 exam that this fetus was located in the weaker right uterus . the fear that the weakened uterus would fail never left her during her pregnancy , she told the journal . ' i ca n't explain how i felt . it was . just a sense of being overwhelmed , wondering what happened to the baby , . wondering what 's happening to me and what did -lrb- the clinic -rrb- think they . did , ' she said . ` it was just constant stress . ' medical : doctors told knights , pictured left , to abort because the fetus was growing in her right uterus which was extremely weak . denial : akron women 's medical group , pictured , is denying the allegations . knights visited the er multiple times during the pregnancy , was admitted to the hospital four times , with each visit lasting around five days , and had bi-weekly ultrasounds at a doctor specializing in high-risk pregnancies . in september , she delivered her daughter who they call the ` miracle baby ' and thankfully both mother and daughter were healthy . knights said she still does n't know why the abortion clinic doctor believed the procedure was complete and what , if anything , was removed from her body . she said she had two ultrasounds before the procedure but was n't sure if one was done afterward . knights said she 's hoping the to get some answers as her malpractice lawsuit against the clinic , and two doctors , makes its way through summit county common pleas court . in a court filing , the clinic and doctors deny any negligence and challenge the lawsuit for various reasons , including that they say at least some of the claims are barred by the statute of limitations . they want the case dismissed . knights is seeking unspecified damages of at least $ 25,000 for the pain , suffering and emotional distress she says the failed pregnancy has caused her . but neither knights or her fiance regret having their beautiful little girl in their arms . ` that 's a sore subject to think about , ' she told the journal . ' i mean , it 's just hard , thinking she 's here and thinking , if they would have done their job ... it 's just something i do n't like to think about .
