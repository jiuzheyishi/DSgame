{"text": "kate winslet 's husband yesterday attempted to ban photographs of him semi-naked in fancy dress from being published . ned rocknroll , who married the hollywood actress a few weeks ago , was in london 's high court to try to ban a tabloid newspaper from printing the pictures taken of him indulging in ` silly schoolboy antics ' . the images of the 34-year-old , who is a nephew of sir richard branson , were discovered on a facebook page . kate winslet 's husband ned rocknroll , pictured together , yesterday attempted to ban photographs of him semi-naked in fancy dress from being published . rocknroll , who changed his surname from edward abel smith , was granted a temporary injunction last thursday , shortly after the sun newspaper contacted winslet 's publicist about the pictures . the newspaper yesterday contested the injunction and the case will continue today . the sun 's publisher , news international subsidiary news group newspapers , argued the pictures , which were taken from a publicly accessible facebook profile belonging to rocknroll 's friend , james pope , were already publicly available . the group also said that rocknroll is a public figure and has a lower reasonable expectation of privacy than an ordinary private citizen . rocknroll 's lawyer , david sherborne , told the court yesterday that the pictures of a ` partly naked ' rocknroll in a fancy dress costume were taken at a private party , which had the theme ` outrageous ' and would cause distress to him if they were printed . rocknroll , pictured leaving court , was granted a temporary injunction last thursday , shortly after the sun newspaper contacted winslet 's publicist about the pictures . mr sherborne told the court : ` this application is not to hide some guilty secret , as i said in the interim hearing . it is not to keep something secret . the claimant is here because the defendant seeks to invade his privacy . ` it was a private party with a private guestlist at a private family home so it is hard to see these photographs as anything other than private family photos . ' he told the court and judge mr justice briggs that the photos showed rocknroll indulging in ` silly schoolboy antics at this fancy dress party . it is embarrassing because of what you can see in these pictures . ' mr sherborne added that rocknroll was ` horrified ' at the prospect of the pictures being published . he explained that they were never intended for public consumption and would cause ` considerable embarrassment and humiliation ' for winslet and her children , who would face bullying and taunting if they were made public . he also said that he was not a role model and had been a ` relative nobody ' prior to his marriage to winslet in december . rocknroll , who was previously head of marketing for branson 's virgin galactic space-exploration firm before leaving to work as a sheep farmer , was in court wearing a blue pinstripe suit , married the titanic star in a low-key ceremony in new york in december . the hearing follows the publication of a report in march last year by the joint committee on privacy and injunctions that found there was no case for a new privacy law and that cases should still be judged by the courts on an individual basis . rocknroll is the latest in a long line of well-known figures to use an injunction to prevent the publication of detail of his private life . in 2011 , sir fred goodwin , the disgraced banker who took the royal bank of scotland to the brink of collapse , was revealed as another figure who had taken out a controversial high court super-injunction . the order , which bans mention of matters sir fred wishes to keep secret , was disclosed in the commons by liberal democrat mp john hemming using parliamentary privilege . in 2011 , footballer ryan giggs took out a super-injunction banning newspapers from printing details of his affair with model imogen thomas , despite his identity being widely discussed across the internet . hemming again used parliamentary privilege to name the player , saying 75,000 people had already outed him on twitter . sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .", "summary": " ned rocknroll , 34 , was pictured indulging in ` silly schoolboy antics '   photographs were discovered on a facebook page .
