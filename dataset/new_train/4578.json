{"text": "fighting flared for a third straight day sunday along the thai-cambodian border over a disputed ancient temple despite a reported ceasefire and international efforts to soothe tensions . at least seven people -- two villagers and five soldiers -- were wounded after a new gunfight broke out shortly before 7 p.m. sunday evening , thai army spokesman col. sansern kaewkamnerd told his nation 's state-run mcot media outlet . the skirmish came a day after the two sides agreed to a ceasefire , according to the official thai report . earlier , thai army lt. gen. thawatchai samutsakorn told mcot that the situation along the border was returning to normal sunday . several shops in the kantharalak district reopened earlier sunday , and some villagers had gone back to their homes -- though the later report noted that residents were evacuated again to temporary bunkers . twenty schools planned to remain shuttered through at least wednesday on the government 's orders . the clashes stem from a longstanding conflict related to the 11th-century preah vihear temple . the building sits on a cliff in cambodian territory , but the most accessible entrance to the site is on the thai side . gunfire erupted friday near the site , followed by more skirmishes saturday . a thai army spokesman said one soldier was killed saturday , and four others were injured . earlier , the country 's health minister told the mcot news agency that one thai villager was killed by artillery shells fired by cambodian troops . a cambodian official , who was not named , said 10 of its soldiers and civilians were killed or injured in friday and saturday fighting , state-run cambodian news outlet akp reported . the official said cambodian authorities had also captured five thai troops , including four on friday . the united nations weighed in on the dispute sunday , with a statement from secretary-general ban ki-moon 's press office saying he is  deeply concerned  by the clashes . the world body 's leader urged discussion over military confrontations , in  a spirit of dialogue and good neighborly relations .   the secretary-general appeals to both sides to put in place effective arrangements for cessation of hostilities and to exercise maximum restraint ,  the u.n. statement said .  the united nations remains at their disposal to assist in these peaceful efforts .  on saturday , cambodia had formally complained in a letter to the u.n. about what it described as  intense shelling  with mortar rounds saturday morning following an alleged armed incursion by thai troops on friday , according to state-run akp news . in the letter , cambodian prime minister hun sen pointed to the  explosive situation at the border ,  alleging that 300 thai troops on friday  entered cambodian territory and attacked cambodian troops at three locations  about 500 meters -lrb- a third of a mile -rrb- from the temple . the letter also alludes to similar  acts of aggression  in 2008 and 2009 by thai forces . besides the human toll , the letter claimed that the temple itself had suffered damage in the shelling and firefights .  facing this flagrant aggression , cambodian troops had no option but to retaliate in self-defense in order to safeguard cambodia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity ,  the letter states . the recent thai military actions violate the 1991 paris peace accord , u.n. charter and a 1962 judgment from the international court of justice , the letter claims . thai prime minister abhist vejjajiva denied that his nation 's troops had attacked cambodian forces , telling reporters they only acted in self-defense to protect their homeland 's own sovereignty , according to mcot . that report indicated thailand , too , had sent a letter to the united nations about the situation . on sunday , the thai leader tried to downplay the need for outside intervention to resolve the dispute , including an offer from asean secretary-general surin pitsuwan -- thailand 's former foreign minister and now head of the southeast asian alliance -- to mediate . the united states urged thailand and cambodia on friday to show  maximum restraint .  events were being closely monitored , according to state department spokesman p.j. crowley , and both sides were called on to  take all necessary steps to reduce tensions and avoid further conflict .  conflict over the preah vihear site has taken place periodically for years . in 1962 , the international court of justice in the hague , netherlands , ruled that the site was in cambodia , adding that the structure was  an outstanding masterpiece of khmer architecture .  but thailand says that the 1.8 square-mile -lrb- 4.6 square-kilometer -rrb- area around preah vihear was never fully demarcated , and blames a map drawn at the beginning of the 20th century during the french occupation of cambodia . in july 2008 , the united nations approved cambodia 's application to have the temple listed as a world heritage site -- meaning the u.n. believes the place has outstanding universal value .", "summary": " a thai official tells state-run media that seven are hurt sunday in clashes with cambodia .   the dispute centers around an ancient temple in cambodia , along the thai border .   heads of the u.n. and asean have urged thai and cambodia to resolve it via talks .
