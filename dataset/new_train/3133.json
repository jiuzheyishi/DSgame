{"text": "for tina yates , a pensioner from hertfordshire , a single visit to a nudist party with her husband mark was all it took to convince her to embrace the lifestyle for herself . ' i had a bad body image . i 'd had an operation and i 've got what i think is a huge scar and a disfiguring scar , and mark took me along to a nature swim , ' she remembers . ` and , you know , i do n't notice it anymore . it gives you lots of confidence . you know i am who i am , and you can see my life on my face but you can also see the life on my body . ' naked ambition : tina , third from left , says that becoming a nudist has made her feel happier with her physique . tina is one of a growing number of british people to embrace a nudist - or naturist - lifestyle and now lives in the uk 's second biggest naked community , spielplatz . located close to st albans in the village of bricket wood , the 12 acre ` community ' was founded in 1929 by charles macaskie and his wife dorothy in a stretch of woodland as a retreat for themselves and their friends . among them was ross nichols , a cambridge academic and founder of the order of bards , ovates and druids , a neo-pagan group , and his friend , gerald gardner , the father of modern wicca who established his first coven at the bricket wood site . while wicca plays little part in modern life at spielplatz , nudity and a communal lifestyle most certainly does . friendly : tina and her husband live at spielplatz , a naturist community located just outside st albans . ` it 's basically a normal life , ' explains tina . ` my neighbours are lots of different ages and some were even born here . ` it 's just a small . community and very much a community where everybody gets to know everyone else . ' so established is the community , even delivery drivers dropping off ocado or asos deliveries have become a regular part of life at spielplatz . ` everybody delivers to us , ' adds tina . ` our . deliverymen are usually the same ones so there 's never a problem . quite often we ask them to take . their clothes off at the gate ! ' for tina herself , her journey to life at spielplatz when her husband , a naturist himself , came up with a drastic solution to her body image woes . miserable about a huge scar left on her torso following an operation , her husband mark decided to cheer her up by taking her along to a naturist event . amazingly , she agreed to go and says she has n't looked back since . ' i had had surgery and was n't confident , ' she remembers . rural : the beautiful hertfordshire countryside is home to spielplatz which appears in a new documentary . lifestyle : presenter darren mcmullen goes nude at spielplatz after meeting tina and her friends . ' i . did n't like undressing in front of him or anyone else so we decided to . do something about it . in the end , it proved very quick and easy way to cure it and no therapy needed . ' now the couple call spielplatz home and regularly go naked , although as tina points out , being a naturist does n't necessarily mean being nude all the time . ` naturists or nudists generally prefer to be without . clothes if it 's warm enough , ' she explains . ` if it 's cold , we put clothes on , although i 'd still call myself a naturist . ` if a cricketer goes on a gay pride march in . london , is he still a cricketer ? of course he is , so it 's the same thing for me . ' unlike more extreme members of the community , tina also says she puts on clothes when doing things like gardening in order to avoid ending up with scratches in delicate areas . ' i put trousers on if i 'm gardening , ' she laughs . ` if i 'm digging a hole , i 'll put my wellies on ! if i 'm doing a barbie , i 'll put an apron on ! ' she also laughs off the idea of people becoming aroused in a naturist environment , saying it rarely happens at spielplatz . ` it -lsb- unscheduled arousal -rsb- very rarely happens , ' she explains . ` clothes are . more erotic . if you 're naked , it 's not particularly arousing . ` the naked body does n't seem to be as . arousing as one in a bikini or negligee . if someone does get an erection , they 're usually very . discreet about it . most people carry a towel to sit on , so they just wrap that round their waist . ' the odd embarrassing moment notwithstanding , tina says spielplatz is her little haven and says anyone who thinks naturism is weird should come and give it a try . ' -lsb- critics -rsb- can think what they like - for us , this is normal , ' she reveals . ` they should come and give it a go or just come and visit to see what it 's . like . ` it really is a little haven . it 's quiet and calm , although we do like the odd party just like anyone . else . ' she 's also come to accept her body for what it is and says she 's happier than ever . ' -lsb- naturism -rsb- made me realise that i look the same as everyone else - just a different shape , ' she explains . ` i 'm here -lsb- at spielplatz -rsb- because i 'm comfortable , happy and right now , this is where i belong .
