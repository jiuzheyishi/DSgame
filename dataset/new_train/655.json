{"text": "these are the ` designer ' twins - genetically engineered by doctors so their mother could give birth without miscarrying . doctors discovered that both julia eynon and her husband stuart had abnormal chromosomes which were being passed to their unborn babies , causing them to be miscarried . she had tragically lost two sets of twins before doctors made the heartbreaking discovery . julia enyon with ` designer ' twins aaron and holly who were born last year thanks to a new technique which eliminates faulty chromosomes . she underwent a special ` designer ' technique where doctors selected embryos which were free from the abnormal chromosomes that were causing her to miscarry . it meant that her twins holly and aaron were able to be born safely in march last year . mrs eynon , 37 , said : ` the doctors had told me it was unlikely that i could ever give birth to a baby alive , it was heartbreaking . ` we both had faulty chromosomes that meant that when i fell pregnant , the baby would either miscarry or die at full term , before i could give birth . ` i thought i would never be a mum - . but now my twins have been born safely due to this wonderful technique . it seems like a miracle . the couple , who live in bridgend , south wales , started trying for a family after they got married in 2005 . after two miscarriages and another two failed ivf attempts the couple tried pre-implantation genetic diagnosis where doctors selected embryos which were free from the abnormal chromosomes that were causing her to miscarry . mrs eynon said : ` i thought it would happen straight away . i came off the pill and expected to fall pregnant within a few months . ` but nothing happened , so i went to see my gp who told me to be patient and that it can take a while and not to worry . but by christmas the following year mrs eynon still had n't fallen pregnant so she went for a scan and doctors discovered she had polycystic ovaries . she was put on the fertility drug clomid for a further 12 months , but still nothing happened , so the couple were referred for ivf treatment . julia pictured with husband stuart holding holly and aaron at the hospital in march 2011 . they underwent their first cycle at ivf wales in cardiff in january 2008 and it was a success . doctors put two embryos back into her womb , but then at six weeks she miscarried both the twins . mrs eynon , a health visitor , said : ` we were absolutely devastated . we had thought that after the years of trying , we were finally going to be parents . when they told me i was pregnant i was overjoyed . ` so to lose both the babies at six weeks was heartbreaking . ' the couple underwent a second ivf attempt in october 2008 , but that failed . a third attempt in march 2009 proved a success and mrs eynon once more fell pregnant with twins . she said : ` i was worried in case anything went wrong , but we were so excited , and were convinced that we could n't be as unlucky this time . ' but again at six weeks she miscarried and lost both babies . devastated , she asked the doctors to carry out tests to see why she had lost both sets of twins . the tests showed that both mrs eynon and her husband stuart , 39 , a supplies coordinator for st johns ambulance , were carriers of abnormal chromosomes - one which caused early miscarriage , and the other which causes the baby to die at full term . mrs eynon said : ` we were both devastated when we were told the news . it meant it was unlikely that i would ever be able to give birth to a baby that was still alive . it was heartbreaking to think that it had caused me to lose both sets of twins . ' despite being born prematurely at 27 weeks both the twins are happy and healthy and ` coming on in leaps and bounds ' then the doctors told the couple about a technique called pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- - a technique that allows doctors to check for genetic disorders in an embryo so that an unaffected embryo can be implanted into the mother 's womb . it means that they could test for the two abnormal chromosomes in the embryos and make sure only ones unaffected would be used . mrs eynon said : ` we had never heard of the technique before , but it meant that we could have a baby without these abnormalities , so we decided to go ahead . it was our only chance at being parents . ' the couple underwent their fourth cycle of ivf in june 2010 and this time all the embryos were tested , but they were all found to have the genetic fault . in september 2010 they had a fifth attempt and this time seven of the 15 embryos were found to be free of the defective chromosomes . two were put back into mrs eynon 's womb and were successful . she said : ` i was so thrilled when i found out i was pregnant , and now this time i knew that the babies had a much better chance of developing normally . ' her pregnancy went smoothly until 27 weeks when she went into premature labour . she was rushed into the singleton hospital in swansea and the couple were terrified that they were going to lose the twins . mrs eynon said : ` after everything we had been through to have the twins , we really thought that they were going to die . it was devastating . ' doctors gave her steroid injections to develop the babies lungs whilst they were still in the womb and holly was born first weighing just 2ib , followed by aaron at 2ib4 . mrs eynon said : ` they were so fragile and tiny . holly had a perforated bowel and aaron had a brain haemorrhage . ` but they were both real little fighters and hung on . we just had to pray that after everything they had been through they would be alright . ' the twins were finally allowed home after three months and are now coming on in leaps and bounds . mrs eynon added : ` they are doing so well now . they both have great appetites and they are getting much stronger . ` we feel so lucky to have them , and we are just so grateful for the ` designer ' technique that allowed them to be born .
