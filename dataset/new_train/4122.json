{"text": "u.s. rep. gabrielle giffords was successfully transferred friday to a houston hospital from tucson , arizona , and physicians described the brain-injured congresswoman as  doing great .   i 'm very pleased to bring the news that the transfer of gabby from the university medical center in tucson to memorial hermann hospital here went flawlessly ,  dr. randall friese of the umc trauma center said at a houston news conference . while saying an assassin 's bullet  did damage some portions  of giffords ' brain , dr. john holcomb of memorial hermann-texas medical center said giffords is  doing great .   she could have been a lot worse ,  holcomb said .  this was a tangential gunshot wound . fortunately , it did n't go crosswise  through her brain , he said . dr. dong kim of memorial hermann said a 30-minute exam of giffords found that she has  very good movement on the left side of her body .  he added that her physical therapy and rehabilitation will be a four - to six-month process .  we tested her vision and she did n't like us shining the light in her eyes and wanted to keep them closed , and these are all very good signs ,  kim said .  she also had pretty good tone in her leg ,  he said .  she just looked spectacular .  but , he said ,  there are varying stages of what we call paralysis or weakness  on her right side .  in her arm , we are not seeing much tone and we 're not seeing much movement ,  kim said . but he noted that giffords did show movement in her arms during her hospitalization in tucson , so results could change .  we really think over the next few months she 's going to do remarkably well ,  kim said .  there 's no question that she is aware of what 's happening .  giffords is able to move her lips , kim said .  whether she can mouth words , we 'll have to wait and see ,  he added . portions of giffords ' skull that were removed are still frozen in a sterile bag , and it could be weeks , if not months , before those portions are surgically returned to her head , doctors said .  the transfer of that is not a big deal ,  kim said of such surgery . giffords has been in intensive care for the past 13 days since she was shot in the head january 8 during a meet-and-greet outside a tucson supermarket . physicians expressed concern friday about infection , saying they will be monitoring that over the next few days . friese , who accompanied giffords in the ambulance ride in tucson from the hospital to the airport , said that giffords could hear the cheers of well-wishers from the sidewalks friday .  she smiled and actually began to tear a little bit ,  friese said . giffords left the tucson hospital where she had been treated since alleged assassin jared lee loughner , now in custody , shot her in the head . loughner , 22 , is accused of killing six people , including a judge , and wounding a total of 13 , including giffords . the congresswoman arrived at houston hobby international airport shortly after 1 p.m. and was flown in a helicopter to memorial hermann . although previous reports had indicated she would move directly to a rehabilitation facility affiliated with the hospital , she instead was taken to the hospital 's trauma center for evaluation and treatment , kim said .  she 's not quite ready for rehabilitation yet ,  he said , citing concerns about ongoing medical issues . he declined to elaborate . the hospital said in a statement that she will be transferred to the rehabilitation facility , tirr memorial hermann , when her health allows . giffords left the tucson hospital in an ambulance escorted by police and a group of motorcyclists from the veterans of foreign wars . the procession traveled to davis-monthan air force base , where she was carried aboard an airplane for the flight to houston . the move is the latest in a string of milestones for giffords since the 40-year-old congresswoman was shot in the forehead . on thursday , she was able to go outside for the first time since the shooting .  today , actually , we were glad to say that we were able to take her outside and she was able to do her physical therapy ,  dr. peter rhee told cnn 's john king .  we gave her some fresh air and also gave her some sunshine ,  said rhee , speaking from outside university medical center .  she was able to see the arizona mountains .  giffords ' husband , navy capt. mark kelly , described his wife 's progress as  remarkable  thursday , saying he is hopeful she will make a full recovery .  i 've told her that ,  kelly told reporters at university medical center .  she recognizes it . ... she is a fighter like nobody else that i know .  giffords is able to stand with assistance , but is not yet able to take steps or walk , said rhee , adding that therapists are helping giffords with ways to express her thoughts and , eventually , speak .  -lrb- we are -rrb- holding her up so she can train herself to hold her head up ,  rhee said .  she is learning to balance and learning all the little things we can take for granted .  on wednesday , the public learned that giffords was able to rise from her hospital bed and stand with assistance . kelly said he believes she has tried to speak , although she is prevented from doing so by a breathing tube in her neck ; and he believes she is aware of her surroundings , saying he can look into her eyes and tell . she will smile at him and pat him on the face -- something she did before the shooting , he said .  every time i interact with her , there 's something quite inspiring ,  he said . a federal grand jury indicted loughner on wednesday on three charges of attempted murder . the indictment charges loughner with attempting to kill giffords and two of her aides , ron barber and pamela simon . legal experts said that more federal charges against loughner are likely . he is next set to appear in court monday in phoenix .  i do n't think we 're ever going to fully understand the whys and the how and , you know , the reason for what happened on the 8th of january ,  kelly told reporters .  it 's a loss of innocent life . the injury of a dozen people , the death of a 9-year-old girl , a federal judge and the serious traumatic injury to my wife gabrielle -- we 'll never fully understand that .  cnn 's paul vercammen , susan candiotti and roni selig contributed to this report .", "summary": " the flight of rep. gabrielle giffords to houston went  flawlessly ,  physician says .   while doctors say she looks  spectacular ,  she has some signs of  weakness     in her arm , we are not seeing much tone ,  another physician says .   she faces four to six months of therapy and rehabilitation .
