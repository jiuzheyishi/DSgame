{"text": "a photo opportunity in a pub might have seemed just the thing to prove that nick clegg and vince cable are still good friends . but the lib dem duo looked decidedly awkward as they posed with a pint in a soho watering hole this morning , in an echo of the desperate attempts by tony blair and gordon brown to appear united while privately at war . the love-in was supposed to focus on a plan to stop big name pub chains ripping off landlords , but all eyes were on the relationship between the lib dem leader and his rival whose friend was caught plotting to topple him . scroll down for video . nick clegg and vince cable posed in the queen 's head in piccadilly just a week after the lib dem leader faced calls to resign . mr clegg was behind the bar , pulling a pint of london pride for his lib dem colleague . the lib dem ministers hoped to promote a new crackdown on big pub chains ripping off landlords . all eyes were on the body language between the lib dem duo , after it emerged mr cable 's friend lord oakeshott had been plotting to topple mr clegg as leader . the lib dems were plunged into crisis last week in the wake of dire election results , which saw mr clegg 's party lose 300 council seats and all but one of his 12 meps . it later emerged lord oakeshott , a friend and ally of mr cable , had commissioned and leaked a series of opinion polls designed to show the party needed to ditch mr clegg . lord oakeshott warned that the party is ` heading for disaster ' under mr clegg and he claimed mr cable knew all about secret polling he commissioned in lib dem seats to show they would do better without mr clegg as leader . mr cable was forced to break away from a trade visit to china to deny knowing about the plot , with allies of mr clegg furious at being left in the dark . over a pint of ale in the queen 's head pub in piccadilly , the two men sought to put the turbulent rows behind them . mr clegg pulled a pint of london pride beer for mr cable and an archer mild ale for himself as the pair talked pubs , policy and chandeliers in the pub . mr clegg and mr cable were both at pains to stress that the business secretary -lrb- right -rrb- knew nothing about the plotting of his friend lord oakeshott . mr clegg insisted he wanted the lib dems to ask ` searching questions ' about the dire election results , which saw the loss of more than 300 council seats and 11 of 12 meps . mr clegg insisted that he and mr cable were still getting on very well despite the turmoil of recent weeks . mr clegg said today : ` vince has been very , very clear - he had absolutely no idea what matthew oakeshott was getting up to with his polls . ` all i would say is setting personalities aside , we had a really bad result last week . ` it 's the most normal thing in the world that , after such a bad result , vince , myself , the whole party - we 're having a parliamentary party meeting tomorrow - that we really ask ourselves the most searching questions about what we can do to make sure we get our message across . ' mr clegg said this included stressing his party 's role in developing the economy , pensions , taxes and schools . lord oakeshott , a friend of mr cable , quit the party last week after being exposed for commissioning and leaking damaging opinion polls . an apparently humbled mr cable also told reporters : ` we work together , i support his leadership . we 're going to move on from some very difficult elections . i 'm optimistic we are going to turn this corner . ' he added : ' i have n't been communicating with lord oakeshott recently . ' a media scrum focussed on their body language risked overshadowing a crackdown on eye-watering contracts imposed by companies seeking to squeeze more profit out of struggling landlords . publicans who have to buy beer and supplies at higher prices from so-called pubcos say they are struggling to make a decent living , with rents pushed up without warning . under the changes landlords will get new rights under a statutory code , and an independent watchdog will have the power to resolve disputes . the adjudicator will enforce the new code , arbitrate disputes , carry out investigations into alleged breaches and impose sanctions on pub-owning companies if they fail to comply . mr clegg said : ` british pubs are often the centre of our community , a place where we meet friends , watch sport and enjoy a sunday roast - they are a national treasure and the envy of the world . ` they also contribute billions to our economy every year . but , for too long , landlords who are tied to larger pub companies have struggled to make ends meet . ` the self-regulatory approach has n't worked , so these new rules will give fairer treatment for landlords so that they can keep your local pub going strong . ' mr cable said : ` local pubs and their owners play a vital part in vibrant local communities right across the country , as well as making an important contribution to the economy . ` far too many landlords feel their income is squeezed by big pub companies . so today we are taking action to make sure they get a fairer deal . ` the introduction of a statutory code will make sure that tied tenants get an accurate assessment of how better off they could be and the new independent adjudicator would make sure pubs companies are forced to act to redress the situation if they are n't behaving responsibly . ' tied tenants have to buy beer from their pubco , usually paying a higher price , leading to complaints that they can not compete with other pubs . the lib dem love-in had echoes of tony blair buying gordon brown an ice-cream in gillingham in the run-up to the 2005 general election . the labour pm came under intense pressure to name a date for handing over power to mr brown . last month david cameron and his tory leadership rival boris johnson put on a united front during a walkabout in a market in newark , when the prime minister bought his old school friend some rocky road cake . under the new code , the government said pub landlords will benefit from fairer rent assessments . all landlords running a pub under a ` tied ' contract will be given the power to request a rent review if they have not had one for five years . for the first time , tied tenants will also have the right to review the information pub-owning companies have used to decide to increase rents . ministers believe this greater transparency will allow tenants to see what information their landlord has used in calculating the rent , and decide whether an increase is fair . there will be additional protection for tenants whose pub-owning company owns 500 or more tied pubs . the government held a consultation a year ago on the pubco system , which attracted a huge response from the industry . steve kemp , of the gmb union , said : ` self-regulation has been rejected , which is to be welcomed . ` we will study what is proposed to see how workable it is , but we regret that the free-of-tie option has been ruled out .
