{"text": "washington if anything were to go seriously wrong at tuesday 's inauguration of barack obama , homeland security secretary michael chertoff is the man who would manage the crisis response . he is trying to make sure everything goes right . barack obama 's visit to baltimore , maryland , on saturday offered a taste of tuesday 's tight security .  i do n't anticipate anything disruptive . part of my job is to hope for the best and plan for the worst ,  chertoff said during a final tour of key sites across washington . cnn exclusively accompanied chertoff on the tour . chertoff said authorities are not aware of any credible threat to the inauguration .  we are constantly scrubbing and rescrubbing intelligence to see if there is a threat that we should be concerned about . and that is going to continue , frankly , through the inauguration itself ,  he said .  we are literally going to be watching this every minute between now and the conclusion of events on the 20th .  it is difficult to detect individuals or small groups intent on causing trouble , and chertoff is most worried about them .  i am still focused on the kind of event we had at virginia tech : one disturbed person kills a bunch of people . so whether the motivation is racism or some psychological disorder ... in an open society , it is impossible to keep a single individual from doing some damage ,  he said . chertoff 's first stop was the multi-agency command center from which he will monitor inaugural events . this is the security nerve center for the inauguration , with representatives of federal , state and local agencies that will help secure the swearing-in , the parade , the balls and other special events .  everyone has a common picture of what is going on ,  chertoff said .  if something arises , we know who has the ball . we know who plays a supporting role . if an issue that is not anticipated comes up , we are in the room ; we can figure out what do ; we can make a decision .  chertoff also took a swing by the u.s. capitol , where obama will be sworn in . the west side of the capitol gives a panoramic view of the national mall , where crowds will assemble to watch tuesday 's events . chertoff said it was useful to see the setting firsthand .  you get a sense of the physical layout . you may get an idea of where the potential congestion areas or challenges are in terms of managing that large crowd ,  he said . the presidential reviewing stand was still under construction in front of the white house . this is where obama will view the parade in his honor . in the biting cold , chertoff got a quick tour and received a briefing from the united states secret service . turning up his , chertoff expressed concern that the public will not plan and prepare for the weather , which is forecast to remain frigid .  the worst thing in the world would be for someone to come dressed like he is going to go to bermuda , with no food or water or place to stay .  critics have accused inauguration organizers of engaging in security overkill , but chertoff said he has tried to strike a balance .  you do n't want to make this like an armed camp , because it spoils the event itself . at the same time , you want to have enough capacity so you can deal with any foreseeable issue ,  he said . unlike other bush administration officials , chertoff will not leave his job when obama is sworn in . he will stay on until the morning of january 21 , to ensure continuity through this major security event and to allow his designated successor , janet napolitano , to enjoy the festivities . chertoff believes that this is the largest and most complex security event in history . an estimated 8,000 police officers will be on duty , along with almost a thousand fbi personnel , transportation security administration screeners and others , including 10,000 national guard troops . chertoff said that another 20,000 members of the national guard are being held in reserve .  i think we are ready ,  chertoff said .", "summary": " homeland security chief takes a final tour of inauguration hot spots .   authorities have heard no credible threats , he says .   chertoff says officials will be watching  every minute  through the day .   he says he 's tried to avoid security overkill .
