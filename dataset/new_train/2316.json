{"text": "i had the pleasure of getting to know the robertsons -- the duck call mogul stars of a&e 's  duck dynasty  -- over the past couple of years . i 've hunted ducks with phil , the patriarch , and enjoyed miss kaye 's home cooking . they are good , kindhearted , compassionate and generous people . the brouhaha over phil robertson 's comments to a gq reporter is disconcerting , not because i disagree with his views on homosexuality -- and i do , demonstrably -- but because his views are neither surprising nor unique .  duck dynasty  is a show about a christian family . they pray at the end of every episode . they go to church , or school as phil likes to call it . phil 's son allen is an evangelical pastor . phil quotes scripture regularly on the show -lrb- and in real life . -rrb- they do not hide their christianity , but rather they celebrate it . that phil would therefore express a biblically literal interpretation of homosexuality may offend some , but it should n't surprise anyone . a&e has the right to its decision , but suspending phil for his beliefs , even if expressed crudely , seems ungracious . the robertsons ' christian values are , in large part , exactly why the show is so popular . millions of viewers have made it the top reality show of all time because they reject the moral bankruptcy of other reality families . indeed , the robertsons ' christianity has been very profitable for a&e . the outrage over phil 's intolerance also seems blindly hypocritical . many of his most indignant critics , including prominent voices in the media , are the very same people who are overtly intolerant and dismissive of christians , regularly condemning them as idiots , fanatics and loons . a colleague of mine -- someone i like very much -- once said that parents who taught their children the creation story should be charged with child abuse . another colleague of mine likened a christian community in florida to jonestown . i 've heard many others openly wish that anti-abortion christians had been aborted . this is the kind of tolerance to which phil robertson should aspire ? a&e need not endorse phil 's comments , nor must we embrace them . but it 's unfortunate that an otherwise kind and giving family has been maligned for expressing personal views shared by many . reject those views , but do not reject this family . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of s.e. cupp .", "summary": " s.e. cupp has gotten to know the family featured in a&e 's  duck dynasty  series .   she says they are a christian family that celebrates their religion and scripture .   she disagrees with phil robertson 's views on gays but says they 're not a surprise .   cupp says a&e 's suspension of robertson from show is an ungracious act .
