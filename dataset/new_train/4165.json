{"text": "the thronging mass of people in front of me , which seconds before had been surging forward to see a tar-lined barrel being set aflame , suddenly parts . i soon see why . charging towards me , like a blazing bull , is a young man with a raging inferno on his shoulders . i duck and weave , looking for an opening in the crowd to escape through , but none exists . abruptly , though , the flaming figure performs a pirouette and changes direction . i join the chase as the reassembled masses forget their fear and race after the barrel runner , with fire-lust burning in their eyes . i 'm in ottery st. mary , a normally sleepy in the devon region of southwestern england . across the country in november , most communities celebrate bonfire night -- a fiery commemoration of a foiled attempt to blow up london 's houses of parliament in 1605 . here they do it by charging up and down the streets with flaming tar barrels held aloft . it 's the maddest thing i 've ever witnessed . gunpowder plot . the health-and-safety defying tradition is at least several centuries old . although its exact origins have gone up in smoke , it 's thought they 're linked to the  gunpowder plot  of 1605 . andy wade , who 's been involved in the event for 30 years , has been on the 80-strong organizing committee for the past 22 years and is now life president , explains that many places in southwestern england once had burning-barrel rolling festivals .  but one year a long , long time ago , some bright spark in ottery obviously decided that things would be a lot more exciting if you picked the barrel up ,  says wade .  and then our unique tradition was born .  interpreted through the eyes of an expert , the festival is a lot more controlled than it appears at first glance . for starters , people ca n't just rock up , grab a burning barrel and go for a jog through the crowd .  the runners are extremely experienced ,  wade explains .  they come up through the ranks , starting with the kids ' barrels when they 're eight years old , and then progressing to the intermediate barrels . and then -- if they 're big enough and ugly enough -- they move up to the men 's barrels .  for wade , it 's about the perpetuation of a proud tradition .  many of these guys come from families that have a connection with the event going back generations ,  he says .  the fathers , grandfathers and great grandfathers of these lads carried barrels .  earlier in the evening i 'd witnessed the initiation of a new generation of barrel boys and girls . the barrel is slightly smaller for the kids ' event , but the principle is exactly the same : get the flaming thing up on your shoulders and run like mad , without dropping it , until someone else demands it . dancing with fire . there 's no competitive element -- the challenge is to keep hold of the barrel for as long as possible , and to keep the flames bellowing . this explains the pirouettes , which get extra oxygen into the barrel . in total , 17 barrels are daubed with tar throughout the year , then set ablaze during the evening of november 5 , starting with the kids , then women and intermediates -- and finally the men . traditionally , each barrel is sponsored by a pub . although only four of the town 's original pubs remain , the memory of those that have shut is kept alive in the name of the barrels . by the time the men get going , ottery 's streets are heaving with spectators who flock to the town . it 's estimated about 15,000 people come to see the event when it 's on a school night , and up to 20,000 gather when november 5 falls on a weekend . safety concerns ? eh . inevitably , every year there are complaints from people who feel the event is unsafe . wade 's message to them is simple :  the atmosphere is lighthearted , but the barrels do get run through the streets . if you do n't like it , please stand back .  and do n't touch or interfere with the barrels -- the boys really do n't like that .  visitors have to remember that they 're getting a free show . we do n't make anything out of this -- the collections that take place on the night just about cover costs .  every year getting insurance is a problem . of course there are injuries , but more of these are caused by factors other than the barrels -- like people boozing too much and falling over .  these days the runners are n't allowed to drink until they 've finished . but that does n't stop the crowd taking up the slack on the cider-swilling front , and the later the night gets , the more boisterous the atmosphere becomes . if the detractors think the event is crazy now , it 's good they were n't here a few years ago , before health and safety became such a big issue .  it was proper mayhem when i was young ,  reminisces wade , fondly .  people used to get cidered-up and there was plenty of fighting over the barrels . things used to get sorted out on november 5th .  ottery 's flaming tar barrels takes place on november 5 . most of the barrels are lit outside the town 's four pubs : the lamb & flag , the volunteer , the london and the kings arms . the first barrel runs start at 4 p.m. . more at www.otterytarbarrels.co.uk . lewes bonfire night . ottery st. mary is n't the only uk town to turn fiery celebrations into unusual spectacles . the largest november 5 event in the world takes place in the lewes , in the southern english region of east sussex . the whole town burns brightly every year as up to 80,000 people come to watch six  bonfire societies  parade through the streets , dressed as smugglers , with burning crosses and -lrb- sometimes controversial -rrb- effigies , before lighting various infernos and letting off fireworks . burning tar barrels are also featured here , but they 're rolled , not carried . the event commemorates both the discovery of the 1605 gunpowder plot and the burning at the stake of 17 local protestant  martyrs .  up helly aa . before the 1880s , there was a great winter tradition of tar barreling in scotland 's shetland islands , which saw local men dragging burning barrels through the town of lerwick on sledges , getting up to high jinx en route . when this was banned , they started celebrating up helly aa , a fire festival that takes place on the last tuesday in january . this event features a torch-lit parade by people dressed as vikings and culminates with the dramatic burning of a viking-style galley ship .", "summary": " ottery st. mary in southwestern england hosts dramatic annual barrel burning festival .   seventeen flaming barrels are carried through the town 's streets in a tradition begun centuries ago .   other uk locations stage dramatic flaming festivals , including lewes and the shetland isles .
