{"text": "a new treatment could help peanut allergy sufferers get over their potentially deadly intolerance to the popular pub snack . trials of sublingual immunotherapy treatments , where patients are given doses of allergens in gradually increasing amounts , suggest the technique could one day be used as a cure for the allergy . however , experts carried out the tests under strict conditions and have warned people not to try a similar experiment themselves . around one in a 100 people in the u.s. and uk is allergic to peanuts , and reactions range from mere watery eyes to potentially fatal anaphylactic shock . potential cure : around one in a 100 people in . the u.s. and uk is allergic to peanuts , and reactions range from mere . watery eyes to potentially fatal anaphylactic shock . now u.s. researchers believe they have a cure . for sufferers even eating a tiny amount of peanut can lead to a deadly reaction . many must carry around special medicines like epinephrine-containing pens for emergency treatment in case they eat contaminated food . the prevalence of peanut allergy is increasing , however there is as yet no clinical treatment available for sufferers other than strict dietary elimination . new research published in the the . journal of allergy and clinical immunology this month however shows that . giving patients gradually increasing doses of a liquid containing . peanut powder could help them to build up a tolerance . life saver : until now , the only way sufferers could the allergy was to avoid peanuts and carry an epipen -lrb- pictured -rrb- in case they came into contact . the patients first hold the liquid under the tongue for 2 minutes and then swallow it . dr wesley burks , a professor at the university of north carolina school of medicine , said the results of the research were ` encouraging ' . ` the immune response was stronger than we thought it might be , and the side effects of this treatment were relatively small , ' he said , . ` however , the magnitude of the therapeutic effect was somewhat less than we had anticipated . that 's an issue we plan to address in future studies . ' dr burks and dr david fleischer , of national jewish health in denver , colorado , recruited 40 peanut allergy sufferers aged between 12 and 37 , and randomly gave them either daily peanut sublingual therapy or a placebo . all were given a baseline oral food challenge of up to 2g of peanut powder to test how much peanut powder they could consume without symptoms . after 44 weeks , all were given a second oral food challenge . mild : . severe : . those who were able to consume either 5g , or at least 10-fold more peanut powder than their baseline amount , were considered to be responders -lrb- i.e. , desensitised to peanut -rrb- . at 44 weeks , 70 per cent of those who received peanut therapy were responders , compared to 15 per cent of those who were given the placebo . among the responders , the median amount of peanut powder they could successfully consume without symptoms increased from 3.5 to 496 milligrams . after 68 weeks , that amount increased significantly , to 996 milligrams . of 10,855 peanut doses given through week 44 of the study , 63.1 per cent were symptom-free . when oral and pharyngeal symptoms were excluded from the analysis , 95.2 per cent of doses were symptom-free . the study concluded that peanut sublingual therapy safely induced desensitisation in a majority of participants compared to a placebo , and that the longer that treatment continued the more peanut powder they could safely eat . however , dr burks cautions , this is not a treatment that people should try on their own . for now it 's a treatment that should only be given by medical professionals in a carefully monitored clinical trial , he said .", "summary": " around one in a 100 people in the uk is allergic to peanuts .   symptoms range from watery eyes to potentially fatal anaphylactic shock .   study claims tolerance can be increased through small daily doses of peanut .   of more than 10,000 volunteers involved , 63 per cent were left symptom free .
