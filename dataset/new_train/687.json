{"text": "vicar behaving badly : dom joly gets set to fool the nation . when i turned up on set for my new itv1 hidden camera series fool britannia , i thought someone was playing a joke on me . there were 25 crew waiting to get started , compared to the five of us who made trigger happy tv back in 2000 . how can you secretly film people with 25 crew hanging about , i thought ? it soon became apparent , however , that these people were going to make my life a whole lot easier so i could concentrate on what i was good at : approaching strangers as different characters and causing mayhem . the cameramen used all sorts of methods to conceal themselves . we even had a ` pram-cam ' , with a camera inside instead of a bawe also used workmen 's tents . we 'd set these up in the middle of a square , and it was incredible how no one paid them a blind bit of notice . the idea was to film stuff all over britain ... and we did just that . it was mostly a very easy and happy shoot , but when you 're dealing with the general public you never quite know what 's going to happen . we were filming in the cotswolds at bourton-on-the-water with me as a vicar who ca n't help behaving badly , and i had just pretended to spray a cyclist -lrb- the vicar loathes cyclists -rrb- with mace . the cyclist then crashes into the river . normally passers-by just watch whatever scene is being acted out and do that very british thing of not wanting to get involved . this time , however , an angry man announced he was going to headbutt me . hidden fear : dom joly had to stop filming his new series in spain after he was threatened by a man claiming to be a member of the local mafia . but i stood my ground , as i presumed most people who headbutt people do n't announce the fact in advance . this was very nearly a big mistake , as at least four times he pulled his head back as if to strike . he calmed down when he learned it was for tv and found it very funny . . . until he remembered that the lady he was with was not his wife and quickly refused all consent for us to show it . this turned out to be a common theme while we were filming . you 'd be amazed at the number of people who are n't with the person they 're supposed to be with . we also spent a week targeting british tourists in benidorm , which is where i nearly came to sticky end . i was playing a spanish lothario , with tight leather pants and flowing locks , and was about to approach some english ` ladeeez ' on the beach . out of the blue , a huge italian appeared and squared up to me . it turned out he was convinced i 'd been driving a car that had knocked him off his motorbike . to make things worse , i was told in terrified , hushed whispers that he was ` local mafia ' . an executive decision was taken and i was bundled into a van and driven back to the hotel , where i spent the rest of the day in the pool as it was considered too dangerous to film . nice work if you can get it ! fool britannia , itv1 saturdays , 6.55 pm .", "summary": " comedian dom joly tells all about the scares of filming with hidden cameras .
