' i do n't feel like people are staring at me when i walk down the street anymore . i finally feel like a teenager . ` i 've carried some hurtful comments with me all my life but now i feel ready to leave the past behind and forgive and forget . ' her newfound self-assurance has helped her start a relationship with apprentice painter and decorator ricky , 22 , three months ago , who she met through friends . she said : ` i 've had boyfriends in the the past but i do n't think any accepted my condition , really . but with ricky it 's never been an issue . found love : on top of her facelift , zara has also met a new boyfriend ricky andrews . ` he 's seen pictures of me before and told me i was always beautiful - although i would n't have had the self-confidence to believe him before . ' growing up zara put her rapid aging down to lipodystrophy - a genetic illness which decays bones and destroys fat beneath the skin . at age four doctors told her she had inherited the condition from tracey after she developed excess skin round her jawline . zara said : ` mum explained that i had an illness like she did , but that i was beautiful and should n't pay any attention to what anyone said . ` the bullying was worst between the ages of eight and ten . kids used to call me monkey and granny and i was even beaten up just because of how i looked . ` it got so bad i stopped going for a while . ' but even after changing schools zara 's life was made a misery because of her illness . she recalled : ' i lived in fear of being asked how old i was . genetic : zara , pictured right pre-surgery , inherited the condition from her mother tracey , left . but sister chloe , centre , has not been affected . ' i was even mistaken for a teacher in school on a couple of occasions , which was just mortifying in front of my classmates . ' after zara 's plight was made public she was contacted by lipodystrophy expert dr abhimanyu garg , from texas , us , who asked to carry out some tests on zara and tracey . the pair were found to be suffering from cutis laxa , an even rarer condition which can shorten life expectancy , weaken joints and can lung and heart problems . taunts : as a child , zara was bullied by other children who called her ` monkey ' and ` granny ' although hard news to take in , zara was later presented with the offer of a facelift and nose augmentation free of charge by top surgeon dr robert ersek . she said : ` it was an amazing opportunity that i could never of dreamed of before . ` when i saw myself in the mirror after the bandages all came off it was mixture of surprise and happiness . ' i used to hate my nose , but now i love it . ' difficult : zara said she was even confused as a teacher at school on several occasions , but feels much happier after her facelift with boyfriend ricky , right . and thanks to her confidence boost , zara is determined to go to college and achieve her ambition . she said : ' i feel much more confident and just happier in general . ` i 'm now able to do things like going to college and having a career which i might not have felt possible before . ` the surgery has given me a boost and now i do n't fear what other people think . ` i 've noticed a change in me and i feel a lot happier . ' and poignantly , zara says she is all the more determined to live a happy , normal life because of the support she has had from her mother tracey . she said : ' i know i 'm lucky to have had the opportunity and it 's something my mum would have loved to have been offered . ' i want to make something of my life for her - to make her proud . ' i know i 'll always have this condition and it may shorten my life , but at least i can feel more like comfortable and confident . ` although i look younger i still feel older than my years because of everything i have been through .
