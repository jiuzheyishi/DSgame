{"text": "washington sen. hillary clinton raised $ 27 million in the third quarter for her 2008 democratic bid for the white house , a clinton aide said tuesday . presidential hopeful sen. hillary clinton raised $ 27 million in the third quarter , a clinton aide said . all but $ 5 million of clinton 's funds can be spent trying to win the democratic presidential nomination in the primaries , the aide said . more than 100,000 new donors contributed to the new york democrat , the aide said . clinton outpaced sen. barack obama over the last three months , a reversal of positions from the second quarter . the obama campaign announced monday the illinois democrat raised at least $ 20 million for his presidential campaign during the third quarter . all but about $ 1 million of obama 's contributions can be used in the primary fight . in the second quarter , he shattered fundraising records by reporting he raised $ 32.5 million , $ 31 million of which he can use in his bid for the democratic nod . clinton raised $ 27 million during this same period ; all but $ 6 million can be used in the primaries . fundraising is historically slow in the third quarter , which covers the final two months of summer and the first month of fall . watch how summer can be a tough time for candidates  campaign finance laws limit the amount an individual can contribute to a candidate during the primary cycle to $ 2,300 . at the same time , individuals can contribute another $ 2,300 to a candidate for the general election . campaigns often report the total of contributions for the primary and general cycles during a quarter , even though general election contributions ca n't be used immediately to buy ads or hire staff .  many in washington have spent the last weeks declaring the outcome of this race to be preordained and the primary process a mere formality ,  said obama campaign chief david plouffe in a veiled reference to clinton , the front-runner for the democratic presidential nomination in most national polls .  yet , in this quarter alone , 93,000 more americans joined our campaign , because they desire real change and believe barack obama is the one candidate who can deliver it ,  plouffe said .  this grass-roots movement for change will not be deterred by washington conventional wisdom , because in many ways it is built to challenge it .  obama 's campaign said the senator has raised at least $ 74.9 million in primary funds so far this year from 352,000 donors . in a conference call monday , john edwards ' campaign announced the former u.s. senator from north carolina raised $ 7 million during the third quarter . edwards , the party 's 2004 vice presidential nominee , said last week he would accept public financing for the primary and general election campaigns , challenging clinton and obama to do the same . edwards ' deputy campaign manager , jonathan prince , said the campaign has $ 12 million in cash . prince said public funding will add $ 10 million to its totals . edwards has raised more than $ 30 million so far , and the campaign is on the right track to reaching its goal of $ 40 million by january , prince said . crediting the campaign 's aggressive grass-roots outreach , prince said edwards received donations from 150,000 americans , with 97 percent of contributions less than $ 250 . edwards raised more than $ 9 million in the second quarter . on sunday , new mexico gov. bill richardson reported campaign contributions of $ 5.2 million for the third quarter , which his campaign said supports his claim that he is a top-tier candidate .  this figure obviously separates us from the second-tier candidates and makes clear this is a four-person race ,  richardson 's campaign said . most political observers put clinton , obama and edwards as the first-tier candidates for the democratic nomination . though $ 5.2 million is down from the $ 7 million reported in the second quarter , the richardson campaign touted it as  a strong showing in a historically difficult fundraising period .   most importantly , this amount ensures we will have the resources we need to compete in the early states like iowa , new hampshire , nevada and south carolina ,  it said .  we have strong organizations in those states and continue to expand our field operations by adding staff and opening new offices .  the campaign did not disclose how much it had spent during the quarter or how much cash it had left . candidates have until october 15 to file a full report with the federal election commission . on the republican side , former new york mayor rudy giuliani and former massachusetts gov. mitt romney are expected to battle again for the top spot . romney raised nearly $ 35 million so far this year , with giuliani $ 1.5 million behind . sources close to the giuliani campaign said their candidate expects to be atop the pack for the third quarter . among the gop candidates , former sen. fred thompson will have his numbers closely scrutinized . thompson raised more than $ 8 million for his late-starting presidential campaign in the past three months , a thompson campaign source said monday . thompson 's upcoming fec report also will show 70,000 donors have contributed to the tennessee republican in the third quarter , according to the source , who requested anonymity because the campaign has not officially released the information . the actor , a former  law & order  star , formally entered the presidential race last month , but he has been raising money since june . thompson raised close to $ 3.5 million from about 9,000 donors in june , the final month of the second quarter . sen. john mccain of arizona is expected to show he raised more than $ 5 million this quarter , but a mccain adviser said recent poll numbers in new hampshire and a busy fundraising schedule next month show the campaign has  some life .  mccain raised $ 24.5 million the first two quarters of the year but spent nearly all of the funds raised . lower numbers are expected for sen. sam brownback of kansas , rep. duncan hunter of california , rep. ron paul of texas , sen. tom tancredo of colorado and former arkansas gov. mike huckabee . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's lauren kornreich , mark preston and paul steinhauser contributed to this report .", "summary": " sen. hillary clinton raises $ 27
