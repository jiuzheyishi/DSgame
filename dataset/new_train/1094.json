{"text": "herculean : david suchet as hercule poirot . he has portrayed the belgian detective since 1989 and wishes to film all of his adventures penned by agatha christie . agatha christie could not stand hercule poirot . the little belgian detective with the waxed moustaches brought her fame and wealth , but she found him ` insufferable ' . the actor david suchet , luckily for us , ca n't get enough of the character . he has been playing poirot since 1989 , starting with 50-minute adaptations of short stories -- christie was endlessly inventive , and wrote more than 30 novels and 50 short tales featuring the pompous little sleuth with the egg-shaped head . suchet has made no secret of his ambition to star as poirot in all the stories and the character has come to define his career . last night , the 13th season of agatha christie 's poirot -lrb- itv -rrb- opened with one of her last crime riddles , elephants can remember . it was not one of her better plots -- the twist involves identical twins , a trick that was outlawed way back in 1929 when avid detective story fan monsignor ronald knox published the ten commandments of crime -lrb- they included : no chinamen , only one secret passage per novel , and definitely no cheating with twins -rrb- . frankly , elephants can remember is n't one of the crime queen 's better titles , either . most things can remember , apart from goldfish . a cleverer title was hidden in the excellent script by nick dear : a retired copper relayed some ancient gossip to poirot and reminded him , ` old sins have long shadows . ' but the elephant theme gave the set designers an excuse for extra fun . among the glorious clutter of thirties fabrics and props , from the garish rose wallpaper , to the gold tracery on the teacups , someone had placed an ivory monstrosity on poirot 's windowsill : a tusk carved into a procession of elephants . poirot was as riotously egotistical as ever . suchet 's genius is that he can deliver everything christie found so exasperating , without becoming a caricature -- he minces , he trots , he fusses , he talks endlessly of himself in the third person . partners against crime : suchet with zoe wanamaker as lady sleuth ariadne oliver . ` if poirot can be of any assistance he comes at once , toute suite , ' he said . zoe wanamaker , as the lady detective ariadne oliver , worked hard to match him . she has turned the original character , a bumbling scatterbrain who eats apples by the bagful in her bathtub , into a ghastly snob who investigates murders like a prefect at a girls ' boarding school who suspects the third formers of smuggling cherry brandy into the dorms . it 's a clever device -- she makes poirot seem charming by comparison . and she gets results , sniffing out murder most foul in rural sussex . fearful symmetry : operation snow tiger followed the plight of the majestic siberian tiger . as one old scandal-monger tells her : ` in this part of the world , one either hunts or has affairs . ' affairs would be out of the question in eastern siberia , where blizzards blow for weeks and the temperature often falls below minus 30c . love of wildlife : liz bonnin 's enthusiasm for the beautiful creatures was infectious . but hunting can be rewarding , when the quarry is tigers . presenter liz bonnin , a former wildlife biologist who studied bengal tigers in nepal , brought real passion to operation snow tiger -lrb- bbc2 -rrb- last night , on the trail of the most magnificent predators on earth . fewer than 350 siberian tigers survive in the wild . more scientists have gone into space than have seen the animal in its natural habitat . ` the siberian tiger stands a very real risk of becoming extinct , ' she warned . and film of the tigers was brief in this first of two episodes . most of it came from hidden cameras in the forests north of vladivostok , amid snow-scenes and ravishing scenery that looked like a real-world narnia . but bonnin 's excitement when the camera traps caught images of tigers was palpable . she squealed , gasped and shouted when a fleeting image ghosted across the frame . and she was determined to match the russian scientists for stamina and hardihood , whether that was yomping through the snowdrifts , fighting to haul vehicles over the icy roads , or swigging tigroff vodka . she was pop-eyed with horror after downing a shot of the fiery liquid . ` how do you say  that 's strong  in russian ? ' she croaked . with so little footage of the tigers , there was inevitably some padding . but bonnin 's genuine enthusiasm made every moment watchable .", "summary": " author agatha christie found her most famous creation ` insufferable '   but suchet , who has portrayed detective since 1989 , shows no sign of waning .
