' parents james and faye weeks wanted their son to have a procedure called selective dorsal rhizotomy . it . involves cutting faulty nerve endings in the spinal cord in order to . loosen the legs and make them more agile . however , they faced the mammoth task . of raising # 35,000 for the operation after they were told their local . trust would not pay for it . disaster then struck last august . after # 1,400 from the charity fund was stolen after callous thieves . broke into a community centre safe . mr potts , corin 's father , said at the time he was ` gutted that one or two people have let everyone down like this ' . but the determined family redoubled their efforts and had raised the amount in time for christmas . corin with his proud parents james and faye : he should be able to walk unassisted in the coming months following intense physiotherapy . this cctv shows the moment two heartless thieves stole # 1,400 from a charity saving for an operation to help corin walk . the postman added that his son could now cross his legs which meant he would be able to sit with the other children at school rather than on a chair away from the rest of his class . james , a postman , said : ` it is the little things like that . people think of the operation as a miracle cure for walking but it is also about giving him the chance to be like every other child . ' corin potts when he was just a couple of hours old . his spasticity has gone since his operation according to his father . corin is building up the strength in his legs to help him walk and he is doing physiotherapy every day . his parents have also been taking the youngster swimming and cycling so that the work is more fun . james said the family is so appreciative to all the people who helped their son have the surgery and wanted to send his thanks to as many people as possible . but he also hopes that successful operations on youngsters like corin will be taken into account when funding of sdr is reconsidered . he said : ' i ca n't see how they ca n't say it is justified after the success on a number of americans , where they have been doing it for 25 years . ' i think it should be available on the nhs , or at least there should be some help . ` it 's massive , who would n't pay # 35,000 for being able to get a good night 's sleep for 70 years or so , or being able to go to the toilet by yourself . children do n't choose to have cerebral palsy . ` and he has probably cost # 35,000 already in terms of mobility cars and his wheelchair .
