{"text": "water tests after a chemical spill in west virginia are encouraging , the governor said , but it 's unclear when people might be able to use their taps again . about 300,000 residents in nine counties in the southwest section of the state ca n't use tap water .  our team has been diligent in testing samples from throughout the affected area . the numbers look good and , like last night , they are very encouraging . i believe that we 're at a point where we can say that we see light at the end of the tunnel ,  west virginia gov. earl ray tomblin told reporters sunday . jeff mcintyre , president of west virginia american water -- a company affected by the spill -- said that officials will begin lifting the water bans by zone . certain areas will be prioritized , including downtown charleston , but decisions will also depend on test results . he declined to put a timeline on when the do-not-use orders will be lifted .  i do n't believe we 're several days from starting to lift , but i 'm not saying today ,  mcintyre said . officials have warned water customers to watch for symptoms of exposure to the chemical , which is used to clean coal , such as skin irritation , nausea , vomiting or wheezing . karen bowling , secretary of the state 's department of health and human resources , said sunday that more than 1,000 people had called the west virginia poison center , concerned about their exposure to contaminated water . there have also been more than 60 animal exposures reported . a total of 10 people have been admitted to three hospitals , none in serious or critical condition , and 169 patients have been treated and released from emergency rooms , bowling said . water restrictions were imposed thursday after it was discovered that about 7,500 gallons of a chemical used to clean coal -- 4-methylcyclohexane methanol -- had leaked out of a storage tank a mile upriver from the west virginia american water plant . residents were told to use bottled water to wash hands , brush teeth or take showers . the federal department of homeland security sent 16 tractor-trailer loads of bottled water to help and the water company also provided truckloads . the medical impact was hard to assess .  we 've had a lot of worried-well calls ,  dr. rahul gupta of the kanawha-charleston health department said over the weekend . he cited complaints of irritation of the skin , throat , chest and stomach that some residents have linked to possible exposure . the unknowns made residents anxious .  they do n't even know what the health risks are ,  stacy kirk of culloden told cnn affiliate wsaz .  we had bathed , cooked and everything right before the news came on yesterday .   i do n't know anything about the chemical to say too much good or bad about it , so we 're all up in the air ,  said arthur taylor .  we 're common folks -- we 're not chemists .  no quick fix for water woes . anxiety about effects of chemical . water company spokeswoman laura jordan urged people to get medical attention  if they are feeling something ... is n't right .  many did just that .  our emergency rooms have been very busy with individuals unnecessarily concerned and presenting no symptoms ,  said the charleston area medical center . dr. robert maha , chief medical officer for medexpress , a group of seven medical clinics in the area , said many patients sought treatment for symptoms they worried were tied to the chemical exposure . he said the water crisis may contribute to the spread of flu because people are having a difficult time finding clean water to wash their hands .  that 's one of our biggest concerns for the community ,  maha said . the goal : less than 1 part per million . officials will know that the water is safe for more than firefighting and toilet flushing -- its only sanctioned uses now -- when tests find less than 1 part per million of 4-methylcyclohexane methanol in treated water , said mcintyre , with west virginia american water . four laboratories have been set up to measure the levels in a uniform manner .  the treatment plant must consistently produce samples at or below this level before the current do-not-use order is lifted ,  he said . west virginia national guard maj. gen. james hoyer said sunday that sampling and testing at the water treatment facility showed a consistent number of below 1 part per million for 24 hours at the outflow of the facility .  this allows us to move forward to the next phase of sampling and testing throughout the system ,  he said . though the water woes since thursday have led scores of businesses to close , gupta said that some restaurants were reopening after devising alternative plans . the problem affected people of all ages .  i 'm here to get some water for the baby because she has to make formula ,  deborah williams , who was caring for a granddaughter in culloden , told wsaz .  right now , we 're in desperate need of washing baby bottles and filling them up .  7,500 gallons leaked . the chemical overflowed a containment area around the tank run by freedom industries , which supplies products for the coal-mining industry . it migrated over land and through the soil into the river . the leak happened about a mile upriver from the west virginia american water plant . mike dorsey , chief of the department of environmental protection 's homeland security and emergency response group , said officials estimate that 7,500 gallons -- the equivalent of about 10 hot tubs that can accommodate eight people each -- leaked through a 1-inch hole in the tank 's stainless steel wall .  it 's an old system ,  he said about the physical plant , adding that the company had planned to upgrade it . c.w. sigman , the deputy emergency manager for kanawha county , said the tank appeared to be  antique .   when i see a riveted tank i know it 's an old tank ,  he said . dorsey expressed confidence that the chemical , which smells like licorice , did not start leaking long before thursday morning , when it was reported .  we would have gotten odor complaints earlier than that if it had been going on longer ,  he said . after concluding late thursday afternoon that the tap water was contaminated , officials issued a stop-use warning to customers in boone , cabell , clay , jackson , kanawha , lincoln , logan , putnam and roane counties . since then , the offending material has been hauled from the site , officials said . some residents have directed their anger at freedom industries , the coal industry company from whose storage tank the chemical leaked .  it 's caused us more problems than you could ever imagine ,  said danny jones , the mayor of charleston , the state 's capital and most populated city .  it 's a prison from which we would like to be released .  kanawha county commission president kent carper told cnn on saturday that more than 100,000 customers were affected , bringing the number of people affected to about 300,000 .  it was scary because i went to brush my teeth this morning , and i went to turn the water on , and it was like , you ca n't turn your water on yet ,  evelyn smith of rand said .  you have to change your mindset of how you do things right now .  an investigative team from the u.s. chemical safety board on saturday deployed to the scene of the spill . the csb is an independent federal agency charged with investigating industrial chemical accidents . freedom industries president gary southern said two freedom employees noticed material leaking from a storage tank into a dike around 10:30 a.m. thursday . they contacted authorities and began the cleanup process -- including hauling away the chemical still in the tank and vacuuming up some from the nearby ground , he said .  we have mitigated the risk , we believe , in terms of further material leaving this facility ,  he said . but sigman , the emergency management official , said it did n't appear the company was in emergency mode when his team began to arrive thursday .  they did n't appear to understand the magnitude of the incident at the time , and we did n't either because we just got there ,  he said , adding that investigators from the environmental protection agency had also arrived and took the lead in the investigation .  it took a little bit of time to get a determination how serious it was ,  he continued .  i never got a good indication from the plant folks how bad the leak was , how much was going to the river , anything else . it was probably a little ways into the incident before we realized how bad it was getting into the river .
