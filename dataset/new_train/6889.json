{"text": "ex-minister alan milburn says the government 's approach to uk child poverty ` falls far short of what is needed ' the government 's plans to end child poverty are doomed to failure , its adviser on social mobility has warned as new estimates revealed the uk will be home to 3.5 million poor children by 2020 . a report by the social mobility and child poverty commission , chaired by former health secretary alan milburn , branded the draft strategy for the next three years a ` missed opportunity ' and insisted it fell far short of what is needed to prevent the numbers rising . mr milburn said it was ` particularly lamentable ' that ministers had been unable to agree on how to measure poverty after rubbishing existing measures . ` the government 's approach falls far short of what is needed to reduce , yet alone end child poverty in our country , ' added the ex-labour mp . ` our new research shows that the gap between the objective of making child poverty history and the reality is becoming ever wider . ' he also called on politicians from all parties to work together to combat the issue , adding : ` willing the ends without the means today merely becomes a broken promise tomorrow . ` across the political spectrum , party leaders now need to come clean about what they plan to do to hit the targets , or what progress they can deliver if they expect to fall short . ' in its report , the commission concluded there were some positive things in the strategy , including the extension of childcare support for low-income families and a greater acknowledgement of the problem of working poverty than before . but it criticised a lack of any clear measures to assess progress and the absence of a detailed plan covering what needs to happen to jobs , wages and benefits to ensure poverty goes down . it also identified limited action to get other parts of society , such as employers , engaged in tackling poverty and a lack of new action on in-work poverty as fundamental problems . in addition it accused the government of ignoring the impact of welfare cuts and of continuing to distance itself from statutory measures in the child poverty act 2010 , which senior ministers describe as ` discredited ' , without suggesting any alternatives . ` doomed ' : the report wants that 3.5 million children will live in poverty by 2020 - five times the government 's legal obligation to end it . the findings were published as new research carried out on behalf of the commission by landman economics revealed the 2020 child poverty targets will be missed by a large margin . it estimated that even overly optimistic assumptions about parental employment rates and earnings would still leave more than three million children - 21 % - in absolute poverty by 2020 - almost five times the number needed to meet the government 's legal obligation to end it . to achieve the targets within the current council tax and benefits system , it said , would require  implausible  parental employment rates of close to 100 % , combined with big increases in working hours of families in working poverty over and above the requirements of universal credit . a spokesman for the department of work and pensions said : ` we remain committed to our goal of ending child poverty by 2020 . our strategy outlines plans to tackle the root causes of poverty , including worklessness , low earnings and educational failure . ` this approach is a better reflection of the reality of child poverty in the uk today and is the only way to achieve lasting change . ` under this government there are 300,000 fewer children living in relative income poverty and 100,000 fewer children in workless poor families . we have just seen the largest rise in employment for over 40 years and unemployment is falling . but there is more to do - and we are getting on with that job . ` the commission 's own research highlights the weaknesses of the current child poverty measures - calculating poverty by income alone fails to address the issues which hold people back and that 's what we 're tackling . '", "summary": " former minister alan milburn says britain struggling to reduce child poverty .   in six years , figure will be five times the government 's legal obligation .   government can not even agree on how to define the phenomenon , he says .   report says current strategy lacks clear measures on how to help children .
