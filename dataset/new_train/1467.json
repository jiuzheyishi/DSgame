{"text": "a five-year-old girl who was born with legs ` like a frog ' has taken her first steps thanks to special splints . emma-grace andrews suffers from a rare condition that caused her to be born with almost no muscle in her legs and arms . her parents were told she would die during birth after scans showed that her limbs were dangerously twisted . scroll down for video . emma-grace andrews , five , was born with a rare congenital condition which caused her leg and arm joints to be curved . her parents -lrb- rachel and alan , pictured -rrb- were told that she would spend her entire life in a wheelchair but thanks to special splints she has taken her first steps . despite being encouraged to have a termination , they refused to give up hope on their daughter . they were told that if she survived she would probably need to use a wheelchair her whole life . however , emma-grace has now taken her first steps using leg-straightening splints after an operation to stretch her muscles . her mother , rachel andrews , 42 , said : ` when she was born , her legs were curled up and her feet back-to-front . she looked like a little frog . ` her arms were bent and her hands were twisted outwards . she was really deformed . i feel terrible saying it , but it was incredibly disturbing . emma-grace 's condition was picked up at her mother 's 20-week pregnancy scan . doctors advised rachel , and husband , alan , to have her aborted because they feared she would not survive birth . ` but i remember saying :  my daughter is going to walk , run and dance . she 's going to do everything other children do  . ` i was not going to accept what they were saying but it has n't been easy . i was close to giving up . ` if you 'd told me a year ago my daughter would walk unaided i would think you were utterly mad . ` she has overcome so many hurdles in such a short space of time . it 's absolutely incredible . ' emma-grace 's condition was picked up at her mother 's 20-week scan , leaving mrs andrews and husband alan , 50 , from llanelli , carmarthenshire , devastated . the full-time mother said : ` we were utterly blown apart . i had two images in my head - a little white coffin and a child in a wheelchair . she spent much of her first few years of life with her legs in plaster but this failed to enable her to walk so she was referred to great ormond street children 's hospital for further treatment . arthrogryposis multiplex congenita is a collective term for a large number of different syndromes characterised by non-progressive , joint curvatures that are present at birth.when the condition is present , the muscles in the baby 's limbs tend to be partially or completely replaced by fat and fibrous tissue.the condition is present in about one in every 3,000 babies and is usually detected before birth.treatment options include physiotherapy , splinting and surgery . ` i was determined to carry on with my pregnancy though . ` alan and i coped with it very differently . he found it very hard to talk about it . ` i . went out and bought baby clothes of all different ages because i just . refused to accept what they were telling me . it was my little act of . defiance . ' emma-grace . was born a week early by caesarean section and doctors diagnosed her . with multiple arthrogryposis , a congenital condition that causes curved . joints . the condition affects about 260 babies in the uk every year . after four days in hospital , emma-grace was discharged and allowed home . mrs andrews said : ` what 's meant to be an amazing time , was pretty horrific . ` people were coming round saying congratulations but we found it difficult to respond positively . we were both devastated . ` i went into  mum  mode . i fed her , washed and dressed her but really i was just going through the motions . i was numb inside . ' at five-weeks-old , doctors put emma-grace 's legs in plaster in an attempt to straighten them . emma-grace spent six week with her legs in full-length plaster casts before she was fitted with splints . she also had surgery to stretch her leg muscles . but after three years , they realised it was having no effect and she was transferred to london 's great ormond street hospital , where she underwent surgery . she was put in plaster from her hip right down to her feet for six weeks before doctors fitted full length splints . they were designed to keep her legs straight but she still could n't walk . mrs andrews said : ` our physiotherapist gave us a special ride-on horse to help her get around . ` she loved it and called it sausage . it gave her that little bit of independence for the first time in her life . we 'd always had to carry her before . emma-grace became so distressed every time her parents put the splints on that they nearly gave up . however , when they tried them for the last time she took her first steps using a push-along dog for support . emma-grace is now waiting to see a specialist about her arms but is looking forward to being able to take part in her first school sports day . emma-grace is now able to take part in a stage school play at the family 's local theatre . ` every morning , i 'd try to put her splints on and she 'd scream her head off . she 'd beg me not to put them on . ` she did n't cry , she sobbed . it was heart-wrenching . ` alan could n't do it because he found it too upsetting . ` i remember thinking whether i did n't know if i could do it anymore . i was questioning if i was doing the right thing . ` i decided to give it one more try . and if she did n't walk , i 'd leave it . my daughter would be in a . wheelchair like the doctors said . ' to her mother 's amazement , emma-grace took her first steps with a push-along dog the next day . and now , she 's progressed to walking unaided . mrs andrews said : ` she was very wobbly but she did it . i showed her teachers the video and they cried . ` she walked to school every day last week . we had to leave early but i do n't care . ` it 's absolutely incredible what she 's achieved . she loves showing people that she can do it now . sometimes she even runs . ` she 's taking part in her first . sports day this week and is in a stage school play at our local theatre . all the things i hoped for are becoming a reality . ' the couple , who also have a son , . jordan , seven , and two-year-old daughter , rosie , are now waiting to see a . specialist about how to flex emma-grace 's arms . emma-grace 's parents -lrb- also pictured with son jordan , seven , and daughter rosie , two -rrb- say that their daughter has taught them to overcome challenges . mrs andrews said : ` she is the most beautiful child you will ever know . she just radiates love . ` it has been difficult but she has taught me and our family how to overcome and push through challenges . ' mr andrews , chief executive of a drug and alcohol intervention service , said : ` when emma-grace was born i really struggled as i just did not know how to cope . ` over time , as i have got to know emma and see her funny determined character , i have grown to adore her and i am amazed at her strength of character and the determination to persevere through every difficult situation that she goes through . ` she is my little princess .
