{"text": "vicky pryce has been moved from the harsh regime of holloway prison in north london to an open jail in the kent countryside . pryce and her ex-husband , disgraced former cabinet minister chris huhne , were both sentenced to eight months for perverting the course of justice after she ` accepted ' his speeding points ten years ago . last night , the economist told a friend : ` i 'm fine . ' she added that she was ` settling in ' at east sutton park open prison near maidstone and insisted staff were treating her very well . jailed : vicky pryce , the ex-wife of former energy secretary chris huhne , pictured inside the window of a prison van as she was taken to holloway prison where she was moved after only four days . on monday , pryce , 60 , who was convicted after a retrial at southwark crown court , spent her first night behind bars at holloway , europe 's largest women 's jail , which has a reputation as a daunting institution for first-time prisoners . but just four days later , after a risk assessment by holloway staff , she was driven 30 miles in a prison bus to the more relaxed regime of east sutton park . the ministry of justice describes the grade ii-listed 15th century building as a ` pleasant mansion house overlooking the weald of kent ' while prison inspectors say it produces ` unusually good outcomes ' for the 100 women it holds . during her time there , pryce will work on the prison farm , where she will be expected to dig and weed alongside fellow prisoners -- or ` residents ' . guilty : pryce and former cabinet minister huhne were both sentenced to eight months for perverting the course of justice after she ` accepted ' his speeding points ten years ago . they include april casburn , the disgraced former detective chief inspector convicted in january of corruption after attempting to sell information about the phone-hacking investigation . casburn , 53 , contacted the news of the world to discuss scotland yard 's decision to launch a new investigation into hacking . she claimed she made the call because the public should know that counter-terrorism officers were being used to investigate hacking instead of ` saving lives ' . another well-known east sutton park inmate was jane andrews , the duchess of york 's former dresser who is serving life for stabbing to death her former lover tom cressman in 2000 . andrews went on the run from east sutton in 2009 and has now been sent to a closed prison . pryce -- one of britain 's leading economists -- was jailed with her former husband after jurors rejected her claim that huhne bullied her into accepting his penalty points in 2003 so he would not lose his driving licence . settling : pryce was moved to east sutton park open prison near maidstone , described as a ` pleasant mansion house ' , where a friend said she was ` settling in ' although it is an open prison , east sutton park 's dormitories and lack of privacy will still be a far cry from the # 2 million south london home she once shared with her former husband . last week her family raised concerns about her physical and mental state . her brother george courmouzis said he was ` worried ' . ` our family has no experience of going to prison , ' he told bbc radio . ` physically , vicky is very frail . ' meanwhile , huhne remains within the bleak victorian walls of category b wandsworth prison in south london , which is home to 1,600 hardened convicts . the former energy secretary 's spirits are said to be undimmed by his first experience of imprisonment . his girlfriend carina trimingham said : ` he is getting on well both with inmates and officers . ' huhne is also expected shortly to be moved to an open prison . provided that both he and pryce keep out of trouble they can be expected to be released within two months , having served just a quarter of their sentences . ... but former inmate warns : it 's so sinister she 'll soon long to be back in her old cell . my impressions of east sutton park were initially promising : a female open prison in a red-brick elizabethan manor deep in the kent countryside with gardens designed by capability brown . it was certainly a world apart from holloway , the daunting jail for 500 offenders where i spent two years of a five-year sentence for fraud , and which is now home to vicky pryce , economist ex-wife of disgraced cabinet minister chris huhne . pryce has been given an eight-month sentence for perverting the course of justice after ` accepting ' huhne 's driving points . new home : east sutton park open prison near maidstone in kent , an an 15th century elizabethan manor . but as a low-risk , white-collar offender she will be moved to east sutton park within the next two weeks . contrary to expectations , this is not a cushy number . while holloway , where you are locked up for 18 hours a day , has its own challenges , for an educated middle-class woman such as pryce , the regime at an open prison -- where the walls are psychological , the competitive atmosphere suffocating and the rules petty and patronising -- may prove unbearable . granted , when i arrived at east sutton , i was astounded to be offered coffee -- a luxury at holloway -- and tobacco . i was no longer a prisoner , but a ` resident ' , and staff called me ` kate ' rather than ` miss johns ' . i could use nail varnish , had more than two pairs of shoes and glass perfume bottles -- previously confiscated because they could be used as weapons . i could walk in the grounds until 11pm and use the telephone without asking permission . at ` hotel holloway ' -lrb- there was an ironic sign in the prison 's reception -rrb- my cell had worn lino floors and steel walls painted institutional mint green . unbearable : the former inmate warned that a ` middle-class woman ' like pryce may find her new surroundings ` unbearable ' i was served sunday roast with rice and had plastic cutlery . now my ` bedroom ' was carpeted and oak-panelled , with an original fireplace . we had fresh vegetables , meat and a salad bar and were allowed to eat with metal knives and forks off china plates -- a luxury . but before long i saw the formidable downside of east sutton park . as a working prison , ` residents ' were required to graft on the farm , and in the gardens and kitchens , putting in eight hours a day for an average salary of # 14 a week . it was often back-breaking , especially if , like pryce , you are used to sitting in an office , firing off emails . i regularly mucked out dozens of pigs . not easy : former city lawyer and ex-inmate of east sutton park kate johns said the prison stay was ` humiliating ' more humiliating were the menial roles such as cleaning toilets and taking rubbish out , for which we were paid two pence . we also shared rooms : i lived with a senior police officer convicted of theft , and a septuagenarian murderess approaching parole after a life sentence . she was said to be so determined for release that she informed on other inmates for cash . while ` grassing up ' a fellow inmate may be considered unacceptable in television dramas , it was a culture that was almost encouraged at east sutton park . the governors were reliant on informants and seemed overtly affected by the ` celebrity ' of some residents . your ` press file ' -lrb- newspaper cuttings -rrb- was used for risk assessment and to identify those with ` assertive tendencies ' . staffing , which had been limited at holloway , was excessive at the open prison and for the first time in my sentence i became conscious of being scrutinised , to an extent that felt obsessively intrusive . staff listened to my telephone calls and discipline was dished out for the pettiest reasons . those who were allowed out on day release had to write down everything in their handbag , even including their brand of eyeliner . strip searches were the norm . thankfully , i never experienced one , but some women came back tearful and traumatised . we were also regularly subjected to room ` spins ' , where dormitories were turned upside down by staff on the merest inkling we had contraband . punishments varied from loss of day release to the nuclear option : ` closed conditions ' . staff used them both , punishing residents randomly and threatening to restrict access to families , friends and children . holloway has an established reputation for violence , but i discovered a certain camaraderie between the inmates . that did not exist at east sutton park , where residents appeared to be in competition . we also faced threats of violence . one sunday i was typing up a witness statement -- we had access to computers but not the internet -- when two women serving life complained that i was typing ` too loudly ' -lrb- they could only type with one hand and had probably never heard anyone touch-typing -rrb- . they suggested i should leave the room or get ` hurt ' . i promptly left . in the past i have said that prison saved my life . it certainly gave me a reality check after years spent in an ivory tower in the city . perhaps it will do the same for pryce . but if her experience in open prison resembles mine , she may yet find she longs for the monotony of hotel holloway . by kate jones - former city lawyer and ex-inmate of east sutton park .", "summary": " she has been moved from north london prison to open jail in kent .   told friend she was ` settling in ' at east sutton park prison near maidstone .   moved from holloway prison after four days following risk assessment .   she will work on the prison farm with the other 100 ` residents ' there .   her family raised concerns about her physical and mental state last week .   disgraced mp is also expected to be moved to an open prison shortly .   former inmate warned that pryce may find the new prison ` unbearable ' "}
