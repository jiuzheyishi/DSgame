{"text": "tehran , iran a reporter for newsweek magazine who was arrested in tehran has confessed to doing the bidding of western governments , the semi-official fars news agency reported wednesday . newsweek says maziar bahari has been reporting for years without bias and beyond reproach . maziar bahari , 42 , made his alleged confession at a news conference tuesday . because international journalists have been limited in their ability to gather news in iran , cnn has not been able to confirm the agency report . fars reported that the canadian-iranian reporter who had worked for the bbc and england 's channel 4 network admitted having filed false reports for newsweek during the elections -- a charge the magazine rejected .  he has been reporting for years without any possible hint of bias and beyond reproach ,  newsweek paris bureau chief chris dickey told cnn .  we think he 's one of the best reporters in the business .  he called the report  preposterous .  dickey said bahari had not been allowed to speak with a lawyer or with his family since his arrest on june 21 .  the western media are part of the capitalist machinery and liberal democratic governments of the west ,  bahari reportedly said .  when a western reporter comes to iran , like a politician or specialist , he will be made to fit into the western complex . for that person , the interests of the westerners , who take advantage of every occasion to stand against iran , are of utmost importance .  the fars news agency account adds that most western news outlets oppose iran , but that the ministry of information scrutinizes reporters ' work , minimizing any harm they might do . bahari reportedly said iranian reporters can be tempted by offers of money from western news organizations to report for them .  unfortunately , sometimes we fall prey to mistakes , wrong feelings and we become greedy , thus falling into the traps of the foreigners ,  he said , according to the news agency transcript . in their alleged attempt to foment revolution in iran , journalists ' efforts began two months before the election , according to the account attributed to bahari : .  the first step was to propagate the thought of questioning religious authority and maintain that the islamic republic of iran has no popular support and then they said that , under the shadow of such a system , the voting process would be rigged and much hard work went into making this thought a reality in peoples ' minds .  hassiba hadj-sahraoui of amnesty international rejected bahari 's alleged confession , calling it part of the islamic republic 's effort to intimidate the opposition and blame western powers for the post-election chaos .  we know from people we 've talked to that people have been forced to make confessions on tv where they are supposed to have acted on instigation of foreign powers ,  she said . indeed , iran 's state-run press tv has broadcast interviews with people who said they were guilt-ridden protesters who wanted to unburden themselves by confessing that the western media had made them act as they did . bahari is not the only reporter said to have confessed , according to reporters without borders , which last week condemned  a parade of iranian demonstrators being shown on state-run tv confessing to having protested at the behest of foreign media .  the reporters all used the same words :  i admit that i demonstrated under the influence of the bbc , the radio voice of america and other foreign media ,  according to the advocacy group . watch about the dangers of reporting in iran  in a posting on his web site , former president mahmoud khatami accused the government of having restricted communications in the country .  the state-owned media outlet shows the same scenes over and over again , in order to provoke people 's feelings ,  he said .  where was this media outlet when tens of people were killed and hundreds of people beaten ?  he added ,  the majority of those arrested are the political activists , journalists and attorneys , who now , unbelievably are pressured , as foreign agents , to falsely confess in television spectacles .  reporters without borders said that 28 journalists -- including about 20 who work for a newspaper owned by opposition presidential candidate mir hossein moussavi -- have been arrested since the election .  arresting an entire editorial staff is totally unprecedented ,  reporters without borders said . questioned about the arrest of foreign journalists during demonstrations , the intelligence minister , mohseni ejehi , said that  one or two people who came to gather secret information were arrested , but not as journalists . one of them had his equipment confiscated and he is now the subject of an investigation .  reporters are not the only people at risk . amnesty international said as many as 1,000 people have disappeared since the june 12 election . with his purported confession , bahari is no longer among them .  we 're very happy that they 've acknowledged responsibility for holding him ,  newsweek 's dickey said .  and we hope very much that they will understand that it is in everybody 's interest to release him as soon as possible .
