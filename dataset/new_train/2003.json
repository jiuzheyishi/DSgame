{"text": "it 's easy to understand why comedians like jim carrey , mike myers , and sacha baron cohen have flirted with adapting james thurber 's 1939 new yorker story about a timid man with a vibrant fantasy life . not only has cgi made it relatively simple to turn walter mitty 's daydreams into technicolor tapestries of digital eye candy , it 's also the kind of emotionally textured role that can be a springboard out of the banana-peel slapstick ghetto . ben stiller 's no stranger to such clown-crying-on-the-inside gambits -lrb- see :  permanent midnight  and  greenberg  -rrb- . but his new film ,  the secret life of walter mitty ,  despite all of its visual razzle-dazzle , never locates the beating heart of its hero . stiller , who also directed , plays mitty as an absentminded , socially awkward nebbish who works in the photo department at life magazine . the irony , of course , is that even though he works at a place called life , he has n't lived . instead , he retreats into his head and imagines himself a dashing mountain climber or a hot-blooded casanova . stiller and screenwriter steven conrad have given thurber 's story a 21st-century twist by setting the film in our era of corporate downsizing . life is about to cease publishing , and for its final cover the editors have chosen a shot from their globe-trotting photojournalist star , sean o'connell -lrb- sean penn -rrb- . then mitty misplaces the negative . and with the encouragement of a co-worker he 's sweet on -lrb- kristen wiig -rrb- , he embarks on a quest to find o'connell , leading him to greenland and the himalayas . as stiller 's mitty crisscrosses the planet , he slowly transforms into the action hero he 's always been in his fantasies . while stunning sequences show him skate-boarding away from an erupting volcano and fighting off a great white shark , the character never becomes more than a fuzzy conceit . at the risk of psycho-analyzing a film that 's already too deep inside its own head , stiller seems to lack the confidence as a dramatic actor to fully commit to the emotional potential of his story . too often he aims at our funny bones when he should be targeting our heartstrings . in the end , walter mitty is a film about acting out our dreams . but stiller never quite shows us the soul of his dreamer . b - . see the original story at ew.com . click here to try 2 risk free issues of entertainment weekly .
