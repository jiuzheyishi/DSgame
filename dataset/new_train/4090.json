{"text": "cbs correspondent lara logan apologized friday and said the network was  wrong  for a  60 minutes  report that raised questions about the obama administration 's response to last year 's attack on the u.s. diplomatic compound in benghazi , libya . the assault left four americans dead , including ambassador christopher stevens .  in this case , we were wrong . we made a mistake ,  logan said on  cbs this morning .   that 's disappointing for any journalist . it 's very disappointing for me .  a primary source for the  60 minutes  report on october 27 was a security contractor using the pseudonym  morgan jones ,  later identified as dylan davies . davies told cbs he was able to reach the benghazi compound on the night of september 11 , 2012 , scale a wall and even fight off a militant . also on friday , the publisher of a book containing davies ' account said it was suspending the sale and publication of the book . threshold editions , an imprint of simon & schuster , is recommending that booksellers not sell  the embassy house  and return the books , spokeswoman jennifer robinson told cnn . the  60 minutes  story broadcast october 27 cast doubt on whether the obama administration sent all possible help to try to save stevens and his three colleagues . the story was then cited by congressional republicans who have demanded to know why a military rescue was not attempted . benghazi attack timeline . on friday , logan responded to questions from cbs 's norah o'donnell , who pressed her for details about davies .  what we know now is , he told the fbi a different story to what he told us ,  logan said .  that was the moment for us when we realized that we no longer had confidence in our source and we were wrong to put him on air , and we apologize to our viewers .  logan was also asked about how cbs vetted davies and his story .  we verified him , confirmed who he was , that he was working for the state department at the time , that he was in benghazi at the special mission compound the night of the attack ,  logan said .  he showed us -- he gave us access to communications he had with u.s. government officials .   the embassy house  tells the same story davies told logan . davies also told logan that he acted in violation of his employer 's orders to stay away from the compound . since the revelations about problems with the story , logan said cbs has tried to contact davies but has not heard from him . congressman : benghazi questions need answers . the news show apology comes a day after cbs issued a statement saying ,  60 minutes has learned of new information that undercuts the account told to us by morgan jones of his actions on the night of the attack on the benghazi compound . we are currently looking into this serious matter to determine if he misled us , and if so , we will make a correction .  on thursday a u.s. official told cnn that there were discrepancies between the contractor 's accounts to the fbi and cbs , although the official did not specify them . a second u.s. official told cnn the same thing friday . the new york times , citing two senior government officials , reported thursday that the contractor told the fbi he did not go the benghazi compound on the night of the attack . when logan was asked friday why cbs was willing to stand by its report after davies lied to his employer , she said ,  because he was very upfront about it ; that was part of his story .  incident report raised questions . the cbs story first came into question because of an incident report filed by the contractor 's employer , the blue mountain security company . the incident report , obtained by cnn and first reported in the washington post , said the contractor never reached the benghazi compound . the incident report also revealed the real name of  morgan jones  to be davies . cbs initially stood by the story after the incident report came to light . davies said he never saw the incident report . but he said it matched a false account he gave his blue mountain supervisor to cover up that he had disobeyed the supervisor 's order not to go to the compound . in a statement to cnn this week , davies said ,  the account in my book is consistent with what i gave to the fbi and u.s. authorities about what happened in benghazi .  cia operatives to testify at classified benghazi hearing . davies ' co-author , damien lewis , also told cnn this week that jones never wavered in his story .  he 's been consistent in the story from the word go ,  lewis said .  not only that , he 's the kind of guy who downplays his role .  reached friday after cbs 's apology , lewis said he would have nothing more to say until davies comments . hearing set for next week . cia employees are scheduled to testify about the attack at a closed-door congressional hearing next week . u.s. officials have said stevens and information officer sean smith took refuge behind a heavy metal door at 10:30 p.m. on the night of the attack , about 30 minutes after attackers had breached the walls of the compound . the two were quickly overcome by smoke when attackers set fire to the building . also at 10:30 p.m. , six security agents left a cia annex a mile away . the six agents and 16 libyan security officials regained control of the compound . with the help of a rescue team that arrived from tripoli at 1:15 a.m. , the agents rescued about 30 americans and took them to the cia annex . they also took stephens and smith , although their conditions at that time have not been made clear . at 4 a.m. , militants attacked the cia annex . navy seals glen doherty and tyrone woods were killed .", "summary": " publication of book containing account is suspended .   reporter : cbs was  wrong  in report that raised questions about benghazi attack .   official claims discrepancies between cbs source 's accounts and what he told fbi .   source had claimed he violated orders , reached benghazi compound and fought militant .
