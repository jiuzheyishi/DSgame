{"text": "high price of success : ticket prices for this summer 's wimbledon tennis final have soared after andy murray 's victory at the queen 's club on sunday . tickets for the wimbledon tennis tournament are always hard to come yesterday it emerged that ticket prices had soared after the british number one 's win at the aegon championships at queen 's club on sunday , with loyal fans willing to gamble that the scot will make it through . prime centre court seats for the men 's final , which takes place on sunday july 7 , have peaked at # 13,500 for a pair , according to the trading website viagogo . and seats further back still cost # 6,971 a pair . anyone who failed to get a ticket at a more modest # 66 in the hugely oversubscribed annual public ballot has little alternative but to shell out . however , you can enjoy the magic of wimbledon without a bank loan . each day , 6,000 outer-court tickets are available at the turnstiles , priced at # 12 , with a further 500 for centre court and 500 for number one court . but be prepared to queue . those with outer court tickets can always watch the main event on a big screen at murray mount . viagogo spokesman steve roest said : ` as murray mania season begins , getting involved in what could be sporting history is a must . it 's extraordinary to see how much his win at queens has impacted ticket demand already . ' murray 's win at queen 's comes after the 26-year-old pulled out of the french open tournament last month , passing up on the chance of a fourth consecutive grand slam win because of a problem with his lower back . and it appears he may have pilates to thank for the improvement to his back . a small fortune : even seats further back on centre court will cost tennis fans almost # 7,000 for a pair . the scotsman has revealed that the secret to his successful recovery is not torturous ice baths or muscle-wrenching massage , but pilates , a yoga-based discipline that improves flexibility , strength and endurance . he told the radio times : ` i work in a small class . i 've done big-group classes , bikram yoga and so on , but i find pilates helps me the most because the work can be tailored day by day . ' therapy : andy murray has told radio times magazine that pilates has been helping with a problematic back injury . murray , who is ranked the second best player in the world , will no doubt be hoping that pilates , which is favoured by celebrities including madonna and gwyneth paltrow , helps him win wimbledon and become the first british player to take the trophy since fred perry in 1936 . murray , who describes missing the french open as being ` really hard ' , said that losing to roger federer in last year 's wimbledon final was the toughest loss he has ever suffered . he told the magazine : ` i was struggling after i 'd lost at wimbledon . it was one of the toughest matches for me to lose . ` three or four days afterwards , i woke up thinking i 'd won wimbledon . when i realised i had n't , that set me back again , but once i was back on the practice court i started to feel better . ' he added that he has n't been able to bring himself to watch the losing match and admitted that he rarely watches videos of himself playing . murray 's comments come as female tennis star laura robson revealed that her own technique for getting over a loss is to watch sad films . she said : ` sometimes after i lose , i torture myself even more and watch a really sad movie . ` it 's probably not the best idea , but then you ca n't watch them when you 're having a good day , because it ruins your day . if your day 's already ruined , then it 's fine . ' miss robson , 19 , who partnered murray in the mixed doubles tournament at the olympics last year , described him as ` a funny guy who does n't take himself too seriously off court ' . runner up : murray was disappointed to finish second in last year 's wimbledon championship after he was beaten in the final by roger federer , left . emotional : andy murray won many new fans after he openly wept after losing last year 's wimbledon final . she added : ` he 's an incredible player and we 're lucky to have him . he moves so well , returns so well , so i tried to take as much as i could from the time we spent on court together . hopefully that 's paid off a bit . ' murray , who was criticised for his aggressive style of play at the beginning of his career , won the hearts of the nation after becoming emotional when he lost the final . he graciously accepted his runner 's up prize , then sobbed through a television interview on centre court . now he is putting all his efforts into making sure he is ready for this summer 's tournament . he said : ` i 'll be short of match practice -lsb- for wimbledon -rsb- , but hopefully i 'll have had more time on the grass courts and have a bit of a head start . ' joker : laura robson , who won an olympic silver medal with murray in the mixed doubles at last year 's london games , says that murray does n't take himself too seriously off court . and murray , who lives in oxshott with his girlfriend kim sears and their dogs , maggie may and rusty , has transformed his regency-style home into part living space , part fitness centre . he uses high-tech pilates machines called the reformer and the cadillac and spends his spare time walking the dogs around the leafy surrey village . he said : ` i love walking the dogs . i grew up around my grandparents ' retrievers and labradors . ` my parents both worked , so after school my brother and i would go round to gran and grandpa 's house and they always had two dogs , a boy and a girl . ` it 's great that kim and i are able to have two of them , too . kim takes them out in the morning and when i 'm back from training we go out again .
