{"text": "shipshape : jo wood pictured at canvey island in the 1970s , when she was still 16-year-old jo howard . i was barely 12 when my daydreams began to sharpen into a single focused ambition -- and i certainly would n't need to know quadratic equations to achieve it . it was the end of the sixties and everywhere you looked you saw a model called twiggy . from the moment i saw that girl with bambi eyes in jackie magazine , i knew i wanted to be her . hey , jo , i thought , you could do this , too ! when my class was asked to write an essay on ` my future career ' , i wrote about how i was going to be a top model and live in knightsbridge . there was only one small thing standing between me and model superstardom : i 'd been an angelic-looking little girl , but almost overnight i 'd become a big-toothed , geeky-haired , skinny-legged kid . the next day in class i found a group of girls reading my essay aloud in fits of laughter . i was determined to prove them wrong , and the idea of becoming a model occupied my every waking hour . it was n't the money or fame that appealed : i just wanted to wear fabulous clothes and be in beautiful pictures . so , in the summer of my 14th year , my parents sent me to the london academy of modelling on old bond street . the tutors were former models who taught us etiquette , make-up skills and how to walk with stacks of books on our heads . in those days it was all about deportment and nothing like the slouchy strut of today 's models . my blossoming looks and confidence fortunately coincided with the realisation that boys were rather interesting . as well as the school builders , my friend dympna and i had an ongoing flirtation with a cute lad called andrew . that ended abruptly after he showed us his willy . i was totally cool because i had two brothers , but for the rest of the day i 'd catch dympna shuddering : ` oh , it was horrible . . . horrible . ' then there was the vicar 's son , michael . the vicarage overlooked our house and whenever he saw me come into my bedroom he 'd hold up a sign saying , ` i love you jo . ' i would smile and wave , just to be polite , but then one day i saw him at the window with a telescope trained on my room . . . i was 15 when , with trembling hands , i flicked through the daily mirror and found what i was looking for : a photo of a young girl wearing a simple white dress and holding a daisy , her blonde hair falling about her shoulders , captioned : ` jo karslake , from benfleet in essex ' . my dream had come true . i was a model . my big break had come courtesy of an amateur photographer called robert hallmann , who had heard about my modelling ambition . not long after , a letter arrived addressed to ` jo karslake , benfleet , essex ' . dad was instantly suspicious and whipped it away , but mum told me later it was from a bloke saying he wanted to take me into the hop fields and ` show you what real life is about ' . as you can imagine , dad freaked . so i changed my name to jo howard , after dad 's middle name . he was a bit happier then . i was next whisked off to a posh dentist to fix the gap between my two front teeth -lrb- a gap that , ironically , is the height of fashion these days -rrb- and i was soon armed with my new model card , featuring richard 's shots and the following blurb : ` jo howard . height 5 ' 6 , bust 33 , waist 23 , hips 35 , inside leg 31 , outside 40 . hair : blonde . eyes : blue . ' big dreams : jo wood with siblings vinnie , lize and paul aged 14 , at the height of her twiggy obsession , and determined to become a model . i started working for all the teen magazines , especially jackie , for the fun , playful shoots : roller - skating , jumping off walls -- that sort of thing . i did a job with three other models for a german magazine in which we had to have a food fight . at the studio there was a table covered with cream cakes , buns and jellies . the other girls were a bit timid , but i really got stuck in . my life became a dizzying succession of pinch-me moments . i was sent to paris for the pret-a-porter shows and remember setting off with dreams of the chanel catwalk , but the reality turned out to be altogether less glamorous . i stayed in a grotty little flat that reeked of drains and did n't get a single job . things looked up when one of the other models promised me a fabulous night out , but when i arrived at the restaurant , i found her sitting with two much older men , all sweaty palms and leering eyes . even at 16 , it did n't take me long to work out that i 'd been invited as dessert . after one clammy grope too many , i made my excuses and fled . but things soon picked up professionally : it was as if someone had stamped on the accelerator . i embarked on some crazy years as a single girl about town , meeting pretty much everyone in london including , of course , my future husband ronnie wood . it was the start of an extra-ordinary 30-year adventure . last days : jo and ronnie at daughter leah 's wedding in 2008 shortly before they split . after ronnie left in 2008 , i could n't face leaving the house . i would wander from room to room , looking at all the mementoes of our life together . i felt utterly lost . for most of my adult life i had been defined by my relationship with ronnie and the rolling stones . i had been part of them and protected by them . now , not only was i losing my husband , i was losing my identity . it is only with hindsight , that i realise there was nothing to be afraid of outside the golden prison . i am now in control of my life . i get respect for my own achievements . i 'm not going to lie -- i do miss being absolutely spoilt . that is wonderful ! but if you 're constantly treated like a cossetted child , you can sometimes start to behave like one . in that respect , stepping outside the rolling stones was a huge growing-up process for me -- and i have now grown into the person i was meant to be all along . and while i might not fly first-class every time , i 'll take freedom and independence over a bit of extra leg-room any day . © jo wood 2013 . hey jo , by jo wood , is published by harpercollins , priced # 16.99 . to order your copy for # 14.99 inc p & p , call the mail book shop on 0844 472 4157 or go to mailbookshop.co.uk .", "summary": " jo wood speaks of her early years as a model - before the days of ronnie .   quickly learned the downsides of model life during a paris trip aged 16 .
