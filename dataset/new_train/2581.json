{"text": "germany has only produced two formula one champions , but they are two of the greatest drivers the sport has ever known -- and they can thank one man for spotting their nascent talent . michael schumacher and sebastian vettel have won 11 world titles between them , winning renown across the globe for their record-breaking feats . and the story of their success started in the small town of kerpen , where gerhard noack is known as the man who finds champions at the local go-kart club . it was at this innocuous circuit , carved out of an old gravel pit , that noack first spotted the potential of germany 's two giants of motorsport . but his involvement in karting happened almost by accident .  i got to know the schumacher family , the father and mother ,  noack explained to cnn 's the circuit in a rare television interview .  that 's when i first really found out about kart sport .  that way i also met michael schumacher , and i enjoyed it so much , us both being in motorsport , that i stuck with it .  schumacher grew up in kerpen , where he graduated from a homemade kart at the age of four to become the benchmark for f1 . the 44-year-old , who began his f1 career in 1991 , won a record seven world championships before retiring for a second time more than 20 years after his debut season . it is a little ironic that after being introduced to karting by the schumacher family , noack would go on to mentor the man who is already well on the road to usurping schumacher 's place in f1 history . vettel -- dubbed  baby schumi  when he made his f1 debut seven years ago -- has already won four consecutive world titles with red bull and collected several of the old maestro 's racing records in the process . all this at the age of just 26 -- no wonder noack saw his potential as schumacher 's successor .  sebastian was not the first great talent after michael ,  explained noack , who also coached a generation of german f1 racers that included ralf schumacher , heinz-harald frentzen and nick heidfeld .  there are many great race drivers that all came from this club but sebastian was the first one where i felt a special connection .  he 's got something that michael has too , a very special personality , great will and a lot of talent , and that led me to decide to look after him in that way .  the first time i saw sebastian was in 1996 . he was a bambini driver and racing in kerpen .  we were watching a race particularly closely and it was in the rain . some of the drivers had changed to rain tires , sebastian continued to drive with slicks -lrb- dry weather tires -rrb- .  he was very dominant compared to the others even without rain tires , and that impressed me so much that i said i want to give it another go and see if i can manage this young driver to get into formula one .  after the long gap between michael and sebastian , i just decided to approach the vettel family and try to support such a young driver .  noack decided to temporarily rent out his business to help guide vettel 's career or , in his own words ,  smooth the way for him .   after all those years in motorsport i knew a few important people and , thank god , we were lucky to always find the right people at the right time to support sebastian ,  the businessman explained .  i myself was his mechanic , his coach , all those things that you need in karting . we went to the races together , we lived together , at the weekends at least , and the family was always there , too .  i did everything that was needed also to sort out the financial background , to find the right people and the right sponsors , and luckily we always did .  those connections helped him sign vettel to red bull racing 's junior academy at the age of 13 . after a stint as a reserve for the bmw sauber team , the young racer began his first full season in f1 with red bull 's junior toro rosso team in 2008 . this year vettel became one of just four men to win the f1 world title four times , and noack predicts his former charge could one day surpass all schumacher has achieved .  i believe that sebastian will certainly be able to get the seven titles ,  noack said .  but a lot depends on whether the team he 's with at the time is competitive . .  at the moment there really is no need to change the team . red bull are great , it 's where the best people are , and he proves it at every race .  at some point he might change the team . i think in the next few years there is no question about it .  schumacher , who won his world titles with benetton and ferrari , recently conceded in an interview with his former mercedes team that he is happy for vettel to take over his mantle .  if someone can break all these records then i prefer him to do it than somebody else ,  said schumacher , who vettel cited as his inspiration growing up .  i did what i did in my time and he 's doing it in his time -- i 'm glad it is him in the end .  schumacher bowed out of the f1 spotlight at the end of 2012 after a second career with the silver arrows , and revealed since his retirement that he too has been helping find the next generation of racing stars .  i 'm looking after young drivers in the go-kart area ,  explained schumacher , who occasionally returns to kerpen to drop in on his racing alma mater . vettel is likely to be in the spotlight for many years to come , but he too stays in touch with his roots -- and the man who helped his talent grow .  the last time we talked in person was at the nurburgring -lrb- home of the german grand prix -rrb- ,  revealed noack .  since he won his fourth title we have only been able to speak on the phone . i hope we will have time again to go out for a meal or have time for a longer chat .  we have very little time for each other , but that will improve in the winter months .  and does noack see a changein the boy who has become red bull 's all-conquering racer ?  he has grown up , that 's the only thing that 's changed about him ,  noack reflected .  other than that he is , in my view at least , still the same sebastian that he was when he was eight years old . i never notice that anything much has changed about him .  he always worked hard , and above all , he has the will to persevere , always challenging his opponents , and ultimately winning .  that 's always been the case with him and you can still see that in him today . all that and he still remains down to earth .  the same could be said of noack . he may have nurtured two racing superstars but he is content in kerpen , running his karting business -- and keeping one eye on track for the next racing prodigy .", "summary": " michael schumacher and sebastian vettel were both nurtured by the same man .   they were guided in their junior careers by gerhard noack in the town of kerpen .   noack was introduced to karting through his friendship with the schumacher family .   he says four-time champion vettel will eclipse schumacher 's record seven titles .
