' bananas are very high in potassium , a mineral essential for survival but which the body , especially the heart , is particularly sensitive to . a single medium banana contains an average of 422mg of potassium , and while it would be nearly impossible to cause a cardiac arrest through consuming food , eating excessive levels can put a strain on the kidneys , which have to filter out the excess . british dietetic association spokesperson , aisling pigott says : ` this interesting and alternative diet advocated by the banana girl appears to have helped the lady that promotes the diet , however conflicts with traditional healthy eating advice which recommends variety , portion control and moderation . often garnering comments for being too thin , freelee has nonetheless have gained 166 thousand subscribers on her youtube channel preaching the benefits of her lifestyle . freelee captioned this picture on her instagram account : ` seven years of eating 90 % more of my calories from fruit and more fruit than any other female on the planet , averaging between 2,500 and 3,500 calories a day . judge by results vs theory folks because the proof is in the banana pudding ' ` there are some benefits to the diet . for example , a well-balanced vegan diet can be extremely healthy if managed correctly , however all vegans should pay particular attention to their iron and calcium intake in addition to a vitamin b12 supplement . ` raw fruit and vegetables retain more vitamins and minerals than cooked fruit and vegetables and . controversial instagram sensation loni jane anthony hit headlines recently when she boasted she 's ` living proof that you do n't have to become a whale when you 're pregnant ' . the australian social media star first came under fire six months into her pregnancy , when she claimed she would continue her plant-based diet - which involved eating 20 bananas a day - throughout pregnancy . she says her diet has kept her in ` good shape ' . ` the banana girl promotes home cooked food and including less processed food as per traditional healthy eating advice . ` however , the negative points of this diet are quite concerning . this diet contains no food sources of vitamin b12 , limited calcium and little iron . ` poor intake of vitamin b12 and iron over an extended time can lead to vitamin b12 and iron deficiency anaemia characterised by tiredness , upset stomach , poor skin colour and easy bruising . ` poor intake of calcium over a long time leads to low bone mineral density and brittle bones . ` there is no element of portion control incorporated into these recommendations and based on scientific evidence and research , this is unlikely to lead to any weight loss if foods are consumed in the quantities recommended . ` a small amount of fat is required for optimal health due to fat soluble , this diet recommends 10 per cent of calories coming from fat -lrb- 38g/fat/day -rrb- which may not be sufficient to meet the needs of all individuals . ` the sugar and carbohydrate content of this diet is extremely high . a high sugar and carbohydrate diet is linked with poor dental health and poor blood sugar control in those with diabetes or at risk of diabetes . ` eating large amounts of one food - for example bananas - can displace essential nutrients available from other foods . ` in summary , i would always encourage my clients to include more raw fruit and vegetables in their diet , aiming for a variety of raw and cooked fruit and vegetables alongside a healthy balanced diet of portion controlled -lrb- about the size of your fist at each meal -rrb- starchy carbohydrates -lrb- such as bread , rice , potato , pasta -rrb- and protein -lrb- meat , eggs , beans or pulses -rrb- with two to three portions of calcium enriched foods/day -lrb- dairy or dairy alternatives -rrb- and limited fat , sugar and processed foods .
