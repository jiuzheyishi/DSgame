{"text": "an british inventor has designed a new fridge that can keep live-saving vaccines cool for 35 days without power . the appliance is designed for use in the developing world where some remote areas have no electricity , power cuts can be frequent and vaccines are vital for healthy communities . the bill and melinda gates foundation has donated a $ 1.4 million -lrb- # 836,000 -rrb- to help fridge company sure chill further develop the potentially life-saving design . scroll down for video . one cool idea : inventor ian tansley -lrb- pictured left -rrb- developed the unique cooling technology . which uses water to keep supplies of vaccines cool in remote . medical centres -lrb- right -rrb- . the sure chill fridges can keep its life-saving contents cool at a regular 4 °c for up to 35 days - even if the temperature outside is as high as 43 °c . at 4 °c , water is at its heaviest and sinks . this explains why lakes can be frozen but fish can swim beneath the surface . the same concept is used to create the fridge that adapts its temperature naturally so it automatically cools to the optimum temperature - a constant 4 °c even without power . water surrounds a sure chill refrigeration compartment . when the fridge is hooked up to a power source , the water cools and forms ice around the compartment to leave only water at four degrees cooling the contents . however , when the power is turned off , the water warms and rises while the ice melts , so that only water at 4 °c remains , cooling the contents of the compartment . ian tansley of the sure chill company , based in snowdonia , north wales , developed the unique cooling technology which uses water to keep supplies of vaccines cool in remote medical centres . ` the devices will allow vaccines to be stored safely in challenging environments with no power and ambient temperatures as high as 43 °c , ' he said . ` conventional refrigeration technologies can put vaccines at risk of either freezing or getting too warm . ' ` our technology ensures that vaccines reach children in the best condition possible and has the potential to save the lives of countless children across the world . ' at 4 °c water sinks and this scientific fact inspired mr tansley to create the new refrigeration system that adapts its temperature naturally so it automatically cools to the optimum temperature - a constant 4 °c even without power . this temperature is perfect for storing food and vaccines . changing lives : the $ 1.4 million -lrb- # 836,000 -rrb- cash from the bill and melinda gates foundation will enable the welsh firm to start field trials in east and west africa for the new coolers within the next year . here , a different model is moved into place at a remote health centre . it works because water surrounds a sure chill refrigeration compartment . when the fridge is hooked up to a power source , the water cools and forms ice around the compartment to leave only water at 4 °c , cooling the contents . however , when the power is turned off , the water warms and rises while the ice melts , so that still only water at 4 °c remains cooling the contents of the compartment . the company said that its fridge has ` its own internal and entirely natural energy store that maintains a completely steady temperature . the system can operate like this , without power , for days and weeks . ' the invention has received financial backing from the bill and melinda gates foundation , which aims to transform people 's lives who are living in poverty without access to adequate healthcare . the $ 1.4 million -lrb- # 836,000 -rrb- cash injection will enable the welsh firm to start field trials in east and west africa for the new coolers within the next year . the firm already has 10-day vaccine refrigerators operating in over 30 countries - and is recognised by the world health organisation . it shipped 200 devices to the philippines at the beginning of this year to help unicef in the wake of super typhoon haiyan . good things come in small packages : the firm already has 10-day vaccine refrigerators operating in over 30 countries - and is recognised by the world health organisation . it is also developing a small vaccine cooler -lrb- pictured -rrb- that is more portable and could be taken to remote areas in an emergency .", "summary": " an inventor in snowdonia , north wales , has received $ 1.4 million -lrb- # 836,000 -rrb- from microsoft founder bill gates to develop his sure chill fridge .   appliance is designed for use in the developing world where power cuts can be frequent and some remote areas are without any electricity .   fridge can store vaccines at 4 °c without power for up to 35 days .   technology is based on the fact that at 4 °c water is at its heaviest and sinks .
