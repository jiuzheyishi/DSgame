{"text": "get dialing for your reservation now : noma in copenhagen has been named the world 's best restaurant at a ceremony revealing the planet 's top 50 dining venues . to raucous cheers , high fives , hugs and kisses , team noma took to the stage in a packed london venue in jubilant scenes that would n't be out of place at the world cup in brazil later this year . noma 's top honor in the prestigious san pellegrino world 's 50 best restaurant awards -- viewed as the oscars of fine dining -- was the fourth win for minimalist danish pioneer of foraged menus . the award was presented late monday at a ceremony in central london attended by some of the world 's leading chefs .  it 's too -lrb- expletive deleted -rrb- crazy !  said noma 's head chef , rene redzepi , picking up the award .  thank you for believing in us .  in the last year -lrb- after the restaurant was awarded second place -rrb- my staff and i looked into each others ' eyes and said ` let 's just really really work hard . ' we made a plan and said ` let 's make this the best year we 've ever had . '   but to have this is a whole surprise , none of us expected it .  the list , now in its 12th year , is dominated by european venues , but there were prizes for restaurants from around the world , including asia 's first top 20 entry . the biggest climber was lima , peru , restaurant central , which jumped from no. 50 last year to no. 15 this year . the highest debut entry was gaggan from bangkok , which came in at no. 17 . highly influential . there were few changes in the list 's top 10 . last year 's winner , spain 's el celler de can roca , was bumped to second place , with italy 's osteria francescana holding steady at number three . despite the repeat victory for noma , it 's still yet to match the record of spain 's el bulli , which claimed four successive wins before head chef ferran adria closed its doors in 2011 . other winners in the top 10 were , in fourth place new york 's eleven madison park , followed by spain 's mugaritz , brazil 's d.o.m. , london 's dinner by heston blumenthal , spain 's arzak , chicago 's alinea and the ledbury , another london restaurant . noma , which celebrates its 10th anniversary this year , was praised for its  fresh approach and energy .  the restaurant 's menu serves diners with a series of  snacks  largely sourced from the nordic landscape -- dishes that include sea urchin toast and a beef tartar that includes ants . most of the winners -- a total of 28 -- were from europe , with spain claiming seven top 50 positions . nahm , a thai restaurant in bangkok that earlier this year was named asia 's best , made it to number 13 in the list -- the region 's highest entry . organized by uk-based restaurant magazine and sponsored by italian drinks manufacturers san pellegrino and acqua panna , the awards are seen as highly influential in the fine dining industry . noma 's first win in 2010 is credited with catapulting the restaurant to international stardom . reputedly , the day after winning , it received enough online reservations to fill its 45 seats for a decade -- thankfully , it only takes bookings for a few weeks in advance . some observers say the awards now hold greater sway over a restaurant 's financial success and bookings than coveted michelin star rankings , often transforming them into major travel destinations . ` beauty contest '  this is the big one ,  contest chairman richard vines told cnn ahead of the awards .  although you can argue about the list , everyone wants to be on it .  vines said the list is n't a rival to michelin 's  systematic  assessments , describing it as a spontaneous  beauty contest for restaurants .  the list was decided by votes compiled from 900 restaurant industry figures . the winning names were closely guarded ahead of this year 's ceremony after details were leaked prior to announcement in 2013 . british chef fergus henderson received a lifetime achievement award at this year 's event . henderson 's st. john restaurant in london has championed  nose-to-tail  eating that utilizes every part of an animal . san pellegrino world 's 50 best restaurants for 2014 . 1 . noma , copenhagen , denmark . 2 . el celler de can roca , girona , spain . 3 .
