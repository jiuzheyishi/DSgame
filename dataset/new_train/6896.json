' awards of punitive damages by tribunals are virtually unheard of in this country . mr davies said : ` there is no limit to the amount a tribunal can award in damages for sex discrimination . ` it is only a matter of time before a uk tribunal adopts the u.s. approach to punitive damages to kill discriminatory practices that still flourish here . ' in legal papers lodged at central london employment tribunal on friday , miss abraham accuses scudamore of ` despicable and vile ' behaviour and says she has never received an apology from him . miss abraham , who has 14 years ' experience as a personal assistant and previously worked for vodafone and orange , says she felt compelled to blow the whistle . she says : ` on discovering the sexist work emails in the course of my work at the premier league , i was offended and disgusted . ' i actually re-read a few of the emails because i could not believe that i had read them correctly . it was surreal and very disturbing . ` as i discovered others in the course of my work , i found it completely sexist , disgusting , vulgar and very disrespectful to women . ` my grandfather always taught me to speak up for what i believe in . i knew that i had to do the right thing and expose what i had discovered . ' i was in shock . in a way , i still am . then i could not believe that such an important executive could behave in such a despicable and vile manner . ` later , i was in shock at the way the premier league failed to investigate the matter and failed to discipline him . ' miss abraham said she was shocked that the premier league failed to discipline scudamore . miss abraham says that scudamore ` humiliated ' his wife and five daughters by saying women become more irrational with every child they have . she said : ` given my experience of his misogynistic conduct i feel very sorry for his wife and daughters . ' i do not believe that mr scudamore has any respect for women employees or indeed women generally . ' ' i did not want to work with or have to face richard scudamore any more . ' i realised that the premier league was institutionally sexist from top to bottom and that i did not want to work there any longer . ' i could not believe that such an important executive could behave in such a despicable and vile manner ' rani abraham . ` as soon as i read the sexist emails i knew that our working relationship was irretrievably damaged by his conduct . i no longer respected him . ` the point is that the chief executive had used his work email account to send out vulgar and sexist communications and he did not seek to censor or moderate his vile language even though he must have known that in the course of my work it was likely that i would view them at some point and bedistressed by it . ` it came as a complete shock to me and afterwards i felt humiliated , harassed and belittled . ' i did not want any future female executive assistant to have to suffer as i had . ' i also thought it was in the public interest that people knew about the sexism at the premier leaguerani says of her predecessor paola nyderek : ` it was clear when i mentioned paola that staff were visibly uncomfortable about it . no-one said anything apart from that it did not work out . it was odd . ' miss abraham , of kingsbury , north-west london , worked at the premier league as scudamore 's # 40,000-a-year temporary pa for two months between september and november last year . she said : ` as the executive assistant i was asked to monitor and to manage mr scudamore 's three company email accounts , all of which are @premierleague . com addresses . ' i have never accessed mr scudamore 's private email accounts and indeed do not know if he has such an account . ' miss abraham 's legal action will pile further pressure on scudamore to resign . she says she was told : ` keep on top of his emails . stay one step ahead of him and then you 'll know exactly what he wants ' . she says scudamore falsely claimed she accessed private emails against his instructions to try and discredit her . she said : ` this was clear victimisation and harassment of me . he was taking a swipe at my professionalism and integrity in order to divert from his own illegal sexist conduct . ` for the record he has never apologised to me for the offence caused to me . ` of course , because he is unaccountable at the biased and institutionally sexist premier league and the not fit for purpose fa i have now had to issue an employment tribunal claim to obtain justice . ' she brands the fa 's claim that it could not charge scudamore because it was a private matter ` nonsense ' . she said : ` it was not a private matter . the communications occurred in work emails . it was simply a cover up by the fa . ' rani admits forwarding some of the offending emails to her own personal account as evidence . she says scudamore phoned her at home two days after she started working from there as she was suffering from stress . she said that he said ` it 's just not working out , is it ? ' and then went quiet . she says :  my contract was to be ended by them that day . mr scudamore asked me to compile a list of outstanding matters and to put it in an email to him . ` he did not thank me for my work at the premier league . ` after the call , although it was shocking , i actually felt very relieved because i thought i could not return to work in such a hostile , sexist working environment . ' miss abraham says she told her job agency what had happened and forwarded one of the emails to them but never heard from the agency again . it was only after she finally found another job seven months later that she dared blow the whistle . miss abraham says that she has suffered ` stress , anxiety and depression ' over the whole affair . scudamore likes to be seen as a champion of equality in football and has worked with the fa to promote a multi-million pound women and girls ' programme . however , football association 's powerful independent board member heather rabbatts has said he should consider his position . and a number of england women internationals , including everton women 's goalkeeper rachel brown-finnis , have also called for tough action . after the emails were revealed , scudamore said : ` entering into email exchanges of this nature was wrong and the apology i have made is sincere , as is the contrition i feel . ' he is having a ` routine ' heart operation next week - but plans to be back in his role by the start of the season . a statement from the premier league said : ` the premier league would resist strongly any such claims . ` it would be inappropriate for us to comment any further as there is an ongoing investigation by the information commissioner 's office and the police into the unauthorised removal of confidential business and legally privileged material .
