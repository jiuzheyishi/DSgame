{"text": "updated : . 09:22 est , 6 january 2012 . it has emerged that even the duchess of cambridge underwent a check by the criminal records bureau before becoming a volunteer for the scouts . her wedding to prince william was watched by two billion across the globe making her one of the most recognisable faces on the planet . yet it has emerged that even the duchess of cambridge underwent a check by the criminal records bureau before becoming a volunteer for the scouts . it was announced yesterday that she is to help out at her local scout group on anglesey as part of a new package of royal patronages . this will see her lend a hand at meetings close to the rented farmhouse she shares with prince william . confirming the crb check had been carried out , a scout association spokesman added : ` the duchess does not need to be crb checked to undertake this occasional volunteering role but she has chosen to take it so that in future she might form part of the team for camps and for sleep-overs . ' he added that decisions on whether the organisation asks volunteers to undergo a check depends on their duties and will take into account such factors as whether that person is working with other adults and has supervised access to young people . by having the crb check , the duchess will be able to expand on the types of activities that she undertakes within the organisation . st james 's palace added : ` the duchess was happy to comply , submitted her forms and is very much looking forward to starting as soon as possible . ' but the fact that even the woman who might one day become the queen had to undergo such a check has raised questions about the blanket need for vetting . josie appleton , director of the . manifesto club , a civil liberties group , said : ` this shows the height of . crb hysteria , and the fact that nobody is above suspicion . ` even royals are considered . potentially risky until they have their  safe adult card  . we are . trusting too much to bureaucracy - and not enough to common sense or . people 's reputations . ` the . chance of the duchess of cambridge being a paedophile is precisely zero . - likewise for the thousands of grandmothers and mothers who must do . crb checks before they can volunteer to listen to children read , or . teach them to cook . ' ministers have said they want the crb checks , introduced in 2006 after the soham murders of holly wells and jessica chapman , to be reduced to ` common sense ' levels . among those affected by the legislation were a group of cathedral flower arrangers who last year staged a rebellion against demands they undergo the intrusive checks . twenty women from gloucester cathedral flower guild , including head flower arranger 64-year-old annabel hayter -lrb- pictured -rrb- refused to have their pasts examined . ` even royals are considered potentially risky until they have their  safe adult card  . we are trusting too much to bureaucracy - and not enough to common sense or people 's reputations . ` the chance of the duchess of cambridge being a paedophile is precisely zero - likewise for the thousands of grandmothers and mothers who must do crb checks before they can volunteer to listen to children read , or teach them to cook . ' most royals hold honorary roles in organisations which means they need not have the checks . the queen is patron of the scout association and the duke of kent is its president . neither has had a crb check . founded by robert baden-powell in 1907 to help young people with their ` physical , mental and spiritual development ' , the scouting movement requires members to be loyal , friendly , courageous and considerate -- as well as keeping to the famous motto to ` be prepared ' . at the age of eight , kate enrolled as a brownie with the 1st st andrew 's pack in pangbourne , berkshire , so has some experience of the movement . concerns that extensive use of the checks are deterring volunteers and putting vital community services at risk were raised last year despite coalition pledges to scale them back . it was estimated that almost a million checks were made in the previous 12 months , a six-fold increase since the crb was launched in 2002 . the figures were obtained by the manifesto club under the freedom of information act . the club , which campaigns against over-regulation , claims that many local authorities are still demanding ` blanket ' vetting of volunteers . last year the former archbishop of canterbury lord carey criticised ` unnecessary ' criminal record checks after disclosing he had undergone five just to conduct a service or preach a sermon . lord carey said that after he retired from his role in 2002 , he had been asked by some dioceses to help out as an assistant bishop . he said that every time he agreed to a new role he was required to have a crb check -- to vet those working with children or the vulnerable -- even if he would not be working with children . ` i had five sometimes , ' he said . ` it 's crazy . ' ministers have said they want the checks , introduced in 2006 after the soham murders of holly wells and jessica chapman , to be reduced to ` common sense ' levels . the vetting scheme , which requires everyone working with ` vulnerable ' groups to register , has been fiercely criticised for requiring checks on a staggering nine million adults , many of them volunteers . among those affected by the legislation were a group of cathedral flower arrangers who last year staged a rebellion against demands they undergo the intrusive checks . twenty women from gloucester cathedral flower guild , including head flower arranger annabel hayter , 64 , refused to have their pasts examined . miss hayter , who was forced to resign because she refused to have the check , said at the time : ` it is insulting . they are all lovely ladies who would not hurt a fly . they are not paedophiles . when i can rise above the sadness of it all it is laughable , pathetic .
