{"text": "a trip down to the local video , and more recently dvd , store has become a thing of the past thanks to the rise of video streaming services . companies including netflix and lovefilm let viewers indulge in back-to-back episodes of hit tv series at the click of a button . now , a new study has shown that streaming can be much better for the environment , requiring less energy and emitting less carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- than some traditional methods of dvd renting , buying and viewing . new research published in the journal environmental research letters suggests that it would be more ` green ' to scrap dvds in favour of using streaming services . this is for two reasons , one that dvd players use more energy than comparable streaming services and also that people sometimes have to drive to buy or rent dvds . the researchers , who published their study today in the journal environmental research letters , cite modern devices such as laptops and tablets as the reason for this improvement . this is because they are much more efficient than older , energy-sapping dvd players . furthermore , the driving that is required to go and buy , or rent , dvds makes this method much more energy - and carbon-intensive . netflix has signed a deal with three small cable-providers in the us to become a regular tv channel . the . agreements with atlantic broadband , rcn telecom services and grande . communications gives the internet streaming site 's subscription service a . channel on tivo boxes that the companies provide their customers . it debuted on atlantic and rcn in late april and is now expanding on to grande 's service . a significant proportion of the energy consumption and carbon emissions for streaming comes from the transmission of data , which increases drastically when more complex , high-definition content is streamed . the study was carried out by researchers from lawrence berkley national laboratory in california and northwestern university in chicago . they estimated that if all dvd viewing in the us was shifted to streaming services in 2011 , around 2 billion kg of co2 emissions could have been avoided and around 30 petajoules -lrb- pj -rrb- of energy saved . that 's the equivalent of the amount of electricity needed to meet the demands of 200,000 us households . they estimated that in 2011 , 192 pj of energy was used , and 10.4 billion kg of co2 emitted , for all methods of dvd consumption and streaming in the us . from this , they calculated that one hour of video streaming requires 7.9 megajoules -lrb- mj -rrb- of energy , compared to as much as 12 mj for traditional dvd viewing , and emits 0.4 kilograms -lrb- 0.9 pounds -rrb- of co2 , compared to as much as 0.71 kg -lrb- 1.6 pounds -rrb- of co2 for dvd viewing . video streaming services such as netflix , youtube , vimeo and hulu have risen hugely in popularity in the last few years and have successfully dented the sales of dvds - but the researchers say it might be time to scrap the format completely . to arrive at their results , the researchers compared video streaming with four different types of dvd consumerism : dvds that are rented from online mailers ; dvds that are rented from a store ; dvds that are purchased online ; and dvds that are bought from a store . video streaming was limited to tv and movies and did not include shorter videos that are streamed online through youtube , vimeo and so on . they found that video streaming and the online rental of dvds required similar amounts of energy ; however , the renting and purchasing of dvds from a store were much more energy intensive , due to the impact of driving . ` it 's a modern-day equivalent of the debate about which is more environmentally sound - the disposable or the cloth diaper , ' says lead author of the research arman shehabi from lawrence berkley national laboratory . ` our study suggests that equipment designers and policy makers should focus on improving the efficiency of end-user devices and network transmission energy to curb the energy use from future increases in video streaming . ` such efficiency improvements will be particularly important in the near future , when society is expected to consume far greater quantities of streaming video content compared to today . '", "summary": " scientists say that using streaming services is better for the environment .   their research found that dvd players are wasteful and not very green .   also driving to a store to buy or rent a dvd in itself releases more co2 .   they suggest the rise of sites like netflix and youtube is good for earth .   and they say it might be time to get rid of dvds forever .
