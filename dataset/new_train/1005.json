{"text": "the release of the iphone 6 was eagerly anticipated all around the world . but one apple fan went to great lengths to ensure he was the first to get his hands on one , by changing time zones and flying down to australia for the launch ... just so he could drop the first iphone 6 in a pitcher of beer . canadian based musician michael mooney spent 22 hours on a plane so he could be the first to buy an iphone in brisbane , even paying the first people in the queue of 2,000 to hand over their handset . but it was no accident that the first iphone 6 met such a sticky ending , mr mooney dropped it into his beer on purpose . as part of a clever marketing ploy , the musician was working to promote a product that claims to revive phones even when they have been completely saturated . reviveaphone tasked mr mooney with acquiring the first iphone 6 on the market , so he could test out the product with a fun video . so he headed to australia , which was the first country to welcome the release date of september 19 , due to time zone differences . beer time : mr mooney pours the beer into his pitcher as he prepares to drop his iphone 6 into the liquid . expensive drop : mr mooney then drops the world 's first iphone 6 into his pitcher of beer . mr mooney is the lead signer of a montreal band called le trouble and a good friend of the production company that filmed the reviveaphone video . the video was shot from september 16 to september 19 and it involved flying mr mooney and two-man crew to brisbane . mr mooney said , ` when the guys approached me with this crazy and beautiful idea , i had to go with it . what 's funny is that nothing was guaranteed . would we get to the store on time ? would we get the first phone ? of course , we were confident reviveaphone would bring the iphone back to life , but it was all a big gamble ... those four days were totally hectic , and boy did we have fun ! ' dying : the iphone 6 is placed in the pitcher where it quickly dies and the lights fade out . second chance : moments later mr mooney takes the phone out of the pitcher and introduces revivaphone . on the day of the iphone 6 release mr mooney is taken aback by the length of the queue and he says , ' o wow , that line keeps going , you just ca n't see the end of that line from here . ' during the entertaining video mr mooney comes to an agreement with the first two people in line for the iphone 6 and he agrees to give his new friends thousands of dollars in return for the world 's first iphone 6 . the video then cuts to the morning of the iphone 6 release and an excited mr mooney . he says , ` our friends are being interviewed because they were the first in line but what they do n't know is the first phone is mine . ' when mr mooney finally gets his hands on the iphone 6 he kisses it and says , ` thank you very much everybody , that one 's mine . we came a long way for that b ***** d. ' drying : after he takes it out of the revivaphone pouch he leaves it outside to dry for 24 hours . minutes later the musician can be seen in a hotel with a large jug of beer and his actions would undoubtedly shock most iphone enthusiasts . mr mooney says , ` ladies and gentlemen i 'm now going to drop the world 's first iphone 6 into a full pitcher of beer . as he drops the electronic device he says , ` two thousand people lined up for this thing just then and we 've just dropped it in beer ? although the phone looks doomed as the display lights are extinguished as the beer infiltrates the device mr mooney then introduces the riviveaphone . test : after the drying period mr mooney then takes it back inside and attempts to switch it on . success : the apple logo lights up and following the reviveaphone intervention the phone is working again . he says , ` when you drop your phone in water or beer or whatever it 's not the liquid that makes the thing die , it 's the minerals in the liquid and somehow this stuff treats the minerals and works on the minerals . i do n't know i 'm not a scientist . ' mr mooney continues : ` you pour the liquid into the pouch and then stick the phone in and seal it . you leave this thing in for seven minutes and then you take it out and leave it to dry for 24 hours and you 're good to go . the video then cuts to mr mooney 24 hours later as he checks if the phone has been revived . ` this thing has been sitting outside for 24 hours drying and it is dry so i guess i 'll turn it on . ' the lead singer is delighted to see the phone lights up . he adds , ` please look at that , please , look at the apple and please see that that works .
