{"text": "an ` update ' of the scrabble app on social networking site facebook has left players lost for words . after electronic arts ea took over the running of the online game from scrabble brand owner mattel , it decided to revamp its game structure . sadly , these changes have not gone down with with seasoned players , with the key bone of contention being that player history has been deleted . outrage : the ` updated ' version of facebook app scrabble has been met with derision by loyal players . this means that the aggregate win percentage of a player who has been gaming for years has been lost to the abyss . this has led players , not surprisingly , bombarding the facebook page for the popular game showing their disgust with the new format . other changes include the dictionary being changed from chambers to collins , and the refresh stalling after a player 's turn . one post put by the page admin , totally unrelated to the ` update ' was met with a raft of negative comments . andrea appleyard wrote : ` the scrabble moment when u realise how only pure arrogance can fly in the face of such overwhelming opposition to the new format . . and still you just give the lot of us the finger ! aw well ! barbara bishop added : ' i miss playing scrabble - please admit that you made a serious mistake and bring back the original game . ' popular opinion : andrea appleyard 's comment was ` liked ' 315 times . negative : there is n't a positive comment in sight here . and this was echoed by fellow fan jacqueline smith who wrote : ` that scrabble moment when you discover that the game you loved to play had gone only to be replaced by a crap version !!! ' disgruntled users also have a facebook group to air their discontent after ` please bring back the scrabble we love ' was set up . this has attracted more than 2,000 members . game users have also complained that the new version of the game does not allow them to pick who they play against and have also dismissed the new design as ` brash ' . bad move : unfortunately there is n't many ` likeable ' comments on this post . helen jones , 54 , a support worker from southport said : ` i 've been playing for the past five years . i 'd play for around an hour of an evening when i come home from work . ` i 've met some really interesting people . of course they do not substitute friends , but we had a community . i 've just had a grandchild and a lot of the people i played with knew that and would ask how it was going . such is the strong feeling on this , a petition has been set-up called : ` scrabble - if it ai n't broke do n't fix it ' by john lewis from sheffield . on this petition , he writes : ` in the weeks running up sunday , 27th may 2013 , mattel promised a new  improved  version of scrabble . ` in our opinion what was delivered is a great disappointment . judging . by the comments left on scrabble playing message boards , dissatisfaction . is almost universal . there are very few if any of the community of . players who have messaged anything positive about the changes . ` we are now presented with a random playing partner and therefore . can not choose against someone who regards themselves as a novice or . against someone who considers themselves to be a serious player . this is . frustrating . ` we enjoyed having the choice of whether or not play a 2 minute game or a week game . that choice has now been removed . ' over 5,000 people have signed the petition so far . a spokesman for mattel said : ` the scrabble facebook game is now managed by a new partner ea mobile . ` the benefits of the new game include gameplay across devices , the addition of the collins official scrabble wordlist , the ability to play in six languages , the option to customise boards and tiles and the option to play ad-free . ` as part of the transition , we were unable to carry over ongoing games and statistics , the timer mode and the manual match-making function . ` the new version will have the same robust statistics moving forward . '", "summary": " new ` update ' sees players ' gaming histories lost forever .   gamers can no longer select who they wish to play against .   original chambers dictionary has been replaced by collins version .   but brand owner mattel back the update made by new partner ea mobile .
