{"text": "a new check for cervical cancer is far more effective than the traditional smear test , say doctors . thousands of young women 's lives could be saved by the new procedure . early trials have shown it detects affected cells before they are able to develop into cancer . a light micrograph showing cervical cancer cells . early trials have shown a new test can detect affected cells before they develop into cancer . unlike the current smear test , women . would be able to carry out the procedure in their own homes , saving . themselves the embarrassment of having it done at a surgery or hospital . the new test costs # 30 but researchers believe the price would be reduced considerably if it was rolled out across the nhs . they also calculate it would save the . health service # 50million a year because women would need to have the . test less frequently than smears , which are carried out every three to . five years . cervical cancer most commonly affects women aged between 25 and 50 and there are about 2,800 cases every year . women would provide a sample similar to a smear test which is then sent to a lab . but there are often no symptoms early on and in many cases the illness is only picked up in the advanced stages when it may be too difficult to treat . last year the cancer caused 936 deaths and hundreds of other women had to have chemotherapy and surgery for late-stage tumours which may have left them infertile . the do-it-yourself test detects the human papilloma virus -lrb- hpv -rrb- which causes tumours . women would provide a sample -- similar to a smear -- which is then sent to a lab . if they are found to have the virus , they would be invited back for more frequent screening every year or 18 months . those who did n't have the virus would not have to have another test for six years . crucially , the test can also pick up pre-cancerous tumours which are often not detected by smears . women would then be able to have surgery to remove these growths before they developed into cancer . researchers . from queen mary , university of london calculate that the procedure -- . known as primary hpv testing -- could save the lives of 150 women a year . they looked at the records of 8,750 women aged 25-64 diagnosed with cervical cancer between 2007 and 2012 . around 40 per cent had undergone a smear test within the previous six years which had come back clear . the researchers then calculated how many cancers could have been avoided had women been given the new test . they believe it would prevent a third of cervical cancers -- 1,000 a year -- and at least 150 deaths . professor peter sasieni , who carried out the study , said : ` we are talking about the lives of young women here . women in their 30s , 40s , 50s and in rare cases their 20s . ` many are mothers with young children , somebody 's wife or daughter . ` we can not delay . over a decade that is 1,500 deaths . ' he added : ` cervical cancer screening is already hugely effective but our study shows how much more effective it could be by swapping to primary hpv testing . not only would introducing primary hpv testing prevent more cases of cancer , it would also mean women who tested negative would n't need to be checked as often . ' the findings , published in the journal of medical screening today , were presented at the national cancer intelligence network conference in brighton . a pilot of the new test was launched last month and over the next year 100,000 will be invited to have the procedure at centres in liverpool , north-west london , sheffield , bristol and norwich . the results will be published next year . if it proves a success , the test will be available on the nhs , although the approval process may take three or four years . it would be offered to women aged 25-64 , the same group who undergo the current smear tests.although women will be encouraged to have the procedure done at a surgery or hospital , they could provide samples they take themselves at home . only this week nhs figures revealed that a third of women in their late twenties were ignoring doctors ' advice to come forward for smear tests .", "summary": " women would be able to carry out the procedure in their own homes .   the new test costs # 30 but price ` could be reduced ' on the nhs .   women would provide a sample which is then sent to a laboratory .
