' . webber was convicted of kidnap , causing grievous bodily harm , making threats to kill and criminal damage at hove crown court and jailed for nine years . richard barton , prosecuting , described the case as ` kidnapping by fraud ' and said webber was ` intelligent and plausible ' . the court heard how miss chapman contacted webber in july last year to discuss some modelling shots . during the time she then modelled for him , over several months , he instilled a sense of paranoia in her . eventually , he told her she was going to be recruited by mi5 and made her watch the television programme spooks about spies as the beginning of her ` training ' . over the next six days , he took her to a string of hotels , telling her a series of increasingly elaborate lies . unable to escape and fearing for her life , miss chapman tried to keep webber calm as she did not want him to hurt her . as webber 's -lrb- right -rrb- lies became more unbelievable , laura chapman -lrb- left -rrb- realised she was in a dangerous situation and wrote a ` goodbye ' letter to her family . mr barton said webber twice stabbed miss . chapman , so she suffered scratches , tried to strangle her , pushed her . and lied to her boyfriend and family . webber also frequently staged imaginary conversations on the phone with contacts at mi5 . ` he talked about  shooting to kill  , ' said mr barton . ` he collapsed on the ground in shock on hearing that colleagues had been killed . she was terrified . ` he took her phone and bank card . he was in control .

' after the sentencing , detective inspector mick jones said : ` stephen webber is clearly a dangerous individual whose deceit and manipulation led a vulnerable young woman into believing that he was a spy for mi5 and that they were both in life-threatening danger . ` this led to the victim being too frightened to leave him over a five-day period in which they travelled to eastbourne , staying in local accommodation whilst their alleged pursuers hunted for them . ` the victim was so fearful of the situation presented by webber that she was too afraid to attempt to escape .
