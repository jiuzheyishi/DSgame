{"text": "controversial : helen grant mp 's son lives with his grandmother , which puts him in a good state school catchment area . a tory minister is at the centre of an elitism row after it emerged that her son has secured a place at a exclusive grammar school by living with his grandmother . helen grant was embroiled in a scandal over expenses last year when it was revealed that she lived not in her constituency of maidstone , kent , but in a # 1.8 million home in surrey . but although she chooses not to stay in the town she represents mrs grant 's son does live there -- with the mp 's mother and within the catchment area of the academically successful maidstone grammar . the unusual arrangement has led to claims that mrs grant had been able to take advantage of a free , elite education for her son at the state-funded selective school , despite living 40 miles away . her controversial living arrangements first came under the spotlight last year when it was revealed she was claiming # 20,000 for a flat in the capital -- even though her reigate home is within the london commuter belt , where mps can not claim allowances for second homes . however she was allowed to take the money as her constituency is outside the ` exclusion zone ' , even if her home is n't . now the mp is facing further pressure over the fact that her 17-year-old son lives with his grandmother , gladys , in sutton valence , just over four miles from the school where last year an impressive 97 per cent of pupils achieved five or more good gcses . last night michael pyke , from the campaign for state education group , said : ` this seems to be a good example of the way the system benefits wealthy people . ` if kent was all-comprehensive , i very much doubt whether mrs grant would have made this arrangement . ' kent is one of the last grammar school bastions in britain , containing 33 of the country 's remaining 164 schools . despite pressure from parents and pro-selection tory mps , david cameron has refused to back their expansion , leading to fierce competition for the few schools which still exist . selective state education is not available in surrey . mrs grant , 51 , succeeded former minister ann widdecombe to the maidstone seat at the 2010 election , with a majority of under 6,000 . class credentials : in a gathering of conservative mps born in council houses helen grant sits centre left . but political opponents have drawn up a petition calling for mrs grant 's resignation since her expenses were revealed . it says : ` in a government that is destroying the lives of those most in need , the equalities minister is busy making her life very comfortable . ' mrs grant takes home # 97,000 from her political job and a further # 26,000 in fees from the legal company she established 20 years ago . while she claims # 20,000 rent on her riverside flat in london , the tory mp in whose reigate constituency she lives , crispin blunt , is not allowed to claim anything . a spokeswoman for the minister said : ` mrs grant declines to comment on issues regarding her children .
