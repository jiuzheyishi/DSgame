{"text": "an aspiring model who wishes to marry and have a family is too scared to even shake hands with a man . hitachi baylou , 21 , has suffered from crippling ocd for three years , magnified by fear of catching a sexually transmitted disease . completely unable to have a sexual relationship with a man - or even to come into contact with another person - hitachi spends over # 300 a month on antibacterial products , convinced she 'll catch stis from toilet seats , furniture or cupboard doors . the young woman is so terrified she will ` catch something ' , she panics if she so much as grazes a jacket collar when giving a hug . ` if i brush the door i panic and have to wipe my hands immediately , ' she said on this morning today . scroll down for video . hitachi baylou says she 's still a virgin because her ocd has robbed her of a sex life . she went on to say that men are less than understanding of her difficult condition . ' i have been on dates and described my ocd , but they just say ,  you do n't need to do that  - they think it 's so simple . ' cognitive behavioural therapist katie d'ath joined the young woman on the breakfast television show to explain there is hope available through cognitive behavioural therapy . ` not all cognitive behavioural therapists know how to treat people with obsessive disorders , ' she says . ` specifically , they need to practice exposure and response prevention , which is essentially where they start . to gradually expose themselves to their fear and not perform the response they . usually perform . ' brought up by a strict single mother , hitachi baylou developed ocd at the age of 18 . ` before i moved into my flat aged 18 i was sort of okay . ocd crept up on me , i did n't see it coming , ' she said . the aspiring model has to talk to the make-up artist on shoots to ensure tools are extremely clean . ' i started using fairy liquid on my hands , then upgraded to baby wipes , and then to antibacterial wipes . ' ' i wipe my bag handle , phone , kettle , taps ... when i wake up in my room i get the wipes ready to go and wipe the kettle handle , toaster - i worry that a fly has gone in and spread bacteria . my main fear is catching something . ' she later visited her mother and they had a serious conversation about the dangers of stis . ' i went home afterwards and wiped everything very excessively . i thought ,  what if i did n't do it enough before i left  . ` it 's really hard to let go of . ' she 's been pursuing modelling since last year , and her ocd seems to also be getting in the way of those ambitions too . ' i have to talk to the make-up artist , ' she says . as well as feeling the need to ensure tools and make-up used on her face are extremely clean , she also has to talk to chefs and waiters in restaurants . ` it 's really hard for people to understand . it 's exhausting . ' she also fears people think she is stuck up or rude . her ocd takes on many different forms . she photographs and documents everything she eats and sometimes loses sleep and cries about her condition . ` the other day sitting on my bed in my bedroom and i got food on the mattress cover . i thought it had gone on the mattress . i kept wiping and wiping . i ca n't really ever relax , ' she said . hitachi now spends over # 300 a month on antibacterial products , convinced she 'll catch stis . ` people with ocd need to practice exposure and response prevention , which is essentially where they start to gradually expose themselves to their fear and not perform the response they usually perform ' when asked about how she would ever get intimate with someone , hitachi confessed one of her dreams is to get into a serious relationship and have a family . ` when i see a child my heart melts . i 'm very sentimental and very sensitive . while i would want a child i would n't want them to develop what i 've got . ' i have received cognitive behavioural therapy and we 've got to the connection and different things that trigger it . ' katie d'ath said : ' a variety of different things can trigger ocd . ' a person 's personality , genetics , their upbringing - a cocktail of things . anyone could develop ocd . when those things add up enough , you get it . all of us have an element of it but usually most of us can keep it in a sub-clinical category . ` when hitachi 's mother mentioned stis , it made her condition worse for her as she has now placed too much importance on it . ' it is a mental health condition where patients experience overwhelming obsessions , compulsions or both . obsessions are recurrent thoughts or urges that can not be ignored and make you feel anxious . compulsions are the actions that people feel they must do in order to deal with this anxiety . a well-known way for ocd to manifest itself is to have obsessions about dirt or contamination , and a compulsion to wash the dirt away . ritualistic tidying is another example . when posed with the dilemma of how hitachi could overcome her ocd , katie explained : . ` when she feels dirty her anxitey goes up and she does something to bring down , like wash her hands . ` sometimes that works in the short term - first the fairy liquuid then baby wipes and then antibacterial ones . so actually it does n't work long term - only curing anxiety short term . ` what we teach is how to deal with anxiety in a different way . ' i think definitely people can be cured , though some argue that they always have it , others say it is no longer part of their life and others feel it 's manageable , something in the background that sometimes crops up but does n't really get in the way of living a normal life . it would mean the world to hitachi if she could be cured . ' i could relax . i ca n't remember the last time i could relax .
