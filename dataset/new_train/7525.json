{"text": "the high street faces a new tidal wave of casino-style betting machines in bookmakers after a court kicked out a vital test case yesterday . the warning came after newham council - which already has 81 betting shops including 18 on a single street - tried to prevent gambling chain paddy power from opening yet another one . but a judge sided with the chain , saying there was no evidence that the outlet would attract violence , underage gambling and street drinking - despite powerful evidence that this is already happening in and around other betting shops . the judge has allowed paddy power to open another betting shop in newham as there is no evidence that connects gambling and anti-social behaviour . last night campaigners said the ruling would be a ` red rag ' to other bookmakers who would take more and more councils to court and force their way on to high streets ` up and down the country ' . they said it also proved that councils were ` powerless ' to act on behalf of their residents to end the scourge of unfettered gambling . newham is one of the poorest boroughs in the country , and the east london-based council believes bookmakers are deliberately targeting it with the fixed-odds betting terminals , branded the ` crack cocaine ' of gambling . each roulette-style machine allows the user to stake up to # 100 a time on the spin of a virtual wheel every 20 seconds . the profusion of betting shops on england 's high streets is blamed on tony blair 's controversial 2005 gambling act , which relaxed planning rules on the opening such outlets . last night labour mp david lammy , who has campaigned against the profusion of the casino machines , reacted with horror to the ruling . ` this court case proves that councils are utterly powerless to stop themselves being overrun by betting shops , and all because of our laissez-faire approach to planning , ' he said . newham council already has 81 betting shops including 18 on a single street and tried to prevent gambling chain paddy power from opening yet another one . ` this was a high-profile case being watched very closely and i have no doubt now that this will be a red rag to bookmakers to go for it , and take the opportunity to move into high streets up and down the country in even bigger numbers . ` the world will look with bemusement that britain could allow an olympic borough to become a mini las vegas . ' councillors in newham had voted to block paddy power from opening a new shop at the site of a former kebab shop claiming it would attract anti-social behaviour and underage drinking . it also claimed to have evidence suggesting the primary use of the shop was for fobts and not traditional betting . however at an appeal against the decision at thames magistrates court , district judge paul goldspring rejected claims that the shop would attract violence . he claimed the local authority did not have the power to turn down the application and ordered them to pay # 33,900 costs . that meant the case would not be a landmark ruling that could halt the tide of betting shops opening to house fobts across the country . his decision yesterday came down to whether betting shops and fobts caused violent crime . judge goldspring said : ` i find it significant the police did not object to the licence and agreed conditions . ` one would have thought , that if the concerns of the local authority were evidenced and well founded , the police would have said so then and at this appeal . ' david lammy said that it was a travesty that the courts might force local authorities to use tax payer 's money to fight gambling companies in court . former treasury minister stephen timms , the local mp for east ham , had told the court the fobts ` destroy people lives ' and the machines cause users to get angry when they lose and that violence can spill out into the high street . but the judge said his evidence was of ` very little help ' . he said : ` while undoubtedly as mp he receives complaints about betting premises , 50 in three years of a constituency of 95,000 hardly proves his assertion . ' speaking after the hearing , councillor ian corbet from newham said the decision underlined how little power local councils have in halting the increasing tide of betting shops . he said : ` we have a major problem with these machines . i do agree with people who call them the crack cocaine of gambling . we will soon have the most betting shops in london , outside westminster . ` but this is not just a problem for us , it is a problem for the whole nation . we are not unique we are just at the extreme end of the scale . ' mr corbet rejected criticism by the judge for ignoring advice from the planning inspector to continue to contest the appeal . he said : ` i do n't regret it at all . the only thing i regret is that we did not win . ' anti fobt campaigner derek webb , founder of the campaign for fairer gambling , said the decision highlighted the weakness of the gambling commission . he said : ` the gambling commission refused to support the newham council and is failing to uphold the licensing objectives of the 2005 gambling act , so is clearly unfit for purpose . ' mr lammy said : ` it is a travesty that we are allowing paddy power to use their corporate might and forcing a local authority like newham , which represents some of the poorest people in london , to use taxpayers ' money to fight them in court . ` because paddy power can afford expensive lawyers they have been successful . ' he added : ` no one is against gambling , but these fixed-odds betting terminals are a menace and we now have a situation where boroughs like this have more betting shops than book shops . the mp for tottenham admitted labour had got it wrong when it relaxed gambling laws eight years ago . ' i am very clear that the gambling act 2005 was flawed , because it let these betting shops through the back door to saturate our high streets , ' he said . ` labour have accepted it was wrong but in the meantime the coalition need to act . we need to give local authorities the legal power to say : enough is enough . ' a spokeswoman for paddy power said : ` paddy power is pleased that the judge has upheld our appeal and granted the licence . ` we want to fund initiatives that support the local community , particularly around up-skilling , getting people into - and back into - work and social enterprise . ` we would like to set up a meeting to discuss this with newham council and the local mp , stephen timms , to enable us to put the money to work as soon as possible .
