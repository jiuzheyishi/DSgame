{"text": "a group of men who devoted their lives to hunting powerful storms died in the middle of the chase . tim samaras , his son paul samaras and carl young were killed friday while following a tornado in el reno , oklahoma , relatives told cnn on sunday . their work tracking tornadoes was featured on the former discovery channel show  storm chasers .  they were among 13 people killed in storms that struck oklahoma on friday night , according to oklahoma city fire chief keith bryant . at the intersection where authorities said the three storm chasers were killed , crews hauled away a mangled white truck sunday that had been crushed like a tin can . the metal frame of their storm-chasing vehicle was twisted almost beyond recognition . the windows had been smashed to bits . canadian county undersheriff chris west confirmed that three storm chasers had been killed but declined to provide additional details about the circumstances of their deaths .  we also want to say that storm chasers and meteorologists and news stations , that 's part of the vital link in getting the word out to people so that they do n't become victims ,  he said .  a lot of these individuals have dedicated many years of their lives to going out and assisting and tracking storms , and getting footage and putting themselves in harm 's way so they can educate the public to the destructive power of these storms .  friday 's tornado took a sudden turn that surprised many observers , cnn meteorologist chad myers said .  it was a wobbler . and it was big . ... i think the left-hand turn made a big difference on how this thing was chased as well and why people were killed and why people were injured in their vehicles ,  he said .  a vehicle is not a place to be in any tornado , especially a big one like that , and those men doing their job , those field scientists out there doing their jobs , were killed in the process .  tim samaras founded twistex , the tactical weather instrumented sampling in tornadoes experiment , to help learn more about tornadoes and increase lead time for warnings , according to the official website . in 2004 , he told cnn that being near storms was part of the job .  in order to get directly in the path , you have to be close ,  he said .  actually i 'm pretty focused on our safety , certainly , and i 'm focused on getting the data and getting the right spot ,  he said .  you only have one chance to do it .  a dangerous job .  they all unfortunately passed away but doing what they loved ,  jim samaras wrote in a statement posted on his brother 's facebook page . myers , who also covered friday 's storm in oklahoma , said tim samaras was known for his attention to safety .  there 's just no one safer than tim . tim , he would never put himself in danger ,  myers said .  he certainly would n't put his son in danger .  one of samaras ' goals , myers said , was collecting more data to help government officials .  we all know that this is difficult and dangerous and sometimes things go wrong . but i think to portray tim as just a chaser out for a thrill is just the wrong thing ,  myers said .  i just want people to know that tim was a scientist . he was out there to put probes out there . he was out there to learn and understand and to make science more understandable . ... we all go out there and we try to protect the public , but tim was even one step higher .  samaras had received 18 grants from the national geographic society for his research , said terry garcia , the organization 's executive vice president of missions . in a written statement , he described samaras ' studies of lightning as  pioneering .   tim was a courageous and brilliant scientist who fearlessly pursued tornadoes and lightning in the field in an effort to better understand these phenomena ,  he said .  though we sometimes take it for granted , tim 's death is a stark reminder of the risks encountered regularly by the men and women who work for us ,  garcia said .  this is an enormous loss for his family , his wide circle of friends and colleagues and national geographic .  doug kiesling , a videographer who chases storms and calls himself  the weather paparazzi ,  said the three men were more than storm chasers .  they 're researchers ,  he said .  this thing is really shaking up everyone in the chasing community ,  he said .  we knew this day would happen someday , but nobody would imagine that it would happen to tim . tim was one of the safest people to go out there . ... he 's had close calls , but he 's always had an escape route .  el reno mayor matt white did n't provide details about those killed after the tornado struck , but he stressed the importance of staying indoors when powerful storms hit .  we had to deal with not only strong winds , but we had extreme hail , extreme softball-size hail . el reno had a lot of damage to the roads ,  he told reporters on sunday .  in these situations , we ca n't stress enough to people to stay inside and do what the weather men and women tell us to do .  close call : one storm chaser 's story . friday 's storm was particularly unpredictable , according to mike bettes , an anchor and meteorologist for the weather channel who had a close call himself . the tornado swept up the tornado-hunt truck he and a crew were traveling in , tossed it 200 yards into a field and smashed it to the ground .  i think this was just an erratic tornado . i think the size of it and the speed of it changed very , very quickly ,  he told cnn on sunday morning .  i think the direction of movement changed quickly . and i think there were a lot of people out there that , you know , ended up getting stuck in positions we did n't want to be in .  bettes described the experience as the scariest moment of his life .  i saw people in my life , i saw their faces flash right in front of me . and it just seemed for a moment , everything was in slow motion , especially when we were floating ,  he said .  i kind of felt like i was being lifted to heaven or something . i was conscious through the whole thing and remember the whole thing , but it 's still a surreal moment .  bettes and several others emerged with scratches and bruises . one crew member had broken bones , he said , but was in good spirits . the experience left him rattled and unsure whether he 'll go out to chase storms again . but bettes said he had no doubt about the value of storm chasing .  we show weather , and we like to be out there and show people what these things can do , and help give advance warning . a lot of times the storm spotters out there serve a very valuable purpose . they give ground truth to what meteorologists from the national weather service are doing ,  he said .  but seeing it in person , seeing it for real , and giving that real time information , i think really supplements the warning . it helps people take shelter ahead of time .   storm chasers  aired for five years on the discovery channel . the last season ended in the fall of 2011 . the network expressed condolences in a statement sunday .  we are deeply saddened by the loss of carl young , tim samaras and his son . our thoughts and prayers go out to their families ,  the statement said . photos from a professional storm chaser . tornadoes rip through heartland again : how to help . powerful
