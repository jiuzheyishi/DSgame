{"text": "church leaders have warned that christmas day is in danger of becoming a ` frenzy of bargain hunting ' after amazon announced it is launching its sale on december 25 . online retailers expect an astonishing # 307 million of business on tuesday alone -- 50 per cent more than an average day . critics have called for the sales to be postponed until boxing day , leaving christmas as a family occasion and religious celebration . unheard of : amazon has announced that it will be launching its sale on christmas day to the anger of church leaders . however , after a disappointing december , many retailers desperate to clear their stock have decided to unveil their sales a day early . a huge proportion of the 42 million britons who shop online are likely to log on , dwarfing the 2.3 million expected at christmas day services , including midnight mass. . most controversially , the biggest retailer , amazon -- already under fire for avoiding uk tax on its estimated # 3 billion annual sales -- will begin listing bargains from 9am on christmas morning . alongside discounted stock will be ` lightning deals ' -- limited offers throughout the day , which are likely to pose a distraction from unwrapping presents . high street chains in the online rush include currys pc world , john lewis , halfords , marks & spencer , house of fraser and argos , all of whose sales begin on christmas eve or christmas day . however , many have already begun to offer major discounts in shops and online . ` it never stops ' : amazon -lrb- warehouse pictured -rrb- - already under fire for avoiding uk tax - will begin listing bargains from 9am on december 25 . lord carey , the former archbishop of canterbury , said : ` christmas day is a time to be together with the family , to focus on the children and to have a great time together . ` this day is precious . we are now in danger of the gadgets taking over our lives and we are not in control of them . ' the rt rev graham james , bishop of norwich , a close contender for the post of archbishop of canterbury earlier this year , said : ` christmas day is an oasis of peace in an often frenzied world . ` it 's a pity we do n't seem able to sustain a 24-hour period free of our acquisitiveness . we do need a sabbath -lsb- rest -rsb- from shopping if only once a year . ' and andrea williams , chief executive of christian concern and a member of the general synod , added : ` we all miss out if we forget the true meaning of christmas . ` and we will forget it if there is no space to remember . big businesses have a responsibility to leave that space open for families to spend time with one another . lord carey said : ` christmas day is a time to be together with the family ... ' ` companies like amazon will say they are meeting consumer demand . but surely even they recognise their responsibility to ensure time for things that money ca n't buy ? ' her views echo the words of pope benedict xvi , who last year claimed christmas had increasingly become a ` shopping holiday ' . however , a spokesman for amazon said that although its website would take orders on christmas day , warehouse staff would not begin dispatching products until boxing day or december 27 . he added that last year , some shoppers logged on as early as 6am to download music and books for their new ipods , kindles and other devices . andrew mcclelland , of e-retailers ' organisation imrg , said : ` as consumers encounter discounts and offers already available in the sales on these sites , it is not surprising they will spend more than # 300 million even on christmas day itself . ` online , the christmas shopping never really stops . ' a spokesman for currys pc world said : ` we are simply offering something our customers want and have , in past years , demonstrated that they want . ` of course the convenience of online is such that customers can dip in and out of the sales without compromising time with family , friends and the other things that they hold dear at this time of year . ' however , mp gary streeter , chairman of the all-party christians in parliament group , said : ` it 's a sad reflection on our times . i hope that most people will be focusing on their families and on bigger issues on christmas day and not ordering books online . ` i would hope we 'd never see shops opening at christmas . it would require a change in the law and i ca n't see parliament voting for that -- most people want to focus on their families and rightly so . ' senior tory backbencher sir tony baldry , who speaks for the church of england in the commons , added : ` i think that it 's very sad if we ca n't retain at least one day of the year as a family day , a day of celebration and reflection to mark christmas and for people to be together . ` whatever amazon or others sell on christmas day , they will just as easily sell on subsequent days . it just seems unnecessary commercialism and very regrettable .
