{"text": "it 's going to take more than free beer , gift cards and ipads to convince uninsured young adults that opting out of health coverage under obamacare is a good decision . recently , generation opportunity , a conservative group , was down in florida hosting swag-filled events at the university of miami encouraging young people to do just that . but health care is too important for our generation to opt out . we recently met with emily w. wright , who suffers from aching pain caused by endometriosis and has been putting off badly needed surgery for the past five years because she could never afford health insurance , particularly with a pre-existing condition . now , under obamacare , she can afford a high quality , affordable plan and can get the treatment she needs . too many young adults , like emily , lack health insurance . polls show that young people value coverage and see it as something they need , they just have not been able to afford it . and with fewer employers offering young workers health care benefits , the need for affordable coverage has never been greater . luckily , the increased competition among insurers on the health insurance marketplace as well as new tax credits are making health insurance for the young uninsured much more affordable . on its face , opting out of insurance under obamacare makes no sense . paying for financial insecurity is dumb . purchasing health coverage is like buying a $ 10 umbrella when you see rain in the forecast . if you do n't purchase the umbrella , not only do you risk getting soaked from head to toe , you could end up ruining your new favorite pair of sneakers or iphone , costing you a lot more than just $ 10 . in the same way , at some point everyone gets sick and needs health insurance coverage , even those of us who are young and seem healthy . obamacare provides decent coverage we can actually afford . if you look at miami , where generation opportunity recently took its opt out campaign , competition is so strong that consumers on healthcare.gov will be able to choose between over 100 plans offered by seven insurance carriers . for example , a 27-year-old person living in miami earning $ 25,000 annually will be able to buy a plan for as little as $ 87 per month . the young uninsured population is largely low income ; not surprisingly , cost is their greatest impediment to getting covered . in florida , the average uninsured 18 - to 34-year-old earns about $ 14,659 annually . since premium tax credits are determined on a sliding scale based on income , most young people will pay far less because they will have access to greater subsidies . in fact , a recent study from the department of health and human services found that nearly 7 in 10 single , uninsured young people looking to purchase coverage on the marketplace could qualify for a plan that would cost them under $ 100 a month . based on data from the census ' current population survey , we estimate 605,000 currently uninsured 18 - to 34-year-olds in florida could qualify for reduced-cost coverage thanks to automatic monthly premium tax credits . if the state legislature agreed to expand the its medicaid program , nearly 590,000 currently uninsured young floridians could be eligible for free care . it is true that enrollment has been slowed down by initial glitches on the health exchange website , but we have seen dramatic improvements in the site already . the past two weeks have seen a big uptick in enrollment . prior to the affordable care act 's passage , too many americans relied on lousy coverage not even worthy of the term insurance . seventy-eight percent of medical debt-related bankruptcy filers actually had insurance . in an effort to provide consumers with greater financial security , the department of health and human services identified 10 essential health benefits that all plans on healthcare.gov must offer consumers . these benefits , like maternity and newborn care , prescription drug and mental health coverage , are particularly important to young people . for instance , according to a 2013 study , young people have a disproportionate need to access mental health services . so do n't let the opt-outers fool you into thinking that plans purchased outside the exchange will have the same level of comprehensive coverage or satisfy the mandate . the worst-case scenario is buying low-quality coverage that does n't cover what you need and still having to pay the individual penalty . young people should take the time to learn more about their new coverage options , encourage their friends to do the same , and enroll in a plan that fits their needs . generation y should n't gamble when it comes to their health -- especially when obamacare makes health insurance coverage so affordable . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of aaron smith .", "summary": " a conservative group tried to encourage young floridians to opt out of obamacare .   aaron smith : health care is too important for generation y to forgo .   he says in miami , people can choose between over 100 competitive health plans .   smith : obamacare makes health insurance affordable ; let 's not gamble our health .
