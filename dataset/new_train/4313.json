{"text": "in the past , if you wanted to be able to be able to lift more weight you would have to spend months bulking up at the gym . now , with a new invention from a group of engineering students at the university of pennsylvania , you can just strap on an external bicep and you are ready to go . the bionic device , called the titan arm , is the brainchild of four mechanical engineering students who , in their final undergraduate year , built an upper-body exoskeleton that can be used in physical therapy and manual labor . the invention won its inventors $ 10,000 in the cornell cup for innovation and has recently been shortlisted for the 2013 dyson award . the titan arm straps directly to a user 's right arm to help lift heavy objects that the user would n't normally be able to lift . its inventors believe that it will be useful in aiding physical rehabilitation , both for people who have suffered upper body injuries and for those with pre-existing muscular-skeletal disorders . the titan arm 's inventors say the exoskeleton can also be used by people whose jobs require heavy lifting such as warehouse workers , removalists and couriers .  with the titan arm , we wanted to create something that could both augment a user 's natural strength as well as help someone perform physical therapy in their own home ,  says elizabeth beattie , one of the titan arm 's inventors .  we wanted to create something that was low-cost and easy for a user to put on and strap to themselves .  according to the united states department of labour , back disorders are one of the leading causes of disability for people during their working years . the american national institute for occupational safety and health says that back problems afflict over 600,000 employees each year with a cost of around $ 50 billion annually to the u.s. economy . the problem is significant in other countries : the world health organisation says that worldwide , 37 % of lower back pain is due to injuries sustained in the workplace . beattie says that addressing this problem while being attentive to user comfort was one of the primary motivating principles in designing the device :  we wanted something that was comfortable for the user , something that mimics the body 's natural mobility and range , so we definitely went through a lot of testing in order to get to where the design is right now .  the titan arm attaches to a user 's right arm with a power motor at its elbow joint . the bionic limb can lift approximately 40 pounds of weight , augmenting a user 's natural strength . the arm is predominantly made of aluminum and steel components , and is powered by a dc battery . as well as helping lift weight , the arm can also be locked into any position with a ratchet brake to hold an object steady without any exertion from the user . jd albert , an engineer and co-founder of e-ink , calls the titan arm  exciting ,  but adds :  i would caveat that with the fact that it 's a very tough product to launch for a lot of reasons ... it needs to feel right -lrb- and -rrb- i think there 's also some pretty significant safety concerns ... we are taking a piece of machinery and integrating it with a person and so naturally you need to make sure that there 's no way to injure someone .  still , albert says that for young engineers , the titan arm represents an impressive achievement :  they 've managed to combine a pretty wide variety of disciplines both dealing the mechanical side of things -- the design and the electrical -- and the software side of things as well .  beattie says that the titan arm team intends to keep working on the exoskeleton with a view to one day bringing it to market :  the four of us definitely want to use our engineering tool kits to better the quality of life of those around us . i think that 's one of the things that technology really has the power to do .
