' ' i could not form a sentence . i kept shaking my head as if i had duct tape across my mouth . it hit me all of a sudden - i knew i had made a mistake . i did not want to be married ... i wanted to be a bride but i should n't have been married yet , ' she wrote . the couple were busy working apart for much of their marriage and shields said the relationship was ` just existing . ' later , she wrote that agassi had broken down and told her ` that for the whole first part of our relationship he had been addicted to crystal meth . ' i was shocked but immediately got hurt and insulted that he had not come to me at the time . ' despite the argument , the former child star and the tennis champion married in april 1997 - the day after , she says , she realised she had made a ` mistake ' she added : ' i feared our life together was not based in absolute truth . ' a candid autobiography written by agassi also suggests the lavish wedding to the actress was a mistake . from the four helicopters full of paparazzi circling overhead to the groom wearing elevator shoes to avoid being dwarfed by his towering bride , the celebration is rendered in ` open ' as a bleak farce . ' i have a thought no man should have on his wedding day : i wish i were leaving too . i wish i had a decoy groom to take my place , ' he revealed in his autobiography . soon after his divorce in 1999 , mr agassi began wooing steffi graf , another former tennis prodigy , who , agassi says , loathed the game as much as he did but surpassed him in disciplined , competitive fury . speaking 14 years after the break-up , shields revealed that the tennis star had told her it was fortunate they did not have children . she said : ' i am divorced . and mine was very quick and relatively easy but it 's a very interesting thing because he - quote , unquote - did say to me , ` be happy that we do n't have children or i would not have made this easy for you .  she added with a laugh , ` and therein lies why i 'm not there anymore . ' the former ` suddenly susan ' sitcom star briefly dated john travolta , liam neeson , jfk jr. and was close friends with michael jackson . shields also wrote about her platonic fling with gay wham ! singer george michael , saying her mother teri helped set them up on a date . after a romantic hotel dinner in chicago she said the star walked her to her room . ` he left without even trying to kiss me . i was so touched by what a real gentleman he was -lrb- i wanted to yell , ` wait , please do n't go go ! ' after going on a couple more dates and shopping trips , ms shields wrote that she was ` devastated ' when mr michael dumped her , saying , ' i think we need to take a break . i need to concentrate on my career . ' she added she cried herself to sleep ` for weeks . ' shields , now 49 , remarried in 2001 to tv writer chris henchy and they have two daughters , rowan 10 , and grier , seven . in the memoir , published on november 18 , she also discusses her mother 's lifelong battle with drinking and the public misconception that she forced her daughter into projects she did n't want to do . the actress was at her mother 's side when she died in october 2012 after a decline into dementia .", "summary": " andre agassi smashed wimbledon and us open trophies in a jealous rage .   actress brooke shields said he stormed off set during filming for friends .   tennis star was angry that she licked joey 's fingers and started laughing .   he told actress she made him look ` like a fool ' in scene with matt leblanc .   she revealed it took her three years to have all the trophies replaced .
