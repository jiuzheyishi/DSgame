' ` the jury were told that the police professional standards department is now looking into this lamentable failure to investigate very serious allegations with the care and attention they warranted . ` whether or not you realised that the police were taking no action , it had undoubted consequences for the girl , because during the school summer holidays in 2012 you asked her to get in touch with you . ' on that occasion ali threatened the girl into having sex with two of his friends , who have not yet been tried , and then told her to leave quickly afterwards . ali , of headington , oxfordshire , was convicted of rape , inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and sexual activity with a child . the judge 's comments sparked criticism from labour mp for oxford east andrew smith , who said they sounded a ` very serious warning note . ' ` especially after the experience of operation bullfinch , it is alarming and surprising that police did not follow up on this , with the wholly unacceptable consequences the judge referred to , ' said mr smith . ` the public will want to know exactly what went wrong and what has been done to put it right . ` people need to have confidence that the police are doing all they can to the highest standards of professionalism and effectiveness . ' chief constable thornton said the investigation was being looked at by the professional standards department and supervised by the independent police complaints commission . ` the initial handling of this case was completely unacceptable , ' she said . ` as soon as the deficiencies came to light the force moved quickly to rectify the situation , working closely with the victim and her family and arresting omid ali for his offences . ` as a result , he has been handed a significant sentence of 14 years in prison . ' oxfordshire county council spokesman paul smith said : ` oxfordshire county council takes grooming and sexual exploitation of children very seriously and encourages anyone with concerns to contact the specialist kingfisher unit . ` we will always listen to children .
