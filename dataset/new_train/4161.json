{"text": " mexico on the 17th woohoo !   on a jet plane . bye bye usa . hello mexico .   last day in mexico ... i could so live here ...  judging from social media , not everyone is avoiding mexico this spring break . and , despite a steady stream of bad press and travel warnings , mexico is counting on a good year for tourism . image problem notwithstanding , mexico has been the top foreign country visited by americans for more than two decades . mexico welcomed more than 16 million americans in 1990 , according to the department of commerce 's office of travel and tourism industries . with a few periods of fluctuation in between , that number reached 20 million in 2010 , the latest year for which data is available from the u.s. department of commerce .  when you hear about swine flu and the drug war and see grisly photos and stories that go along with them , people look at the country on a whole through that light ,  said lonely planet writer richard reid , who has been to mexico 15 times in his 43 years .  that 's not always an accurate representation of the entire country .  the mexico tourism board estimates that 52 million domestic and international tourists will visit the southeastern part of the country in 2012 , thanks to growing numbers of visitors from emerging markets and aggressive public relations campaigns to counter the perception that mexico is unsafe . the southeast consists of resort areas such as cancun , cozumel and playa del carmen , as well as mayan cultural destinations , a key area of focus for the tourist board in 2012 . analysts say efforts to direct tourists to the southeast reflect the experience of most visitors to the country who stay away from areas in northern mexico plagued by cartel-related violence .  while there are security concerns in certain areas in the country , particularly in the north , travel to traditional tourist destinations along the mayan riviera remain safe ,  said miguel salazar of the woodrow wilson international center in washington . the u.s. state department issued a travel warning to americans to avoid all but essential travel to all or parts of 14 of 31 mexican states . no advisory is in effect for yucatan , quintana roo or campeche , states that make up the yucatan peninsula , or for that matter , mexico city , the nation 's capital .  the fact that tourist destinations along the mayan riviera still remain safe is further underscored by the state department 's most recent travel warnings , which shows that not all of mexico is experiencing increased violence as a result of efforts to confront organized crime ,  salazar said . that success might not be evident in the news that comes out of mexico , but the numbers tell a different story : a record-breaking 22.67 million international visitors arrived in 2011 , representing a 2 % increase from 2010 , according to figures provided by the mexico tourism board . that 's not to say that bad things do n't happen outside the hot zones . in february , 22 carnival cruise lines passengers were robbed of valuables and their passports during a shore excursion in the mexico seaside resort of puerto vallarta in the state of jalisco . the state department warning advises travelers to defer nonessential travel to areas of jalisco that border the states of michoac√°n and zacatecas . it also recommends exercising caution when traveling at night outside of cities elsewhere in the state . the tour was driving on a remote highway about 15 kilometers -lrb- about 9.3 miles -rrb- outside puerto vallarta when an individual held them up , rodolfo lopez negrete , chief operating officer of the mexico tourism board , told cnn .  i can assure this is an isolated , rare incident that should n't have happened ,  he said .  but at same time , i have to tell you that this is something that could happen anywhere else in the world .  putting things in context is a large part of negrete 's modus operandi . while many rushed to interpret the state department 's recent expanded travel warning as a blow to mexico , lopez negrete said he welcomed the extent to which it pinpointed areas to avoid with specific descriptions and a map and highlighted others where no travel warning was in effect . and while the state department 's travel warning puts mexico in the company of syria , libya and north korea , none of those countries is described by the state department as a place where  millions of u.s. citizens safely visit  for study , tourism and business .  we try to put things within the proper context of making sure people understand that if there are problems in certain pockets of the country , that does n't mean the major resort destinations and city center destinations are in danger ,  lopez negrete said .  mexico is a very large country , the size of western europe , so it 's unfair to paint mexico with such a massively broad stroke ,  lopez negrete said in a phone call this week from germany , where he was representing mexico in itb berlin , the world 's biggest travel trade show . it was a sentiment he would repeat later in the week in response to the texas department of public safety 's blanket warning against spring break travel to mexico , citing drug cartel violence and criminal activity . texas officials highlighted an increase in murders of u.s. citizens in mexico and other violent crime concerns .  the mexican government has made great strides battling the cartels , and we commend their continued commitment to making mexico a safer place to live and visit ,  texas dps director steven c. mccraw said in a statement .  however , drug cartel violence and other criminal activity represent a significant safety threat , even in some resort areas .  this is the third year in a row that texas has issued the warning , prompting allegations from the world travel and tourism council that it was a ploy to encourage domestic tourism , according to mexican news outlet notimex . last year 's announcement prompted similar reaction , with several leading american tourism groups urging texas to downgrade the warning to an advisory .  we want to caution consumers against overgeneralizing -- taking isolated events and applying them to the whole country ,  said lisa simon , president of tour operator trade group , nta .  mexico is a beautiful destination with incredible adventure and cultural experiences available . we advise americans to travel with professional tour operators , because they know what 's happening in specific areas of the country and can provide safe and secure travel arrangements .  american travel to mexico has fluctuated over the past few years , coinciding with an overall decline in international travel during the recession , according to u.s. department of commerce numbers . figures from the mexico tourism board indicate that the number of american visitors dropped by 3 % overall in 2011 . but they consider it a promising sign the number of american visitors in the last four months of 2011 was up 10.6 % compared with 2010 . the fluctuations prompted mexico to woo new visitors from outside the united states by building relationships in emerging markets and easing the visa application process with online portals , lopez negrete said . those efforts paid off in record-breaking numbers for 2011 , with the biggest growth from emerging markets such as brazil -lrb- 66 % -rrb- , russia -lrb- 55 % -rrb- and china -lrb- 30 % -rrb- . those gains tend to be overshadowed by media coverage of cartel-related violence and occasional acts of violence toward tourists . lopez negrete acknowledges that parts of mexico should be avoided , which is why the tourism board has focused efforts on driving visitors to southern mexico with an emphasis on the  mundo maya ,  or the mayan world , and gastronomy tours . the timing could n't be better with doomsday travel ramping up ahead of the alleged mayan prophecy of the apocalypse . but lopez negrete says the push is about diversifying mexico 's appeal . mexico 's indigenous roots and unesco-honored cuisine have always been a big part of its culture , he said . again , it seems to be a matter of changing perceptions .  we see a great opportunity to share a part of our culture that many visitors do n't normally see ,  he said .  for those who 've been to mexico before , it 's a chance to see the country in a new light .
