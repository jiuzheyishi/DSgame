{"text": "the hundreds of theatergoers who packed into central london 's historic apollo theatre on thursday night were expecting to watch a mystery . but about 40 minutes into the play , shortly after 8 p.m. , they got a drama instead .  one of the actors said , ` watch out ! '  said one woman .  we thought it was part of the play .  it was n't . instead , it was part of the century-old structure 's ornate plaster ceiling , which tumbled five stories onto the theatergoers , injuring scores of them , seven seriously , officials said .  we heard a creak , somebody screamed , somebody from over there said , ` look out ! ' and then the ceiling kind of creased in the middle and then just collapsed ,  said hannah , who with her husband had snagged one of the last pairs of tickets to the performance in the 775-seat theater . though she said she herself felt  slight panic ,  she credited those around her for keeping their calm .  it was n't every man for himself ,  she said , noting that several of her fellow theatergoers checked on those around them .  everyone was looking out for each other , and in a couple of minutes , everyone was out .  the london fire brigade 's kingsland station manager nick harding said about 720 people were inside when a section of the ceiling collapsed on the theatergoers , taking parts of the balconies with it . an ambulance official said a total of 76 people had been injured , though many of them were treated at the scene and released .  it was like slow motion ,  said one girl , who initially thought the sound of the falling ceiling was sound effects , but soon learned otherwise .  it just kinda came down .  harding said what fell was a 10-meter-by-10-meter square section of the ceiling , and that it dragged down balconies with it .  you initially thought it was part of the play and then you could feel things on you ,  said an older woman .  the dust that came down -- you could n't see in front of you .  metropolitan police said those who were seriously hurt had been taken to hospitals in central london . none of the injuries appeared life threatening , one official said . within an hour , a spokesman for the fire department said everyone , including those who had been hurt , had been evacuated from the building . martin bostock , who was with his wife and two children , said he thought the cave-in was part of the show until something very hard hit him on the head and chaos and panic erupted .  you could n't see across the room because of the dust , which we were all breathing in ,  he told cnn .  it was absolutely horrific and very terrifying . i was with my wife and two kids . thank god , we got out .  the apollo is located next to piccadilly circus in the soho district , which is usually packed with tourists , shoppers and diners at theater time . within minutes , paramedics arrived carrying stretchers as police cordoned off the area . a few minutes later , some of the paramedics emerged from the theater , their stretcher full ; others helped someone limp out of the building . many of the injured were taken initially to the nearby theaters for an initial assessment of their condition by medical workers . the initial police assessment of the collapse was that it was an accident .  there is no suggestion at this stage that this was as a result of a criminal act , however , at this stage we are keeping an open mind ,  metropolitan police said in a statement . outside the apollo , the street was packed with dozens of police , fire and ambulance vehicles as well as well-dressed theatergoers , some of their faces darkened with dust .  the curious incident of the dog in the night-time ,  which was adapted to the theater from the 2003 mystery novel by british writer mark haddon , is about a 15-year-old boy 's investigation into the death of a neighborhood dog . ticket prices at the four-level theater , which opened its doors in 1901 , included a # 1 -lrb- $ 1.64 -rrb-  theatre restoration levy ,  the theater 's website said . it was not immediately clear whether the ceiling was part of the restoration of the building , which is owned and operated by nimax theatres . in a statement , a spokesman said the company would  continue to cooperate fully with the authorities to establish exactly what happened tonight .  prime minister david cameron , in a tweet , commended the fast work of emergency services . now , what started as a mystery and veered into drama has again become a mystery , as engineers try to determine what caused the collapse .", "summary": "  one of the actors said , ` watch out !
