{"text": "worry : of concern is the hfea 's claim that the donations of eggs and sperm must be increased in order to meet the growing demand for ivf treatment -lrb- posed by model -rrb- . women who give their eggs to help childless couples will get a # 750 payment in an attempt to boost the number of donors . hundreds of ` fertility tourists ' are driven abroad each year to seek eggs or sperm in countries which make more generous payments than allowed in britain . childless couples , lesbians and single women are also using unregulated websites in desperate efforts to start a family . until now there has been a cap on expenses of # 250 for egg and sperm donors per cycle of treatment . but many experts claimed the payment failed to properly reward women for taking extra risks from the drugs involved . the fertility watchdog , the human fertilisation and embryology authority , agreed yesterday to approve a fixed sum payment for the first time to stop donors being out of pocket and deter the use of ` rogue ' sites . but critics said the decision was ` disgraceful ' , saying poor , vulnerable women would be tempted to risk their health for cash . a change in uk law five years ago which requires sperm or egg donors to reveal their identities to any children born as a result is also blamed by some experts for long waiting lists . juliet tizzard , hfea head of policy , said : ` shortage is undeniably an issue . patients are still waiting for donor conception treatment and are increasingly going overseas . ' payment : the # 750 figure for egg donors is the same as that used in spain , for instance , while the # 35 for sperm donations matches that of denmark . she warned about the increase of unregulated websites that claim to introduce donors to recipients . ` some are making private arrangements where they are organising sperm donation among themselves . we have already written to these websites to highlight our concerns about the risks that sperm donors and recipients can put themselves at . ' current system . women and men can claim expenses such as travel costs and loss of earnings of up to # 61.28 per day . there is a cap of # 250 . new system . women . would receive a fixed sum of # 750 and also be able to claim for . excessive expenses . the figure would put the uk on a par with the . spanish system . sperm donors would receive a fixed sum of # 35 . sperm donors will in future get a fixed sum of # 35 per clinic visit , which could see them netting around # 525 based on a typical series of 15 visits . the fixed sums include expenses , receipts will not have to be produced , and donors will still only be allowed to help create a maximum of ten families -- a rule that is likely to limit women to a single donation of eggs in return for # 750 . but some experts believe higher payments , which already exist in other european countries , may attract the wrong type of donor and breach eu guidelines that donation should be voluntary . hfea chairman professor lisa jardine denied the payments would be an incentive to people who were ` merely financially motivated ' . but dr david king , director of human genetics alert , said surveys showed the british public opposed cash payments and the hfea was using a loophole by insisting they were called compensation . he said : ` this is a disgraceful decision which puts young women 's health at risk . by creating a financial incentive the hfea is ensuring that the risks of egg donation are dumped on young women in financial difficulties . ` anyone who think # 750 is not a financial incentive knows nothing about life on income support or with your students fees tripled . ` we already know that a # 750 payment , as they have in spain , creates a financial incentive which explains the surplus of egg donors there . why was there a massive spike in egg donor applications in spain when the financial crisis hit in 2008 ? ' cash in hand : under the hfea 's planned scheme , egg donors would be paid up to a limit of # 750 for each cycle of donation , compared with the current maximum of # 250 -lrb- picture posed by models -rrb- .", "summary": " experts hope move will tackle acute shortage of donor eggs in uk , with waiting lists of five years .   payment will bring us into line with spain , where there are more volunteers .   critics fear increase will change donation from altruistic to financial act .
