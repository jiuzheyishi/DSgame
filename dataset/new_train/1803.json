{"text": "a ` master key ' that could give hackers complete access to mobile phones and tablets running google 's android software -lrb- logo pictured -rrb- has been revealed . a ` master key ' that could give hackers complete access to mobile phones and tablets running google 's android software has been revealed . the bug could allow hackers to hijack phones , allowing them to steal data , listen in to calls or send junk email and text messages . researchers say the loophole has been present since 2009 , and claim around 900 million devices are at risk . jeff forristal of bluebox , the firm which uncovered the key , said the implications of the discovery were ` huge ' . ` it can essentially take over the normal functioning of the phone and control any function thereof , ' he wrote on the firm 's blog . forristal said the firm made google aware of its finding in february . however , the firm did not respond to mailonline 's request for a comment . the bug takes advantage of the way android handles cryptographic verification of the apps installed on the phone . android uses the cryptographic signature as a way to check that an app or program is legitimate and to ensure it has not been tampered with . the bluebox team found a way to bypass these checks , tricking android so malicious changes to apps go unnoticed . any app or program written to exploit the bug would enjoy the same access to a phone that the legitimate version of that application enjoyed . ` installation of a trojan application from the device manufacturer can grant the application full access to android system and all applications -lrb- and their data -rrb- currently installed , ' wrote forristal . ` the application then not only has the ability to read arbitrary application data on the device -lrb- email , sms messages , documents , etc -rrb- , retrieve all stored account & service passwords , it can essentially take over the normal functioning of the phone and control any function thereof -lrb- make arbitrary phone calls , send arbitrary sms messages , turn on the camera , and record calls -rrb- . ` finally , and most unsettling , is the potential for a hacker to take advantage of the always-on , always-connected , and always-moving -lrb- therefore hard-to-detect -rrb- nature of these  zombie  mobile devices to create a botnet . ' researchers say the loophole has been present since 2009 and claim around 900 million devices are at risk . one third party device , the samsung galaxy s4 -lrb- pictured right -rrb- , already has a fix for the flaw , but that google 's own nexus handset -lrb- left -rrb- does not . forristal is planning to reveal more information about the problem at the black hat hacker conference being held in august this year , and said the bug could have huge implications for firms who allow people to connect their android phones and tablet to secure company networks . he confirmed that one third party device , the samsung galaxy s4 , already has a fix for the flaw , but that google 's own nexus handset did not . however , experts say that there is currently no evidence that the flaw has been exploited . ` i imagine that google would move quickly to add some logic to look for such attacks , ' dan wallach , a professor specializing in android security in the computer science department of rice university , told the ars technica website . ` without that available to an attacker , this is likely to only be relevant for android users who use third-party app stores -lrb- which have lots of other problems -rrb- . ' mcafee mobile security has identified a new android trojan embedded in a pirated copy of an exclusive app from rapper jay z . on the surface , the malware app functions identically to the legitimate app . however , in the background , the malware sends info about the infected device to an external server every time the phone restarts . the malware then attempts to download and install additional packages . the only visible indication that a user is infected comes via a time-based trigger that is set to activate on 4th july , independence day in the us . on that day , the malware will replace the wallpaper on the infected device with an altered image of president obama that comments on recent events in the us . the security company thinks that there is a hacktivist agenda behind the trojan but has not ruled out the possibility that additional malware may target financial transactions or other data . a new android trojan embedded in a pirated copy of an app -lrb- pictured -rrb- from rapper jay z has been identified . on the surface it works like the real app but is actually trying to install additional packages to an individual 's phone . it 's real identity only became clear on 4 july .", "summary": " a bug that has been present since 2009 allows hackers to listen in to calls and send junk emails from android devices .   one research firm claims over 900 million android devices are at risk from the bug that takes advantage of the way the operating system handles cryptographic verification of apps installed on phones and tablets .   samsung galaxy s4 handsets have a fix , but google 's nexus phones remain at risk .   there is no evidence that the flaw has been exploited yet .
