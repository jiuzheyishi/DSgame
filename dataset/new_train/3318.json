{"text": "three white lion cubs born in hangzhou zoo , china , have been adopted by a female dog after their mother refused to feed them . the cubs , born in late april , were abandoned by their mother and are now breast-fed by a dog together with a siberian tiger cub in the zoo . white lions are not actually a species in their own right , but are a variation of the african lion , with their colour caused by a recessive gene which is shared by both parents - like blue eyes in humans . three white lion cubs have been born in a zoo in china 's southeastern province of hangzhou but were rejected by their mother . the three cubs , along with a tiger cub , have now been given to a surrogate dog mother to look after until they are a bit older . by giving the animals to a dog , instead of hand rearing them , keepers hop that the animals will eventually be able to rejoin their own kind . contrary . to popular belief , white lions are not albinos . their colour is . caused by a mutation similar to albinism , but they lack the distinctive . red eyes . it is not the first time the zoo , in china 's southwest , have used a surrogate dog mother to adopt baby lions and tigers . in december last year they placed a pair of siberian tiger cubs with a stray dog from the nearby village after their mother refused to suckle them . they brought in the dog , named xiao wang , to act as their surrogate mother while still nursing her own newborn puppies . it is not the first time this zoo in china has given baby lions and tigers to a surrogate dog mother to look after , they did the same thing in december last year with two siberian tiger cubs . while naturally occurring white lion cubs are rare , because the cause of their colour is genetic they can be bred for in zoos , leading to fears of interbreeding . raising the cubs is hard work for a dog . as babies they require far less food than the 20lb their adult counterparts require , but it is still more than a baby dog . the lions were born in late april , meaning they are just over a month old . it is usual for cubs to be separated from their dog surrogate before they are a year old and can start doing harm . while young siberian tigers obviously do . not eat as much as their adult counterparts - who need at least 9kg . -lrb- 20lb -rrb- of food each day to survive - their appetites are certainly . greater than that of the average puppy , making the task a difficult one . for a dog . the technique is used to keep human animal interaction to a minimum so the animals can eventually be reintroduced with their own kind . in 2010 , a tiger cub called ` lucky ' was introduced to a litter of dogs after its mother refused to feed it . and other cross-species adoption has also been known to take place , with or without encouragement by zookeepers . white lions are thought to have been living in the timbavati region of south africa for centuries , although the earliest recorded sighting was in 1938 . once the cubs are older it is hoped they can be reintroduced to a pride of other lions as being reared by a dog means they will not be dependent on humans . in 2010 , a tiger cub called ` lucky ' was introduced to a litter of dogs after its mother refused to feed it . white lions are regarded as sacred animals in certain parts of africa , but after europeans ` discovered ' them in the 1970s , many were taken from the wild to captive breeding and hunting operations . in 2005 , a newborn squirrel was discovered in seattle having been adopted by a pregnant papillon dog called mademoiselle giselle . in the same year owen , a one-year-old orphaned hippo , was taken in by mzee , a 130-year-old giant tortoise , in a kenyan zoo . golden retriever isabella adopted three white bengal tiger cubs on a us ranch in 2008 -- although they were separated for the dog 's own safety when the big cats reached a year old . the species has been technically extinct fro 12 years , but has never officially been registered as endangered as they are not a separate species from the regular african lion . in their natural habitat , white lions are regarded as ` apex predators ' , able to hunt successfully in day and night and take down prey as large as giraffes .", "summary": " three white lion cubs were born in april but when their mother refused to suckle them they were given to a dog .   they are now being fed along with a siberian tiger cub who was also handed over to the dog to look after .   it is hope that by using a dog to rear the cubs instead of humans , they can one day rejoin their own species .
