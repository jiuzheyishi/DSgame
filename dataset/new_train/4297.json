{"text": "if you 're rich and want to give money to a lot of political campaigns , the supreme court ruled wednesday that you can . the 5-4 ruling eliminated limits on how much money people can donate in total in one election season . however , the decision left intact the current $ 5,200 limit on how much an individual can give to any single candidate during a two-year election cycle . until now , an individual donor could give up to $ 123,200 per cycle . the ruling means a wealthy liberal or conservative donor can give as much money as desired to federal election candidates across the country , as long as no candidate receives more than the $ 5,200 cap . while most people lack the money to make such a large total donation to election campaigns , the ruling clears the way for more private money to enter the system . in effect , it expands the loosening of campaign finance laws that occurred with the high court 's citizens united decision in 2010 that eased campaign spending by outside groups . are campaign donations a form of free speech ? at issue was whether limits in the federal election campaign act on overall -- or aggregate -- campaign spending by individuals violate the first amendment rights of contributors .  we conclude that the aggregate limits on contributions do not further the only governmental interest this court accepted as legitimate  in a 1976 ruling , said chief justice john roberts , who wrote the opinion of the court 's conservative majority .  they instead intrude without justification on a citizen 's ability to exercise the most fundamental first amendment activities .  in dissent , justice stephen breyer said the majority opinion will have the effect of creating  huge loopholes in the law ; and that undermines , perhaps devastates , what remains of campaign finance reform .  republican leaders hailed the decision as an affirmation of free expression rights .  it does not permit one more dime to be given to an individual candidate or a party -- it just respects the constitutional rights of individuals to decide how many to support ,  said senate gop leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky . however , congressional supporters of tougher campaign finance laws expressed concern about more private money influencing elections .  i am concerned that today 's ruling may represent the latest step in an effort by a majority of the court to dismantle entirely the longstanding structure of campaign finance law erected to limit the undue influence of special interests on american politics ,  said republican sen. john mccain of arizona , a longtime proponent of campaign finance reform . new campaign finance reform ? some legislators called for new campaign finance legislation in response to the ruling , but such reforms appeared impossible in an election year . sen. pat leahy of vermont , the democratic chairman of the senate judiciary committee , said he would hold a hearing on the impact of  alarming supreme court decisions that have eviscerated our campaign finance laws .  another top senate democrat , charles schumer of new york , warned of further erosion of limits on special interest influence in elections .  this in itself is a small step , but another step on the road to ruination ,  schumer said .  it could lead to interpretations of the law that would result in the end of any fairness in the political system as we know it .  the case involved shaun mccutcheon , the owner of an alabama electrical engineering company , with support from the republican national committee . they objected to a 1970s watergate-era law restricting someone from giving no more than $ 48,600 to federal candidates , and $ 74,600 to political action committees during a two-year election cycle , for a maximum of $ 123,200 . mccutcheon argued he had a constitutional right to donate more than that amount to as many office seekers as he wanted , as long as no single candidate got more than the $ 5,200 per election limit -lrb- $ 2,600 for a primary election and another $ 2,600 for a general election -rrb- .  spending money on advertising , promoting ideas and supporting candidates is an exercise of our right to freedom of speech ,  mccutcheon told cnn on wednesday after the ruling came out . preventing corruption . supporters of the limits struck down wednesday said the law prevented corruption or the appearance of corruption . without the limits , they argued , one well-heeled donor could in theory contribute to every federal race possible . the ruling leaves in place current donor limits to individual candidates , and donor disclosure requirements by candidates , political parties , and political action committees .  what i think this means is that freedom of speech is being upheld ,  said house speaker john boehner , an ohio republican .  you all have the freedom to write what you want to write . donors ought to have the freedom to give what they want to give .  but supporters of the limits expressed disappointment .  the supreme court majority continued on its march to destroy the nation 's campaign finance laws , which were enacted to prevent corruption and protect the integrity of our democracy ,  said democracy 21 president fred wertheimer , a longtime advocate for election money reforms .  the court re-created the system of legalized bribery today that existed during the watergate days .  congress passed the individual aggregate limits in the wake of the watergate scandal , and the supreme court upheld them in 1976 . the separate citizens united case in 2010 dealt with campaign spending by outside groups seeking to influence federal elections . in that case , the conservative majority -- citing free speech concerns -- eased longstanding restrictions on campaign spending by corporations , labor unions , and certain nonprofit advocacy groups . the citizens united ruling helped open the floodgates to massive corporate spending in the 2012 elections . it also led to further litigation seeking to loosen current restrictions on both spending and donations . what the ruling on campaign money means .", "summary": " supreme court lifts limits on how much in total one person can donate .   its 5-4 ruling means wealthy donors can give to as many campaigns as they want .   people can still only give a maximum of $ 5,200 to a single candidate .   critics warn the ruling further undermines already weakened campaign finance laws .
