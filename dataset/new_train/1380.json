{"text": "soaring numbers of under-40s are developing a type of diabetes linked to obesity and traditionally seen as a disease of the elderly . a study of gps ' records found the number of young people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes rose six-fold over two decades . the most common form of the disease , it is strongly linked to obesity and was once the preserve of the middle-aged and elderly . the number of people aged under 40 being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes is soaring , a new study has revealed . in this file picture , a patient uses a lancet to test blood glucose levels . those who analysed the figures said the increase can ` almost entirely ' be explained by the obesity crisis -- and warned developing diabetes early raises the odds of potentially deadly complications . diabetics are more likely to suffer heart attacks and strokes than other people . the condition , in which the body struggles to convert sugar to energy , also increases the risk of blindness , kidney disease and nerve and circulatory damage , which can lead to amputations . earlier onset gives the disease time to attack the body and could bring decades of ill health . the nhs already spends # 10billion a year on diabetes -- a tenth of its entire budget . the study of a snapshot of gps ' surgeries found that from 1991 to 1995 , 577 people under 40 were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes . but from 2006 to 2010 , that soared to more than 14,000 -- a more than 20-fold increase -- with young women particularly likely to be diagnosed . a large part of this rise can be explained by changes in the way data is collected , and it is estimated the true rate of diagnosis in under-40s is now around six times higher than in the 1990s , at around 25,000 new cases a year . obesity rates roughly doubled in the same period , with 26 per cent of adults dangerously overweight by 2010 . growing numbers of under-40s are developing type 2 diabetes , which is linked to obesity and traditionally seen as a disease of the elderly -lrb- file picture -rrb- . in a report on their findings , published in the journal diabetes , obesity and metabolism , the researchers said : ` not only was the overall incidence increasing but the proportion of people aged 40 or less rose markedly . ` this is likely to place an increasing burden on resources and may also lead to death at a younger age . ' the researchers , from cardiff university and the heart of england nhs trust in birmingham , said the rise may be partly due to better screening , since gps now have performance-related pay that rewards them for diagnosing sufferers . however , they said rising obesity was the main driver . lead researcher professor craig currie said : ` it 's almost entirely obesity . how fat you are is the top and bottom of it . ' dr matt capehorn , of the national obesity forum , said even children in their early teens have been diagnosed . some are genetically more at risk but lifestyle is the key trigger , he said , adding : ` it 's still quite rare but we do see them . in the huge majority of cases type 2 diabetes develops as a consequence of being overweight . so as the weight of the nation increases , the incidence goes up too . ` the implications for nhs spending are huge . it already spends about 10 per cent of its entire budget on diabetes . it 's not the diabetes that kills people but usually the heart disease they develop as a consequence . ' professor jason halford , of the uk association for the study of obesity , warned diabetes is the first in a chain of diseases fuelled by obesity . he said : ` it is likely that in a few years we will see a similar epidemic of cardiovascular disease and , after that , probably an increase in a good number of cancers as well .
