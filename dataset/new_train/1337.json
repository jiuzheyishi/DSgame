{"text": "we 've had a freezing past few days in london and i 've come to accept the fact that winter is now here to stay . although i love a good night out , with the colder weather it 's so much more tempting to stay in with a cup of tea and a dvd . every once in a while it 's nice to sit back , relax and have some well-deserved ` me time ' , as well as pampering my face , body and hair with all my favourite beauty bits . scroll down for video . binky has been treating herself to a few pampering evenings as the cold nights set in . so this week i thought i 'd share with you how i 'd spend a perfect relaxing evening in during the winter . binky 's relaxing pamper night in . for me , there 's no better way to start a relaxing evening in than a hot bubble bath . i love the sensuous indulgent aroma of the tisserand signature blend luxury bath soak , which is made up of natural ingredients to relax the body and mind . if i 'm feeling particularly stressed i also add in a few drops of the ultra-calming lavender and mandarin scented tisserand de-stress blend luxury bath oil . while relaxing in the bath i 'll usually apply a cream face mask to rejuvenate my skin . as i wear a lot of make-up during the week , it 's important for me to keep my skin fresh and hydrated so it does n't end up looking sallow . the la roche-posay hydraphase intense masque has a velvety gel-cream texture which is super-soothing on the skin and leaves it looking glowing . binky says that it is important to rejuvenate your skin and hair with masks . as i use a lot of heated appliances on my hair during the week , when i 'm having a pamper evening i also take the opportunity to treat and repair my locks with an intensive conditioning mask such as dhc rich & moisturising care treatment . moisturising your body after bathing can sometimes be a tedious task , but not when you 're using a gorgeous smelling body butter like l'occitane shea butter ultra rich body cream . binky 's essentials for a girly pamper night . the thick , comforting formula leaves skin feeling nourished and supple without leaving any greasy residue -- plus the cream 's marshmallow and sweet almond extract means your body will be smelling divine for hours . long baths can sometimes dry your hands out , so i always use the luxurious rose-scented paul edmonds cashmere , rose de mai and patchouli hand lotion after bathing -- its light , nourishing texture leaves my hands feeling amazingly soft . once i 've slipped on a fluffy dressing gown and settled myself in front of the tv , i like to relax with a cooling gel face mask like the dhc bio cellulose mask to keep my skin feeling plumped and refreshed , as well as reducing any redness or agitation on my face . simply leave on and chill out for 20 minutes to reveal a thoroughly more radiant complexion . these are binky 's pampering picks for a luxurious night in . if you suffer from under eye bags , i thoroughly recommend the dhc revitalising moisture strips for eyes . place the cooling gel patches under your eyes for around half an hour for visibly brighter and more awake-looking peepers . perfect if you 've had a heavy weekend ! to round off my pamper evening , i love lighting a scented candle like yankee candle in clean cotton -- which fills my whole bedroom with a beautifully crisp , fresh aroma -- and painting my nails a new shade ready for the week ahead . i tend to opt for deep , dark and mysterious tones on my talons during the colder months ; my current favourites are michael kors glam nail lacquer in the shimmering indigo blue hue femme fatale and my very own binky london gel nail polish in beaufort burgundy . hope you enjoyed reading about my perfect relaxing evening in -- you can get all the products i mentioned from escentual.com . will you be planning something similar soon ? i 'd love to hear what pampering products you 'd go for ! love binky xxx .", "summary": " binky has been enjoying a few nights in as the evenings get colder .   she shares her favourite products for a luxury pamper evening .   binky says it is the perfect opportunity to rejuvenate your hair and skin .
