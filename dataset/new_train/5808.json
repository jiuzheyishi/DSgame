{"text": "the son of assassinated pakistan prime minister launched a political career with a fiery speech today - despite still being too young to stand as a candidate . bilawal bhutto zardari , 24 , addressed thousands of cheering supporters on the fifth anniversary of his mother 's assassination in southern sindh province , beside the family mausoleum . his speech comes just months before national elections are due to be held . the minimum age for candidates is 25 so he can not stand , but is likely to be a key asset for the ruling pakistan people 's party . rallying cry : bilawal bhutto zardari , left , addresses a crowd of thousands of pakistan people 's party supporters on the fifth anniversary of his mother 's death . shocking story : zardari , who has just finished studying at oxford , is too young to stand in the elections - but his family history makes him an asset to the party . fight on their hands : zardari 's father asif ali zardari , right , rode a wave of sympathy to become president after his wife 's death - but the ruling party is losing its hold . the party 's popularity has plummeted since it took power nearly five years ago , as the country has struggled with a weak economy and bloody taliban insurgency . before dawn today , dozens of militants armed with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons attacked two tribal police posts in pakistan 's northwest , killing two policemen , with a further 21 officers missing and presumed kidnapped . zardari was made chairman of the party after his mother 's death but has remained largely in the background until now while he completed his studies in britain , at oxford university . his father , president asif ali zardari , also addressed the crowd in garhi khuda bakhsh village today . ' i want to tell you that thanks to god he has completed his studies , but now is the time of his training , ' he said . ` he has to study pakistan , he has to learn from you and he has to work according to your thinking , ' the bhutto family has played a prominent role in pakistani politics for much of the country 's 65-year history . not forgotten : pakistani policemen stand guard on a roof at the site where former premier benazir bhutto was assassinated in 2007 . born to lead : zardari was made chairman of the party after the death of his mother , who twice served as prime minister in the 1980s and 1990s . bilawal bhutto zardari 's grandfather , zulfikar ali bhutto , founded the pakistan people 's party and served as both the country 's president and prime minister in the 1970s . he was eventually hanged in 1979 after general zia ul-haq seized power in a military coup . benazir bhutto twice served as prime minister in the 1980s and 1990s but never completed a full term . her governments were dismissed both times under the cloud of corruption allegations by presidents who were close to the country 's powerful army . she was killed in a gun and suicide bomb attack on december 27 , 2007 , shortly after returning from self-imposed exile to participate in national elections . after her death , the pakistan people 's party rode a wave of public sympathy to garner the most seats in the 2008 elections , and asif ali zardari was elected president . but the popularity of both the party and the president has fallen significantly since then as the government has failed to address pressing problems , such as pakistan 's shortage of electricity and stuttering economy . complex : benazir bhutto never completed a full term - her governments were twice dismissed under the cloud of corruption allegations by presidents who were close to the country 's army . the government has also struggled in its fight against the pakistani taliban , who have killed thousands of people in attacks throughout the country . rasul bakhsh rais , a political science professor at lahore university of management sciences , said it was not a surprise that the pakistan people 's party had unveiled bilawal bhutto zardari in an attempt to boost its fortunes in the elections , which are expected by june at the latest . ` this is pakistan and dynastic politics is the norm , ' said rais . ` bilawal is perhaps the only card left in the chest of the pakistan people 's party . ' both bilawal bhutto zardari and his father sought to whip up the emotions of the crowd by shouting ` long live bhutto ' and ` bhutto is alive . ' supporters waved the red , black and green flag of the pakistan people 's party and held pictures of benazir bhutto and her father . ` if you kill one bhutto , one thousand more bhuttos will emerge , ' said bilawal bhutto zardari . shocking : benazir bhutto was killed just weeks after she returned to pakistan after years in self-imposed exile to participate in the elections . he took a swipe at the judiciary , which has clashed with the current government , by asking why people arrested for suspected involvement in his mother 's murder have yet to be convicted . but some critics have questioned why zardari has not done more to push forward the investigation during more than four years as president . the president at the time of his mother 's death , gen. pervez musharraf , blamed the pakistani taliban for the attack , and five suspected militants are facing trial for alleged involvement in the killing . the pakistani taliban have denied the claims . a pakistani court issued an arrest warrant for musharraf last year over allegations he played a role in the attack , which he has denied . arrest warrants were also issued for two senior police officials accused of negligence in the assassination . prosecutors accused one of the officials of failing to provide proper security for bhutto and the other of cleaning the crime scene before evidence could be collected . rhetoric : father and son tried to whip up the emotions of the crowd by shouting ` long live bhutto ' and ` bhutto is alive ' a un investigation into the assassination said it could have been prevented and blamed all levels of government for failing to provide adequate security . it also accused intelligence agencies and other officials of severely hampering the investigation into those behind her murder . the attack on the tribal police posts before dawn today took place in the town of darra adam khel in khyber pakhtunkhwa province , government officials said . the town is near pakistan 's tribal region , the main sanctuary for taliban militants in the country . security forces have launched an operation to try to recover the 21 missing policemen , said the officials , speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media . no group has claimed responsibility for the attack , but suspicion will likely fall on the pakistani taliban .", "summary": " fifth anniversary of his mother 's death in gun and suicide bomb attack .   bilawal bhutto zardari , 24 , could be key asset to his party .   his father rode wave of sympathy to become president in 2007 .   but party is in trouble because of ailing economy and taliban insurgency .
