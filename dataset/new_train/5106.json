' the honours crown a year of excellence in british sport -- so much so that a special honours list was added to recognise the 65 medals , 29 of them gold , won at this year 's olympic games , as well as the 120 medals -- including 34 golds -- won at the paralympic games . there was also recognition for those behind the games . lord coe , who headed london 's bid team , becomes a companion of honour , while jean tomlin , who led the games maker programme for volunteers to help the event run smoothly , gets an obe . scroll down for video . knight of the road : wiggins followed his tour de france triumph with an olympic gold and was also named bbc sports personality of the year . king cool : bradley wiggins , pictured right in manchester on thursday night , said : ` it 's quite something really . i never imagined that i would ever become a knight ' but eyebrows were raised that mo farah received only a cbe for his historic double track triumph in the 5000m and 10000m . in 2005 , kelly holmes was made a dame for winning both the 400m and 800m at the 2004 athens olympics . heptathlete gold medallist and london 2012 poster girl jessica ennis will also have to be content with a cbe . andy murray , who won olympic tennis gold before becoming britain 's first men 's grand slam champion for 76 years , can perhaps count himself unlucky to receive just an obe . it was also noted that while sarah storey was made a dame after her four golds at 2012 , her paralympic teammate , wheelchair athlete david weir , who also got four golds , was made merely a cbe . there was no mention of danny boyle , creator of the epic olympics opening ceremony , who reportedly turned down a knighthood , or stephen daldry , who staged the closing party . champion : ben ainslie , who won four successive olympic sailing golds , has received a knighthood in the list . supreme : sarah storey is the uk 's most successful ever paralympian and is to be made a dame . there was also nothing for cyclist chris hoy , who with six gold medals became britain 's most successful ever olympian during the games , because he had already been knighted after his heroics at the previous olympics in beijing . in 2008 , when britain came fourth in the olympics ' medal table at beijing , 54 honours were awarded in the new year honours list . storey , 35 , who now has 11 paralympic gold medals in total and is pregnant with her first child , said : ` i ca n't believe the number of times we 've said this year ,  oh , can 2012 possibly get any better ?  we feel so fortunate that 2012 will always stand out as being the most incredible year . ` 2012 has been quite amazing . i am still pinching myself , literally .

' swimmer simmonds , 18 , who won two more golds at london 2012 making her a four-time paralympic champion , said : ` it 's been a great honour to be included in the list which caps an amazing year for me personally and for british sport . ' the honours also recognise those who contributed to london 2012 in a ` non-sporting capacity ' , with 49 ` back-room ' staff from paul deighton , who was made a knight commander of the order of the british empire , down to a mbe for volunteer muhammed khan . away from sport , the companion of honour goes to professor peter higgs , namesake of the higgs boson or so-called ` god particle ' , which was finally proved to exist in july , 48 years after he first proposed it . no sir mo : mo farah 's gold medal-winning triumphs provided fans with two of the london olympics greatest moments . lightning : mo farah missed out on a knighthood but has been awarded a cbe . recognition : cyclist victoria pendleton , who appeared on this year 's strictly come dancing , has been awarded a cbe . recognised with an mbe in the diplomatic and overseas list was also captain raymond ` jerry ' roberts , 92 , one of the four founder members of bletchley park 's testery section , tasked with breaking the german top-level code during the second world war . an mbe also goes to penelope clough , 53 , who set up the justice for jane campaign with husband john after her daughter was murdered by her ex-partner in 2010 while he was on bail . sport makes up about 10 per cent of this year 's awards , education 10 per cent , health 7 per cent , and industry and the economy make up 12 per cent . a cabinet office spokesman said an unprecedented number of people from the sporting world had received honours . he said : ` as we 've seen with the special list for olympians and paralympians , there is a desire to continue to expand the honours system and make sure we 're extending the reach .
