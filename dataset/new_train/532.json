' nurse . julie norton who received mrs darby on a general medical ward at . barnsley district hospital said : ` it was quite upsetting . she was . really , really frail . there were some issues we were really concerned . about . ` when i was changing her bedding with another nurse we were all quite upset and distressed . her right ear was impacted with ear wax and she had a pressure sore , her hair was thin and wispy and badly stuck to her face and neck and her eyes were completely shut . it took quite a lot of bathing with water to open them . ' when old people 's matron karen sharpe saw mrs darby she immediately contacted social services . endocrine specialist dr elizabeth uchegbu , who examined mrs darby , reported : ` she appeared neglected and unkempt , there was a discharge from both eyes , a smell of urine and she was distressed . she was covered in faeces when she first arrived . ' deterioration : jim darby , 72 , at his mother 's bedside in 2007 . the retired miner said mrs darby was ` sprightly ' when she entered the home . the doctor wrote later : ' i got the impression she was neglected . she was weak and thin and it could not be explained . ' tissue viability nurse tracy green , who carried out an investigation after mrs darby 's death , said there were no notes about her pressure sores yet molly was at ` high risk ' of skin damage . ' i believe there had been neglect by omission , ' she said . ` this is in the absence of any proof that there was any intervention . ' the rotherham hearing was told mrs darby had a lower than normal body mass index and had been assessed at risk of malnutrition four months before she went into the home . her son jim darby , 72 , a retired miner , told the inquest his mother was ` sprightly ' when she was at home in west melton , near rotherham . ` her carers used to say my mum could get up the stairs better than they could , ' he said . but the great-grandmother developed dementia and needed 24-hour care so her family decided to put her in the beeches . she went into the home on july 6 , 2007 . failings : an inquiry found the widowed mother of six suffered unintentional abuse through ` neglect by omission ' mr darby said : ` they kept saying they were feeding her and i had no reason not to believe it but it turned out it was wrong . the nurse at the hospital said she had never seen anybody come into hospital from a care home in such a bad state . ' the former care home manager julie morgan said in a statement that staff helped mrs darby with her personal hygiene and toileting , but her diet was poor and she would often refuse to eat . care assistant michelle burkinshaw told the inquest the elderly patient had mobility problems and she was refusing food and fluids . she regularly washed her , bathed her eyes and put cream on her sores . pathologist dr caroline quincy said mrs darby died on august 29 , 2007 , from broncho-pneumonia contributed to by coronary artery atheroma . she said her reduced mobility could have played a part in increasing the risk of pneumonia and there was also evidence of malnourishment . the 44-bed beeches was run by the winnie care group at the time of mrs darby 's death but last year it was sold to new owners mha . an inquiry by rotherham council 's social services department found the previous owners negligent by ` omission of care ' for mrs darby in february , 2008 . moira ockenden , area manager of the beeches at the time , denied mrs darby was emaciated . in a letter to the family read at the inquest she said : ` the references to a concentration camp victim are unjustified . ' she said staff claimed to wash or bathe mrs darby on a daily basis and they regularly brushed her hair . the widow had a poor appetite and would refuse food , she said . she admitted the old woman had sores on her heels , right hip and lower spine when admitted to hospital and that she should have been referred to a dietician . sam newton , rotherham council 's safeguarding service manager said an inquiry found mrs darby had suffered abuse through ` neglect by omission ' but it was not intentional . ` it was based on poor recording , little or no evidence in respect of the care she was receiving , there were no weight charts , fluid or diet recordings and there was no evidence of professional visits . ' tom parramore , service manager for the current owners of the beeches said all the staff were now fully trained and there was regular auditing of residents ' hygiene , nutrition and medication needs . cause for concern : the beeches residential care home , in wath-on-dearne , south yorkshire , has been taken over since mrs darby 's death , but former operator winnie care still runs other homes . recording a narrative verdict the coroner said : ` her basic care and medical requirements were not satisfactorily met and her decreased mobility during her time at the beeches increased her risk of developing a chest infection . ' ms mundy went on : ` her nutritional status compromised her ability to cope with the effects of the chest infection , the latter of which led to her death . ' after the hearing , mrs darby 's granddaughter pearl green , 56 , said : ` the coroner confirmed everything we knew as a family . neglect did contribute to her death . the care she was provided with in that place was absolutely disgusting . it was inhuman . ' mrs darby 's son ray , 68 , said : ` her life was shortened by this . there was a total lack of care . she hardly saw a doctor in 40 years before she went into that home . she did all her own shopping and was very active for her age . ' the coroner is also writing to winnie care , which still operates other care homes , asking them if they have reviewed all their procedures , documentation and training following mrs darby 's death .", "summary": " molly darby , 94 , was suffering from pneumonia , sores and infections after just a few weeks in a privately-run care home in south yorkshire .   previous inquiry into her death in 2007 found the mother of six had suffered abuse through ` neglect by omission ' "}
