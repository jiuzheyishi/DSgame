{"text": "british pensioners who live abroad could be the first to lose their winter fuel allowance under government plans to save millions of pounds from the welfare bill . officials have been ordered to find a way to claw back up to # 16million paid to people living outside the uk to help with their fuel bills . it comes as senior minister ken clarke signalled that the tory pledge to protect universal benefits is likely to be ditched in the next election manifesto . ministers want to stop expat pensioners living in hot parts of europe like the costa del sol from claiming help with winter fuel bills . work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith yesterday suggested future generations of pensioners could lose some of their universal benefits like winter fuel allowance , free tv licences and bus passes . he has vowed to honour david cameron 's pre-election pledge to protect the benefits until 2015 , because pensioners are less able to increase their income than someone in work if benefits are suddenly cut . but he suggested that beyond 2015 new pensioners might not enjoy the same perks . mr duncan smith is understood to be furious at a european court of justice ruling that will hugely increase the bill for britons who live abroad claiming winter fuel allowance . under current rules it can only be claimed by someone who moves overseas after turning 60 . but the ruling said that anyone could claim it regardless of when they left the uk . latest figures show that in 2011-12 , # 16million was paid to in winter fuel allowance to people not living in the uk . today it emerged that officials are considering setting a qualifying threshold based on an average winter temperature , so that people living in britain would qualify even if there was a mild spell . ` clearly it is a crazy idea that pensioners living in hot places abroad in europe should be receiving winter fuel payments , ' a source said . ` we are looking into seeing if there is something we can do around setting an average temperature in order to get round the european court of justice ruling . it is important that taxpayers ' money is used to help pensioners here . ` an average temperature rule would ensure people here get it regardless . ' work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith -lrb- left -rrb- wants to stop people who live outside britain from claiming the winter fuel allowance as minister ken clarke warns cutting all pensioner benefits will be an ` agenda item ' in discussions on the next tory manifesto . the winter fuel allowance is worth # 200 for single pensioners , rising to # 300 for the over 80s . around 12million people receive it each year . but critics have said it should be limited to poorer people who need extra help with their fuel bills . last week former lib dem minister paul burstow suggested just the 2million poorest should be eligible , saving around # 1.5 billion . senior ministers are pushing mr cameron to ditch his pledge to protect the allowance . mr clarke today suggested the tory leader had been rushed into promising not to cut them , and it would be an ` agenda ' item for the next conservative manifesto . mr clarke said : ` before the election the labour party started putting out leaflets accusing us of planning to take away benefits from pensioners . ` very rapidly a promise was given that we would n't reduce benefits to pensioners , ' he told bbc radio 4 .  we actually tied ourselves down for this parliament not addressing them . they , i 'm sure , when we get round , which we have n't yet , contemplating our manifesto for the next election they 'll be an agenda item .
