{"text": "while most photos are digital these days , there was a time when sepia-toned hard copies of pictures were regarded as precious relics -- and families would be thrilled to get their hands on any from times past . some lucky families were recently able to do just that , thanks to the effort of one st. louis county , minnesota , man . when matt seppo , facilities supervisor for the chris jensen nursing home , came across bags of old photographs at the center while cleaning up in 2005 , he could have just thrown them out with the rest of the trash . but he did n't . a self-described history buff and amateur genealogist , seppo was already hooked on working with old images .  i am a collector ,  he told hln .  i collected a lot of old military things for years . my interest in genealogy started when my grandmother passed down a photo album from the 1860s .  seppo traced his own family tree and learned that his family came to the united states from finland in the mid-1800s . so when he discovered the photos at the nursing home , seppo decided to take on the challenge of getting the photos back to their owners -- or at least their owners ' living relatives . but how do you trace photos that are from so long ago ?  i started by turning them face-down , feeling thickness of paper to separate the batches . i also used stamps to discern time taken and where they were developed ,  seppo said . he also used phone books , newspaper archives , census information and the genealogy site of the church of latter-day saints to aid his research . seppo had the photos for eight years before he finally found a lead that connected him to what he was looking for in november .  the big breakthrough was that finally i found some of the people they should belong to ,  he said .  i did it on my own . i used google for some of the research , but i 'm the last person to get a cell phone and a computer ,  he laughed . the bags contained roughly 150 photos , some of them dating as far back as 1890 . one man -- seppo describes him as  very distinctive  -- appeared in many of the photos , from baby pictures to older shots . seppo discovered his name was la verne swenson -lrb- which was also written on one of the bags the photos were in -rrb- , but that there was no link between him and the nursing home .  i found la verne 's brother and sister after doing some research in wisconsin ,  seppo said .  i found a newspaper clipping that led me to believe that a woman named julie swenson was married to a man that was related to la verne . and it turned out that la verne 's sister , lillian , and her brother , olaf , had a baby -- and that was eugene , julie swenson 's husband .  the swensons were n't the only family seppo was able to track down . he also managed to track down the hunter family in cloquet , minnesota , and give mickey hunter photos of his great-great-grandfather he had never seen before .  you know more about my family than i do ,  seppo said hunter told him when they met for the first time . he was right , too -- seppo had managed to find hunter 's relative by tracing a world war i draft registration and then finding descendants of the name . while seppo has many more photos to go through , he said he feels happy that he has finally met with some success .", "summary": " man returns found photos to families in his free time .   the property manager is also a history buff .   matt seppo : ' i just could n't throw them out ' "}
