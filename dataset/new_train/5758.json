{"text": "wolves could die out in just a few years . scientists are debating whether to intervene . gray wolves are at grave risk of extinction in a michigan national park , scientists have warned , with just nine of the animals left and their numbers likely to dwindle . isle royale national park 's gray wolves are at their lowest ebb in more than half a century , and could die out within just a few years . only one of the nine wolves still wandering the wilderness island chain in western lake superior is known to be female , raising doubts that the animals will bounce back from a recent free-fall . diminishing numbers : a pack of gray wolves in isle royale national park in northern michigan . they are at grave risk of extinction unless people lend a hand , wildlife biologist rolf peterson and john vucetich from michigan tech university have warned in a report . the dramatic drop in numbers seems to have been caused by a run of bad luck , rather than one single catastrophe . a shortage of females has cut the birth rate , while a breakdown of several packs has boosted inbreeding and weakened the gene pool . other troubles include disease and starvation from a drop-off of moose , the wolves ' main source of food . although wolf sightings are rare , their presence is treasured by park visitors who hope to catch a glimpse on a backcountry trail or hear their eerie howls at night . beautiful habitat : just nine gray wolves still live in the isle royale national park . ` people like to know the wolves are there , ' said mr peterson . ` it could be argued that this is the wolf 's greatest refuge in the world . it 's the only place they 've never been killed by human beings . ' because isle royale is a federal wilderness area , hunting and trapping are prohibited . unless the wolves rebound quickly , the national park service will face the difficult question of whether to intervene . officials could either bring in wolves from the mainland to salvage the existing population or let nature take its course and start with a new group if the wolves do die out . some scientists prefer not to interfere with nature , even if it has serious consequences . mr peterson and mr vucetich would prefer to let nature take its course and airlift in more wolves should the current inhabitants become extinct , in order to prevent moose from running rampant and damaging the ecosystem . otherwise , ` we 'd be taking a vital wilderness and turning it into an overstocked barnyard , ' mr peterson said . prey : the gray wolves have traditionally kept the moose population in the park under control . they added that while some believe it unethical for humans to manipulate wildlife populations in wilderness areas , isle royale 's environment has already been considerable modified . the primary consideration , they contend , should be protecting the ecosystem , for which wolves are essential as they keep the moose population in check . the wolves ' best hope may be that the female will bear a healthy litter of pups next month and help form a new pack , peterson said . another positive sign : moose numbers rose from an estimated 515 last year to about 750 . but a shortage remains of elderly moose that are easiest for wolves to kill . prospects are increasingly remote that more wolves will find their way to isle royale without help , mr vucetich said . a male is believed to have made the crossing on an ice bridge in the late 1990s and sired offspring , temporarily reinvigorating the gene pool . but a study published last week found that great lakes ice cover has declined 71 per cent over the past 40 years . biologist began observing interactions between the gray wolves and moose in 1958 , beginning what became the world 's longest-running study of predators and prey in a single ecosystem , mr vucetich explained . restoring wolves would enable continuation of the study , which has yielded a wealth of discoveries about both species , he said . david mech , a wolf expert with the u.s. geological survey , advocated a hands-off policy unless the wolves die out . even in their diminished state , they could last a decade or more and may pull a surprise comeback , he said . ` this is a really unique opportunity to see what they can do , ' mr mech said . ` if there 's any intervention , it destroys that potential .
