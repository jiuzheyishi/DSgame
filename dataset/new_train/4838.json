the office could file involuntary manslaughter charges if mehserle exercised gross negligence , voluntary manslaughter if mehserle reasonably believed that he was acting in self-defense or murder if mehserle acted with malice and forethought .  our function is to determine whether or not criminal charges should be filed against the officer ,  he said .  these things are usually an issue of weeks rather than days .  bart police chief gary gee released a statement this week expressing condolences for grant 's family and saying the authority is cooperating with orloff 's office . gee added that bart will complete an  unbiased and thorough investigation  and asked the public to be patient .  as frustrating as it is , i want to stress that we can not and will not jeopardize this case by discussing details before the investigation is complete ,  gee said . johnson told cnn on wednesday that it could take weeks for bart to complete its investigation . cnn 's eliott c. mclaughlin , augie martin and dan simon contributed to this report .", "summary": " officer 's attorney , union representative submit officer 's letter of resignation .   prosecutor : office investigating  mental state  of officer accused in killing .   spokesman says johannes mehserle has been moved twice because of .   video shows officer shoot grant in back as another officer kneels on him .
