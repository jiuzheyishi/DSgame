{"text": "` if your man is not asking you for sex anymore , it means he 's seeking it elsewhere . he 's not going to accept being in a marriage without sex , ' says ex-prostitute rebecca dakin , 37 . ` i 'm sure there are women who know that their man has been cheating but are happy because they do n't want to have sex with him anymore . ` they are probably relieved that he 's not hassling them and just decide to turn a blind eye . everyone always hates the escorts but you have to remember there are women are probably quite thankful that they 're around . ' rebecca dakin , 37 , spent nine years working as an escort after dropping out of university and finding only low-paid jobs . her first session with a client earned her # 1,400 . now she works as a dating coach and sexpert . valentine 's day evokes mixed emotions for rebecca , reminding her of the nine years she worked as an escort and of the men who will cheat on their wives this february 14 , many of them with paid companions . these days , rebecca works as an author , dating coach and infidelity expert - something she feels she has a unique perspective on . she says it is her duty to educate both men and women about the reasons married men seek out the company of escorts . valentine 's day was rebecca 's busiest time , she says - though on one such rendezvous she was shocked when her client called reception for champagne and a change of sheets as his wife was arriving in half an hour . ` about 60 per cent of the men i saw while i was escorting were married or had girlfriends , ' says rebecca . ` men cheat for different reasons . some may be genuinely lacking intimacy at home but others just get off . on the danger element of wondering whether they 'll get caught . ' valentine 's day can be a busy time for escorts . on one occasion , rebecca spent the . afternoon in a newcastle hotel with a client . when they had finished . having sex , he called down to reception asking for champagne and a . change of sheets as his wife was arriving half an hour later for a . romantic valentine 's evening with her husband . rebecca says she does n't know why prostitutes always get the blame . ` it 's the responsibility of the person in the relationship to be faithful , ' she says . ' i was so angry , ' says rebecca . ' i think clients sometimes forgot that my loyalties lie with women . ' i do n't know why we always get the blame in these situations -- it 's the responsibility of the person in the relationship to be faithful . ` even if the hottest woman in the world comes on to your boyfriend , he should be strong enough to withstand it and , if he 's not , she 's done you a favour . ' rebecca remembers another occasion on which she spent the night in london with a married client who had told his wife he was watching a football match in manchester . ` in the morning he was he in bed reading the paper , catching up on the football results and memorising who had scored goals and what had happened during the match . later that day , his wife called and i heard him telling her about the match -- even what the weather had been like . ' despite such experiences , rebecca enjoyed her work from the moment she began escorting aged 25 . after failing at college , struggling through a string of dead end jobs , and without any capital or training behind her , rebecca decided that this was her only chance of making good money . the daughter of a navy navigator and a . school teacher , rebecca had an auspicious start in life , attending a . convent school in derbyshire and embarking on a fashion degree . however , after dropping out of . university without finishing her course , rebecca found herself in a . cycle of boring , low paid jobs . by this time , she had already worked as a . glamour model and a dancer so , for her , becoming an escort was the next . step . since she was living at home at the time , rebecca was honest with her parents about what she was planning to do . ` my parents had despaired of me , ' she says . ` i 'd always been a rebellious child and . at this point they just did n't know what to do with me . it would have . been different if i was 18 , but because i was 25 i think they realised i . was an adult and they just wanted to let me make my own mistakes . ` it was not the job my mum would have chosen for me but once she saw i was going to really nice restaurants and hotels and meeting people like bankers and solicitors , i think she became marginally more comfortable with it . ' rebecca 's mum dropped her at the bus . stop the day she went to see her first client , an accountant in . liverpool . while she barely had the money for a bus fare on the way to . her date , on the way back rebecca was # 1,400 richer . ' i . remember getting the train back and just counting all these notes , ' she . says . ` after working for as little as # 100 a week in my previous job as . a travel agent , i could n't believe i 'd just made so much money . ' rebecca did n't look back and within three months of setting up her own business , she had a mortgage and was buying her own flat . ` the . guy in the bank gave me a mortgage straight away when he heard i was an . escort , ' she says . ` he told me they never had any problem with girls in . my profession . ' because she chose always to work for . herself rather than for an agency , rebecca would spend the days looking . for new clients , doing admin and organising her own advertising . ` i 'd always been a rebellious child and at this point my parents did n't know what to do with me ' as . she was highly selective about who she would see , rebecca never spent . time with more than 4 men a week and sometimes went for a month without a . booking if she did n't feel comfortable about any of the potential . clients who would get in touch . when she did work , the rewards were . great . specialising in overnight stays , rebecca frequently found herself . whisked abroad , spending time with men in hong kong , dubai , italy , . paris and switzerland . she saw some clients regularly and developed . close relationships with them . ` my favourite was a guy in his 70s , ' she says . ` he . was married but his wife did n't want to sleep in the same bed as him . anymore because he snored ! he owned a factory and was loaded - he would . spend thousands of pounds on jewellery and clothes for me . i liked him . because he was a lovely guy though , very respectful with a dry sense of . humour . we did n't even really have sex - it was more about the . companionship . ' ` cheating is not black and white . there are some circumstances where people do n't have any other options ' although the money was good and rebecca admits to getting a buzz from dressing up and walking into swanky hotels to meet her clients , eventually she decided enough was enough . ' i want to have kids and settle down and i did n't want to be working as an escort while i did that , ' she says . ' i wanted to prove to myself that i could do something else and was capable of earning money in another way . ' rebecca says that men cheat for myriad reasons . ` some guys are just cheats , ' she says . ` some are not confident about communicating with their other half . they think that if they tell her they want more sex , she 'll be upset . ` some do n't want to leave , as they love their wife , but they need more intimacy . by seeing an escort , they 're just trying to find a way to stay with the woman they love . ' although rebecca does not condone cheating , in some instances she thinks it can be justified . ' i want to challenge women 's point of view . i want women to read the stories in my book and think - i quite like this guy and understand where he 's coming from . ' one man who has anonymously contributed to rebecca 's book is living with a wife who suffers from severe manic depression . he does n't want to leave because he would have to take the children and his wife would be broken-hearted , but he still craves intimacy with a woman and has therefore decided to pay escorts for sex and companionship . ` you ca n't help but feel for him , ' rebecca says . ` cheating is not black and white . there are some circumstances where people do n't have any other options . my book will be really valuable insight into how men are thinking . ' it has now been three years since rebecca worked as an escort and , although she sometimes misses the quick cash , her life has moved on . at the same time as writing her book on infidelity , she is putting together a book of sex tips , working as a media ` sexpert ' and running a dating coach service , charging men for skype sessions in which she guides them through the minefields of flirting , dating and relationships using her training as an nlp master practitioner . ` some women have a problem with me giving this advice because of the job i used to do but i 've dated around 900 men and my knowledge comes from experience , ' says rebecca . ' i know what i 'm doing is of value -- i just want to help people stay in relationships .
