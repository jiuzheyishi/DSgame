{"text": "the u.s. environmental protection agency asked its employees in denver this year to stop leaving a dangerous pollutant -- human feces -- in office hallways , according to a report that circulated on wednesday . managers in the epa 's region 8 office in denver , colorado . emailed their entire staff to plead a cease-and-desist case for whoever had been pooping and fleeing . government . executive reported that epa deputy regional administrator howard cantor addressed ` several incidents ' in the office building at 1595 wynkoop street in denver . employees , he wrote , had been clogging toilets with . paper towels . and there was ` an individual placing feces in the hallway ' outside a restroom . dirty job : someone at the epa had to pick up human feces that an employee left in the hallway of the agency 's denver office building . the epa 's region 8 office at 1595 wynkoop street in downtown denver , colorado is near a popular pedestrian mall , but the epa considers the unauthorized pooping to be an inside job . it 's unclear whether epa regulations leave room for the ` if you got ta go , you got ta go ' rule , but the government green group should n't have problems cleaning up its mess . last summer the agency awarded an $ 80,000 contract to tda research , inc. ` to develop technologies to protect public health and the environment following potential accidents or intentional attacks involving chemical and biological agents . ' the technology , the agency reported , ` involves applying an impermeable polymer material to create a barrier on contaminated wastes removed from response sites following chemical or biological incidents , including building materials , furniture , insulation , and other materials . ' ` the successful encapsulation of chemicals and biological agents would protect responders and the general public from exposure and expedite the safe removal of wastes . ' region 8 serves colorado , montana , north dakota , south dakota , utah , wyoming and 27 tribal nations , but only denver seems to be afflicted with random pooping disease . government executive reported eric katz declined to share a copy of the epa memo . ` sorry ... ca n't share that , ' he emailed mailonline . ` feel free to link to my story though . thanks . ' katz reported that cantor wrote : ` management is taking this situation very . seriously and will take whatever actions are necessary to identify and . prosecute these individuals . ' , . the epa official also asked employees to root out the poop bandit and turn him or her in . the environmental protection agency funds hundreds thousands of studies each year into the harmful effects of volatile chemical compounds , so it should seem logical that cantor consulted with john nicoletti , a ` national expert ' in workplace violence , to quantify the health risks . feces left in areas where people walk is ` very dangerous ' and a genuine health and safety risk , nicoletti helpfully concluded , adding that whoever dropped the deuce would ` probably escalate ' his or her behavior to something even more dastardly . no kidding : the epa hired a workplace consultant to confirm that pooping anyplace other than here can be dangerous to human health . epa spokesman richard mylott told government executive that its ` actions in response to recent workplace issues have been deliberate and have focused on ensuring a safe work environment for our employees . ' the agency has been troubled in recent months with revelations of wrongdoing by its employees that pushed the bounds of believability . one employee whose work formed the cornerstone of the epa 's global-warming-control measures was jailed in december for defrauding the agency out of $ 900k by never showing up to work -- claiming he was an undercover cia agent . another confessed to spending between two and six hours per day viewing pornography on his government-issued computer during work hours . still others were found to be using government credit cards for gym memberships , gift cards , meals and even charity donations .", "summary": " stealth defecation irks epa who circulates a memo asking workers to rat out the culprit .   the agency hired a workplace consultant to confirm that human feces in open hallways could , indeed , present a health and safety risk .   the epa 's denver office is near a downtown pedestrian mall , but deputy regional administrator howard cantor considers it an inside job .
