{"text": "naturists fear they will be forced to cover up under new laws designed to crack-down on yobs . it is claimed new measures designed to curb anti-social behaviour could be used by police and the courts to stop them stripping off in public . nudist beaches in particular could become a thing of the past if magistrates take a personal dislike to them , it is claimed . row : parks and beaches could be out of bounds for naturists under new laws aimed at tackling anti-social behaviour , nudist groups have warned . the row centres on the anti-social behaviour , crime and policing bill , which is debated in the commons today . it includes power for the courts to grant an injunction against someone who ` has engaged in , or is threatening to engage in , anti-social behaviour ' . ministers say it could include not being in possession of a can of spray paint in a public place , not entering a particular area , or not being drunk in public . home secretary theresa may has argued the changes will help to cut crime . ` we are delivering on our pledges to give victims of antisocial behaviour a stronger voice , further cut crime and improve the relationship between the public and police , ' she said last month . home secretary theresa may insist the new powers will help to cut crime . but naturist groups claim the law has been so widely drawn that police officers and magistrates courts could ` abuse ' their position to target people who choose not to wear clothes . british naturism branded the legislation ` probably the most serious attack on the civil liberties of this country in decades ' . in a statement it warned the new laws would pose a ` major threat to naturism ' . it added : ` it is well-meaning , and seeks to tackle a serious social problem , but it is so open ended that it could be used and abused to prohibit or require just about anything . ` if history teaches us anything it is that if a power can be abused then it will be abused . ` we have absolutely no doubt that if it becomes law as currently worded then it will be used to prohibit naturism in a wide range of places . ` beaches and gardens are a certainty and it may even include naturist events and clubs . ' under the new rule , an injunction could be granted if a person has ` engaged in conduct which is capable of causing nuisance or annoyance to any person ' . reg barlow , chair of the naturist action group , said the legislation would ` make it so much easier for people to say that naturists have caused distress , that being a naturist and being naked in an open environment is anti-social ' . ` because of a lack of a definition for what is anti-social , police officers are going to be put into an impossible position , ' he told the times . he added : ` the only way that they 'll be able to decide what to do -lsb- if a complaint is made -rsb- is to use their own moral compass about nudity and that could be religious . ' a home office spokesman said : ` we want to give the police and other agencies the means to protect victims more effectively , not penalise certain behaviours . ` the  nuisance and annoyance  test is clear and well-established in law , and it will ultimately be for the courts to decide whether it is proportionate to grant an injunction restricting an individual from acting in a certain way . ' the bill is expected to clear its second reading in the commons tonight .", "summary": " courts will be able to impose injunction on anyone causing ` nuisance or annoyance '   naturism groups claim magistrates opposed to stripping off will use law against them .   mps debate the anti-social behaviour , crime and policing bill today .
