{"text": "britain will need millions more immigrants to cope with an ageing population , the official economic watchdog warned today . the office for budget responsibility said that opening the doors to an extra 140,000 every year for five decades would boost employment and bolster the public finances . it also warned that pressure on the uk 's healthcare system caring for older people means an extra # 19 billion of spending cuts or tax hikes will be needed . open door policy : without high levels of migration to britain , public debt will balloon to become larger than the entire economy , the office for budget responsibility said . urgent action is needed or the gains made by george osborne 's spending cuts will be wiped out by increased spending on the elderly , the obr said . health , pension and social care costs are already equivalent to 14 per cent of britain 's economy but by 2062-63 it will rise to almost 20 per cent . the obr argues that allowing 140,000 immigrants of working age into britain each year -- totalling 7million over 50 years -- would fill jobs and raise taxes for treasury coffers . ` our sensitivity analysis shows that overall migration has a positive impact on the sustainability of the public finances over our 50 year horizon , ' the obr said . it said that if there is a steady flow of immigrants into britain , government borrowing would rise to 99 per cent of gdp . but if there is a bar on immigration , borrowing would hit 174 per cent . ` these results are driven by the assumed age structure of net migration , which tends to be more concentrated in the working age group and hence reduces the dependency ratio throughout the projection period . ' warning : gains made by george osborne 's spending cuts could be wiped out by increased pressure on the public finances from britain 's ageing population . however , david cameron has pledged to reduce net migration to the ` tens of thousands ' and last year the number of immigrants fell by 89,000 to 153,00 . without action to address the burden of an ageing population , the uk will be left with a # 65 billion hole in its finances , according to the obr . in its annual fiscal sustainability report , it said : ` it is clear that longer-term spending pressures , if unaddressed , would put the public finances on an unsustainable path . ' ` public sector net debt would approach 100 per cent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and still be rising , ' it added . the obr said the move to a single-tier state pension had slightly eased the pressure on public sector debt , but added that spending on healthcare was the biggest spending pressure over the next 50 years . the obr said the cost of the state pension was predicted to rise from 5.8 per cent of gdp to 8.4 per cent of gdp as the population ages , even with the introduction of the new flat rate payment system and increase in retirement age to 67 taken into account . healthcare spending is expected to increase from 7 per cent of gdp to 8.8 per cent of gdp , while long-term social care costs are set to rise from 1.3 per cent of gdp to 2.4 per cent of gdp . the obr also warned that declining north sea oil reserves will take its toll , with oil and gas revenues expected to plunge from 0.4 per cent of gdp now to almost negligible levels - at 0.03 per cent of gdp by 2040 . but action taken so far by the government , including an extra year of spending cuts to 2017-18 and the single tier state pension , is helping to offset some of the pressures , the report added . the office for budget responsibility 's robert chote warned of ` huge uncertainties around the scale of the challenge ' of dealing with the costs of more elderly people . robert chote , chairman of the obr , said on presenting the report : ` since last year , the underlying deficit and debt path look less favourable . ` but this and the costs of long-term care reform are likely to be offset by the government 's announcement of additional spending cuts in 2017-18 and savings from the single tier pension . ` that said , there are huge uncertainties around the scale of the challenge and the uk is certainly not alone in confronting it . ' he added that the extra # 19 billion needed to get borrowing back on track could be spread over the next 50 years rather than action taken in one go . in a written statement , chief secretary to the treasury danny alexander said the obr 's report shows that without the steps taken over the past year , public borrowing would be around 50 per cent of gdp higher in 50 years ' time . he added that the report identifies the extra spending cuts as ` one of the key factors in containing the growth of spending over the long-term , demonstrating the importance of the government 's programme of fiscal consolidation for the long-term health of the public finances ' .", "summary": " 140,000 extra immigrants to the uk are needed every year until 2063 .   office for budget responsibility says foreign workers needed to raise tax .   george osborne 's spending cuts will be wiped out by ageing population .
