{"text": "america 's secretive spy agency , the national reconnaissance office , has been in possession of two space telescopes which are better than hubble - and has now decided to gift them to nasa . sources say that the reason for the . hand-me-down is because the nro - motto : ` vigilance from above ' - has . found even better technology . the revelations leads to questions over how long the nro has had the satellites - which are said to have 100 times the field of view of hubble - and what exactly they were planning to use them for . a satellite spy company gifted nasa with two hubble telescopes after they said they had better technology available for newer telescopes -lrb- file photo -rrb- . the space agency has confirmed that . it received a pair of giant identical hubble telescopes , and said the . spy agency built them and then decided it did n't need them . so , having decided they had no use . for them , the nro has now gifted the pair , which have been sat in their . original wrappers in a warehouse in rochester , new york , to the space . agency . the trouble is , nasa is too cash-strapped to refurbish them - until at least 2024 . even with this windfall , nasa has no money to launch the telescopes anytime soon . they have consistently been dealing with smaller budgets and fewer staff members . the transfer last summer was only recently declassified . the telescopes have mirrors similar in size to the famed hubble space telescope , but they are not ready for space - not by a long shot . for starters , they lack cameras and instruments essential for astronomy research . the equipment costs money - around $ 1billion , according to some estimates . dr spergel , a member of the national academy of science 's committee on astrophysics and astronomy told time : ` a 50 per cent discount still means you have to come up with the other 50 per cent . ' one man 's trash : while the telescopes were given to nasa free of charge , they do not have the funds to launch them into space -lrb- file photo -rrb- . the final frontier : the astrophysics director for nasa said that he hopes to launch the telescopes by 2024 , or sooner , ` if money is no object ' -lrb- file photos -rrb- . nasa astrophysics director paul hertz told the washington post that the soonest nasa could hope to launch the telescopes was in 2024 , but said they might launch earlier ` if money is no object . ' he added that the initial framework means less overhead , and more that can potentially be spent on newer technologies . in total , the massive gifts will likely save the space agency some $ 250million down the road . however , until scientists have enough money for launches , the telescopes will remain in the upstate new york warehouse . neither the nro or nasa would release pictures of the two telescopes . scientists hope nasa will repurpose one of the telescopes to study dark energy , the mysterious force that could explain the universe 's expansion .", "summary": " nasa gifted two telescopes by spy agency national reconnaissance office .   however , nasa has no budget to refurbish or launch telescopes ... until 2024 .   ` gifts ' currently sitting in upstate new york warehouse .
