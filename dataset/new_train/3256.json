{"text": "barack obama 's ivy-league educated half-brother is publishing his autobiography next month , painting a dramatically different picture of their few meetings from the one the president related in his best-selling ` dreams from my father ' memoir . mark obama ndesandjo includes an appendix in his book , cataloguing what he says are factual errors in ` dreams ' -- including words falsely attributed to his mother , a jewish woman named ruth . ' a lot of the stuff that barack wrote is wrong in that book , and i can understand that , ' he told the associated press last year when he planned to self-publish his book . ` to me , ' ndesandjo said then , ` for him the book was a tool for fashioning an identity and he was using composites . i wanted the record to be straight . i wanted to tell my own story , not let people tell it for me . ' scroll down for video . revelations : mark obama ndesanjo , the half-brother of barack obama 's half-brother , is uncorking family secrets that the president left out of his own memoir . troubled childhood : ndesandjo as a baby with his mother ruth , then married to the elder barack obama . mark claims his father once held a knife to her throat . his book , ` an obama 's journey : my odyssey of self-discovery across three cultures , ' is due in stores september 16 and published by globe pequot press . describing a two-day stretch in 1988 . when the two half-brothers first met and shared a next-day lunch , . ndesandjo , who bears only a vague family resemblance to the president , . writes that ` overall , it was a very awkward , cold meeting . ' ` an obama 's journey : my odyssey of self-discovery across three cultures , ' an autobiography of president barack obama 's kenyan half-brother mark obama ndesandjo , is due in stores on sept. 16 . barack sr. , he explains , was someone he tried not to think of since he had divorced ruth years earlier and descended further into alcoholism and a downward career spiral . but with barack jr. suddenly in his living room , brought for a visit by the future president 's aunt , avoiding thoughts about their common father became uncomfortably impossible . it was , he writes , as ` though the skeleton that no one ever talked about had strayed into the middle of a family party . ' ndesandjo , according to a writer at wnd.com who obtained an advance copy of the book , ` described their lunch together during that second day as filled with tension , as barack struggled to embrace the african heritage of a father ndesandjo had rejected . ' the author ` had refused even to use the obama name , unable to forget , as a child , experiencing the alcoholism and brutality of their father . ' the elder barack was a blithely self-involved alcoholic , once killing a man in a dui auto accident and dying at age 46 while driving drunk . his viciousness is largely absent from the president 's ` dreams ' -- president obama met barack sr. just once after his infancy , at age 10 -- and is relegated to obama quoting his half-brother criticizing barack sr. . ` you think that somehow i 'm cut off from my roots , that sort of thing , ' ndesandjo tells the future president in ` dreams . ' ` well , you 're right . at a certain point , i made a decision not to think about who my real father was . he was dead to me even when he was still alive . i knew that he was a drunk and showed no concern for his wife or children . that was enough . ' in ` dreams , ' obama casts himself as . the all-seeing observer trying to connect himself back to his kenyan . roots . but ndesandjo now recalls details that never made it into the . president 's 1995 book . ` my . impression at the first meeting , ' he writes , ` was that barack thought . that i was too white , and i thought that he was too black . ' ` he was an american search for his african roots . ... i 'm an american but i was living in kenya , searching for my white roots . ' ndesandjo moved to china 12 years ago , married a chinese wife , and is now fully immersed in the chinese language and culture . accusations of violence : mark ndesandjo says the future president thought he was ` too white ' even though they both called the same man ` father ' culture warrior : ndesandjo lives in shenzhen , china with his wife and has won volunteer service awards for his campaigns against domestic violence . ' i remember that when i spoke with him about the heroes of western culture , he rolled his eyes impatiently , ' he has told maariv , an israeli newspaper . ` my feeling was that , here is an american who in many ways is trying to be a local kenyan youth . this is something i tried to flee my entire life . ' ndesandjo says his effort to escape his african cultural roots was furthered in part by a desire to escape the legacy of his violent father . ` his self-hatred and tendency toward self-sabotage was passed down and became part of my identity , ' he acknowledges in his new book . ` my mother 's lily-white skin and my father 's ebony-black visage come to symbolize an eternal incompatibility in my mind 's eye . for a long time i hated to have anything to do with what my father represented , whether it was him personally , or even the positive aspects of african culture . ' ` in violent reaction to him , ' he concludes , ' i turned passionately toward western culture and music , which brought me a measure of solace . ' after earning degrees in physics from brown and stanford universities , ndesandjo honed his artistic talents in china where he lives with his wife . he is an accomplished pianist and recording artist who often gives lessons to orphans in the chinese boom town of shenzhen . more criticisms of barack sr. surfaced in 2009 when the new president visited china during his first year in the white house . only visit : barack sr. visited the future president in hawaii in the 1970s -lrb- l -rrb- for the first and only time before heading back to kenya , and posed -lrb- r -rrb- with his former wife and president obama 's mother stanley ann dunham . that 's when ndesandjo published his first book , an autobiographical novel titled ` nairobi to shenzhen : a tale of love in the east . ' it paints barack obama sr. as an abusive drunk who repeatedly beat him and his mother in episode after rage-filled episode . ` there were some thumps as of someone falling , ' reads one passage that ndesandjo wrote in the third-person . out of africa : president barack obama shared a laugh on wednesday with tanzania 's president jakaya mrisho kikwete at the white house 's u.s.-africa leaders summit in washington . ` his father 's angry voice raised itself . ... he did n't remember what they were fighting about , but his stomach felt sick and empty . ' ` his mother was being attacked and he could n't protect her .  you bastard !  he remembered her screaming out . and that was just one night . there were many more . ' one of those nights , ndesandjo writes in ` an obama 's journey , ' resulted in his blitzed father holding a knife to his mother 's throat after she obtained a restraining order against him . ` we obamas have big hands . they can be used to create or to debase , ' reads one portion . ` my hands enable me to comfortably reach across twelve keys and play piano well . my father would use his big hands to knock my mother down when he came home from a night of drinking . ' ' i would move protectively toward her and clutch her legs , crying , ' writes ndesandjo . ' i know now why i mostly remember her legs , not her torso , or even her face . ' his parents met when obama sr. was a graduate student at harvard university . they moved to kenya in 1964 , where he and his brother david were born . david later died in a motorcycle accident . obama sr. had earlier divorced president obama 's mother , stanley ann dunham , following obama 's 1961 birth . ndesandjo 's mother later divorced the elder barack obama and married another man , whose surname both mother and son also took .", "summary": " mark obama ndesanjo , the son of barack obama sr. and his third wife , details beatings he and his mother endured in kenya .   he also airs his version of his early meetings with the president , casting him as ` an american ... trying to be a local kenyan youth . this is something i tried to flee my entire life '   ` barack thought that i was too white , and i thought that he was too black , ' the brown - and stanford-educated ndesandjo writes .   ` an obama 's journey : my odyssey of self-discovery across three cultures ' is due in stores september 16 .
