{"text": "a young woman leaves her farming village at age 16 to find work in a distant city . with three younger children at home , her parents ca n't afford to keep her in school . her first job , on a factory assembly line , pays only $ 50 a month . over two years she takes night-school classes , gets a series of secretarial jobs , and lands a coveted position in a factory 's purchasing department that pays more than $ 1,000 a month . she meets a young man , a fellow migrant ; they marry and have two children . the couple saves enough money to buy an apartment for her parents and a secondhand buick for themselves . then the young woman leaves her daughters in the temporary care of her husband and his parents , so she can return to the city to work again .  a person should have some ambition while she is young ,  she writes ,  so that in old age she can look back on her life and feel that it was not lived to no purpose .  watch leslie chang 's ted talk . the outlines of this young woman 's story are familiar ; she could be one of the millions of immigrants who crossed an ocean to make a new life in america . we acknowledge that their lives were hard , but we believe that with adversity came opportunity and transformation . but if i tell you that this woman 's name is lu qingmin , and that she lives in china , all such possibility seems to fall away . she is recast as a victim of the world 's largest authoritarian regime , where workers earn less than a dollar an hour and independent unions are against the law . her story becomes one of misery and exploitation . how could it be otherwise ? i spent two years getting to know assembly line workers in the south china factory city of dongguan . these young men and women labored long hours every day , sometimes for weeks on end without a break ; the best factories gave one day off each week . a government-mandated 11-hour workday was routinely ignored , and factories frequently paid less than the minimum wage or withheld pay for minor infractions . injuries on the factory floor resulted from safety violations and minimal employee training . workers might sleep 10 or 15 to a room , with 50 people sharing one bathroom . ted.com : behind the great firewall of china . yet these workers did not strike me as cowed ; despite their youth and inexperience , they were capable and resourceful at improving their situations over time . almost every worker i met told me a story of challenging her boss over some injustice , which frequently led her superiors to take notice and treat her better . the workers figured out who were the best employers , took private classes to learn computer or secretarial skills and talked their way into higher-paying jobs . they became the chief earners in their families and challenged long-held traditions . they urged their parents to keep younger siblings in school ; they resisted pressure to marry early and return to a way of life they no longer wanted . for these young women , the factory experience could not be boiled down to a set of working conditions . it also changed their lives . surveys have shown that chinese migrants are younger and better educated than the people who stay behind in the village , and that they choose to leave home as much to see the world and to develop new skills as to earn money . factory work is an informed choice , not a desperate response to poverty . other studies by chinese and western scholars show that migration fuels economic growth , social mobility and the spread of progressive ideas . income from migrant work is the biggest source of wealth accumulation in rural china . ted.com : the generation that 's remaking china . by 2025 , mckinsey & co. has estimated , the chinese middle class will swell to 520 million people , most of them former migrants who have done well in the cities and stayed . one study has shown that having done migrant work makes a rural woman more likely to choose her own husband , to give birth in a hospital , and to seek equality in marriage . it 's possible to acknowledge that the chinese factory regime has immense problems but that it also brings benefits to individuals within that system . perhaps chinese workers deserve our interest and respect instead of our pity . just to say these things makes some people angry . since my ted talk on chinese factory workers was posted online , i have been accused of working in league with the technology industry to perpetuate the enslavement of chinese workers .  you sicken me with your effort to discount the negatives of factory workers in china by making it sound like the workers want this ,  one person wrote . what accounts for such visceral reactions ? one answer lies in the nature of daily journalism . by focusing on extreme events , such as a violent brawl earlier this week at a foxconn technology plant that manufactures for apple , journalists create the impression of an enormous underclass on the edge of revolt . ted.com : does democracy stifle economic growth ? write about ordinary workers who have not endured violent protests or extraordinary suffering , and you may be attacked for hiding the truth or shilling for the corporations . a widespread fear of china -- a monolithic force that is taking over the world and stealing american jobs -- blinds people to the complexities of life there . the chinese government is not a democracy , yet its economic policies over the past three decades have improved the lives of millions . but it 's far easier to believe that everyone there is exploited and miserable . it 's true that chinese factories have harsh conditions . it 's also true that chinese factories have allowed huge numbers of people to improve their lives and change their fates . this same set of contradictory facts characterized america 's industrialization more than a hundred years ago . to insist on seeing china in black and white reflects an ignorance of history and a failure of the imagination . follow @cnnopinion on twitter .", "summary": " leslie t. chang : conditions are harsh , but people ignore the full stories of chinese workers .   she says factory jobs have provided upward mobility , new opportunity in china .   people look back admiringly at heroic work of immigrants to u.s. 100 years ago , she says .   chang : chinese workers deserve our interest and respect instead of our pity .
