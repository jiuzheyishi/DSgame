' she added : ` we can not sit back . we must raise our concerns in the hope . that the prime minister will halt this damaging , unnecessary and . expensive reorganisation which , in our view , risks leaving the poorest . and most vulnerable in society to bear the brunt .

' the bill also sets out to encourage more competition within the nhs in . the hope it will drive up standards , with hospitals , private firms and . charities all vying to treat patients . but from the outset it has been heavily opposed by medical workers , charities and even mps from within the government . and yesterday the chartered society of physiotherapy also called for the . bill to be scrapped , saying that even mr lansley 's latest changes did . not address its concerns . last month , dr hamish meldrum , chairman of the british medical . association 's council , warned that if the reforms went ahead the nhs . could face scandals on the scale of those that occurred at mid . staffordshire nhs trust in 2010 , when up to 1,200 patients died from . poor care as staff put government targets and cost-cutting ahead of . patient care . the royal college of nursing and the royal college of midwives also . warned the upheaval caused by the reforms would add to financial . pressures and put patient safety at risk .", "summary": " letter to david cameron says unnecessary reorganisation could leave the poorest and most vulnerable to bear the brunt .
