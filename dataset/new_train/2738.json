{"text": "a professional rugby league player has been jailed for two years for a drunken assault in sydney , amid national soul-searching over the prevalence of alcohol-fueled violence in australian society . russell packer , a former new zealand representative who plays for the newcastle knights in australia 's national rugby league , attacked the victim during a night out drinking in sydney 's cbd in november , stomping on the man 's face as he lay motionless . the severity of monday 's sentence apparently came as a surprise , with australia media reporting that packer 's lawyer , murugan thangaraj , told the judge that he had no idea jail time was being considered . packer 's long-time mentor , former player david lomax , speculated to fairfax media that the 24-year-old 's  harsh  sentence may have been a reaction to public concern over recent high-profile street assaults . the most recent victim , 18-year-old daniel christie , was critically injured after being punched in the face in sydney 's king cross nightlife district on new year 's eve . the assault , which left him in a coma with a fractured skull , occurred close to the spot where another 18-year-old , thomas kelly , was killed with a single punch in july 2012 . kelly 's death drew public attention to the potential damage wreaked by  king hits  -- a term widely used in australian media for single , devastating punches -- and prompted the new south wales state government to move to introduce a new  one punch  law , that will remove the legal requirement to prove assailants know a blow will kill in order to secure a conviction . the recent assault on christie has sparked calls from doctors , politicians and victims ' families for a concerted effort to tackle the problem of street violence , including an overhaul of australian society 's relationship with alcohol -- and its close association with sporting culture . prime minister tony abbott has weighed into the debate , urging police and the courts  to absolutely throw the book at people who perpetrate this kind of gratuitous , unprovoked violence  during an interview with an australian radio station . he said the trend reflected the  rise of the disturbed individual .  steve hambleton , the president of the australian medical association , told cnn that changing habits of alcohol consumption was essential to tackling street violence .  australia seriously needs to think about its culture , that alcohol is connected next to nearly every gathering that occurs ,  he said .  you would be forgiven for thinking you ca n't be successful in life , you ca n't be successful with the opposite sex , you ca n't be a successful sportsperson unless you drink .  he said the current regime for the responsible service of alcohol had  failed ,  with  too many intoxicated people being served alcohol .  potential solutions included introducing early closing times , restricting the number of alcohol licenses and implementing  no re-entry  policies in hotspots for violence , as well examining the relationship between alcohol and sport .  all our youth are exposed to enormous amounts of alcohol advertising through sport ,  he said . the acting leader of the australian greens , richard di natale , called for a senate inquiry into the promotion and advertising of alcohol .  we need to have a close look at how the promotion of alcohol is contributing to a culture of drinking in this country that is unhealthy and dangerous ,  said di natale , a former drug and alcohol clinician .  perversely linking healthy pursuits like cricket and football with alcohol through sponsorship and alcohol advertising is the dark side of australian sport .  christie 's family said even the widespread term  king hit  should be abandoned .  we do n't agree with the popular term ` king hit , '  read a statement from the family .  we have heard it referred to as a coward punch , which seems more appropriate .  new south wales police minister michael gallacher said there was  no silver bullet for alcohol-fueled violence ,  but that initiatives rolled out in recent years had seen assaults in kings cross drop 33 % last summer .  we will continue to work with nsw police to curb alcohol-related violence , but individuals also need to take responsibility for their actions ,  he said . packer has launched an appeal of his sentence , which will be heard on february 11 . his lawyer , thangaraj , did not return calls to cnn . another national rugby league player , reni maitua , is currently facing assault charges after a night out in kings cross in november .", "summary": " rugby league player russell packer was jailed for a late night assault in sydney .   his mentor believes the  harsh  sentence reflects public concern over drunken street violence .   an 18-year-old is in a coma after being punched in sydney on new year 's eye .   many public figures are calling for an overhaul of australia 's relationship with alcohol .
