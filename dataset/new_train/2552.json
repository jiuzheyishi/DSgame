' one woman said she was stuck at home with an injury and had nothing to do , so she would go look for him . and even when we found him , we met someone who was out looking for him ,  she told hln . while not a heavy reddit user before now -lrb- below describes herself as more of a  lurker  -rrb- , she said that the site is an incredible tool for gathering information and that she uses it daily to keep an eye on what 's going on in the world .  it curates the entire internet for you ,  she told hln .  and thanks to it , i found my dog .
