' an outraged shopper at filipino supermarket chain sm supermalls spotted this violent t-shirt and posted a picture onto their facebook page earlier this week . the photo soon went viral and within 48 hours the stores had removed every top . ` sm - the same mall that has the daily angelus and refused to show tim burton 's  sweeney todd  in the cinemas ? ` boys listen to tita karen -- if a girl says no and pushes you away , just err on the side of caution , she likely means no . and go watch  sweeney todd .  she continued : ' i count myself among those worked really hard especially in the 90 's for the rights of girls and women so it really got me upset . ' i was shaking when i took it . i wanted to throw up . ' since the photo was posted on september 22 , it has now received 1,578 likes , 4,383 shares and 440 comments . one user wrote : ' i just got out of bed to go to the bathroom but this one now woke me up . i do n't even know what exactly to say -- this is just so wrong . ' another said : ` sm has all the resources in the world . they need to hire better people so this never happens again and they really need to make up for this now . ' a big company has an even bigger social responsibility to control what goes through their stores .
