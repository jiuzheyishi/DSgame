{"text": "honeymooners and international hotel owners are at the center of an acrimonious showdown over religion between the government and opposition parties in the popular luxury tourist destination of the maldives . the tourism ministry last week banned the use of spas across the country , sparking a fiery debate over islam 's role in the governing of the island nation . the nation 's pristine beaches and rich marine wildlife drew nearly 800,000 tourists in 2010 . the move has prompted confusion , legal action and civil disobedience in the indian ocean nation , which has a population of about 350,000 .  the government has ordered all the spas in the islands to shut down ,  said mohamed rashad , the manager of royal island hotel and aaramu spa in the maldives . but the hotel industry  is not going for that ,  he said .  we are open today and never closed , and the other hotels are keeping their spas open as far as i know .  the standoff over tourists ' rights to have massages and skin treatments at the high-end resorts , many of which charge thousands of dollars for a night 's accommodation , came following calls from opposition groups for a stricter imposition of islamic values in the muslim country . the opposition 's demands conflict with the more liberal stance of president mohamed nasheed , who has urged the country to stick what he describes as the more  tolerant  strain of islam that it has practiced for hundreds of years . the situation came to a head after opposition groups staged a demonstration on december 23 in which they advocated , among other things , for a crackdown on massage parlors in the capital , male , and other more densely populated areas . rather than ignore the demands , the government raised the stakes last week by issuing an order to close all massage parlors and spas across the country 's nearly 1,200 islands . the opposition groups had not sought such a blanket ban of spa activities , said mohamed shaheem , a spokesman for adhaalath party , which participated in the rally .  we respect tourists ,  he said .  we are very happy with the tourism industry in the maldives .  in a statement , the president 's office suggested that the broader ban was an effort to highlight contradictions in the positions of some opposition figures .  ironically , the same opposition leaders who railed against spas and the selling of alcohol and pork to tourists are some of the country 's biggest resort owners ,  the statement said . opposition leaders involved in the tourism industry include qasim ibrahim , the founder and chairman of villa group , which owns five resorts in the maldives . ibrahim is also the head of jumhooree party , which participated in the december 23 rally . repeated efforts on monday to reach qasim were not successful . the hotel industry reacted to the ban by seeking a temporary court injunction and by holding talks with the government to try to get the spa services at major hotels excluded from the order , said rashad of royal island hotel .  this was done for political purposes ,  he said .  nobody has come out to check on us or to carry out inspections .  for its part , the government has suggested that it is willing to compromise with the big operators .  several have raised concerns over our decision ,  mariyam zulfa , the tourism minister , was quoted as saying over the weekend by the local news service haveeru .  we are considering allowing resorts to operate spas .  cnn 's brian walker contributed to this report .", "summary": " the government bans massage parlors and spas across the island nation .   the hotel industry takes legal action to try to get an injunction against the ban .   the move is the result of a political fight over the role of islam in running the country .   one resort says the hotel industry is ignoring the ban .
