{"text": "a jury on saturday night convicted a florida man on four charges related to his shooting into an suv full of teenagers during an argument over loud music , but could not decide on the most serious charge -- murder . michael dunn was found guilty on four charges , including three for attempted second-degree murder , which could land him behind bars for decades . yet there was no verdict on the first-degree murder charge tied to the death of 17-year-old jordan davis . as the jury 's decisions became clear about 7 p.m. saturday , dunn looked ahead solemnly with a frown but no tears . his lawyer , cory strolla , told reporters later that his client was  in disbelief .   even as he sat next to me , he asked , how is this happening ,  strolla said .  ... it has not set in . i do n't think it will set in anytime soon .  the incomplete finale to this emotional , hot-button trial -- partly because of the fact dunn is white and the teenagers who were shot at , including davis , are black -- echoed george zimmerman 's trial for the killing of 17-year-old trayvon martin about 120 miles down the road in sanford , florida . while stand your ground was n't used by dunn , his lawyers did argue that he fired in self-defense . given the partially hung jury , state attorney angela corey said prosecutors would press for a new trial in duval county on the murder charge .  justice for jordan davis is as important as it is for any victim ,  said corey , whose office also handled the zimmerman case . even without a final decision on the murder count -- and pending defense appeals -- the 47-year-old dunn is looking at a lengthy prison term . prosecutor erin wolfson explained saturday night that each attempted second-degree murder conviction carries a minimum sentence of at least 20 years . there 's also a 15-year sentence possible on the conviction for shooting in the teenager 's vehicle .  you are looking at basically at life in prison ,  strolla said , even as he vowed to challenge the convictions .  at 47 years old , that 's a life sentence regardless of count one .  the decision to convict on these counts , and not on murder , did n't come easily for a jury that had deliberated for about 30 hours since getting the case late wednesday . judge russell healey acknowledged earlier saturday that the jury of four white women , two black women , four white men , an asian woman and a hispanic man was  struggling , obviously .   but it 's not for want of trying to reconcile all of this ,  he said then .  i think we 've got some analytical people in there who are trying to do just that -- trying to analyze this from every possible angle .  the lack of a murder conviction upset some , including protesters who marched outside the jacksonville courthouse calling for corey to lose her job .  the people united will never be defeated ,  they also chanted . yet davis ' mother , lucia mcbath , did n't express any anger when she addressed reporters saturday night . her family , she said , is  so very happy to have just a little bit of closure .   it 's sad for mr. dunn that he will live the rest of his life in that sense of torment , and i will pray for him ,  mcbath said .  and i 've asked my family to pray for him .  confrontation at a gas station . it was november 23 , 2012 , when michael dunn pulled into a gas station in jacksonville , parking next to a red dodge durango full of teenagers . the teens had pulled in for gum and cigarettes ; dunn , meanwhile , had just left his son 's wedding with his fiancee , who 'd gone inside the convenience store for wine and chips . dunn did n't like the loud music --  rap crap ,  as he called it -- coming from the teens ' suv . so he asked them to turn it down . what followed next depends on whom you believe . dunn claimed davis threatened him , and he decided to take matter into his own hands upon seeing what he thought was the barrel of a gun sticking out of the durango . but prosecutors asserted that it was dunn who lost control , firing three volleys of shots -- 10 bullets total -- at the suv over music he did n't like . prosecutors challenged what he did next : he left the gas station and drove 40 miles away to a bed and breakfast in st. augustine . there , dunn walked his dog , ordered a pizza , then drank rum and cola --  stunned and horrified , -lrb- shocked how -rrb- things escalated the way they did over a common courtesy .  after learning almost six hours later that he had killed davis , dunn testified that he became  crazy with grief ,  experiencing stomach problems for about four hours before taking a nap .  my intent was to stop the attack , not necessarily end a life ,  he testified .  it just worked out that way .  yet his fiancee , rhonda rouer , testified that dunn had never mentioned any weapon to her -- be it a shotgun , a stick , a barrel or a lead pipe -- unlike what dunn had said . in fact , police found a basketball , basketball shoes , clothing , a camera tripod and cups inside the teenagers ' durango , but no gun . and dunn himself never called police . the first contacts he had with them were at his home in satellite beach -- 130 miles south of st. augustine -- as he was being apprehended . arguing that he was n't in a rational state of mind , dunn admitted ,  it makes sense that i should have -lrb- contacted authorities -rrb- . we did n't . i ca n't tell you why .  echoes of trayvon martin and george zimmerman . some were quick to compare dunn to george zimmerman , who ultimately was acquitted of murder for the shooting of martin . martin 's own parents were among them , claiming davis ' killing is another reminder that , in florida ,  racial profiling and stereotypes  may serve as the basis for illegitimate fear  and the shooting and killing of young teenagers .  but dunn 's defense attorney , strolla , told cnn 's chris cuomo on friday that the zimmerman and dunn cases are n't so similar . there was a physical confrontation between zimmerman and martin , and police gave zimmerman the benefit of the doubt about defending himself , strolla said .  my client did not wait to become that victim ,  he said .  my client did not wait to either get assaulted by a weapon or have someone potentially pull a trigger ,  he said . though a weapon was never found , strolla maintains the youths could have had one and somehow ditched in and around the gas station . regardless , the key point was that dunn believed they were armed and that his life was in danger .  now , does it sound irrational ? of course it sounds irrational . but have you ever been in that situation ?  the lawyer asked . after saturday 's night decision , it seems unlikely -- unless he wins on appeal -- that dunn will ever be in that or many other situations again . instead , spending the rest of his life in prison seems a more likely outcome . strolla said on saturday the four convictions leave him with regret , even as he said he could n't immediately think of anything he 'd do differently in the case . at the same time , the prosecution did n't manage a conviction on what was by far the biggest charge : first-degree murder . this mixed bag means that no one can fully celebrate the jury 's decision .  everybody lost something in this ,  the lawyer said . his client  will live to fight another day  in court , but he and his loved ones are suffering now . strolla acknowledged , too , the pain felt by davis ' family . especially on sunday , which would have been davis ' 19th birthday .", "summary": "  you are looking at basically at life in prison ,  dunn 's lawyer says .   dunn is convicted on three counts of attempted second-degree murder .   but there 's a mistrial on first-degree murder ; prosecutors say they 'll seek a new trial .   the teen killed , jordan davis , would have celebrated his 19th birthday sunday .
