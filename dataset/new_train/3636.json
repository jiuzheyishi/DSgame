' work in the front garden of their home started earlier this year after mr kindred bought the former pub seven years ago . the couple reassured planning bosses they would not live in the annexe or rent it out and offered to remove the chimney and porch , but were told to appeal the order . mrs kindred said : ` this is very upsetting because we thought we were doing the right thing by improving the old barn , which was in a dangerous condition . we are not overlooked by anybody , nobody has complained . ` they are quibbling over 20 centimetres . and how can a chimney and porch be harmful to the countryside ? ' the couple transformed a decaying old barn in the garden of their home in hurst , berkshire , into a luxury building with offices , a gym and three guest bedrooms . wokingham borough council slapped an enforcement notice on the couple in july , which gave them two months to comply or face legal action . in a hand-delivered letter , clare lawrence , head of the council 's development management team , said the building was in an unsuitable location outside of settlement limits , in an area designated as countryside . cllr john kaiser , executive member for highways and planning , said : ` this is n't the case that the owners of fox and hounds cottage have built a building that 's 20cm to large as claimed -- it 's a much bigger issue than that and one that we have to tackle as part of our duty as the local planning authority . quite simply , the owners have built a house in the countryside that they do n't have permission for . ` and this is not acceptable . i hope this sends a clear message that we will take action against people who flout planning laws . ' i would urge anyone who suspects someone of carrying out major work without planning permission to get in touch with the council and we will investigate . ' the couple have now appealed to the planning inspectorate and will not know the final decision until next year .", "summary": " stephen and mary kindred transformed old barn into a luxury building with offices , a gym and three guest bedrooms .   they say planning bosses at wokingham borough council have told them to rip it down because it is 20cm too wide .   the couple claim they were also told that the chimney and porch on the annexe were ` harmful to the countryside '   council slapped an enforcement notice on pair in july , which gave them two months to comply or face legal action .   the couple have now appealed to the planning inspectorate and will not know the final decision until next year .
