{"text": "he was nicknamed mad jack by his men during the second world war . after coming face to face with lieutenant colonel john churchill , the germans probably had a similar , if less affectionate , moniker for the eccentric officer . rather than wield a sub-machine gun in battle , the commando leader inspired his comrades by storming beaches armed with a bow and arrow and two-handed sword , dressed in a kilt and playing a set of bagpipes . brave : lieutenant colonel john ` mad jack ' churchill believed ` any officer who goes into action without his sword is improperly armed ' he enhanced his reputation by capturing 42 german prisoners with only his broadsword and later escaping from one of the most daunting nazi jails before the end of the war . the colourful officer 's bravery -- he is the only soldier in the war credited with killing enemy troops with arrows -- earned him a chestful of gallantry medals , including two distinguished service orders and a military cross . but even though his career was one of the most remarkable in the history of the army , his story is not widely known . now the heroism of lt col churchill , who died in 1996 aged 89 , has been recovered by researchers at family history website findmypast.co.uk . his story has been put together from reports in local newspapers which have been placed online for the first time . hot shot : jack churchill represented britain at the 1939 world archery championships -lrb- pictured -rrb- . born in surrey in 1906 , he was educated on the isle of man and at the royal military academy at sandhurst . he joined the 2nd battalion the manchester regiment in 1926 . he later left the army to become a professional bagpipe player and appeared in films . he was also a highly skilled bowman , representing britain in the world archery championships in 1939 . at the outbreak of war he was recalled to the army . carrying an english longbow and american indian arrows on to the battlefield , lt col churchill 's fearlessness under fire became his hallmark . he often said that ` any officer who goes into action without his sword is improperly armed ' . an account in the dundee evening telegraph from may 1945 described his deadly attack against germans hiding in bushes during the retreat to dunkirk five years earlier . ` he was on patrol when some germans were detected in a thicket about 200 yards away , ' said the report . ` he shot two arrows into the thicket . there were some strange noises and no answering fire . ' he was also in the thick of the action with his bagpipes while leading 2 commando through sicily , to messina and the landings at salerno , italy . mad jack escaped the sagan prison before being captured again and sent to sachsenhausen concentration camp , in germany -lrb- pictured -rrb- . alongside a corporal named ruffell , he took 42 german prisoners and captured a mortar post using only his sword , taking one guard as a human shield and then creeping between sentry posts and forcing the soldiers to surrender . mad jack was finally captured in an attack on the island of brac , off the then yugoslavia , when , as bombs exploded around him , he continued to play his bagpipes until he was knocked unconscious . he later escaped from the sagan prison but was recaptured and interned in the sachsenhausen concentration camp until being released by the german army . debra chatfield , a family historian from findmypast.co.uk , said : ` his story is amazing .
