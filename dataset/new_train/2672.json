{"text": "the evolving life , face and story of aesha , disfigured by the taliban and featured on the august 2010 cover of time magazine , has captivated audiences around the world . cnn has been following her for close to two years and , earlier this week , updated readers on how she is doing both physically and emotionally . we shared exclusive photographs of what she looked like before her latest surgery . monday 's procedure , the fourth in a series to reconstruct her nose , lasted about 9Ã‚ 1/2 hours and went smoothly , said mati arsala , who 's become a father figure to aesha mohammadzai . doctors at walter reed national military medical center in bethesda , maryland , where she 's being treated , will not discuss her case . the reactions to the latest story about aesha poured in -- both in the story 's comments section and by way of e-mail -- even as the world 's eyes remained trained on friday 's mass shooting at sandy hook elementary school in connecticut .  this girl has more courage than all the fanatics that hurt her will ever have ,  wrote akmac61 .  aesha you are a beautiful woman , wishing you the best ! a whole new great life is ahead just for you , better things are coming ,  said tr0j4n .  i am speechless , no words can express the depth of my feeling for this beautiful lady . i salute your courage in the face of illiteracy and extremism ,  added prosncons . some readers wrote with special offerings for aesha and the family caring for her . an e-learning company in canada wants to help with her education . the owner of a bed and breakfast in west virginia would like to treat them to a weekend getaway . a woman in texas encouraged aesha to open a web-store , perhaps on etsy , to sell her jewelry . many others wrote with promises of prayers and extensions of love . as is so often the case when cnn mentions afghanistan or simply the muslim world , there were inevitably readers who took this opportunity to attack that faith . but more readers pushed back , perhaps hinting at decreased tolerance for such prejudices . there was also a fresh perspective brought on by the tragedy in newtown , connecticut .  i guess in the taliban , everybody with a twisted opinion gets to play god ,  wrote onaturalia .  and unfortunately some in the us ,  responded are122 .  exactly , and they are not all muslims ,  said rollins . further down in the comments , tina mantooth added ,  i agree 100 % . islam does n't teach hate .   then why do muslims do so many inhumane things ?  asked swarm4 .  was adam lanza a muslim ? no ,  answered elhaba wackadoodle .  inhumane things are inherent in all humans . some just act on them while the rest of us do n't .  some , who wrote to me directly , shared that the story about aesha was a salve for the sadness that had befallen the country .  it was especially nice to read after the horrors of newtown ,  wrote one person .  it did my soul some good to read such a hopeful story and to learn about the arsalas ' kindness and good will at a time like this , when everything seems pretty dark in the u.s. ,  wrote another .  in a time filled with tragedy and sorrow , thank you for an uplifting and positive article ,  wrote a third . a couple of readers seemed bent on offending aesha , those who care for her and pretty much everyone else , by making comments directed at her looks -- as if she had any control over them . but plenty of readers stood up for her , including lxnay , who wrote ,  she will be beautiful again . the surgery will repair her mutilations , but nothing can repair the ugliness displayed by some posters here . stupid ca n't be fixed .  some readers wondered why the country would help her instead of others .  who is paying for the surgery ? do n't you think there are enough disfugured -lrb- sic -rrb- citizens in this country who needs -lrb- sic -rrb- more attention ?  asked jayjay . in response , iposteyeam wrote ,  you misspelled ' i need a heart implant . '  a handful of readers latched onto information in the story about how jamila rasouli-arsala , aesha 's mother figure and a former ob-gyn in germany , is struggling to find her way in america 's medical community . if she wants to practice medicine here , she must start over in a residency program -- and so far she 's had no luck getting into one . if she ca n't , the whole family , aesha included , may end up moving to germany .  concerning jamila 's plight , one has to ask what is going on in the u.s. concerning attracting and keeping good doctors ,  wrote bob .  from what i am hearing , the u.s. does n't sound like a land of opportunity but instead a country representing endless bureaucratic roadblocks , dogma and special interests .  answered fbreen :  until there is an international standard for medical education and training , i am happy that such requirements exist .  there were lessons that readers from across the globe took away from the piece . a reader in poland , who previously had not felt connected to aesha 's story , wrote ,  it is the right thing to shout it to the world , to make clear there is no acceptance to barbarism and abuse .  added a writer from nigeria :  am very happy the way you americans are helping people all over the world .  and then there was this one , from a young woman who saw in aesha 's story something she knows too well .  this is anika from miles away , bangladesh . i read your story on aesha early this morning on the cnn website and it overwhelmed me with emotions i usually try to bury . i am 22 too like her and part of a society that may not bruise my body but wounds my soul and self confidence everyday . stories like aesha 's inspire us , girls , struggling to live a normal and deserved life .  whether she knows it or not , whether she means to or not , aesha is making a difference .", "summary": " aesha 's face and story have captivated readers across the world .   readers speak of her beauty , her bravery and how she 's inspired them .   her story offers uplifting message amid sadness of connecticut shootings .
