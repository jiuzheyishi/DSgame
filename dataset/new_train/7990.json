{"text": "human rights lawyers have threatened doctors who have removed asylum seekers from surgery lists . gps are being warned that they face legal action if they refuse to accept illegal immigrants as patients . human rights lawyers have been threatening doctors who have removed failed asylum seekers from their surgery lists -- even though they are not entitled to free nhs care . meanwhile , figures reveal that foreigners , including tourists and migrants , have been given an estimated # 40million of free nhs treatment in the past three years . anyone who does normally live in the uk -- including tourists -- is meant to pay for any nhs treatment they receive . the only exceptions are urgent care received in a&e departments or treatment for certain infectious diseases such as tuberculosis . refugees and asylum seekers are given free nhs treatment , but if their application to remain in the uk is turned down by the home office they lose the entitlement . but government guidelines on when to provide free healthcare are vague and simply advise gps to ` use their discretion ' . figures obtained by pulse magazine show that some hospitals are managing to claw back only a quarter of the costs owed to them by so-called health tourists . its investigation also revealed that one surgery in essex had been ordered to reinstate two failed asylum seekers from nigeria after being threatened with legal action by human rights solicitors . doctors had removed the couple after their asylum application had been turned down by the home office . but they subsequently received a letter from bristol-based law firm pierce glynn threatening legal action unless they were reinstated , and they have now been put back on the books . the manager of the surgery said that they were urged by their local primary care trust to reinstate the patients . the unnamed member of staff said : ` someone at the pct read the letter and panicked . ` hospital trusts must put in place arrangements that ensure people can not exploit the system . ' ` do we just register everyone who is illegal ? ' another practice in leeds was also told not to remove illegal immigrants in the face of similar threats . tory mp chris skidmore , who sits on the health select committee , accused lawyers of ` piggy backing ' on the nhs . he said : ` gps are under enough pressure . they should not be made to feel accountable for not registering people who have no legal right to treatment . ` i fear this is only the tip of the iceberg . in many cases , staff may not be asking people 's nationality as it is beyond the hospital or clinic to recover the costs of treatment . refugees and asylum seekers are given . free nhs treatment , but if their application to remain in the uk is . turned down by the home office they lose the entitlement . ` given that nhs resources are going to be stretched , these are savings which should be made .

' the investigation obtained data from 35 hospital trusts in england showing that on average they had debts of # 230,000 owed by foreigners since 2009 . if that figure is replicated across all 168 hospital trusts in the country , then the nhs would collectively be owed # 40million from health tourists . this included st george 's healthcare trust in london , which had recovered only # 1.5 million from the # 3.5 million owed . another trust , royal wolverhampton in the west midlands , had managed to recover only 24 per cent of the # 419,000 owed by foreign nationals . health minister simon burns said : ` we wo n't tolerate abuse of our national health service . the nhs has a duty to anyone whose life or long-term health is at immediate risk , but it is not there to serve the health needs of the globe .
