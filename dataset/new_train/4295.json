{"text": "u.s. intelligence officials are leaning toward the theory that  those in the cockpit  -- the pilots of malaysia airlines flight 370 -- were responsible for the mysterious disappearance of the commercial jetliner , a u.s. official with direct knowledge of the latest thinking told cnn on saturday . the revelation followed news that malaysian authorities searched the home of the lead pilot , a move that came the same day that prime minister najib razak told reporters the plane veered off course due to apparent deliberate action taken by somebody on board . the malaysian government had been looking for a reason to search the home of the pilot and the co-pilot for several days . but it was only in the last 24 to 36 hours , when radar and satellite data came to light , that authorities believed they had sufficient reason to go through the residences , according to the u.s. official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .  the malaysians do n't do this lightly ,  the official said . it 's not clear whether the malaysian government believes one or both the men could be responsible for what happened when the boeing 777-200 er disappeared march 8 en route from kuala lumpur to beijing . what we know about the cockpit crew . the official emphasized no final conclusions have been drawn and all the internal intelligence discussions are based on preliminary assessments of what is known to date . other scenarios could still emerge . the notion of a hijacking has not been ruled out , the official said . a source close to the investigation told cnn that malaysian police had searched the home of pilot zaharie ahmad shah , 53 . shah lives in an upscale gated community in shah alam , outside malaysia 's capital of kuala lumpur . two vans were loaded with small bags , similar to shopping bags , at the home of the co-pilot , 27-year-old farq ab hamid , according to a cnn crew who observed activities at the residence . it was unclear whether the bags were taken from the home , and police made no comment about their activities there . najib made clear in a press conference that in light of the latest developments , authorities have refocused their investigation to the crew and passengers on board . undoubtedly , they will scour through the flight manifest and look further to see whether any of the passengers on board had flight training or connections to terror groups . a senior u.s. law enforcement official told cnn that investigators are carefully reviewing the information so far collected on the pilots to determine whether there is something to indicate a plan or a motive . that would seem supported by preliminary u.s. intelligence reports , which the u.s. official said show the jetliner was in some form of controlled flight at a relatively stable altitude and path when it changed course and flew toward the indian ocean . it is presumed by u.s. officials to have crashed , perhaps after running out of fuel . ` someone acting deliberately ' the first clue that perhaps one or both of the pilots were involved stem from when the plane made a sharp , deliberate turn from where it last communicated with kuala lumpur air traffic controllers , and before it would have to communicate with vietnamese controllers , according to the u.s. official with knowledge of the latest intelligence thinking .  this is the perfect place to start to disappear ,  the official said . military radar showed the jetliner flew in a westerly direction back over the malaysian peninsula , najib said . it is then believed to have either turned northwest toward the bay of bengal or southwest elsewhere in the indian ocean , he said .  evidence is consistent with someone acting deliberately from inside the plane ,  the prime minister said , officially confirming the plane 's disappearance was not caused by an accident .  ... despite media reports that the plane was hijacked , we are investigating all major possibilities on what caused mh370 to deviate .  the focus of the search is now in the southern indian ocean .  the southern scenario seems more plausible ,  the official said . meanwhile , according to najib , new satellite information leads authorities to be fairly certain that someone disabled the aircraft communications addressing and reporting system , or acars , just before the aircraft reached the east coast of peninsular malaysia .  shortly afterward , near the border between malaysian and vietnamese air traffic control ,  najib said ,  the aircraft 's transponder was switched off .  acars is the system that routinely transmits information like turbulence and fuel load back to the airline . a transponder is a system controlled from the cockpit that transmits data about the plane via radio signals to air traffic controllers . it combines with ground radar to provide air traffic controllers with details about the plane , including its identification , speed , position and altitude . the last voice communication from the cockpit a week ago were these words :  all right , good night .  they were uttered at the vietnam air traffic control border at about the same time the transponder was shut off , najib said . that suggests the incident on the plane began sooner than initially thought . but some have questioned the prime minister 's account , given the dearth of information available . malaysia investigation criticized . in the days since the flight disappeared , the malaysian government has been under intense scrutiny for its handling of the investigation . the government has been criticized by some u.s. officials for not sharing information or accepting more offers of help . shortly after najib delivered his remarks , china demanded malaysia provide more information on the investigation . of the 239 people aboard flight 370 , 154 were chinese .  today is the 8th day of the missing mh370 , and the plane is still yet to be found ,  said a statement from the foreign ministry .  time is life .  the criticism was more pointed in an editorial published by china 's state-run news agency xinhua .  and due to the absence -- or at least lack -- of timely authoritative information , massive efforts have been squandered , and numerous rumors have been spawned , repeatedly racking the nerves of the awaiting families ,  the editorial said . malaysian authorities have been highly sensitive to any suggestion they ca n't handle the investigation , said the u.s. law enforcement official , who also spoke on condition of anonymity . it took several days last week to calm their anger over inaccurate reports that the fbi had dispatched a team to investigate , the official said . malaysia airlines defended its actions , saying there has never been a case where information gleaned from satellite signals alone could potentially be used to find the location of a missing airliner .  given the nature of the situation and its extreme sensitivity , it was critical that the raw satellite signals were verified and analyzed by the relevant authorities so that their significance could be properly understood ,  the airline said in a statement .  this naturally took some time , during which we were unable to publicly confirm their existence .  transcript : malaysian prime minister 's statement on flight 370 . kazakhstan to indian ocean . as the focus of the investigation shifted , so , too , has the focus of the search . information from international and malaysian officials indicate that the jet may have flown for more than seven hours after the last contact with the pilots . flight 370 took off from kuala lumpur at 12:41 a.m. on march 8 . the last satellite communication from the plane occurred at 8:11 a.m. , najib said , well past the scheduled arrival time in beijing . that last communication , najib said , was in one of two possible traffic corridors shown on a map released to the press . a northern arc stretches from the border of kazakhstan and turkmenistan to northern thailand , and a southern arc spans from indonesia to the southern indian ocean .  due to the type of satellite data , we are unable to confirm the precise location of the plane when it last made contact with the satellite ,  najib said . because the northern parts of the traffic corridor include some tightly guarded airspace over india , pakistan , and even some u.s. installations in afghanistan , u.s. authorities believe it more likely the aircraft crashed into waters outside of the reach of radar south of india , a u.s. official told cnn . if it had flown farther north , it 's likely it would have been detected by radar . nonetheless for the last 36 hours , the u.s. military and intelligence community has been reviewing all satellite imagery and electronic data it collects from the region for any sign of an explosion or crash , according to another u.s. official directly familiar with that effort . najib said authorities were ending search operations in the south china sea and reassessing the deployment of assets .  this new satellite information has a significant impact on the nature and scope of the search operation ,  he said . investigators , he said , have confirmed by looking at the raw satellite data that the plane in question was the malaysia airlines jet . the same conclusion was reached by the u.s. federal aviation administration , the u.s. national transportation safety board , the british air accidents investigation branch and the malaysian authorities , all of whom were working separately with the same data , he said . families hold onto hope . for the families and loved ones of those aboard flight 370 , saturday was day 8 of anguish . some found comfort that there is no evidence the plane made impact . the father of one passenger watched najib 's news conference at a beijing hotel . he said he hoped the plane was hijacked because that gave him reason to think his son was alive .  i hope they are alive , no matter how small the chance is ,  he said . the search that began last weekend now involves 14 countries , 43 ships and 58 aircraft , najib said , and that the relevant foreign embassies have been given access to the new information . china is sending technical experts to join the investigation , and two chinese search vessels headed for the strait of malacca , according to xinhua . plane was taking ` strange path ' hours before najib 's announcement , u.s. officials told cnn the flight had made drastic changes in altitude and direction after disappearing from civilian radar . malaysian military radar showed the plane climbing to 45,000 feet -- which is above its approved altitude limit -- soon after disappearing from civilian radar screens and then dropping to 23,000 feet before climbing again , a u.s. official familiar with the investigation said . the jetliner was flying  a strange path ,  the official said on condition of anonymity . the details of the radar readings were first reported by the new york times on friday .", "summary": " area between malaysia and vietnam  perfect place to start to disappear ,  official says .   investigators have renewed their focus on the pilots , a law enforcement official says .   malaysia 's government wanted a reason to search the pilots ' homes , the official says .   police search homes of pilot and co-pilot .
