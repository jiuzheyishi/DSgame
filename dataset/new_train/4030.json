{"text": "north koreans ' ability to surf the internet -- for the few in the isolated nation who could ever really go online anyway -- is rockier than ever . dyn research reported on monday that the country 's internet was down , after 24 hours of  increasing instability .  it stayed dead for more than nine hours , then came back to life -- but not for long . half a day later dyn said it was down again . then it was back up , at about 1 a.m. wednesday pyongyang time -lrb- 11 a.m. tuesday et -rrb- , the company said . but the assessment of dyn , a company that monitors internet performance worldwide , made earlier tuesday , did not change :  north korea continues its struggles to stay online .  the timing of north korea 's latest internet issues makes them significant . they come days after the u.s. government blamed pyongyang for being behind the hacking of sony pictures over that company 's production of  the interview  -- a comedy depicting the assassination of north korean leader kim jong un -- as well as threats against anyone who dared watch the movie . north korea denied any responsibility , even as it blamed the u.s. government for being behind the making of the seth rogen-james franco film . its totalitarian government went on to officially make its own threat , warning the united states that its  citadels  will be attacked , dwarfing the hacking attack on sony . pyongyang has n't leveled any blame or threats about its latest internet outage . but experts are skeptical that the american government had any involvement . that 's almost irrelevant , said mike chinoy , a frequent traveler to north korea and former cnn correspondent .  the issue ... is not whether it was or it was n't -lrb- the united states that knocked out north korea 's internet -rrb- . the issue is what the north koreans think it was ,  said chinoy , a u.s.-china institute senior fellow .  and i think it 's safe to assume -- unless they themselves took their system offline for their own security , which is not impossible -- they 'll be looking to respond .  cyber conflict with north korea is ` dangerous uncharted territory ' expert : could be ' a 15-year-old in a guy fawkes mask ' so who is behind north korea 's internet problems ? unlike the sony cyberattack and threats , which were linked to a group called  guardians of peace ,  the latest issues have n't been tied to any group or government . it 's possible they have nothing to do with the sony dust-up and are simply an internal matter . another possibility : north korea 's internet traffic is routed through china , so issues or officials there may be to blame . another option : it could be a deliberate move by the country 's own government .  north korea may have disconnected themselves , either preemptively to prevent that movie from being distributed , but also , probably more likely , in a defensive posture ,  said shawn henry , a cybersecurity expert and former executive assistant director of the fbi . talking when north korea 's internet was totally down , dyn research 's doug madory said  usually there are isolated blips  anyway in the country 's service . but he thinks what happened here was different .  i would n't be surprised if they are absorbing some sort of attack ,  madory said . u.s. state department spokeswoman marie harf deflected a question about the disruption .  we are n't going to discuss -- you know -- publicly , operational details about the possible response options or comment on those kind of reports in any way , except to say that as we implement our responses , some will be seen , some may not be seen ,  she said . no one is saying the u.s. government could n't have carried out such an attack . but tech experts say it might not have needed to , given the ability of anyone , anywhere to do something like this . what happened with sony , especially the studio 's decision to shelve -- at least temporarily -- the release of  the interview ,  got a lot of people upset . matthew prince , president of the performance and security company cloudflare , told cnn he could n't say definitively that there was an attack at all . but if there was , he said it 's possible a lone individual , not an entire government , was behind it .  if it is an attack , it 's highly unlikely it 's the united states . more likely it 's a 15-year-old in a guy fawkes mask ,  said prince , tying the prospective attackers to those connected to or inspired by the hacktivist movement anonymous . limited technology , but not when it comes to hacking . do these outages equal outrage , leaving north koreans unable to view  gangnam style  for the 2-billionth-plus time ? have they been frustrated when they tried to check on the latest nba results for their fantasy teams or engage in heated debates about local , national and international politics ? no . there 's a reason the committee to protect journalists ranks north korea second on its list of  most censored countries .  only a smattering of  ruling elites  can go online freely , leaving the public limited to a  heavily monitored and censored -lrb- intranet -rrb- network with no connections to the outside world ,  according to the advocacy group . widespread computer technology overall is n't a reality in one of the world 's poorest and , according to many outsiders , most antiquated countries . a 2012 report from kisa , south korea 's internet development agency , noted north korea then had only 1,024 ip addresses -- unique numbers assigned to every device that logs on to the internet -- in a country of about 25 million people . that figure may not exactly reflect the current usage since , for example , people can use one ip address for several items , but it 's still paltry by any modern measure . the united states has more than 1.5 billion ip addresses . still , even if most north koreans are n't web-savvy by design , a dangerous handful of them may be . jang se-yul , who claims he worked as a computer expert for north korea 's government before defecting seven years ago , told cnn he thinks that pyongyang has 1,800 cyberwarriors stationed around the world . he says even the agents themselves do n't know how many others work for the secretive group -- called bureau 121 -- whose mission is to  conduct cyberattacks against overseas and enemy states .  an fbi investigation linked the malware , infrastructure and techniques used by the guardians of peace in the sony attack to previous north korean cyberattacks . after that , u.s. president barack obama called the hack  an act of cybervandalism that was very costly , very expensive ,  though he stopped sort of calling it an act of war . the next question is : will kim , in pyongyang , say the same about his country 's internet issues ?", "summary": " cybersecurity expert : north korea  may have disconnected themselves    research company says north korea 's internet goes back down , only to return .   monday 's web blackout lasted more than nine hours , according to dyn research .   web disruption came amid escalating war of words between the u.s. , north korea .
