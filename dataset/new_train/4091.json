{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- the u.s. ocean , atmospheric and space agencies affirmed on friday what the planet has been telling us every way it knows how : 2014 was the hottest year since record keeping began in 1880 . that means average land and sea temperatures , worldwide , have never been hotter in modern times , according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration -lrb- the gold standard for global climate data -rrb- and the national aeronautics and space administration -lrb- the guys who put a man on the moon -rrb- . this is n't about whether we believe in science : it 's about whether we believe the thermometer . in fact , the 16 hottest years on record have all occurred since 1997 , the new data confirm , contributing to widening deserts , rising seas , withering drought , ravaging storms , blistering heat and other climate change impacts reaching from the tiniest african village to our own backyards . here in the united states , arizona , nevada , alaska and california all wrapped up their hottest years on record . california remains mired in the grip of a three-year drought , its worst in centuries . the northeast is still rebuilding from hurricane sandy . and that was just one of the climate-related disasters that cost this country an estimated $ 139 billion in damages in 2012 alone . above and beyond the economic costs , climate change has created a widening humanitarian crisis noted by spiritual leaders around the world . for example , pope francis is expected to publish an encyclical on the state of the world 's environment , singling out climate change as an urgent challenge to global stewardship . it 's reported that he 'll call on people of all faiths to embrace our obligation to protect future generations from this grave and gathering scourge . president obama has embarked on the single greatest u.s. effort yet to combat this growing menace , by reducing the dangerous carbon pollution that 's driving climate chaos . he has directed the environmental protection agency to put in place the first limits on carbon pollution from the power plants that account for about 40 % of the u.s. carbon footprint . under the president 's clean power plan , we 'll cut carbon emissions from our power plants 26 % by 2020 and 30 % by 2030 . we can do better than that -- and we should . the president 's plan puts us on the right track . since last summer , epa officials have been hard at work , coordinating with their state counterparts , public service commissions , power companies and other vested stakeholders to come up with tailor-made plans to hit the targets in the most cost-effective way . some power companies are already well on their way , investing in efficiency so we can do more with less waste , getting more power from the wind and sun , cleaning up dirty power plants or some combination of the three . even as we , as a nation , begin to make progress , though , some coal , gas and oil companies and their allies on capitol hill want to turn us back around . republican leaders in the congress have pledged to lead legislative efforts meant to keep the epa from cutting carbon pollution . the republican leaders are n't offering answers of their own , mind you ; they just want to block any action that could help us address the problem of climate change . it 's part of the big polluter agenda they 've vowed to press , putting fossil fuel profits first -- and putting the rest of us at risk . we have a responsibility in this country to stand up and speak out for what matters most . that 's the essence of american democracy . it 's part of what makes us exceptional . it 's part of what makes us great . we just finished , worldwide , the hottest year on record . those are facts no amount of climate change denial can alter . we have a choice in this country . we can continue to feed climate disaster by anchoring our future in the fossil fuels of the past , or we can protect future generations from the ravages of climate change by investing in the clean energy solutions of tomorrow .", "summary": " 2014 was the hottest year since record keeping began in 1880 .   high temperatures have resulted in widening deserts , rising seas , droughts , ravaging storms , blistering heat .   while president obama is trying to tackle climate change , republicans are blocking meaningful actions .
