{"text": "vega , the second brightest star in the northern night sky , may have a family of planets similar to the sun 's , say scientists . astronomers have discovered evidence of an asteroid belt surrounding the star like the one that circles the sun . if confirmed , it means vega is likely to have a solar system containing rocky planets similar to earth or mars . this artist 's concept illustrates an asteroid belt around the bright star vega . evidence for this warm ring of debris was found using nasa 's spitzer space telescope , and the european space agency 's herschel space observatory . the discovery , presented at the . american astronomical society 's annual meeting in long beach , . california , was made using the herschel and spitzer space telescopes . detectors on the telescopes measured infrared light emitted by warm and cold bands of dust around the star . in our own system , the asteroid belt beyond the orbit of mars is maintained by the gravity of rocky planets and gas giants such as jupiter and saturn . scientists believe vega has an inner asteroid belt and outer belt of debris separated by a gap . the same pattern is seen around the sun . a distant band of rock and ice , called the kuiper belt , orbits the sun near the edge of the solar system . astronomer dr kate su , from the steward observatory at the arizona university in the us , said : ` our findings echo recent results showing multiple-planet systems are common beyond our sun . ' vega , known as the harp star , is the brightest star in the constellation lyra . it is relatively close at a distance of just 25 light years , and around 600 million years old - much younger than the sun . astronomers have discovered what appears to be a large asteroid belt around the bright star vega , as illustrated here at left in brown . the discovery , presented at the american astronomical society 's annual meeting in long beach , california , was made using the herschel and spitzer space telescopes . detectors on the telescopes measured infrared light emitted by warm and cold bands of dust around the star . scientists suspect hidden planets are sweeping the region between the bands free of dust . vega may have several undetected planets up to the size of jupiter , they believe . the limits of current planet detection techniques make it difficult to spot small rocky planets , or larger worlds in outlying orbits . similar bands of debris were found to surround another star , fomalhaut , which is known to have at least one candidate planet . ` overall , the large gap between the warm and the cold belts is a signpost that points to multiple planets likely orbiting vega and fomalhaut , ' said dr su .", "summary": " astronomers have discovered evidence of an asteroid belt surrounding the star like the one that circles the sun .   vega likely to have a solar system containing rocky planets similar to earth or mars .
