' judge john roberts said : ` you kept , to quote the prosecution 's words ,  under the radar  as the planner and director of operations . ` you commissioned the drug from the source while your son james travelled extensively in europe . ` you and he had , in reality , a working partnership of equals . i am satisfied you were both right at the top of the uk supply chain . ` you were also prepared to lend money to others to allow them to participate in the wicked trade of drug supply . ` what was contained in those tins of asparagus was cocaine of a staggeringly high purity . ` this case is so serious that only a very long sentence of imprisonment can be imposed given the nature of the offence and the breathtaking scale of it . ' he said kelly could be expected to serve half of whatever sentence he passed , though he warned kelly , of stanfordham drive , garston : ` whether you will actually be released will depend on your status at that time so far as a life sentence for murder is concerned . ` the sentence i pass upon you is one of 27 years imprisonment . that sentence will begin immediately .
