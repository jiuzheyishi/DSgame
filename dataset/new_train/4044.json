{"text": "kaci hickox , a nurse who worked with doctors without borders to treat ebola patients in sierra leone , was placed under mandatory quarantine in new jersey for three days even though she tested negative for ebola and is asymptomatic . after much protest , she was finally released on monday . in her opinion , her  basic human rights have been violated .  she appeared on cnn and criticized politicians ' reactions to ebola and the lack of forethought and plan . this newest quarantine has us wondering again how far the government can restrain individuals for the common good . no doubt , being physically confined by the government feels like a fundamental violation . but it 's rarely a legal violation . for over a hundred years , the supreme court and other tribunals have upheld the right of states to enact compulsory laws related to health care issues such as vaccination . the seminal case , jacobson v. massachusetts , recognized  manifold restraints to which every person is necessarily subject for the common good .  so how far does this power to regulate for the public health go ? consider the infamous 1927 case of buck v. bell -- a cautionary tale for all medical students -- in which the court upheld a state 's involuntary sterilization of  feebleminded  persons in state institutions . the court broadened state power drastically to allow forcing unwanted surgery on a female for the express purpose of neutering her . perhaps most shocking to modern sensibilities was the court 's use of the jacobson logic of contagious diseases . justice oliver wendell holmes stated in a judicial opinion that the  principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the fallopian tubes  to avoid further generations of  imbeciles .  yes . the supreme court actually said that . since then , the court has specifically recognized that the general health and welfare of the public may require adults be dealt with by compulsory treatment including quarantine , confinement or sequestration . along with many other cases echoing similar sentiments , little doubt remains about the matter . state governments have historically enjoyed nearly unfettered power to restrain our liberty in the name of public health . these cases were decided in times when crowded urban conditions , less-advanced medicine , and lack of public education required drastic measures to avoid the scourge of disease infection . but times have changed , and the collective views of citizens and governments today bear little resemblance to those of centuries past . thanks to the dizzying advances in medical sciences and education , the citizen-patient is more informed and empowered . of course , the unintended side effect of patient autonomy is overreaction . in researching rashes on webmd , a simple poison ivy may become the bubonic plague in the minds of some . while the internet unquestionably contributes to quicker and bigger waves of panic , make no mistake -- the connectivity of communication is a boon to , as well as bane of , public health . for example , most of us are aware on some level of the individual right to refuse medical treatment . and most of us have a general understanding of the right to privacy preventing undue interference with a woman 's  right to choose  abortion . the court cases that protect these liberties may leave the public with a strong and perhaps unrealistic impression about what constitute unassailable , bedrock  rights .  however , these are actually narrowly defined liberties that affect only one patient 's life -lrb- and , depending on your view of abortion , the life of a fetus -rrb- . by contrast , it appears little has changed in the jurisprudence of outbreaks and communicable diseases . the courts continue to recognize the government 's broad  police power  to legislate for its citizens ' health , safety and morals . but state authority is not without limit . states seeking to take your personal liberty with a quarantine must establish necessity , reasonable means , proportionality , and seek to avoid harm . what those concepts actually mean is surely a case-by-case analysis , because it 's impossible to know what 's reasonable until a medical expert tells us what 's reasonable . hickox 's allegation , for example , was that there was no intelligible plan , and therefore no reasonable tailoring of the government intrusion into her liberty . she may be right if the medical evidence supports her view . still , it 's an uphill battle for the nurse-as-plaintiff . it 's exceedingly difficult to sue state agencies to begin with . moreover , courts have upheld compulsory measures on numerous occasions involving vaccinations or quarantines , and even jailing those with serious cases of tuberculosis . ultimately , other than reproductive freedoms and end-of-life decisions , courts have not recognized a fundamental  freedom of the body .  what undoubtedly feels to hickox like a violation of  basic human rights  may not automatically be the same as the  fundamental rights  closely guarded and scrutinized by the supreme court . when it comes to infectious diseases , the collective jurisprudential message is as clear today as it was in centuries past : public health concerns can warrant the state 's intrusion on personal freedoms . the individual 's liberty can still theoretically outweigh public safety , but practically , you 're talking about convincing a court that your right to walk to the corner store outweighs the risk of an epidemic . better fire up the netflix and itunes , and get comfortable with a couple weeks ' house arrest .", "summary": " kaci hickox , who tested negative for ebola but was quarantined , was finally released .   danny cevallos : being confined feels like a violation , but it 's rarely a legal violation .   he says when it comes to infectious diseases , the court is not taking any chances .   cevallos : public health concerns can warrant the state 's intrusion on personal liberty .
