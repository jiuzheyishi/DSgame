{"text": "bills for long-term care in old age are to be capped at # 75,000 in england , in a # 1billion move to be funded by dragging more people into the inheritance tax net , it was announced today . health secretary jeremy hunt said that the ` historic ' reforms would save thousands of people from having to sell their family home to pay for care and give them ` greater peace of mind ' . ` we need to become a society where people prepare and plan for their social care costs as much as they prepare and plan for their pension , ' he said , adding that all governments have ` long failed to tackle ' the issue . scroll down for video . announcement : heath secretary jeremy hunt makes a statement to mps in the house of commons in central london where he said that that elderly care bills are to be capped at # 75,000 . ` whilst there are many other things . that need to be done to prepare for an ageing population , these reforms . do herald a historic change in the way that care and support is funded . in this country . ' the inheritance tax threshold will be . frozen until at least 2019 to help fund the # 75,000 cap on care home . bills for the elderly . it means that thousands more middle-class . families every year will be dragged into paying the 40 per cent tax . sources . close to chancellor george osborne confirmed that some of the funding . for radical reform of social care will come from an unexpected freeze in . the amount people can inherit free of tax . stealth tax ? sources close to george osborne say the inheritance tax threshold is to be frozen to fund a # 75,000 cap on care home bills . the move risks angering conservative mps . who remember mr osborne pledging in 2007 , before the financial crisis , . to increase the threshold to # 1million . instead it has been fixed at # 325,000 since the election and will remain at that level until at least april 2019 . the coalition will announce today that the state will fund all social care for any individual once the # 75,000 cap has been reached . the state will also begin to help with costs if a person 's savings and assets fall below a threshold of # 123,000 , rather than # 23,250 at present . but the national pensioners convention argues that the # 75,000 cap is too high and warns that elderly people will continue to lose their homes as they grapple to meet mounting care costs . the reforms are expected to cost # 1billion a year , 80 per cent of which will come from increased employer national insurance contributions -- mainly in the public sector -- as a flat-rate state pension replaces the state second pension . but the remaining 20 per cent will come from the inheritance ` stealth tax ' . if the threshold for the tax , frozen since 2009 , increased in line with inflation every year until 2019 it would be expected to reach # 420,000 . but instead it will be fixed at # 325,000 -- although just two months ago the chancellor suggested he would increase the allowance in two years . as a result , 5,000 more families a year . are expected to be pulled into the inheritance tax trap , and will pay an . average of # 95,000 more than they would have done if the allowance had . been increased . george osborne 's pledge in 2007 . a government source said : ` the result of the social care reforms will be that 100,000 people who would have had to pay will be helped . the inheritance tax allowance has been frozen since 2009 , but it 's also been made transferable so a couple now has a threshold of # 650,000 . ` yes , it will bring 5,000 more people into inheritance tax but it will help more than 100,000 who currently suffer for daring to do the right thing and saving for retirement . ` those who have worked and saved all . their life and bought a property wo n't have it taken away just because . they did the right thing . that 's only fair . ` we are going to protect their inheritance . ' hit with taxes : ros altmann -lrb- right -rrb- , a former adviser to the treasury on pensions , said well-off pensioners with expensive houses would be hit by the inheritance tax changes while peter bone -lrb- left -rrb- said it looks as if the government is ` giving with one hand , and taking away with the other ' however , conservative mps expressed alarm . right-winger peter bone said : ` it starts to look as if we are giving with one hand and taking away with the other . ' the coalition is setting the # 75,000 cap despite the dilnot commission , established by government to review care funding in england , recommending a lower benchmark . the commission proposed a cap of between # 20,000 and # 50,000 and said # 35,000 would be ` the most appropriate and fair ' figure . but chairman andrew dilnot said the difference between the recommendation and the government 's figure is not large enough to create problems . he told bbc radio 4 's today : ` we said it should be between # 20,000 and # 50,000 in 2010-11 prices . ` the cap being proposed is # 75,000 in 2017 prices , that 's the equivalent of # 61,000 in our terms , # 11,000 higher than the top end of our range . ` but i recognise that the public finances are in a pretty tricky state and it does n't seem to me that it is so different as to radically transform the basis of the system . ' but dot gibson , general secretary of the national pensioners convention -lrb- npc -rrb- , said : ` people are still going to lose their homes to pay for this , # 75,000 is a hugely high cap . ` in actual fact , dilnot said 35 or 50 . but in any case , we did n't think dilnot was the right answer either because it does n't deal with the actual care system . ' ms gibson called for a 1.5 p in the pound income tax to pay for a national care system ` free at the point of delivery ' . neil duncan-jordan , also from the npc , said he could see little difference between the freezing of the inheritance tax threshold and labour 's plan before the election for a ` death tax ' to pay for care . ros altmann , a former adviser to the treasury on pensions , said relatively well-off pensioners with expensive houses -- particularly in the south-east -- would be hit by the inheritance tax changes . ` many people who end up not needing any expensive care in their old age will end up paying lots of inheritance tax to those who do , ' she added .", "summary": " it means thousands of middle-class families will have to pay 40 per cent tax .   george osborne had pledged to increase the threshold to # 1m in 2007 .
