{"text": "a major online security vulnerability dubbed  heartbleed  could put your personal information at risk , including passwords , credit card information and e-mails . heartbleed is a flaw in openssl , an open-source encryption technology that is used by an estimated two-thirds of web servers . it is behind many https sites that collect personal or financial information . these sites are typically indicated by a lock icon in the browser to let site visitors know the information they 're sending online is hidden from prying eyes . cybercriminals could exploit the bug to access visitors ' personal data as well as a site 's cryptographic keys , which can be used to impersonate that site and collect even more information . it was discovered by a google researcher and an independent finnish security firm called codenomicon . the researchers have put up a dedicated site to answer common questions about the bug . they even gave it an adorably gruesome custom icon . heartbleed is the result of a small coding error but it could have far-reaching consequences and affect the majority of internet users . researchers discovered the issue last week and published their findings on monday , but said the problem has been present for more than two years , since march 2012 . any communications that took place over ssl in the past two years could have been subject to malicious eavesdropping . what makes the bug particularly problematic is that there is no simple fix . action needs to be taken by both the compromised sites and individuals who have visited them . to protect their user data and encryption keys , sites must upgrade to the patched version of openssl , revoke compromised ssl certificates and get new ones issued . many major websites including google , facebook , yahoo and amazon have said they 've taken steps to secure their sites . security researchers demonstrated the flaw by stealing yahoo e-mail logins on tuesday morning , but yahoo has since fixed the issue across its major sites , including tumblr . it 's not just an issue for major sites . smaller online stores and services use openssl , and those sites might take longer to make the necessary fixes . websites do n't typically publicize whether they 're using openssl , so the process will also be bumpy for consumers . individuals should update their passwords across the various web pages they use , but only once they have confirmed a site has already taken the proper measures to address heartbleed . if they do n't and that site is still at risk , the new password could also be compromised . many sites will also likely send e-mails instructing customers to update passwords if necessary .", "summary": " security research discovers a bug in the encryption technology used by two-thirds of the web .    heartbleed  could put people 's personal passwords , e-mails and financial information at risk .   addressing the bug will require work by individual sites and the customers who use them .
