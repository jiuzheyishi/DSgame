{"text": "when her beloved husband was killed in afghanistan , christina schmid thought she could never love again . but nearly three years after staff sergeant olaf ` oz ' schmid died defusing a taliban bomb , his widow has a new man in her life . the 36-year-old met mark clarke , who is also a serving member of the armed forces , six months ago and believes her late husband would give them his blessing . christina has fallen for military man mark clarke , pictured , who she met in a coffee shop queue , and she believes oz would give them his blessing . has his blessing : christina with oz , whom she still loves and misses everyday . staff sgt schmid , 30 , died while trying to defuse a bomb in afghanistan in october 2009 , 24 hours before he was due to fly home . he was awarded a posthumous george cross for his bravery , which saw him disarm more than 60 explosive devices in six months . mrs schmid was left devastated but knew she had to be strong for her son laird , who is now eight . christina tells her story in the latest issue of hello ! ` i did n't know if i would ever be able to love again after i lost oz , but mark has taught me that i can ; that i have a lot of love still left to give and a lot of life left to live , ' she told hello ! magazine . posing for a lavish photo spread with 30-year-old mr clarke , she said her love for her husband has ` not in any way diminished ' and she misses him every day . but she added : ` i have been lucky enough to meet this lovely man who cares deeply for me and wants to be with me -- and i adore him . ' mrs schmid said laird has accepted his mother 's new partner -- and is already asking if the pair will marry . ` he wants to have brothers and sisters . children do n't understand it 's more complex than that . ' she added : ` mark gets me completely , and i get him . it 's refreshing , comfortable and easy . some people do n't find that once in a lifetime . i 've been fortunate to find it twice . ` having mark in my life has n't changed the way i feel about oz . he is always in my heart and spiritually he 's always by my side . ' mrs schmid , who lives in a # 500,000 detached house in rural hampshire , has just published her memoir always by my side about her life with her husband , whom she described as her ` soulmate and best friend ' . she says she actually completed the book a year ago and then felt ready ` to move on to the next chapter of my life ' . hero : oz was awarded the george cross after his death for defusing more than 60 defusing bombs . brave and proud : christina gave a thumbs up as she waited for oz 's body to be repatriated in november 2009 . the widow met mr clarke , who had just returned from serving in afghanistan , in a coffee shop last autumn . the attraction was instant and they spoke for two hours before parting , having exchanged phone numbers . mrs schmid , who accepted the george cross on her late husband 's behalf , said she believes he would have liked her new partner ` very much ' and added : ` we did have a discussion once , oz and i , about how he 'd feel about me meeting someone new . ` he said ,  if anything happens to me , honey , you and laird have got each other , and nothing can break that . but if you meet someone who will look after you , then that 's lovely  . so i feel i have his blessing . ' mrs schmid and mr clarke are now discussing having a blessing to symbolise their commitment to each other and ` new start ' to their friends and relatives . but it is too soon to say if they will marry . ` mark is a big part of my life , ' she added . ` but at the same time i am a widow and i am aware that i have to be dignified . i have my closest friends to consider , many of whom are also oz 's dearest friends . whoever comes into my life must be able to get on with them . luckily , mark has . i feel that , in some ways , i have been pigeonholed as a grieving widow and campaigner -- and do n't get me wrong , i was that woman . but i achieved what i set out to achieve , and now i want to move forward . i want to leave that woman in the past and look to the future . ' mrs schmid bought her new home , in its own grounds with a stream running alongside , eight months ago when she moved out of army accommodation . it is understood she and laird live there with frequent visits from mr clarke -- the couple are often seen walking her late husband 's dog in the countryside . a neighbour said : ` they seem very happy . is she pregnant ? i do n't know but i think she has said she would like more children one day . ' the full interview with mrs schmid is in the current issue of hello ! magazine . my first call was to my mother . ` oh no , no , not oz . oh my god , you knew . . . ' she wailed.over . the next few hours i called oz 's family and friends . when i finished , i . launched the phone across the room and smashed the base . i was . screaming ` no ' and shaking uncontrollably . people . came and went . the night passed in a blur but i still remember it . vividly -- the flashbacks of that night still happen to this day . later , i 'd discover that oz had been killed while trying to defuse his third ied of the morning . colonel bob seddon , who led the technical investigation , showed me photographs of oz kneeling over the device that killed him . the . pictures had been taken a few moments before the explosion . there was a . compound wall in the background , and wires poking out of the ground a . few yards in front of it . oz was deep in concentration . the . next photographs of the same spot showed a crater with scraps of burned . paper lying about -- the remains of letters and photos that oz had . tucked into his body armour . grim . as the details were , i wanted to know the full story of my husband 's . death . but no witness could say for sure why the ied had exploded . my . own belief is that it may have been detonated by remote control . oz was . always so careful -- he once said to me : ` i deal with every device as . though you and laird are on the end of it . that 's how i keep my focus .
