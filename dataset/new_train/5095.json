' mastodon c , based at the open data institute , spent eight weeks working with publicly available data looking at the nhs prescribing patterns in gp practices , clinical commissioning groups , and primary care trusts . the cost of an individual prescription item can vary from 81p for a generic drug , to over # 20 for drugs still under licence to the pharmaceutical companies that develop them . francine bennett , who carried out the data analysis said : ` we 've suspected for some time that there were potential savings to be gained by looking at prescribing practices across the nhs but i was n't prepared for the extent of the potential savings we 've seen in just this analysis . ` what 's important now is to work with the nhs and healthcare professionals to provide the data and analysis which can realise this potential .
