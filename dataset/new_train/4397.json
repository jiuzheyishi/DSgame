{"text": "the parents who pulled their cancer-stricken son from a british hospital and spurred an international search for the boy have been ordered to appear monday in a court in spain , where they were arrested , police said . brett and naghmeh king took their 5-year-old son , ashya , who has brain cancer , to france and then spain late last week , authorities said . hotel staff members in malaga , spain , recognized ashya and his family from media coverage and contacted police . authorities did not confirm what charges the couple will face , but say that  cruelty  could be one of them as suggested by british law . british police have arrived in spain to question the parents , malaga police told cnn . the british crown prosecution service will be working on extradition efforts . the court appearance is part of a european arrest order that was issued by britain against the couple . their arrests came hours after brett king publicly asserted that he and his wife are not kidnappers and are not neglecting their son .  we were most disturbed today to find that his face is all over the internet and newspapers , and we 've been labeled as kidnappers , putting his life at risk , neglect ,  king said in a youtube video posted saturday .  we 're very happy with his progress ,  the father said in the video .  we 're not neglecting him .  the father is seen sitting on a bed with his son leaning against him . he points to a machine on the nightstand next to him .  we 've got loads of these feeds here . we 've got iron supplements and we 've got calpol ,  an over-the-counter medication , king said .  as you can see , there 's nothing wrong with him . he 's very happy , actually . since we took him out of hospital , he 's been smiling a lot more . he 's been very much interacting with us .  brett king defended his actions in the video made shortly before his arrest . he accuses two doctors at the hospital for not allowing him to seek proton beam treatment outside of britain , even though he said he was ready to pay for the treatment himself .  we pleaded with them for proton beam treatment . they looked at me straight in the face and said with his cancer , which is called medulloblastoma , it would have no benefit whatsoever .  king said he then looked on the internet and found sites in the united states , france and switzerland on proton beam treatment that  said the opposite that it would be beneficial for him .  the university hospital in southampton issued a statement saying they are working with doctors in malaga to ensure ashya 's welfare and  are delighted that he has been found .   we are aware of the comments made online by his father ,  the statement said .  throughout ashya 's admission we have had conversations about the treatment options available to him and we had offered the family access to a second opinion , as well as assistance with organizing treatment abroad .  after ashya was taken from the hospital without authorization thursday , the family -- including ashya 's six siblings -- boarded a ferry and headed to cherbourg , france , that night , police in britain said . interpol issued an international missing person notice to the agency 's 190 member countries to help find ashya . while authorities were searching for the boy , detective superintendent dick pearson said ashya is not mobile on his own , can not communicate verbally and is supposed to be receiving constant medical care because of recent surgery and  ongoing medical issues .   without this specialist 24-hour care , ashya is at risk of additional health complications which place him at substantial risk ,  pearson said friday . after the parents ' arrest saturday night , authorities acknowledged they could face criticism .  all of our efforts resulted from explicit medical advice that ashya 's life was in danger ,  said assistant chief constable chris shead of britain 's hampshire constabulary .  i am very aware that there are comments about the rights and wrongs of our approach , but when we are told by experts that any child 's life is at risk we will make no apologies for being as proactive as possible .  hampshire police said ashya was taken to materno infantile hospital in spain and that the facility was communicating with southampton general hospital , where the boy had been removed by his parents . it was not immediately clear what happened to the kings ' other children . in the united states only a handful of hospitals offer proton-beam therapy after surgery , including massachusetts general hospital , where the late u.s. sen. ted kennedy was treated for brain cancer in 2008 . he died just a year after his surgery for malignant glioma . that surgery was followed by six weeks of radiation . kennedy wrote in a newsweek magazine article at the time that he underwent proton-beam therapy . the theory behind proton therapy is that its high-energy particles zone in specifically on the tumor and so do not harm the surrounding healthy tissue as much as the x-ray photons in conventional therapy , said dr. donald o'rourke , associate professor of neurosurgery at the university of pennsylvania school of medicine .", "summary": " parents ordered to appear in spanish court monday .   parents took ashya king , 5 , from british hospital without authorization , police say .   the
