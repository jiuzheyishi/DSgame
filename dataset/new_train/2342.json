{"text": "utah 's roller coaster few weeks regarding same-sex marriage has taken yet another sharp turn , with the state tax board announcing that legally married gay and lesbian couples -- even those wed in the brief period of limbo in utah -- can file joint returns . the utah state tax commission detailed the apparent policy change posted on its website , explaining that same-sex couples who are eligible to file a joint federal income tax return can likewise file joint returns in utah . in other words , the state -- for tax purposes -- will treat them just like heterosexual couples . the state agency , in an official notice dated wednesday , said this decision is n't necessarily permanent : if federal courts side with utah officials arguing that the state law limiting marriage to one man and one woman be upheld , then same-sex couples will not be able to file joint state tax returns next year in utah .  this notice is limited to the 2013 tax year ,  the commission said .  filing information for future years will be provided as court rulings and other information becomes available .  charlie roberts , a spokesman for the state tax agency , said the decision put utah 's tax outlook on same-sex couples on par with that of the federal government , which has said it will recognize such legal unions . it does not , however , mean that the utah government -- as a broader entity -- is right now recognizing same-sex marriage .  this is just one agency , one decision ,  roberts said . whatever the rationale , this shift marks a significant milestone for lgbt supporters in the traditionally conservative state . it comes after u.s. district judge robert shelby ruled on december 20 that utah 's law prohibiting same-sex marriage -- which voters approved in 2004 -- conflicted with the constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process . afterward , many couples in the state sought and got marriage licenses . officials said more than 1,000 such licenses were issued in a 17-day period , though it 's not clear if all those people actually wed. . judge 's ruling ignites same-sex marriage frenzy . the 10th circuit court of appeals declined to immediately stay the lower court ruling , leading utah officials to ask the supreme court to intervene . the high court did just that in a two-sentence order on january 6 that , without comment , put same-sex marriages on hold in utah until the constitutional questions are fully resolved . that apparently unanimous order in favor of the state sends the matter back to an appeals court for expedited consideration . the denver-based appeals court is expected to consider the case again in coming weeks more thoroughly , with a ruling possibly affecting all states in its jurisdiction : utah , colorado , wyoming , new mexico , kansas and oklahoma . that last state , oklahoma , is in a similar situation after a federal judge struck down its same-sex marriage ban . but he immediately stayed his own ruling , as the matter works its way through the courts . judge : oklahoma gay marriage ban unconstitutional . still , what 's happening in utah was and remains less clear-cut . while the federal government has said it will recognize same-sex marriages performed between late december and early january in the state , the state had hinted that it would not . this indication came in a january 8 letter from the office of utah gov. gary herbert to cabinet officials saying that , based on advice from the state 's attorney general ,  state recognition of same-sex marital status is on hold until further notice .   please understand this position is not intended to comment on the legal status of those same-sex marriages -- that is for the courts to decide ,  wrote the governor 's chief of staff , derek miller .  the intent of this communication is to direct state agency compliance with current laws that prohibit the state from recognizing same-sex marriages .  this week 's tax commission announcement , though , does signal at least parts of the state government are recognizing such unions . it applies not just to the hundreds married in utah , but also to those gay and lesbian couples who might have gotten legally married in other states then moved to utah . roberts , the state tax commission spokesman , explained that authorities -- including his group 's director and the attorney general -- decided over the past 10 days that it made sense to have utah play by the same rules , tax-wise , as the u.s. government until the legal situation plays itself out .  we feel this brings us in line with the current judicial situation ,  roberts said . this shift may surprise some given utah 's reputation politically . it 's the home of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints , often referred to as mormons , whose leaders have been vocal in efforts to limit marriage to a man and woman . its voters have voted for the republican presidential candidate in every election since 1968 . and its officials now have stood behind the legal efforts to defend their state 's existing law . but there are also some signs that the situation in the state on this issue may not be crystal clear . a recent poll commissioned by the salt lake tribune , one of the state 's biggest newspapers , found an even split -- 48 % for and 48 % against -- of people asked if same-sex couples should be allowed to get state-issued marriage licenses . it 's margin of error is + / - 4.1 % . in the same survey , 72 % of respondents said same-sex couples should at least be allowed to have civil unions or domestic partnerships . cnn 's drew iden contributed to this report .", "summary": " utah 's tax commission says that same-sex couples can file joint returns for 2013 .   the shift affects those married in other states , plus about 1,000 married in utah .   those marriages came after a federal judge struck the state 's same-sex marriage ban .   the supreme court stayed the ruling ; state officials have been fighting to keep the ban .
