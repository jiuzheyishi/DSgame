{"text": "barney frank , an ultra-liberal former massachusetts democratic congressman , and rep. steve king , a right-wing flamethrower from iowa , were the first two national figures to politicize monday 's boston massacre . king said in an interview with the conservative national review magazine that the senate 's immigration reform bill should stop dead in its tracks , reacting to early reports that a saudi suspect in the u.s. on a student visa had been detained for questioning . frank said tuesday on msnbc , as reported by mediaite , that the bombing attacks at the boston marathon showed that republicans ' calls for tax cuts could hinder the federal government 's responses to terror attacks and other tragedies that local governments are n't equipped to handle on their own . scroll down for video . frank complained that conservatives ` criticize government , belittle public employees -lsb- and -rsb- talk about their pensions ' without noting the work government ca n't do unless taxes are high . in his first statement monday after . the bombings that killed three people and wounded at least 173 , . president barack obama said partisan rancor should be left behind as . americans came to grips with the horror and the carnage . ` i 've . updated leaders of congress in both parties , ' obama said , ` and we . reaffirmed that on days like this there are no republicans or democrats . -- we are americans , united in concern for our fellow citizens . ' but the 73-year-old frank , no longer a member of congress since his retirement in january , never got the memo . ` part of the answer ' to the question . of how to make bostonians feel safe again , he said , ` is , and i have to . repeat this : maybe we 'll resist this -lsb- idea of -rsb-  oh , let 's have less . government . let 's reduce the resources .  ' ` no , . let 's continue to build up security , ' frank argued .  and then , by the . way , as a practical matter this is very expensive for the city of . boston . ... i hope that we will be able to find some revenue so that . boston does n't have to pay for this absolutely necessary expenditure . ' msnbc anchor thomas roberts . challenged frank , asking him , ` do you feel like you 're capitalizing and . making political hay of this event that happened ... that you 're making a . political argument about revenue right now ? ' ` yes ! exactly ! i 'm talking common sense ! ' frank responded . barney fran was one of the liberal lions of the u.s. house of representatives until his 2013 retirement . the only openly gay congressman during his tenure , he was seen as a reliable vote for left-wing social causes and liberal tax policy . right-wing firebrand steve king of iowa said the senate should scrap plans to provide conditional amnesty to illegal immigrants , given the possibility that the boston attacks were carried out by foreign nationals . king is among the most reliably conservative members of congress . ` i 'm saying that if the sequester had gone through , ' frank continued , ` and we had not had enough money , we could n't be able to do this . yeah , i 'm making an argument about reality , and that 's the only responsible response . ' frank added that he hoped some people - referring to those on the political right - would be ` less enthusiastic about reducing our ability to respond to a crisis like this . ' also on tuesday , frank told cnn anchor john berman that americans should be ` grateful that we had a well-funded , functioning government . ' ` it is very fashionable in america , and has been for some time , to criticize government , belittle public employees , talk about their pensions , talk about what people think is their excessive health care . here we saw government ... perform very well . . ` you know , ' he added , ' i never was , as a member of congress , one of the cheerleaders for less government , lower taxes . ' ` no tax cut would have helped us deal with this , or will help us recover . this is very expensive . ' on the other side of the political aisle , ideological worlds away , steve king told national review that congress should n't rush immigration reform legislation because the government does n't yet know if foreign national weer involved in the boston bombings . ` some of the speculation that has come out is that yes , it was a foreign national and , speculating here , that it was potentially a person on a student visa , ' king said . ` if that 's the case , then we need to take a look at the big picture . ' a saudi student was initially reported to be a detained suspect , but authorities subsequently ruled him out , noting that a boston bystander had tackled him to the ground for merely acting ` suspiciously . ' king favors the border security portion of legislation reportedly finalized monday by the so-called ` gang of eight ' in the u.s. senate . but a plan to provide illegal immigrants with a path to citizenship , he said , should be delayed at a minimum . ` we need to be ever vigilant , ' he told reporter robert costa . ` we need to go far deeper into our border crossings . ... if we ca n't background-check people that are coming from saudi arabia , how do we think we are going to background check the 11 to 20 million people that are here from who knows where ? ' senate leaders will introduce their bill on april 19 , after boston attacks forced the postponement of an event originally scheduled for april 16 . king leads a group of republicans who have said they will try to block senate-originated immigration legislation in the house .", "summary": " right-winger wants to ice senate talk of citizenship pathway for illegal immigrants , citing saudi student now ruled out as a bombing suspect .   liberal former congressman urges opposition to tax cuts and shrinking government , citing ` very expensive ' responses in boston .   asked if he was ` making political hay of this event , ' barney frank replied , ` yes ! exactly ! i 'm talking common sense !
