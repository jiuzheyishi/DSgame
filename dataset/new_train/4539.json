{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- aviation website airlineratings.com has just released its annual list of the world 's 10 safest airlines . once again , australian airline qantas grabs the top spot .  qantas continues to lead the industry with safety innovations and its fleet is now the youngest -- 7.9 years -- it has been since the airline was privatized in 1995 ,  airlineratings.com editor geoffrey thomas tells cnn . he says the airline is an industry benchmark for best practice and has taken the lead in virtually every major advancement in airline safety over the past 60 years . rounding out the rest of the top 10 in alphabetical order are : air new zealand , british airways , cathay pacific airways , emirates , etihad airways , eva air , finnair , lufthansa and singapore airlines .  our top 10 safest airlines are always at the forefront of safety innovation and launching new planes ,  says thomas . airlineratings.com 's rating system takes into account audits from aviation 's governing bodies and lead associations as well as government audits and the airlines ' fatality records . it also examines airlines ' operational histories , incident records and operational excellence . of the the 449 airlines it monitors , 149 have the top seven-star safety ranking . this year , the site also included a list of the top 10 safest low cost airlines for 2015 . these are , in alphabetical order : aer lingus -lrb- ireland -rrb- , alaska airlines -lrb- u.s -rrb- , icelandair -lrb- iceland -rrb- , jetblue -lrb- u.s. -rrb- , jetstar -lrb- australia -rrb- , kulula.com -lrb- south africa -rrb- , monarch airlines -lrb- uk -rrb- , thomas cook -lrb- uk -rrb- , tuifly -lrb- germany -rrb- and westjet -lrb- canada -rrb- .  unlike a number of low cost carriers these airlines have all passed the stringent international air transport association operational safety audit audit and have excellent safety records ,  says thomas .  low cost does not mean low safety .  one fatal accident for every 1.3 million flights . the release of the airlineratings.com list comes at a particularly sensitive time for fliers . while 2013 was one of the safest years in global aviation history , 2014 is considered one of the worst in recent years in terms of fatalities , due to several high-profile air incidents . airlineratings.com says there were 21 fatal accidents with 986 fatalities in 2014 -- higher than the 10-year average . however , looking to the positive there were only 111 crashes in 2014 , the lowest number in more than 80 years says the geneva-based bureau of aircraft accidents archives , or baaa . the last time the world had 111 crashes was in 1927 .  if you consider sheer numbers of aircraft crashes , flying today is safer ,  says kane ray , an analyst with the international bureau of aviation , a global aviation consulting group .  however , there are more aircraft in the sky , so naturally the overall number may appear similar to previous decades and , in some categories of disaster , higher .  according to a report on airlineratings.com , the world 's airlines carried a record 3.3 billion passengers on 27 million flights in 2014 .  flashback 50 years and there were a staggering 87 crashes killing 1,597 when airlines carried only 141 million passengers -- 5 % of today 's number ,  says the website .  another twist is that fatal accidents for 2014 were at a record low 21 -- one for every 1.3 million flights . two of the crashes last year -- mh370 and mh17 -- were unprecedented in modern times and claimed 537 lives .  in march , malaysia airlines flight 370 disappeared en route from kuala lumpur to beijing with 239 aboard . officials believe that plane is somewhere in the indian ocean . but , nearly 10 months later , mh370 has n't been found . in july , malaysia airlines flight 17 was shot down over eastern ukraine , killing all 298 aboard . malaysia airlines has a five out of seven ranking on airlineratings.com . airasia indonesia -- still reeling from the crash of flight qz8501 , which went down over the java sea on december 28 with 162 people on board -- has a four out of seven star ranking . prior to december , airasia had a near flawless safety record , with no previous fatal accidents . world 's unsafest airlines . airlineratings.com says if an airline has a crash that involves the death of a passenger and/or crew members it will automatically receive a deduction of one star , giving it a lower safety rating .  a crash involving fatalities carries with it a one star deduction for 10 years from the date of the incident ,  says the website on a page explaining its ratings system . of the 449 airlines surveyed by airlineratings.com , nearly 50 have just three stars or less . four airlines only achieved one star for safety . two are from nepal -- tara air and nepal airlines -- joining kazakhstan 's scat airlines and afghanistan 's kam air . all four are on a list of airlines banned from flying within the european union . the united states does n't blacklist individual airlines , but it does make public a list of countries it judges to fall short of international aviation safety standards . cnn 's holly yan contributed to this report .", "summary": " aviation site airlineratings.com says qantas remains the world 's safest airline .   of the the 449 airlines the website
