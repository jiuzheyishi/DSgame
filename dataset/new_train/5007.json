' lacy , molly and angus were saved after neighbours complained about an ` incredible odour ' outside the property . rspca officers found the animals living in ` quite disgusting ' conditions , which left one inspector ` gagging ' because of the stench . happy now : the dogs needed extensive coaxing and needed to be trained to do basic things because of the ill treatment they had suffered . a specialist dog groomer removed huge amounts of matted fur from the shih-tzus , who struggled to walk due to the weight of their overgrown coats . the groomer said the dogs ' coats were in the worst condition of any he had ever seen . molly , believed to be around five years old , was adopted by kay and david cooke from hexham , northumberland . the couple were looking for another dog as company for their border terrier , oscar . kay , 49 , said : ` we saw an advert for molly and i fell in love with her straight away . she was adorable . ` we wanted a friend for oscar and so decided to meet molly to see if the pair of them would get on . ` we knew that we would like a rescue dog as we wanted to give a dog who really needed to be loved , a good home . she added : ` when we first saw molly , we took her for a walk . she was very tense so we stopped and i picked her up . ` as soon as she was in my arms , she just melted , and that 's when i knew that i was going to love her very much . ' i would like to think that was the moment she felt safe . ` when molly first came to live with us , she had no sensory experiences . i ca n't imagine how it must have been for all three of them living in those conditions . ` we have had a lot of work to do with her , as it 's harder to teach an older dog the basic skills you would easily drill into a puppy . but she has been worth every minute of it , and i 'd like to think she is happier than she has ever been .

' i do n't know how anybody could neglect an animal like that . ` we did n't really know what we were taking on when we re-homed angus , because we had no idea how his past might have affected his behaviour , and that 's something i was of course wary of with a child in the house . pauline kinghorn , 62 , received a lifetime ban for her poor treatment of the animals . ` but he has been nothing but fun . we 've had no problems at all and he 's just brought sheer joy into our lives ' ms bolton said the family has seen a big difference in angus already .
