{"text": "no , the richest fight of all time has not been set in paper , let alone stone . not yet . yes , the lines on the contract still wait to be dotted , let alone signed upon by floyd mayweather and manny pacquiao . but yes , also , the big businesses needed to help generate the prize-ring 's first # 200million bonanza are swinging into action already . the travel industry , especially . manny pacquiao -lrb- left -rrb- and floyd mayweather chat at an nba match last month . air and accommodation packages have now gone on sale here in britain for the second half of the week ending saturday , may 2 in las vegas . cost -- anything up to # 4,000-a-head for deals based on flights in economy . the mgm grand -- the giant resort and casino on that neon strip in the desert -- has been keeping its grand garden arena on hold for some time now . more significantly it has just raised its basic room rates for the nights of may 1 and 2 -- by more than treble to in excess of $ 500 -lrb- # 325 -rrb- for the first time . other hotels in vegas are also hiking their prices . all the above are selling like hot cakes . everyone is gambling that the deal of the century will be done . packages to watch the potential # 200million bout are already on sale with some companies . it is believed that ringside seats will cost $ 5,000 -lrb- # 3,250 -rrb- each , with the pay-per-view subscriptions in the us being priced at $ 100 -lrb- # 65 -rrb- each ... if it happens . the only thing which might bring it all crashing down in is a premature announcement that the fight is truly on . one of mayweather 's stipulations is that he makes the announcement . pacquiao has publicly conceded that privilege . but wishful media speculation that he has signed a contract , supposedly based on information from unattributed sources close to the filipino camp , threaten to crush the hopes of the boxing world , the pacman himself included . mayweather does not like that . he dismissed the story out of hand when he attended the nba all-star game in new york at the weekend , when many expected him to declare the fight on : ` it 's not true . i 've not signed yet . he 's not signed yet . it 's all speculation and rumour .

' pacquiao lands a left hook on chris algieri on his way to victory in macau back in november . mayweather is this organisation 's world welterweight champion and sulaiman adds : ` we are doing everything possible to remove any obstacle from this happening . it 's not fair to the fans if they do n't make this fight , which everyone wants to see . it will be terrible it it does n't happen this year because it would be bring so much greater exposure to boxing and transform the sport . ' even so , he raised the prospects of it happening this year rather than next as ` no better than 50-50 . ' meanwhile , the long wait goes on . but even as it does so boxing lovers the world over , in their anxiety about missing out , are gambling on advance bookings . in terms of his credibility and his legacy , it may not be wise for mayweather to disappoint them . george groves has been promised that if he remains patient he is guaranteed his world super middleweight title shot later this year . saint george was disappointed when the wbc suddenly granted anthony dirrell the right to a voluntary defence of their belt prior to meeting his mandatory challenge of groves . dirrell is being allowed to fight an opponent of his choice in april but wbc president jose sulaiman assures groves : ` dirrell will then have to fight george by the autumn .

' in that , at the very least , we can believe him . martin murray takes on hard-hitting gennady golovkin in monte carlo on saturday night . golovkin has promised to knock out the brit and retain his wbo and iba belts . but it would be a monumental achievement for the impressively reformed convict from st helens to overcome the unbeaten kazakh . golovkin knocks out opponents for fun , as anglo-irish warrior matthew macklin is one of many to have discovered already . andy lee , ireland 's holder of another version of the middleweight championship , will be among those in attendance / he is keeping a watching brief in case he overcomes the challenges of , first , peter quillin in america , then hertford 's billy joe saunders and goes on to face golovkin in a unification battle . * golovkin-murray will be televised live on channel 5 on saturday night .", "summary": " floyd mayweather in talks to fight manny pacquiao .   las vegas fight could be worth a world-record # 200million if it goes ahead .   deal not signed yet but travel companies already offering packages .   george groves has been promised a world title fight by the end of the year .   martin murray believes he can beat gennady golovkin on saturday night .   click here for all the latest mayweather and pacquiao updates .
