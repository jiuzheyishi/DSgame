{"text": "manchester , new hampshire -lrb- cnn -rrb- new jersey gov. chris christie dominates almost any room he enters but is suddenly facing questions about his relevance in the 2016 presidential race . the surprisingly fast-moving republican presidential contest , kicked off by jeb bush shortly after the new year and accelerated by the unexpected re-emergence of mitt romney , is putting pressure on christie , who was once the republican establishment 's favorite . the big-check gop contributors that were once assumed to be christie 's for the taking -- in particular the wall street financiers just across the hudson river from new jersey -- are now being courted aggressively by bush and romney as they ramp up their campaigns .  there is big advantage to moving first , and when you 're a whale like both jeb and romney are , and you jump into that pool first , its hard for anyone else to squeeze in ,  said b. wayne hughes , a california billionaire and republican donor who has not committed to supporting a candidate .  they have the same donor base , so they have to go after those guys .  bush has been a well-liked figure in the center-right donor set for years , thanks to his widespread family connections and the perks and ambassadorships doled out by two previous bush white houses . the former florida governor has also been a champion of immigration reform , a precious issue for the business community and republicans who want to grow the party 's appeal among hispanics , even as conservatives bristle at the idea . romney , meanwhile , built an impressive financial network during his 2012 campaign , and many of those donors are waiting to see what he does before committing to another candidate . his surprising decision last week at a new york donor meeting to  show some 2016 leg ,  as one attendee put it , was designed to keep bush at bay as he mulls a third presidential bid . but their moves are also complicating things for christie , who is still expected to launch a presidential bid but is moving at a much slower place than bush or romney . all three republicans will be competing for a similar slice of establishment-friendly financial backers and voters should they each seek the gop nomination . christie , already hamstrung on fundraising by strict pay-to-play laws that prohibit wall street employees from from contributing to governors seeking federal office , was further diminished in the eyes of some donors last year by the  bridgegate  scandal and its subsequent investigations . christie 's record as governor has also been met with some skepticism by the business community : new jersey has seen eight credit downgrades and continues to have some of the highest taxes in the country . his fading star opened the door last year for bush to start making calls to potential supporters who might have previously been with with christie . christie 's team insists the romney and bush developments have had little bearing on his decision-making process -- or his ability to fund a potential campaign .  the last couple of weeks actually had no impact ,  said one christie confidante , granted anonymity to discuss the 2016 machinations with some candor .  he is not changing his plans . he is not moving up any schedule . he is attending a bunch of inaugurals . he has a bunch of speeches coming up . he feels he is in good position and he feels like he has time to decide to want to do more .  the adviser pointed out that christie is fresh off an impressive tenure as chairman of the republican governors association , a post that put him in regular touch with some of the party 's biggest contributors . he remains on the rga 's executive committee , and plans to connect with many of the same donors at february gathering of the rga in washington . no candidate -- even ones with the names bush and romney -- can take the donor world for granted , the christie adviser insisted .  i think all three of them , romney , bush , gov. christie , have a leg up on donor world ,  the source said .  but you take those people for granted at your own peril . everybody will be courting those folks , but i think the smart folks will take their time .  to most americans , the donor courtship now underway is hidden from view and largely meaningless . but in the early stages of a presidential primary , the whims of big donors have outsized importance , especially in a post-citizens united world where a single rich person can prop up a candidate with a well-funded super pac . as the costs of running a presidential campaign skyrocket , landing the support of a major bundler can bring instant credibility to a candidate even before the campaign begins in earnest . early signals indicate that christie might not be hard up for cash should he decide to run . already he has secured the backing of texas bundler ray washburne , a recently-departed republican national committee finance chairman , two gop sources confirmed to cnn . and the wall street journal reported this week that ken langone , the home depot founder and prominent republican donor , is organizing a dinner for christie and potential supporters in new york later this month . once the donor primary ends and the actual primary begins , christie may be on better footing in a race against bush and romney .  there is room in the primary for anyone who has enough resources ,  said tom rath , a longtime new hampshire power broker and romney ally .  look , it 's a little different talking about how you connect with voters , and it 's another story talking about how you connect with the large scale fundraisers . but the fact is , new hampshire will give every candidate a fair shot . there is not home court advantage here for anyone at all .  though both of christie 's potential rivals in the establishment lane have big networks and deep experience in national politics , both of them are older than than the 52-year old christie . romney is 67 and bush is 61 , and both could be tagged as stale emblems of the past . christie , too , is a natural retail campaigner and perhaps the best political performer of anyone in the republican field . the contrast could be stark against the buttoned-up , bespectacled bush and the notoriously awkward romney .  he is kind of a hell-raiser , and nobody is going to say that about jeb bush or mitt romney ,  said leighton lord , a south carolina attorney who hosted a reception for christie in the early primary state this week .  he is not like a lot of the other folks that are running that are more cautious and calculating . folks are getting tired of that . they like his authenticity , which he has got all day long . that 's sort of a counter to romney . with romney , you 're never sure if you 're getting the real mitt romney or the romney he thinks you want .  though he 's been slower than bush or romney when it comes to hiring staff and building out a campaign , christie is still looking and sounding very much like a candidate-in-waiting . he is likely to launch a political action committee in the coming weeks , multiple gop sources said , and he is heading to a big conservative gathering in iowa after this week 's excursion to south carolina . christie can afford to wait longer than other candidates , his supporters said , in part because of his fame . he does n't need to introduce himself to voters in the way bush will , for instance .  so much of politics these days is celebrity ,  lord said .  we have got to find somebody who has the substance and the integrity , but is also a celebrity . and chris has got that .  in south carolina , where he attended the inauguration of gov. nikki haley , christie posed for selfies with top elected officials , including the lieutenant governor and attorney general , before dropping by a crowded gop meet-and-greet arranged by lord and other republicans . the reception was a positive one . christie 's speech to the audience was  short on conservative red meat , but long on how he 's the guy that can win ,  said one republican who attended the afternoon session , held at a columbia law firm .  he said something to the effect of , ` today is nikki haley 's day , but maybe it will be chris christie 's day in south carolina soon ,  the source told cnn .  you could n't walk away from that thinking anything other than he 's going to run .  after the event , matt moore , the chairman of the south carolina republican party , posted photos of the event on facebook .  my honor to introduce chris christie in south carolina today ,  he wrote .  the man tells it like it is ... we like that in s.c. !
