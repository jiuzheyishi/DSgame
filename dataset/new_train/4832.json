{"text": "throw down some drinks at the mad hatter bar in orlando ? check . pull the fire alarm , so about 500 students in tower 1 on the university of central florida campus rush outside , together ? done . give them hell ? those three words were the last item of james oliver seevakumaran 's checklist that he made before , authorities say , he would go out with up to 1,000 rounds of ammunition and start shooting , possibly setting off bombs in the process . it was not crossed off . instead of a mass killing early monday morning , police reported only one fatality : seevakumaran . video released a day later by university of central florida police shows the moment officers discovered him . after getting into his suite , they unlocked his room 's door and barged in , yelling and with their weapons raised . it did n't take them long to realize there was no threat . the 30-year-old lay prone on the floor , having killed himself with a handgun .  all indications are , just like the rest of his life , he was alone ,  ucf police chief richard beary said tuesday . after just more than a day of investigating , authorities have been able to piece together much of what happened . they have seen surveillance video that shows seevakumaran pulling the alarm , then returning to his room . they recovered weapons and ammunition as well as four homemade bombs and the checklist . they interviewed many who described him as a loner who did n't like to talk to others but was n't viewed as a threat . what they do n't know is why he did what he did .  there 's no manifesto , there 's no documentation ,  beary said .  ... we have not uncovered anything that would give us a motive or a rationale .  family calls him ' a loner ' the statement issued tuesday by seevakumaran 's family , initially to the sarasota county , florida , sheriff 's office , did n't shed much light on his thinking .  the family of james oliver seevakumaran states that james was a loner and did not have a history of violence ,  they said . from fall 2010 through fall 2012 , he had been a ucf student . but he was not enrolled for the spring semester , and was in the process of being removed from the dorm room where he lived , school spokesman grant heston said . according to heston , seevakumaran was never seen by ucf counselors and had not had any student conduct issues . he had one prior contact with law enforcement -- a traffic arrest in 2006 -- the police chief said . one of his roommates , arabo  bk  babakhani , told the ucf student news organization the knightly news that seevakumaran would seemingly make an effort to avoid walking near him , that he would n't say anything back when you said hello .  the only time that he made solid eye contact with me was when he was pulling the gun on me ,  the roommate said . that happened as lights were flashing and the alarm was ringing around 12:20 a.m. monday , inside their suite . unsure if he could make it to the hallway , babakhani ran to his room as seevakumaran raised what he later described as a  large assault gun  in his direction .  i just slammed the door ,  the roommate told cnn 's anderson cooper on tuesday night .  i was not going to let him shoot me .  babakhani said he first locked his door , hid behind a chest of drawers , then got behind a cabinet in the bathroom and called 911 .  my roommate just pulled a fire alarm , and he 's got a gun out ,  he told the dispatcher . while realizing seevakumaran was far from a rah-rah college student , babakhani did n't consider him a threat . but in retrospect , the roommate did say he believed seevakumaran was having money problems from having had his hours cut at a job and that , with seemingly no one to turn to , he might have like he was  in a corner .   i just thought that he kept to himself a lot ,  he said , according to audio posted on the knightly news website .  i just thought he was a quiet , introverted person .  ' i do n't think you do that as a joke ' whatever his relatives and acquaintances thought of him , police said they believe that seevakumaran had devious plans of his own . waiting for him in the university mail room were two 22-round magazine clips for his semi-automatic rifle , a sling for that weapon , and a training dvd on how to use its laser and shoot it , authorities discovered tuesday . this is in addition to the ample ammunition -- including drum magazines , one of them found attached to the gun , that can contain 110 bullets each -- that authorities have found . then there were the bombs , which beary said he believes seevakumaran made himself . seevakumaran likely spent about $ 1,000 to buy the guns and ammunition in february , suggesting his plan was set in motion as early as then , the police chief said . of course , there also was the checklist he 'd drawn up -- and largely followed , albeit apparently hours later than he had planned , after scribbling out items such as  get drunk  and  take shower  -- ahead of his death .  i do n't think ... you purchase 1,000 rounds of ammunition  without a plan , beary said .  i do n't think you do that as a joke .  while seevakumaran is the only one dead , the mere possibility that he would wage an attack has already had an impact . dorms were evacuated , classes were canceled , and the ucf campus was shut down . counselors were in tower 1 and elsewhere to talk with students coming to grips with the drama . school authorities could n't promise that something like this would n't happen again , but they did send out more police on patrol to help students feel safe .  all of us have a role to play in the welfare of our campus ,  school president john c. hitt said tuesday in a statement ,  and we will work together to use this experience to make us even more prepared , more alert , and more secure .", "summary": " james seevakumaran 's roommate says ,  i was not going to let him shoot me    seevakumaran , 30 , had about 1,000 rounds of ammo and four homemade bombs , police say .   video shows him pulling a fire alarm , then returning to his ucf room where his weapons were .   seevakumaran 's family calls him a loner ; authorities do n't know his motive for the alleged plot .
