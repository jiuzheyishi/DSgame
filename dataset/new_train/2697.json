{"text": "washington president barack obama 's point person for obamacare implementation faced her critics on capitol hill on wednesday , testifying under oath before the house energy and commerce committee . here 's what we learned from health and human services secretary kathleen sebelius ' 3Ã‚ 1/2 - hour hearing : . highlights from sebelius in the hot seat . analysis : sebelius ' difficult day . 1 . the buck stops with sebelius . republicans repeatedly pushed the secretary to name names as to who was at fault for recent service outages with the government 's online insurance exchange , who made key decisions to delay window-shopping features or who chose to present vague price quotes once that feature was eventually deployed . sebelius deferred to the software contractor now responsible for overseeing website repairs , qssi , and to officials at the centers for medicare and medicaid services . but when asked specifically by republican rep. marsha blackburn who was responsible for the healthcare.gov  debacle ,  the secretary took responsibility .  hold me accountable for the debacle ,  sebelius said .  i 'm responsible .  perhaps in an attempt to defray this line of questioning , sebelius took a cue from cms administrator marilyn tavenner 's testimony before the house ways and means committee on tuesday and apologized for problems with the rollout in her opening statement .  in these early weeks , access to healthcare.gov has been a miserably frustrating experience for way too many americans , including many who have waited years , in some cases their entire lives for the security of health insurance ,  sebelius said in remarks not included in her prepared testimony released earlier in the week .  i am as frustrated and angry as anyone with the flawed launch of healthcare.gov . so let me say directly to these americans , you deserve better . i apologize . i 'm accountable to you for fixing these problems .  2 . sebelius tallies up healthcare.gov cost . for weeks , independent analysts have pored over contracts issued by hhs in an attempt to determine how much the government spent to develop the failing website . conservative critics of the new health care law have cited estimates ranging all the way up to $ 600 million , but on wednesday sebelius gave congress a figure .  we have spent about $ 118 million on the website itself and about $ 56 million has been expended on other it to support the web ,  the secretary said . sebelius also revealed that there are outstanding obligations to the agency 's primary contractors , cgi federal and qssi , and that money will compensate those companies for their assistance in repairing the website . what happens if either contractor fails to fulfill the terms of its contract ?  there is n't a built-in penalty ,  sebelius said in response to questions about the contracts ' language .  but i can tell you that paying for work that is n't complete is not something that we will do .  3 . even hhs is n't sure how many people have enrolled . echoing tavenner 's testimony , sebelius said that the rocky rollout of healthcare.gov will likely result in low enrollment numbers when the administration issues its first data release in mid-november .  our projections prior to launch were always that there would be a very small number at the beginning ,  sebelius said .  we watched the massachusetts trend , which started slowly and then built . i think there is no question that given our flawed launch of healthcare.gov it will be a very small number .  but sebelius was pushed by many republicans as to why she could n't provide any data now . members asked about call center data , paper applications and attempted enrollments that were thwarted by technical glitches . no matter the context , sebelius ' answer was the same ,  we do not have any reliable data .  when pushed by republican rep. lee terry of nebraska to authorize insurance companies to release data from their end , sebelius said that all of the data that exists was unusable because  the system is n't functioning .   according to the insurance companies who are eager to have customers , they are not getting reliable data all the way through the system ,  she said .  it 's one of the real problems that we have .  4 . it depends what you mean by ` crash ' at one point on wednesday , sebelius raised the ire of republicans by pushing back against their use of the word  crash  when talking about the problems with healthcare.gov .  i would suggest the website has never crashed ,  the secretary said .  it is functional , but at a very slow speed and very low reliability , and has continued to function .  cnntech : when is a crash not a crash ? administration warned by contractor a month before launch . as many members noted , at the time of those remarks , visitors to the application portion of healthcare.gov were unable to create an account and instead were faced with an error message .  the system is down at the moment ,  the message read .  we are experiencing technical difficulties and hope to have them resolved soon . please try again later .  many might consider limited or no functionality as a  crash ,  but when asked for clarification , hhs spokeswoman joanne peters stuck by the secretary 's assertion that the website has never crashed .  as the secretary says , the site works ,  peters said .  but it is slow and has a lot of user errors . but even on the first day , some people could get all the way through the system . so it did not crash . if it crashed , it would have been totally down .  while the application portion may have been totally down during sebelius ' testimony , visitors were still able to access the healthcare.gov homepage , learn about the law and browse plans through the site 's window-shopping feature . meaning the site was n't totally down . 5 . sebelius wo n't get an obamacare card . because of an amendment added to the health care law , members of congress and their staff must enter the insurance exchange intended for those without employer-provided coverage . earlier this year , the office of personnel management issued a rule that allows those federal employees entering the exchange to keep the contribution that the federal government currently provides to help cover the costs of insurance . republican rep. cory gardner of colorado asked the secretary whether she would join members of congress and their staff in purchasing insurance on the federal insurance exchange , even though the law did not require her to . after consulting with office of health reform director mike hash , who was seated behind her , sebelius responded that it would be  illegal  for her to join the exchange because she receives insurance through the federal employees health benefits program .  if i have affordable coverage in my workplace , i 'm not eligible to go into the marketplace , that 's part of the law ,  sebelius said . is it really ` illegal ' for sebelius to have obamacare ? later , in a somewhat heated exchange with republican rep. billy long of missouri , sebelius repeated that explanation , telling the committee ,  i do n't want to give misinformation to the american public .   i think it 's illegal for me to access the marketplace ,  she said , before adding ,  i would gladly join the exchange if i did n't have affordable coverage in my workplace . i would gladly join it .  later , peters confirmed that it was in fact illegal for sebelius to join the exchange , but not for the reason she stated .  marketplace plans can not be sold to a medicare enrollee , and the secretary is a medicare enrollee ,  peters said . if sebelius , who turned 65 in may , did not have supplemental insurance through medicare , she would have the option of foregoing her employer-sponsored plan through the fehb and purchasing insurance on the exchange . but because she had affordable insurance available to her , she would be ineligible for federal subsidies regardless of her income , and because the law did not require her to move onto the exchange , the opm rule would not apply to her -- as it does to members of congress . more : ` whatever , ' a frustrated sebelius says .", "summary": " sebelius would n't name names on who was responsible for website woes .   health and human services secretary says about $ 174 million has been spent on website .   sebelius maintains hhs does n't have enough ` reliable data ' to say how many have enrolled .   definition of website ` crash ' differs between sebelius , republicans .
