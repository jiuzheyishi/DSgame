{"text": "washington the annual conservative political action conference drew 10,000 activists to washington over the weekend . the event traditionally concludes with a presidential straw poll . last year , the poll was won by mitt romney . this year , ron paul won , with 31 percent of the ballots cast . cpac 's organizers cautioned against over-interpreting the paul win . participation in the poll had been light , the paul team had just out-organized , etc. . all true enough . but it 's also true that ron paul-style themes have percolated through the conservative movement since paul 's beat-the-spread 2008 presidential campaign . of all those themes , the one that has achieved the widest audience is paul 's call for a return to money based on precious metals such as gold and silver . g.k. chesterton observed that you should never pull down a fence until you understand why it was put up . so let 's rediscover why it was that americans abandoned the gold standard in the first place . in 1929 , the u.s. economy slumped into recession . under the weight of a series of terrible decisions , that recession collapsed into the worldwide great depression . but why did decision-makers make so many bad decisions ? the short answer is that they were trapped . almost all of the right decisions would have ballooned the u.s. federal budget deficit . as budget deficits expanded , investors would inevitably worry that their dollars might lose value in the future . they would demand to trade their dollars for gold at the fixed price of $ 20.67 to the ounce . under the rules of the gold standard , the u.s. government would be obliged to sell . as long as the deficits continued , the u.s. government would lose gold . threatened with the exhaustion of its gold supply , the government felt it had no choice : it had to close the budget deficit . so , in the throes of a severe downturn , the u.s. government did exactly the opposite of what economists would otherwise advise : it cut spending and raised taxes -- capsizing the economy even deeper into depression . it 's very strange to hear gold standard advocates criticize president hoover for imposing steep tax increases in 1932 , the depression 's worst year . yet the gold standard they champion was the reason for the tax increases they deplore . between 1929 and 1932 , the u.s. money supply collapsed , as banks failed and bank deposits and commercial credit vanished . in their classic  monetary history of the united states  -lrb- 1966 -rrb- , milton friedman and anna schwartz identified this contraction of the money supply as the proximate cause of the great depression . why did n't the federal reserve act to prevent the contraction ? again : the gold standard . in a modern recession , the fed will buy treasury securities in the open market . after the purchase and sale , the federal reserve has more securities -- and the former owners of the securities have new cash . those new cash owners then spend or lend their cash , spurring economic activity . but in 1930 , the new cash owners did n't spend or lend . they swapped their cash for gold . the  open market  operations that were supposed to accelerate economic activity instead accelerated the country 's gold drain . so the fed ceased -- and instead passively allowed the economy to collapse in order to save the nation 's currency . every other gold-standard country faced similar challenges in the 1930s . those countries that quit gold first , like britain , suffered least . those that hung onto gold longest -- the united states and france -- suffered most . imagine now if the gold standard were in operation today . the federal government would be scrambling to balance its budget in the midst of recession , cutting spending and raising taxes . instead of pumping money into the economy , the federal reserve would be sucking money out . priority 1 would not be creating and saving jobs , but preserving the nation 's gold hoard . instead of living through the nastiest recession since the war , we 'd be deep into a second great depression . but in a way , this counterfactual is impossible . no government ever can return to the gold standard . back in the 1930s , governments accepted horrific suffering because they were terrified of the consequences of going off gold . when president franklin roosevelt told his budget director , lewis douglas , of his decision to quit gold , douglas replied :  this is the end of western civilization .  he was n't kidding either . in fact , the decision was the turning point of the depression , the beginning of recovery . and every monetary economist knows it . which means that the first thing any future gold-standard government would do in the event of recession would be to jettison gold . and every market trader knows that too . so ... as soon as the first sign of recession materializes on the horizon , the traders would dump the currency of the gold standard country . the gold standard country would then have to decide whether to self-impose draconian 1932-style budget-balancing or forgo the whole painful experience and surrender right away to what is inevitable sooner or later . since everybody knows that a gold standard country would quit gold as soon as times got tough , nobody will ever believe the decision to restore the gold standard in the first place . it 's as dead as monocles and walking sticks . deader , really . the punch line to one of my favorite anecdotes goes ,  son , your answers are so old , i have forgotten the questions .  has the depression receded so far into history that the answers that once plunged the nation into misery can possibly look credible again ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are those of david frum .", "summary": " ron paul won the presidential straw poll at the cpac conference .   david frum says part of paul 's appeal is his advocacy of basing dollars on precious metals .   he says the gold standard made the downturn of the 1930s into the great depression .   the markets wo n't take seriously any revival of the gold standard , he says .
