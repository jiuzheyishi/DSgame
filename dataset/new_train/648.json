{"text": "a taliban leader has admitted the insurgents can not win the war in afghanistan . the senior commander said it would take ` divine intervention ' for the hardline group to recapture kabul . but he said taliban chiefs could not admit this weakness because it would harm the morale of their fighters - raising the prospect that more british blood will be shed on the battlefield before combat troops withdraw in 2014 . defeat : insurgents will not win the war in afghanistan warns a senior taliban leader . in an extraordinary interview with the new statesman , the veteran also launches a withering attack on al-qaeda , branding the jihadists a ` plague ' . ` at least 70 per cent of the taliban are angry at al-qaeda , ' said the former guant√°namo bay inmate . ` our people consider al-qaeda to be a plague that was sent down to us by the heavens . ` to tell the truth , i was relieved at the death of osama -lsb- bin laden -rsb- . through his policies , he destroyed afghanistan . if he really believed in jihad he should have gone to saudi arabia and done jihad there , rather than wrecking our country . ' the taliban commander - identified only as mawlvi in the interview - was speaking to michael semple , a former un envoy to kabul who had maintained strong contacts with the radical group . despite the insurgents pumping out triumphalist rhetoric about their successes against coalition forces , mawlvi said the only way forward for the group is to come to a political agreement with opponents . shocking : a video clip of a taliban soldier gunning down a woman sparked international outrage this week . fury : afghan women hold banners and placards during a protest against the execution of the unnamed afghan woman by taliban militants . he said : ` the taliban capturing kabul is a very distant prospect . ` any taliban leader expecting to be able to capture kabul is making a grave mistake . ` nevertheless , the leadership also knows that it can not afford to acknowledge this weakness . ` to do so would undermine the morale of taliban personnel . the leadership knows the truth -- that they can not prevail over the power they confront . ` it would take some kind of divine intervention for the taliban to win this war . ' the taliban , he said , had shelved its vision of re-establishing the islamic emirate it set up when in power from 1996 to 2001 . this regime banned women from education , carried out thousands of executions as rough justice and outlawed eating lobster , even though afghanistan has no coastline . cost of war : a total of 422 uk troops have been killed since the conflict began in 2001 . ` any side involved in a conflict like . this has decided to fight for power , ' he said . ` if they fall short of . national power , they have to settle for functioning as an organised . party within the country . ' mr . semple said speaking unofficially allowed mawlvi to stray from the . taliban 's ` party line ' and reflect the views of its pragmatic wing . this , he said , was a sign that the group wanted to re-open talks with the u.s. however , only a few days ago video footage was released depicting the unwavering brutality of the taliban , executing a woman for adultery . she was machinegunned in cold blood because two commanders could not decide who should ` own ' her . mawlvi 's suggestion that the taliban could be open to dialogue was welcomed by western politicians with former foreign secretary david miliband calling the commander 's comments a ` landmark ' moment . ` the candour and clarity of the remarks about al-qaeda , nato and the afghan government show we are dealing with a sophisticated and long-term presence , ' he said . a total of 422 uk troops have been killed since the war began in 2001 .", "summary": " the senior commander said it would take ` divine intervention ' for the hardline group to recapture kabul .
