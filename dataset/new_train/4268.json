{"text": "we 've yet to hear all the details surrounding chris brown 's alleged altercation with frank ocean , but it would seem in the court of public opinion , brown 's already been tried . if you 've been following your celebrity feuds , you know there was tension between brown and ocean in 2011 thanks to an argument on twitter . but with brown 's history of violent behavior and the examples of questionable decision-making in recent years , the presumption by some is that the  do n't wake me up  singer is the guilty party in the standoff . as with controversial celebrities before him , at the core of the reaction to brown are those age-old questions : what are our behavior standards for our celebrities , who sets them , and can they be enforced ? if someone does something heinous , should we cease to find them entertaining ? and just how much should a star 's personal life override his or her work ? the answers to those questions are debatable and shift with the times , but they 're also made all the more charged by the context of brown 's case . following his 2009 assault on his then-girlfriend rihanna , which the world saw through a leaked photo of the singer 's bruised and beaten face and a detailed police report , brown has developed a reputation to rival showbiz 's biggest repeat offenders . in the past four years , he 's created a baffling rinse-and-repeat history of misdeeds , with a few apologies to match . just within the last seven months , the r&b / hip-hop artist has been in two other highly publicized fights -- one physical , with fellow musician drake in new york , and one digital , with writer/comedian jenny johnson on twitter -- in addition to now being investigated for the third brawl over the weekend . cnn has n't heard back from either brown or ocean for more clarification on what transpired in the 7200 block of santa monica boulevard in west hollywood , california , but authorities have confirmed that it was a physical throwdown involving six men . as deputies work to get to the bottom of what occurred , they 've said that brown is under investigation for allegedly punching an unnamed victim -- and over a parking space , no less . yet the frequent feuds are just the beginning of brown 's tenuous public image . equally damaging has been his defensive attitude , a brash , short-sighted bravado that he 'll sometimes temper with notes of aspirational positivity . the highlight reel of 2012 alone gives enough examples : . last february , he won no favors by telling those opposed to his 2012 grammy awards appearance to  hate  all they wanted to , because he 'd won an award that night . -lrb- that , in his opinion , was the  ultimate f *** off .  -rrb- in october , brown incurred skeptical looks with a halloween costume that was perceived as emulating the stereotypical image of a terrorist . the month prior to that the controversy was a tattoo of a  sugar skull  on his neck , one that made enough people think of a post-assault rihanna that his rep had to clarify that the ink was n't of the pop star . in december , he again rankled onlookers by sharing a photo of himself in amsterdam smoking enough  medicinal marijuana  for three people , which he later apologized for . -lrb- perhaps realizing the pot-stirring effect his social media posts have , brown pulled away from instagram on tuesday with the post :  social media takes away the essence of why we are even special or icons . so with that , i 'm detaching myself from that world .  -rrb- . as a result , any conversation that remotely mentions the 23-year-old star tends to push observers into two camps . there are the defending supporters , who accuse brown 's critics of being self-righteous and coldly disbelieving in an individual 's power to change . and then there are the affronted , who see his defenders as dismissive of brown 's influence and unwilling to hold the singer accountable for his actions -- not to mention turning a blind eye to the gravity of domestic violence . the media are n't above taking sides . marlow stern of the daily beast offered a  preponderance of evidence  that brown is  one of the most infuriatingly awful people in show business .  gawker posited that  it 's not hard to choose between those two versions  in the ocean/brown fracas , because in one corner you have  a violent , angry , abusive a ** hole ,  and in the other , a singer who  has never been accused of assault and is n't known for hitting people .  influential supporters like justin bieber -- who recently told billboard magazine that he 's pulling for the r&b / hip-hop singer on grammy night -- chime in , reminding consumers that it 's about a product , not a personality .  i 'm a fan ,  bieber said of brown .  his music is really good . that 's what they should focus on : the music .  it might be tough to remember , but brown caught our attention in 2005 with the promise of becoming pop 's next prince , earning the distinction at the time of being the first male artist in over a decade to land a no. 1 on the billboard 100 with a debut single . he was top 40 radio-ready and appearing in doublemint gum commercials , singing alongside an  american idol  winner and charmingly chatting about wanting to be the next michael jackson . along the way , he 's developed a strong fan base -- sometimes referred to as team breezy -- that 's been consistent in his corner even as we 've watched that careful artist package come apart at the seams . one thing that 's held his ship upright in waves of backlash , said yahoo! music senior editor billy johnson jr. , has been his music .  it does help when you have really good products in the marketplace , because i think at the end of the day that will supersede everything ,  johnson said .  you 're trying to repair a damaged image , one way to shift the focus is to put out good music .  whether you personally find brown 's music to be  good  or not is a matter of taste , but it is clear that he 's being accepted by both the industry and the music-buying public . the same month he allegedly broke the window of his  good morning america  dressing room after storming off the set , he notched his first no. 1 album on the billboard 200 with 2011 's  f.a.m.e.  that same record also earned brown a best r&b album grammy the following february , and his 2012 album ,  fortune ,  was another no. 1 and is nominated in the best urban contemporary category at the 2013 ceremony . brown is far from the first to whip us into a backbiting frenzy over where we , culturally , can and/or should draw our lines , and it 's seriously unlikely he 'll be the last . charlie sheen is one of the most notorious examples , and while he 's a touchy subject when it comes to public acceptance , he 's nonetheless been successful in terms of output . even before he was  winning ,  sheen cultivated a bad-boy reputation thanks to his predilection for paying for  sexual services  and time spent in rehab . in the mid-to-late '90s , his shine further lost its luster with allegations of domestic violence . in 2009 , sheen 's then-wife brooke mueller alleged that he threatened her , a storyline that was the precursor to his at turns confusing , laughable and upsetting meltdown in 2011 , during which he was let go from the popular show  two and a half men .  after coming down off the tiger blood , sheen 's now on fx with another comedy ,  anger management .  in brown 's case , he 's similarly continued to press forward with his music and acting career . prior to making his instagram account private , he posted that he 's at work on a new album , showing once again that what happens for a star personally does n't always interrupt what occurs professionally , even while we continue to hash out whether it should .", "summary": " although details are n't clear , some have assumed brown is guilty in his latest fight .   the presumptions are attributed to his history of violence .   brown 's trajectory raises age-old questions surrounding celebrity and accountability .
