{"text": "in jane austen 's time , manners maketh the man and being able to hold a captive and witty conversation was a virtue . so just what would the literary legend have made of today 's society where the art of face-to-face communication is being lost to texting and tweeting ? no doubt she may have been as irked as alex haigh , 23 , from melbourne , australia , who has set up ' a stop phubbing ' campaign group to shame people who snub friends and family they are with in favour of checking their mobile phone . how rude ! but many brits have admitted they will talk on their phone during dinner and whilst in company . it 's a social faux pas that a third of britons polled admitted to in a recent survey , with more than a quarter -lrb- 27 per cent -rrb- saying they would answer their phone in the middle of a face-to-face conversation . a third confessed that they would answer the phone in a restaurant and 19 per cent said they would while being served in a shop . now glamour magazine have imagined just how austen would have satirised those in need of social etiquette when it comes to using their smartphone . or , to paraphrase the novelist , how it is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man -lrb- or woman -rrb- in possession of a good smart phone must be in want of manners . so here 's ` what jane would do ' when it comes to using your mobile with good manners ... one does not approve : jane austen was a stickler for social etiquette . one must avoid reading emails at mealtimes/social occasions . it is phubbing of the highest degree . or , as jane might say : ` to sit in the shade on a fine day , and look upon verdure is the most perfect refreshment . but it is lost if one is more engrossed in that email rebecca sent you of a cat falling into a bathtub . ' one must not leave a missed call without an answerphone message or text . or , as jane might say : ` one half of the world can not understand the pleasures of the other . so how in darcy 's name do you expect us to know what you were calling about if there is but no intimation of your purpose ? ' one must use whatsapp with great care - instead of sharing every waking thought or decision with a group . or , as jane might say : ` you have delighted us long enough . ' one must not put non-verbal things on the phone - like a cat or newborn ba-lrb- ` hi mr snuffles . our conversation is costing me 43p per minute ' -rrb- . or , as jane might say : ` my idea of good company is the company of clever , well-informed people , who have a great deal of conversation ; that is what i call good company . ' one must always say goodbye when hanging up . or as jane might say : ` you hung up on me ? badly done , emma !
