' when she asked him why he had killed them , ` he said the reason he shot them was he did n't want rick to find out the intimate relationship between him and gail and that he was jealous ' , she said . but in court this week , wyngarden tried to convince the jury that those sexually-related incidents would n't have provided a motive for killing his sister . in his testimony , wyngarden admitted to having three sexual experiences with gail , but denied the two ever had intercourse . the first instance happened when wyngarden was 12 and his sister was nine . he said they were naked and ` just playing around ... comparing body parts ' when their mom came into the room . ` there was nothing sexual about it , ' he said . the next time the two had a sexual encounter was one or two years later when the siblings were smoking marijuana . ` we just groped on each other a little bit . there was no clothing that ever came off . that was pretty much that , ' he said . the final instance happened when wyngarden was 15 and again involved marijuana.wyngarden described the encounter as ` consensual ' and says the two touched genitals but it did n't escalate to sex . ` my sister did not lose her virginity to me , ' he said . ' i would n't have killed my sister over this . ' having to talk about the sexual encounters caused wyngarden to become antagonistic with the prosecutor , constantly talking out of turn . at one point the judge had to order the jury out of the court room so he could warn wyngarden not to talk over the prosecutor . ` mr. wyngarden , you ca n't argue with me , ' the judge said . ` this is n't going to end well for you with the jury .

' i am beyond belief that pam sticks to this lie , but i truly believe god 's light will bring the truth ' he wrote in one letter . wyngarden 's defense argued that the brinks were victims in a case of a mistaken identity . the couple had recently moved into a home vacated by residents who had links to the narcotics trade and connections to a detroit-area biker game . short-lived marriage : gail and rick brink had been married for only 18 months when they were found dead . wyngarden suffered emotional highs and lows throughout the sentencing , crying at points and flaring up at others . at one point he quoted from the bible , then said in a loud voice : ` lord , i did n't do this . you know i did n't do this . i just told the truth . i did n't kill my sister and you know it . ' ` so , here i am , an innocent man , shackled ... for no reason other than what repper and blakely suggested -lrb- to his wife -rrb- . ' he talked about the night his daughter , ` my little angel sent down from heaven ' , was conceived . he urged his children to be ` good citizens , do n't cheat , lie , steal , be a good neighbor , be quick to forgive ' . at several points , he wept . ` innocent man , stripped of your family , stripped of your wife , because of a bunch of lies , ' he said . wyngarden 's tirade only cemented opinions that he committed the killings , assistant ottawa county prosecutor lee fisher said . ` he 's definitely not in touch with reality , ' he said . the conviction helps both families , he said . ' i think it means closure , and justice was done . ` they do n't have to wonder anymore what happened to their brother and gail .
