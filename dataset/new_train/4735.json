{"text": "reginald desroches is deploying to haiti to tag key infrastructure buildings with red , yellow and green markers -- designations on whether they 're still usable . desroches has years of experience as a civil engineering expert dealing with structures in the wake of earthquakes . this disaster is also personal : he was born in haiti and one of his uncles died in the quake 's aftermath . the associate chair of georgia tech 's school of civil engineering , desroches will lead a team of experts in haiti about the sustainability of buildings . he spoke with cnn before heading to port-au-prince . below is a transcript of the interview , a portion of which has been edited . cnn : what will be your task in haiti ? desroches : there 's an urgent need for a group of experts in earthquake engineering , preferably french speaking , to come down and assess the critical buildings to determine whether or not they 're safe to reoccupy . essentially , we go about tagging them : red for unsafe ; green for safe ; yellow for something in between . we were asked to do this on a number of critical infrastructure buildings , including hospitals , schools , u.n. facilities , government buildings , as well as buildings occupied by various nations ' ambassadors . evidently , there has n't been anybody on the ground yet to do that service , so there 's a need to get somebody in there asap to assess as many buildings as possible . ... there 's a specific manual that 's been developed by the applied technology council and the manual is geared toward the rapid assessment of buildings after earthquakes . the manual gives you guidelines based on the type of damage -- the type of cracking you have in columns and other load-bearing elements , as well as how many of them have specific levels of damage . based on this checklist , you can then determine what category your building should be classified as . cnn : in many ways , this is the nightmare scenario . you have this quake in impoverished haiti . supplies are hard to get down there . in a month or two , you have the start of a rain season and following that you enter hurricane season . desroches : there are a number of issues there . they clearly do n't have the infrastructure to facilitate rapid recovery from this . there are a number of buildings that have collapsed and bodies are still there . it will take weeks , if not months , to recover those bodies . and like you said , the rain season is coming up . ... it 's really the worst of all cases . this is probably the one country that could not handle an event like this . i call this in some ways the perfect storm of an earthquake , given that it was large , it was very shallow , the infrastructure is extremely poor and the government was n't prepared . so i think the resulting disaster is really a combination of a number of factors working against it . cnn : describe your own personal feelings as you head down there , as haitian and as somebody who lost a loved one . desroches : i had one uncle that passed away . his was what we typically call  secondary effect .  he was found safe following the earthquake . he had been somewhat ill with prostate cancer and he had -lsb- gone -rsb- back several times to the u.s. for treatment . ... my father spoke to him shortly after the event and he was doing fine on wednesday . then , it sounds like he was n't feeling very well . on friday , i believe , he went to the hospital and clearly with all the other critical patients , they could n't really deal with him . and he died on saturday . a lot of these things are never captured during an event like an earthquake or hurricane . we call them  secondary effect ,  where a hospital is overrun and those that are ill -- maybe not directly from the earthquake -- end up dying whereas normally they probably would not . cnn : when you first talked to him , you must have been relieved that he was alive and you must have been celebrating . desroches : absolutely . another close relative , my godmother and godfather : we 've been told through their children in the u.s. that they are safe but their home has been destroyed . cnn : what 's going through your mind as you return home ? desroches : i was born in haiti . i came -lsb- to the u.s. -rsb- as a very young child . i was 1 1/2 . i spent the majority of my life in the u.s. ... but we still have a lot of family and ties to haiti . for many years , as my capacity as a civil engineering professor , i 've always wanted to do whatever i can to help haiti . and i see this as one opportunity to do that , given that i do earthquake engineering . i want to use this opportunity , not only to help them recover in the short term , but also rebuild haiti so that it 's safe and sustainable . and i think this earthquake , unfortunately , provides the opportunity to start from scratch and make it a much better , more resilient place .", "summary": " civil engineering quake expert heads to haiti to assess buildings .   reginald desroches says the quake was  really the worst of all cases    desroches is a native of haiti ; his uncle died in the quake 's aftermath .   haiti must be rebuilt  so that it 's safe and sustainable ,  he says .
