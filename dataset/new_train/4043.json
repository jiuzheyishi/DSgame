{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- the popular pope francis is taking some hits himself after some lighthearted comments that included a pretend punch to a colleague . the comments came while trying to make the point that free speech should have some limits , including on the right to insult another 's faith . speaking thursday to reporters on the plane ride to the philippines , the pope gestured with a fake punch to demonstrate what he would do if someone were to say  a swear word against my mother .  most journalists interpreted it as a joke , not a justification of violence , especially since the pope had also just forcefully stated that  one can not kill in the name of god .  still , the vatican felt the need to clarify , in response to a later cnn question about the punch , that his words were  spoken colloquially  and consistent with the pope 's  free style of speech .  i do n't for one minute think the pope is advocating for any type of violence , whether religiously motivated murder or sparring among friends who dis each other 's mamas . what concerns me is his apparent belief that religion should have special protection when it comes to free speech .  one can not provoke , one can not insult other people 's faith , one can not make fun of faith ,  he said .  there is a limit . every religion has its dignity . ... in freedom of expression there are limits .  the pope , responding to a general question about the interplay between religious liberty and free expression , was clearly referencing the massacre of journalists at charlie hebdo magazine by islamist militants in paris last week . although he did not say the slain cartoonists brought the attack upon themselves because of their satirical criticism of islam , it 's not a huge logical leap to that conclusion and raises the likelihood of such a misinterpretation . let 's just say it 's not what most public relations professionals would advise . and while the pope has been known to talk more informally with reporters on the papal plane -lrb- his  who am i to judge ?  comment about gay catholics came on the return flight from brazil in 2013 -rrb- , he 's still on the record and obviously aware that his words will be reported and analyzed . the pope is not the only prominent catholic raising the issue . bill donahue , a self-appointed spokesman fighting  anti-catholicism  as the president of the new york-based catholic league , released a statement with the headline ,  muslims have a right to be angry ,  on the day of the killings . on thursday , his statement was headlined :  pope sides with catholic league .  such chutzpah . while no one can match the offensive tone of donahue , who actually said charlie hebdo 's stephane charbonnier  did n't understand the role he played in his own death ,  the gist of the pope 's message was the same : criticism of religion is problematic . as an aside , i 'll be curious to see if those who slammed donahue have the same harsh words for the pope . perhaps both of them should take a lesson from the response of another christian , jim wallis , president of sojourners , a progressive , evangelical community and publication . he had a different suggestion for how people of faith should respond to the paris attacks : .  jesus tells us to bless those who persecute us , to return love for hate and good for evil , and even to love our enemies ,  wallis wrote .  loving your enemies certainly includes supporting the foundational commitment to free speech , and defending the right of free speech , even , or especially , for those who offend you .  i think most american catholics agree that while blasphemy -- offensive speech against god or religion -- is not particularly nice , it does not follow that it can or should be regulated or outlawed . in the united states , the supreme court outlawed blasphemy laws in 1952 . i 'm hoping the pope was only offering counsel to his followers , rather than advocating for any sort of legal position . no one has the right not to be offended . even the pope .", "summary": " heidi schlumpf : pope told reporters one ca n't insult others ' faith , expression must have limits .   she says he seems to believe religion should have special protections on free speech .   schlumpf : most u.s. catholics likely disagree -- no one has right not to be offended , even pope .
