{"text": "a popular jeep off-roader favoured by thousands of british school-run families is at the centre of a major fire safety row after u.s. officials blamed it for more than 50 deaths . car bosses have refused u.s. government demands to recall nearly three million of the 4x4s over ` deadly problems ' . defiant chrysler is refusing to recall about 2.7 million of the jeeps which safety officials says are at risk of a fuel tank fire in a rear-end collision . the siting of the 4x4s fuel tank is a ` defect ' which poses an ` unreasonable risk to safety , ' say safety chiefs -- a charge which chrysler rejects . some 23,511 of the jeep grand cherokees made between 1993 and 2004 are still on the road in the uk . the national highway traffic safety administration has now sent chrysler a letter asking that the company voluntarily recall jeep grand cherokees - which were also sold in britain -- between 1993 and 2004 . some 23,511 of the jeep grand cherokees from this period are still on the road in the uk , according to the society of motor manufacturers and traders . the recall request also affects the jeep liberty built between 2002 and 2007 , which was not sold in the uk . nhtsa found at least 32 rear-impact crashes and fires in grand cherokees that caused 44 deaths . it also found at least five rear crashes in libertys , causing seven deaths . the fire row between chrysler , its parent company fiat , and government safety chiefs was the lead item on prime time news broadcasts in the u.s. , including abc news . chrysler group llc , which is now majority-owned by italy 's fiat spa insisted in a statement on tuesday that the jeeps are safe and it ` does not intend to recall the vehicles ' . such a refusal by a car company is rare . and though the nhtsa can order a recall but needs a court order to enforce it . david strickland , the safety agency 's administrator , said in a statement that he hopes chrysler will reconsider its decision . will it be recalled ? the 1998 jeep grand cherokee limited . chrysler group llc , which is now majority-owned by italy 's fiat spa insisted in a statement on tuesday that the jeeps are safe . ` our data shows that these vehicles may contain a defect that presents an unreasonable risk to safety , ' he said . u.s. car safety chiefs opened an investigation into the jeeps in august 2010 at the request of the center for auto safety in washington . they found that the jeeps ' fuel tanks can fail when hit from the rear , leak fuel and cause fires if there 's an ignition source . the positioning of the tanks behind the rear axle and their height above the road is a design defect , it said in a letter to chrysler dated monday . chrysler moved the fuel tanks on the grand cherokee ahead of the rear axle in 2005 , and did the same thing with the liberty in 2007 . nhtsa said the older jeeps performed poorly when compared with all but one similar vehicle from the 1993 to 2007 model years : ` particularly in terms of fatalities , fires without fatalities , and fuel leaks in rear-end impacts and crashes . ' the agency calculated that the older grand cherokees and libertys have fatal crash rates that are about double those of similar vehicles . it asks chrysler to recall the vehicles and ` implement a remedy action that improves their performance in rear-impacts and crashes ' . car-makers usually agree to a recall request , partly to avoid bad publicity . in the last three years , chrysler has conducted 52 recalls . but chrysler insists its review of nearly 30 years of data shows a low number of rear-impact crashes involving fire or a fuel leak in the affected jeeps and that the the recall request is based on an ` incomplete analysis of the underlying data ' . chrysler group llc chairman and chief executive sergio marchionne insisted : ` the company stands behind the quality of its vehicles . ` all of us remain committed to continue working with nhtsa to provide information confirming the safety of these vehicles . ' the row comes as chrysler prepares to launch the latest new generation of its jeep grand cherokee which is unaffected by the safety scare . ` nhtsa seems to be holding chrysler group to a new standard for fuel tank integrity that does not exist now and did not exist when the jeep vehicles were manufactured , ' the company said . the dispute leaves owners of the affected grand cherokees and libertys waiting for government or court action . it also leaves chrysler open to the risk of big liability if there are more crashes and injuries linked to the fuel tanks , said logan robinson , a university of detroit mercy law professor and former chrysler corporate counsel . lawyers could argue that if chrysler had recalled the jeeps , people would n't have been hurt , he said . but that liability would be limited if chrysler beats nhtsa in court and a judge rules the company did n't sell defective vehicles , said robinson . chrysler called the older grand cherokees and libertys ` among the safest vehicles of their era ' saying they met all federal safety standards in effect when they were built . nhtsa 's letter concedes this but adds : ` the existence of a minimum standard does not require nhtsa to ignore deadly problems . ' chrysler has until june 18 to respond to the safety administration 's letter . nhtsa has the authority to fine companies if slow to provide data or recall vehicles . the agency fined toyota motor corp. a record $ 66million for failing to quickly report problems and for delaying a recall . toyota paid the fine without admitting it violated the law .", "summary": " car bosses refuse demands to recall nearly three million 4x4s .   officials say are at risk of a fuel tank fire in a rear-end collision .
