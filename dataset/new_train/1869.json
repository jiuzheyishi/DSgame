' the dimon family put out a christmas card every year but none so far have been so hubristic as the 2013 version . jpmorgan has paid out more than $ 13billion in fines in the past 12 months for a series of damning financial scandals -lrb- headquarters in new york pictured -rrb- .", "summary": " jamie dimon has been branded ` tone deaf '   critics say his card implies : ` hey , we 're so rich we can destroy our own stuff ' "}
