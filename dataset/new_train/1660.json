{"text": "buddy of the bees : environment secretary liz truss urges brits to stop mowing their lawns . it is a chore many could do without . and now we have government backing not to bother mowing the lawn -- because it will help bees . environment secretary liz truss will today sanction a nation of messier lawns for the benefit of our dwindling bee population . making her first major speech since she was given the cabinet position in the summer , the conservative politician will say that bees benefit from the wildflowers allowed to grow free . ` people can help pollinators in their garden at home or the local park or school space , ' she will tell an audience at the policy exchange think tank . ` oxeye daisies , lavender , primroses , cyclamen , they are just a few of the common flowers that are bee-friendly . ` i have to confess that not mowing your lawn so often is one piece of advice that i have no problem following . ' the number of wild bees in britain are thought to have halved in the last 25 years , and other pollinating insects such as butterflies and moths are also struggling . miss truss will highlight insects ' role in agriculture , where they play a vital role in pollinating crops . she will say : ` without those insects , not only would our parks , gardens and countryside be much more drab places , our food could well become less varied and some of it more expensive . ' the loss of the nectar insects feed on is partly to blame for their decline , with 97 per cent of our meadows and their carpets of wildflowers having disappeared since the 1930s . the new national pollinator strategy , published today , encourages farmers to cultivate strips of land for wildflowers . and schools , businesses and local authorities are asked to plant nectar-rich plants on their land . but householders are also asked to do their bit , by allowing a patch of land to grow wild , selecting bee-friendly plants , or simply allowing part of their lawn to grow go un-mown . experts advise that lawns not be cut after september to protect bumble bee nests in the grass . it also allows caterpillars nesting in the ground to survive until spring . by not mowing lawns and allowing wildflowers to grow , britain can help the dwindling bee population . those who have space could even allow parts of their lawn to grow wild year-round , the strategy says . a recent project conducted by at two sites owned by thames water found that cutting the grass less often and instead sowing wild flower seed boosted bee numbers by 37 per cent . miss truss will also call for a new debate over the environment , which until now been a polarised ` slanging match ' between ` hippies and gas-guzzlers ' . defending the coalition 's environmental record , she will insist that she and her colleagues are still committed to their pledge to be the ` greenest government ever ' . she will say : ` to achieve that , the debate has to get beyond experts and special interest groups , beyond targets and summits , beyond the polarised slanging match we so often hear : you 're an alarmist or a denier , a hippy or a gas-guzzler . ` the reality is different . we are making environmental and economic progress . they are not just compatible - they depend on each other . ' bee a friend : bees play a vital role in pollinating crops , but the number of wild insects is thought to have halved in the last 25 years . she will also call for a new approach to the environment , with fewer restrictions and greater enjoyment . ` ever since can remember , the environment has been presented as something worthy . ` it 's been all about behaving yourself : sort out your rubbish or else ; feel guilty about buying more stuff ; take fewer flights . ` it 's all been about having less but it can -- and should -- be about having more . ` a clean , beautiful , healthy natural environment is about more jobs and greater prosperity , contributing to our long-term economic plan , our wellbeing and our future security . ' green groups last night praised the minister 's rhetoric , but said she needs to match it with action . andrew pendleton , head of campaigns at friends of the earth , said : ` this action plan is an important step towards safeguarding britain 's bees and other pollinators - but unless it properly tackles the impact of pesticides and helps all farmers to develop bee-friendly practices its effectiveness will be significantly undermined . ` tens of thousands of people have backed friends of the earth 's bee cause campaign for a national action plan . they will expect a robust strategy capable of saving our bees . ` bees are crucial pollinators for our farms , gardens and countryside -- failure to protect them from every threat they face will have a costly impact on us all .
