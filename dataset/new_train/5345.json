{"text": "john redwood says david cameron is misleading the country by claiming to have slashed the deficit . david cameron is ` misleading ' the public by bragging about having slashed the nation 's budget deficit , a former conservative cabinet minister said yesterday . john redwood said the boast -- repeated in the pm 's new year message -- risked fooling people into thinking that the nation 's debt was coming under control at a time when borrowing is still running at more than # 100billion a year , because many voters did not know the difference between the debt and the deficit . it came as business leaders warned the economy was in danger of reaching a ` point of no return ' unless ministers slashed red tape and fast-tracked infrastructure projects to boost growth . and labour warned that the government . was on course to miss the target set by former chancellor alistair . darling to halve the deficit -- the amount by which the government 's . expenditure exceeds its revenue -- by next year . mr . redwood , who was an economic adviser to mr cameron in opposition , has . persistently called for deeper cuts to both taxes and spending in order . to boost the economy . ministers now routinely trot out the statistic that they have cut the huge deficit left by labour by a quarter . while . this is accurate , mr redwood said it could ` mislead ' people into . thinking the national debt is falling , when it is still rising fast . ` polling shows that many think there have been big spending cuts in the uk and that the debt is now falling , ' he said . ` the truth is all too different . the uk is still running a deficit of over # 100billion a year . ` current public spending has been increased by this government . that means that the uk state is still adding to our debts by more than # 100billion again this year , or by nearly # 1,700 for every man , woman and child in the country . ` meanwhile total state debt exceeds # 1,000 billion , excluding the state banks ' debts , private finance initiatives , public private partnerships and various pension items . david cameron repeated his claim that the government is tackling the country 's deficit in his new year 's message . ` that 's nearly # 17,000 per person of debt already racked up . all these debts have to be repaid one day . ` this generation is building up debt to live beyond our means , in the hope that our children will come along and be able to pay it back , or be able to refinance it at sensible interest rates . ' yesterday , john longworth , director general of the british chambers of commerce , said dramatic ` once-in-a-century ' measures were needed to head off the threat of terminal decline , adding : ` support those businesses that are looking to venture into new markets by improving access to finance and reducing red tape , and focus on the businessmen and women of the future . otherwise it could be a case of too little , much too late . ' a treasury spokesman insisted the economic programme was ` on the right track ' , with more than a million jobs created since 2010 . he added the chancellor had outlined a growth package , including tax cuts for 24million basic-rate payers .", "summary": " john redwood says national debt is still rising fast .   prime minister is in danger of ` misleading ' the public .   deeper cuts to both taxes and spending needed , he argues .
