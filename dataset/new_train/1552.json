{"text": "madonna has been accused of ` betraying ' the family of her adopted daughter mercy - as they issued a desperate plea to be allowed to see her . the grandparents of mercy james have accused the star of cutting them out of her life and failing to meet a promise to keep her close to her roots . they also attacked ` white foreigners ' for taking children away from africa . saxon maunde , grandfather of mercy james who was adopted by madonna in 2009 , told mailonline : ` nobody has told me a thing about mercy being in the country or about her welfare since she left us . ` she has my blood flowing in her veins . it is preposterous that i am not made aware of anything regarding her development . ' the 69-year-old , who ekes out a living selling pots from a roadside stall , added that madonna had , ` broken my heart and hearts of my family members , ' saying that , ` she has shown no humanity at all towards us . ' ` betrayal ' : the grandparents of mercy james , pictured in the straw hat with madonna on her visit to malawi yesterday , have accused the star of reneging on a promise to let them see her . regrets : saxon maunde , mercy james ' grandfather , told mailonline he bitterly regrets agreeing to allow madonna to adopt his granddaughter . thriving : mercy james , pictured yesterday on her visit to malawi , was adopted in 2009 by madonna after a high court agreed that the star did not need to be resident in malawi for 18months prior to becoming a parent , but her family are upset that they have not seen her since . bitter : mercy 's 69-year-old grandfather , who ekes out a living selling pots from a roadside stall , told mailonline that the first time he heard mercy james was in the country was via mailonline and in newspaper reports . saxon maunde originally backed madonna 's bid to adopt his granddaughter because he believed she would get a good education , and convinced his reluctant ex-wife to agree the adoption papers . but today , as madonna visits malawi with mercy james , he said he bitterly regrets his decision and accused madonna of kidnapping a child of africa . he said : ` white foreigners who decide to take our children away from africa have no understanding of our culture . ` they do n't realise that in our african families each one has a responsibility to the others . if a half-brother or half-sister does well , they share their fortunes with all of the others . ' a child like my granddaughter mercy , if she succeeds in her career , she is expected to share that success with all of us . that is how our extended family system works . ' because of that system , he believed mercy was being given the chance of a lifetime to travel to america for her schooling and would then return to help her family in africa . ' i worked for a household years ago where a foreign lady took one of the children to be educated and brought up abroad , and that child came back as a doctor and improved the lives of every member of the family . that is what persuaded me to let mercy go . ` now i see that all she meant was that she would bring her here on holiday , stay in an expensive lodge for foreigners , and cut us -- her real blood family -- out of her life . that can not be the right way to do things . no foreigner has the right to interfere in our culture like this . ' his thoughts were echoed by his ex-wife lucy chekechiwa , also 69 , who fears she may never see her granddaughter again . ' i am now old and sickly , ' she said . ' i do n't want to die before seeing my daughter . ' chekechiwa and maunde 's teenage daughter died days after mercy 's birth and so the family placed her at the orphanage because they could not take care of her . a tearful chekechiwa said : ` we planned to take her back when she reached the age of six when she could eat solid food . but we were told a rich lady wanted to adopt her . we resisted at first but government officials convinced us this was good for chifundo 's future . we never thought we will not see our daughter again . maunde says he now bitterly regrets signing the papers that allowed the 56-year-old pop star to adopt mercy , whose teenage mother mwandida , died days after giving birth . ` by putting a distance between mercy and me and members of my family , she is being extremely unfair . madonna , pictured with children mercy james and david banda yesterday , both nine , who she adopted from the african nation , has already helped to fund 10 schools in the country and her charitable efforts are not yet finished . visiting malawi : madonna brought mercy james to gumulira village , about 80 km -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- from the malawian capital lilongwe in april 2010 but mercy did not see her family then . ` please let us see our daughter ' : saxon maunde , mercy james ' grandfather , pictured over the weekend , just wants to see his granddaughter . poverty : the grandfather of mercy james , saxon maunde , pictured this weekend , ekes out a living selling pots but is not looking for any handout from madonna , he says he simply wants to see mercy . anger : david banda , madonna 's first adopted child , saw his father on a visit to the orphanage where he used to live during the visit to malawi last week . ` we are extremely poor , but we do not need her money , ' he added . ' a simple acknowledgement that we exist , that we are humans with feelings and that we do not wish to be disconnected from our child will be enough . ` what has happened to our family should be a lesson to anyone who may be approached by madonna with promises to make lives of children better . ' his guilt is compounded because it was he who convinced his reluctant family to let mercy go . his now estranged wife , lucy , fought to keep mercy as a court battle raged over her fate four years ago . lucy said : ' i did n't want her to go but as a family we had to sit down and reach an agreement and we agreed that mercy should go . ` the men insisted that mercy be adopted and i wo n't resist anymore . i still love mercy . she is my dearest . ' now maunde says he made a mistake when he facilitated madonna 's adoption of mercy some four years ago . he has never accepted money from madonna and is not looking for any - he says he simply wants to see his daughter . ` we did not donate our child to madonna . we let madonna have our child because we were told she is a philanthropist who would help give her a good education . ` what is the point of us wanting mercy to get a good education and a good life if in the end she does not help her relatives ? ' with her adopted children mercy james and david banda , also nine , the material girl has been visiting the east african nation to see the efforts of her charity raising malawi , first hand . her 14-year-old son rocco ritchie also joined them on visits to schools and hospitals in the country where she funds a number of orphanages , including home of hope in the western border district of mchinji where she adopted david , and kondanani children 's home in the southern tea-growing district of thyolo . on friday the pop legend met with malawian president peter mutharika at the country 's state house and later announced her plans to build 300 schools across malawi . she also found time for david to visit his father yohande , who farms tomatoes and maize in the central border district of mchinji . looking to adopt again ? madonna , centre , poses for a picture yesterday with children in kasungu , about 150 kilometers north of the malawian capital lilongwe . charity work : madonna poses for a picture with children in kasungu yesterday , about 150 kilometers north of the malawian capital lilongwe , where she has been working since 2006 with her non profit organization , raising malawi . forgiven : madonna had her ` vvip ' status restored by malawi after being called ` arrogant ' by the country 's president in april last year . yesterday she played with her daughter mercy as the girl 's family issued a plea to see her . ` you have grown so big , ' banda senior told his son as they bonded over a game of football . banda , who has since remarried and has another son , brought his son some gifts , including groundnuts and onions , in keeping with malawian custom . but the news of this visit has only added to the heartbreak for mercy 's grandmother . ` why do they always take the other child -lrb- david -rrb- to his people and not chifundo to us , ' chekechiwa asked , using her malawian name which translates to mercy . ` what 's the difference ? is it because the other one is a boy why my daughter is a girl ? ' she added that she fought to keep mercy as a court battle raged over her fate five years ago . after protracted legal wrangling madonna was allowed to keep mercy , who she spotted during a visit to an orphanage with her then husband guy ritchie in 2006 . mercy 's uncle , peter baneti - who also signed off mercy 's adoption papers in 2009 - said he was not sure whether or not he regretted signing off the papers . he said : ' i met madonna in court and she assured me she would be bringing back my niece every other two years . was she lying to me ? this was in court . ` government officials are my witness for they were translating our conversation . ' baneti , a tobacco farmer , said he does n't know how to explain the situation to the family . he said : ` they are all looking to me for answers because i am the one who signed the papers . what should i be telling them ? ' baneti also said that mercy has a lot of cousins who want to see her - but are confused by her new life of luxury . he said : ` we tell them they have a cousin who is living oversees with a famous rich woman . they wonder why this famous rich woman should allow them to live in abject poverty while their cousin is living big . ` this is not good for mercy herself . what will she think when she discovers her people are wallowing in poverty ? ' a representative for madonna had not responded to requests for comment by the time of publication .", "summary": " mercy james ' grandparents say they are desperate to see their little girl .   they accuse star of betraying promise to keep her close to her roots .   grandfather : ` she has my blood flowing in her veins , i want to see her '   ` white foreigners who take our children have no understanding of our culture '   discovered mercy was in malawi thanks to mailonline and newspapers .   madonna ` is giving mercy good schooling but we want to see her ' "}
