{"text": "thousands of you sent in your protests against a&e closures -- and this week we delivered two bulging mailbags full of your demands to david cameron 's doorstep . nearly 30,000 mail on sunday readers have called for the government to reverse the policy of downgrading and axeing local casualty departments across england and wales . a total of 28,619 protests were lodged -- 17,170 coupons , 7,377 emails and 4,072 text messages -- all prompted by fears that the policy for big , centralised a&e departments could risk lives as it leads to longer journey times to hospital . sackful of protests : mos reporter nick craven hands in your petition to no. 10 . as your protests reached downing street , it emerged that : . a london ambulance spokeswoman last night confirmed that the hard-pressed service is currently spending # 60,000 each weekend on the private firms , plus unspecified further sums at what she termed ` busy periods ' . yet under the closure plans , london is set to lose no fewer than seven casualty departments -lrb- one has already been lost -rrb- . this will hugely increase the burden on the ambulance service . critical : campaigners say changes are about cuts , not a better a&e service . as as well as travelling longer distances after answering 999 calls , it will have to pick up seriously ill patients who turn up at the so-called ` urgent care centres ' which are set to replace a&e s but in reality can not treat any life-threatening conditions . at just one of the hospitals where a&e is due to close , ealing , there is already an urgent care centre which transfers up to 50 patients a day to casualty . currently , this is a short journey down a corridor , but if casualty closes , as planned , all the patients will have to be transferred by blue-light ambulance to an a&e somewhere else , probably west middlesex 20 minutes away , or northwick park , 45 minutes away . ` there is a limit to what paramedics can do ' the ambulance service spokeswoman said that it hoped to be able to recruit new staff , and would discuss how to fund the extra demands a&e closures would create once a final decision on the cuts had been made . yet the ambulance service is facing steep cuts itself , with a requirement to slash # 53 million -- or 19 per cent -- of its budget by 2015/16 , which will include the loss of 560 front-line staff . the pressure on paramedics is not confined to london . alan bush , who has recently retired after 35 years as a paramedic in newark , notts , where the a&e closed early last year , said : ` the closure meant we had to drive much further , and often you would n't know which hospital you were supposed to take a patient to . ` there is a limit to what paramedics can do . travelling further means you have to provide more treatment to try to keep a patient stable . on the other hand , you ca n't do much when you 're hurtling along at 70mph . ' on average , it now takes emergency patients from newark almost two hours after a 999 call to be handed over to an a&e department . a&e scandal : readers want the policy of downgrading and axeing casualty departments reversed . meanwhile , casualty departments in london will face a huge increase of 47 per cent in the number of residents they will each serve if the closures go through , it was forecast last night . new analysis shows that if the 32 a&e departments which existed in 2010 are cut to 24 across the capital , the number of people in the average catchment area will soar from 255,000 to 375,000 in 2020 , once forecast population increases are taken into account . labour 's city hall health spokesman , murad qureshi , who compiled the analysis , said : ` londoners face being caught in a pincer of far fewer a&e s and a thinly stretched ambulance service . it is truly shocking that the government has left the nhs in such a mess . ' but an nhs london spokesman said : ` any changes to nhs services will be led by clinicians , and local people will be fully consulted . clinicians would not recommend change unless it improves patient care . ` hundreds of lives have already been saved by treating life threatening injuries in fewer specialist centres and expert stroke units . ' under pressure : prime minister david cameron and health secretary , jeremy hunt , right , must act now . last week , we revealed how a powerful lobby of 140 senior physicians , academics and surgeons signed an open letter to david cameron calling for an end to the ` indiscriminate ' closure of a&e units that will affect 26 hospitals . their letter accused health chiefs driving through changes just to save money , rather than for valid clinical reasons . the a&e closure in one area where the department is under threat , according to an official poll.campaigners say the result undermines the local nhs chiefs ' claim that their plan is supported by clinicians -- an assertion repeated last month in newspaper advertisements designed to convince patients that closure would be a good idea . they were placed by nhs north west london , where four out of nine existing casualty departments are set to close , including the one at ealing hospital . a public ` consultation ' on this plan ended last week , with a decision expected early next year . but new figures from an official poll of gps carried out as part of the consultation disclose that in ealing only four per cent of the doctors -- or one in 25 -- supported ` option a ' , the choice being backed by nhs bosses which involves the closure of the local a&e . more ... one in 10 babies born within 24-week abortion limit lives to see their first birthday , official figures show . less than half of the doctors eligible to vote did so . however , of those that did , 54.2 per cent backed ` option c ' , under which ealing a&e would stay open . ` the claim that the closure has clinical support is simply misleading , ' local campaigner colin standfield told the mail on sunday . he also called into question the way the survey was framed , as there was no option given for keeping all of the hospitals ' a&e departments open . ` it was a case of  which poison do you prefer , strychnine , arsenic or cyanide ?  ' he said . axe : ealing hospital is one of four casualty departments set to close in north west london . he added that he and his fellow campaigners , including many doctors , are now consulting lawyers and intend to launch a high court challenge if the closure plan is ratified . ` if this should go ahead , we would be looking at going for a judicial review , ' he added . in nhs north west london spokesman said it was ` not true ' that the proposals lacked clinical support , saying : ` all medical directors of all the trusts in north west london have publicly signed up to the case for change . ' he said the gp survey was ` all part of listening to concerns raised during consultation , and we are now analysing the thousands of responses we have had to see how we should develop our recommendations ' . the doctors ' opposition has been shared by ealing council which has called on the government to scrap the ` half-baked ' plans to downgrade local hospital services . the labour-run council 's cabinet held a special meeting to discuss a report from former nhs executive tim rideout , which raised serious concerns about the closures and dismissed the business case from health bosses as fundamentally flawed . the council has also joined authorities from across west london to deliver 60,000 signatures in protest to nhs north west london headquarters . councillor jasbir anand , ealing leader for health and adult services , said : ` we wo n't gamble with our health or be bystanders as our hospital services are dismantled . '", "summary": " we deliver your protests to the door of downing street .   overstretched ambulance service already pays # 3m a year to cover gaps .   london casualty units will have to cover massive 47 per cent more patients .   london ambulance service is already paying more than # 3 million a year to private ambulance firms because it can not cope with demand -- a problem that will only get worse as journey times increase to more distant a&e s.   a survey revealed that only four per cent of gps in one area backed the closure of their local casualty unit , as favoured by the nhs .   changes in london could result in a massive 47 per increase in the number of people served by each a&e department .
