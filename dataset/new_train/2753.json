{"text": "stranded in the unforgiving expanses of niger 's sahara desert after their vehicles broke down , scores of people , almost all of them women and children , slowly died of thirst . the migrants had been trying to reach algeria , azaoua mahaman of the synergie nongovernmental organization said thursday . instead , they died of dehydration , unable to escape the sandy wastes of the sahel . a total of 92 bodies have been found , niger security forces told cnn on thursday . synergie earlier put the number found at 87 . many of the bodies were severely decomposed and appeared to have been partially eaten by animals . the travelers were hoping to find a better life for themselves in algeria , trying to escape the extreme poverty and economic hardships in niger , said mahaman . their story is the latest tragedy to befall migrants trying to leave behind a woeful existence for opportunities elsewhere . others who have survived the arduous journey from sub-saharan africa to the continent 's northern shores have drowned as they tried to cross the mediterranean in overcrowded boats , with europe in their sights . for many of niger 's 16 million or so people , life is not easy . the population is one of the fastest growing in the world , but the large , landlocked country is prone to political instability and natural disasters , according to the world bank . droughts , floods and locust infestation all contribute to the country 's chronic food insecurity -- and the poverty rate is one of the highest in the world . the world bank puts the annual per-capita income at just $ 360 , and the country lies second from bottom in the u.n. 's human development index . less than 30 % of adults are literate , and life expectancy is only 57.5 years . ` extremely dry and difficult conditions ' faced with these tough conditions , many decide to leave . this has turned niger 's desert north into a major transit area for migrants , according to the international organization for migration , and many human smugglers operate there . algeria and libya are the final destinations for some travelers , while others seek to reach europe , said laura lungarotti , migrant assistance regional specialist in the iom 's west and central africa office in senegal . most are from niger , although others also come from central and western africa . once they embark on their journeys , they face  extremely dry and difficult conditions ,  she said . those who get stranded in the desert face a challenge to survive . part of the problem is that many would-be migrants are stopped by algerian or libyan authorities and are expelled back over the border into niger 's desert , lungarotti said . some of those kicked out are transported directly to two transit centers run by the iom -- outposts in the desert where the migrants can receive food , water and first aid . others manage to make their own way there . despite the dangers , the migrants ' numbers have been increasing since the beginning of this year , lungarotti said . over the past 10 months , more than 15,000 from niger and 1,300 from other countries have reached the two transit centers -- one in arlit , closer to algeria , and the other in dirkou , nearer to the libyan border . some who 've made their way back from libya have told of being held in detention where they suffered harsh treatment , lungarotti said . before libya 's revolution overthrew the regime of strongman moammar gadhafi two years ago , many migrants from niger worked in its construction and agricultural sectors . but the instability forced many out . the recent conflict in northern mali also sent about 60,000 refugees over the border into niger , according to the european community humanitarian office , adding to the pressure on its meager resources . 220 km sahara desert run : ` the toughest race on earth ' journalist ibbo daddy abdoulaye in niger contributed to this report .", "summary": " bodies of 92 people have been found in the sahara desert , say security officials .   niger 's northern desert has become a major transit area for migrants , says group .   the migrants , almost all of them women and children , died of dehydration .   niger , one of the poorest countries in the world , has a fast-growing population .
