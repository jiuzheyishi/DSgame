' but that does n't mean there has n't been heartache . the mississippi native lost a parent at the tender age of 4 when his father was killed during a game of dice . to date , he 's also lost his sister to murder , a son to aids and his mother . it appeared that harris , who recalls sometimes having nothing to eat but discarded bones from the butcher as a child , was going to skirt what looks a lot like a family curse when he was discovered by the wwf in 1982 . kamala was actually a 6-foot-7 mississippi native , but he terrified audiences as an ` idi amin-inspired ' african cannibal who often took on legends like andre the giant in the 1980s and the undertaker in the 1990s . his character did n't speak and was accompanied by a keeper named kim chee -lrb- left -rrb- . harris saw great success in the pro wrestling world , but says he was paid only a tiny fraction of his banner name opponents . he quickly rose to fame as the silent , shirtless cannibal from afar -- whose 6-foot-7 frame and girthy build struck fear in children and adults alike -- accompanied by a man named kim chee . that man , whose real name is kenny casanova , is the mind behind his kickstarter and book . casanova believes harris -- who has a 9th grade education -- lost out the soaring salaries of wwf headliners like hogan and the undertaker and is now paying the price . ` if i had been a better talker , if i 'd have known how to negotiate , that probably would 've helped me , ' harris told bleacher report . today , harris lives on a meager government check following the loss of both his legs to years of diabetes . and his wife has recently been laid off from her job of nearly 30 years . ' i figured kamala 's story alone in book form could be one answer to lost earnings , ' casanova writes on the kickstarter page . if written correctly , it could mean great supplemental income for kamala for years to come . so , i picked up the phone and made the call . ' kamala speaks : in order to right what he sees as a wrong , kim chee aka kenny casanova , decided to try to help harris earn a few bucks by telling his unbelievable life story in a biography . old friends : ` many huge wrestling names came together to provide quotes , stories and additional content for this project , to help create an autobiography like you have never read before , ' casanove writes in his kickstarter page for the biography project . today , the book is done and -- like harris himself -- tries to focus on the positive . the biography of harris focuses on , according to casanova 's kickstarter page : . and , as harris says : . ` do n't feel sorry for me , if you want to , encourage me . embrace me . i 'm going to be all right -- just like i 've always been .
