' she then asked police commissioner mike bush , ` what do you feed them ? ' and ` can they see yet ? ' it was a typically wet wellington day as the couple visited the college , where they were greeted by claps and cheers from the crowd , before being given a tour and meeting some furry police recruits . the duchess of cambridge tenderly pats a much bigger police dog at the royal new zealand police college . a present for george : when the duchess was given a soft plush toy intended for george from a young girl , kate replied ` he 'll love it ' the german shepherd puppies were born on april 4 and were the first litter of dtc bitch gucci and stud dog borg , via artificial insemination . after holding the puppies , the royal couple met three lots of foster families and the police dogs they 're helping to train up , who were all lapping water up off the parade ground . the first was three-year-old yana . kate asked foster mum sharon nicholas the dog 's age and said , ` she 's sweet . ' the duchess asked , ` how has she coped ? ' and , ` how did you get involved ? ' she asked melony weallens about her foster dog winta , ` who 's this then ? ' and , ` what age did you get her ? is she your only dog ? she 's so sweet . do they need a lot of exercise ? ' . melony said of her daughter cadence , 16 , ` she 's taken winta for more walks since she heard she was going to meet the royals . ' getting wet : a police offer got caught in the downpour as the royal couple lay a wreath in honour of officers killed on duty . staying dry : the cambridges are sheltered by an umbrella as they lay the wreath . the royal couple took a moment to pay their respects . the final foster family was john and sarah bole with daughters morgan , 14 , madison , 10 , and monet , 8 , with dog gessy , four months . kate asked , ` how old is gessy ? was she tiny when you got her ? ' the girls gave kate a stuffed-toy police dog for george . kate said , ` aww , that 's so sweet . he 'll love it . does it have a name ? maybe we should call it gessy . sorry we could n't bring george . he was asleep . he 's a very podgy ba' the college 's kapa haka -lrb- maori cultural -rrb- group also gave an impromptu performance of singing in the rain - a tribute to the appalling weather - which had the royals couple in stitches . they then segued into a traditional maori tune with a poi dancer performing . shortly before morning tea , wills and kate were presented with police one-piece for george that read ` junior recruit ' . wills said  fantastic . brilliant . he 'll love that . thank you . will it fit him ? he 's grown ! ' kate agreed , adding : ` he 's grown lots ! ' all smiles : despite the unfortunate weather the cambridges smiled broadly as they were greeted by crowds at the police college outside wellington . sight for sore eyes : despite the rain the waiting crowds clapped , cheered and took photos as the couple arrived . they later met a little girl with an inoperable brain tumour , iris pouau , from porirua , who had turned seven yesterday . she wore hundreds of beads representing the number of times shed had surgical procedures and presented kate with a bouquet of purple irises . she also held a toy dog that police had given her yesterday for her birthday . kate : ` it 's very nice to meet you . how old are you ? ' looking at the toy dog , she added ` he 's very cute . have you seen the puppies outside ? you 've been a very , very good girl . ' the duchess also talked to iris ' mum darlene tuiono , 43 . asked when the kids ` break up for their easter holiday ' . darlene mentioned it was iris ' birthday yesterday . kate replied : ` oh , she did n't tell me that ! iris , did you have a good day ? happy birthday ! ' william added : ` you 're very pretty today . it was lovely to meet you . ' wet dog : william gave a police dog who 'd got caught in the downpour a gentle scratch . afterwards william and kate conducted a walkabout in wellington , enjoying the largest turn-out of their trip so far . a huge crowd bid a very vocal fond farewell to the duke and duchess at civic square . the couple shook hands and spoke with hundreds of people , especially small children , senior citizens and the disabled , before and after signing the city 's visitors ' book . george 's first proposal offer : a small child is dressed in a one-piece printed with the words ` marry me george ' as the royals are farewelled from new zealand . william accepted a rather squashed block of cadbury dairy milk chocolate , saying : ` we 'll like that ! ' rachel scott , 46 , from derbyshire , now wellington , showed the prince a picture of him doing work experience at chatsworth house in the uk eight years ago with her father , john reilly . she said : ` he used to see william every day for two weeks and the prince would ask him every morning , ` where should i park ? ' my dad would say , ` because it 's you , you can park anywhere but the disabled spot . you do n't look very disabled . ' ` william would park his car and then pretend to hobble across the car park . ` william was just seeing kate at the time and my dad would ask , ` so william , have you got any crumpet at the moment ? ' he 'd reply , ' i could n't possibly comment . ' getting sleepy : the german shepard appeared to tire of his royal cuddle , as kate asked dog handlers what the puppies are fed and if they can see yet .", "summary": " the cambridges waved goodbye at wellington airport as they boarded flight bound for australia today .   it 's usually kate who holds prince george in public , but it was finally william 's turn .   earlier they visited royal new zealand police college in the small city of porirua .   it 's the last of their 10-day tour of new zealand , with the couple due to land in australia in the afternoon .   follow live updates from the daily mail 's royal correspondent rebecca english in sydney on twitter .   send your pictures of the royal tour to australiaroyal@mailonline.com .
