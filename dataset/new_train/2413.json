{"text": "on separate trips to guatemala and zambia in the late 1980s and in the early 2000s , we each saw the devastating effect of the water and sanitation crisis firsthand . we saw a world in which basic needs went drastically unmet -- where a lack of safe water and sanitation robbed men , women and children of health , hope and even life . in the time it takes us to fill a glass of water -- about 21 seconds -- a child in some part of the world has died because of water-related disease . watch video : gary white on the ubiquitous force . the disturbing fact is that we 've known how to deliver safe water and basic sanitation to people for more than 100 years . so , why are people still dying today because of it ? can you imagine if we had a cure for hiv/aids and millions of people continue to perish because of the inability to deliver treatment ? it would be outrageous . yet , more than 3.4 million people die each year from water , sanitation and hygiene-related causes . most of these illnesses and deaths can be prevented . for example , diarrhea remains the second-leading cause of death among children younger than 5 globally . nearly one in five child deaths -- about 1.5 million each year -- is because of diarrhea . it kills more young children than aids , malaria and measles combined . knowledge of that alarming reality drove us to action . in 2009 , we co-founded water.org , an organization dedicated to ending this crisis in our lifetime . from the beginning , we focused on finding solutions that wo n't depend solely upon charity . we came up with watercredit , which applies the principles of microfinance to the water and sanitation sector . through the program , individuals take affordable , small loans to finance the water and/or sanitation solution that works for them . according to our internal analysis , we 've empowered more than 1 million people to gain access to safe water or sanitation . our research also shows that investment in watercredit reaches five to 10 times as many people as a traditional grant over a 10-year period . at the current rate , we believe we could end the global water and sanitation crisis for nearly 100 million people by 2020 . safe water and toilets change everything . when you see the difference it makes in a community , it 's the difference between night and day . we met lively , excited children , and women moving with ease and natural , joyful energy . we spent time with a group of children at a school where they demonstrated hand-washing techniques and talked about the important things in life -- their classrooms , their teachers and friends . we know about muddumare , who was living with many family members in in a village outside of a rapidly growing city in india .  we have 16 people in the house . five years ago , we constructed our home by taking out a loan but we did not build a toilet . nobody had a toilet in the village , and no one thought about having one in the house ,  said muddumare .  all of us used to go out in the open for defecation . but now as the population is increasing , there is no space for this .  muddumare said his children are all becoming more educated and doing more  modern  work . he questioned how he and the family could go on defecating out in the open . given the progress the world around him was making , it seemed ironic to him that his family did not have a toilet in the home . muddumare made the decision to construct a toilet to make life better for his family . by taking out a watercredit loan of 7,000 rupees -lrb- $ 112 u.s. dollars -rrb- from water.org 's local microfinance partner , the organization for the development of people , he was able to build a toilet . he has 3 acres of land where he grows groundnuts , sorghum and finger millet . the yield from his crops helps him earn money , which he uses to repay the loan amount in easy monthly installments . having a toilet means his family no longer was hindered by the time-consuming and physical constraints of open defecation . the change improved productivity and restored dignity . for many others , it saved health and transformed lives . we hope that in the coming year , more organizations , both in the private and public sector , will double down on water and sanitation-related investments . together , we can accelerate the pace of progress against the enormous but solvable crisis . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of matt damon and gary white .", "summary": " matt damon , gary white : millions die each year from lack of safe water and sanitation .   damon , white : with watercredit program , we could help end the global water crisis .   they say clean water access improve productivity , restore dignity and transform lives .   damon , white : we hope more people will get involved with this big but solvable crisis .
