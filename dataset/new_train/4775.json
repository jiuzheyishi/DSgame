{"text": "brussels , belgium as nato prepares to take over the libya mission , alliance officials said friday they are considering a broader role that goes beyond enforcement of a no-fly zone . after days of acrimonious discussion , nato officials hailed their decision to take command as swift and historic and vowed a  seamless  transition of leadership from the united states to nato , which could happen as early as sunday .  in the course of a single week nato allies have launched both the arms embargo and the no-fly zone operations ,  said nato spokeswoman oana lungescu .  this is a clear demonstration of the allies commitment to fulfill their obligations under the u.n. mandate and to show their resolve to do what it takes to protect the people of libya .  but whether nato will assume the role of protecting civilians on the ground -- as mandated by a u.n. security council resolution -- remains at issue . the operational heart of the mission could hinge on if and when to intervene with airstrikes when civilians appear to be at risk . a decision on what nato officials are calling  no-fly plus  could come as early as sunday after a meeting of nato ambassadors . nato and u.s. officials say discussions are ongoing to bring the entire mission under nato control . a senior american administration official said that while countries have agreed nato will take over the rest of the mission ,  there are a couple more steps in the planning process that will need to be taken .  a senior u.s. defense official said that nato 's announcement  has not caused any change to our operations .   they 're just taking over an operation that 's for the most part , already established ,  the official explained . beyond that , tense exchanges are also expected at a summit in london next week , where officials will try to lay out how far they are willing to go militarily against moammar gadhafi .  we expect that ministers will set the wide political guidance at next week 's international conference in london to take forward the implementation of the un security council resolution 1973 ,  lungescu said . the main question , the officials said , is whether nato forces should attack gadhafi 's military as part of the mission to protect civilians . the turkish contingent is arguing for the most limited interpretation of what is allowed under the u.n. resolution .  the tricky question is when you have a situation where his forces are advancing on some positions rebels hold , do you hit ?  a senior u.s. official asked .  if there are forces that are trying to get through rebel forces to kill people , there are some in the alliance like the turks who said , ` we did n't sign up for that . ' there are those like the french who are saying , ` of course we did .  the u.s. official said the obama administration 's interpretation is to do whatever is required to protect civilians . in the rush to quickly protect civilians from gadhafi 's forces closing on benghazi , the sources said that some countries and arab league secretary general amre moussa might have not fully understood what  any means necessary  meant . officials and diplomats said they are confident the rules of engagement can be worked out over the weekend before nato takes command .  let 's just give it a day or two and see where things stand ,  the senior defense official said . overall nato command will be based in naples , italy , but turkey has agreed to allow a sub-command stationed at an airbase in izmir , turkey . nato is already supervising naval embargo operations from naples . the alliance said friday that canadian lt. gen. charlie bouchard , stationed in naples , will take the lead for the libya mission . the turkish air component will help give nato the credibility it seeks in taking military action against a muslim nation . the tone of mission , however , already seems to have shifted , with nato commanders attempting to enforce the u.n. resolution to the letter of the law .  no-fly zones are impartial , there is no one authorized to fly within that zone ,  said group captain geoffrey booth of nato 's air force command .  it is not necessarily pro-gadhafi or anti-gadhafi forces . it 's the impartial enforcement in line with the -lrb- resolution -rrb- .  cnn 's chris lawrence and elise labott contributed to this report .", "summary": " nato is assuming command of the libya mission .   it is considering whether to go beyond enforcement of the no-fly zone .   at issue is whether the alliance will assume the role of protecting civilians on the ground .
