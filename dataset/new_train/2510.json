{"text": "with my 3-year-old twins in tow , i navigated several steep flights of subway stairs , managed four train transfers , and arrived safely at the museum of natural history in manhattan . i took photos of them in front of the giant apatosaurus skeleton and imparted -lrb- probably erroneous , but who cares ? -rrb- facts about the jurassic era . i am the best . mother . ever ! to top off the special day , i decided to treat them to an educational toy at the gift shop . my son theo wanted an astronaut , so i brought him to the space display and let him choose between three astronaut-themed items -lrb- i 'm so smart to give my preschooler a sense of control by offering him a choice ! -rrb- .  no , astronaut !  he began to whine .  this is an astronaut ,  i said brightly , pointing to one of the helmeted play figures .  no !  he then slapped all the items out of my hand and began screaming . ten minutes later , after theo had stomped on a dozen packages of freeze-dried ice cream , i tucked one boy under each arm and staggered out . i am the worst mother ever , i said to myself , embarrassed , drained , and near tears . 5 tantrum stoppers that actually work . turns out , the scene at the museum was not all my fault , and it does n't mean my boy is  bad ,  either . michael potegal , ph.d. , a pediatric neuropsychologist at the university of minnesota , in minneapolis , has spent the latest part of his professional career studying tantrums and how and why young children have such brutally emotional explosions . and what has he learned in that time ? that their outbursts are as normal a biological response to anger and frustration as a yawn is to fatigue . so normal , in fact , that you can make a science out of the progression of a tantrum and predict one down to the second . kids from about 18 months to 4 years are simply hardwired to misbehave , he says . and that means  nurture  -lrb- i.e. , you -rrb- is n't always to blame . 8 discipline mistakes parents make . the mush behind the madness : your tot 's noggin . let 's take a quick tour of the human brain , stopping at a little blob of gray matter behind the eyebrows called the prefrontal cortex -lrb- pfc -rrb- . this is the part of the brain that regulates emotion and controls social behavior . it 's also the last area of the brain to develop ; it has only just begun to mature at age 4 . that immaturity -- as difficult as it makes parenting a toddler or a preschooler -- may serve an important developmental role in the acquisition of language -lrb- the most significant social tool humans have -rrb- , says a new report out of the university of pennsylvania . the authors posit that the underdeveloped pfc is what allows young children to master a new language much more easily than adults . simply put , our kids ' more disagreeable behavior may be an evolutionary trade-off for the sake of human communication . how gross is it ? your germiest situations analyzed . okay , so they 've got these mushy brain parts that make them prone to outbursts and irrational displays of emotion , but there 's another factor at play in the toddler/preschooler 's often difficult behavior : stress .  kids this age think magically , not logically ,  explains gina mireault , ph.d. , a professor of psychology at johnson state college , in vermont .  events that are ordinary to us are confusing and scary to them . they do n't understand that the bathtub drain wo n't swallow them or that their uncle ca n't really snatch their nose .  and if you 're not sure whether or not a simple bath will end in your demise , needless to say , you 're going to feel pretty confused and prone to anxiety -- on a daily basis . how to say goodbye to mom guilt . this feeling of heightened arousal causes our bodies to release cortisol , known as the  fight or flight  hormone . maybe it should be called  tantrum juice :  cortisol increases blood pressure , speeds up breathing rates , and may lead to confused or unclear thinking -lrb- sound like anyone you know ? -rrb- . this anxiety is developmentally typical in moderation , but chronic anxiety or stress -- is my stuffed tigger going to come alive and eat me ? -- is not ; it can turn kids into virtual bundles of kindling primed to ignite at the slightest provocation . how to handle a tasmanian tot . the next time your child has an episode , potegal recommends asking yourself  what function does this inappropriate behavior serve ?  if your tyke is looking for attention or a  tangible  -lrb- toy , food , or other treat -rrb- , the best response is to ignore the behavior and maintain your own emotional composure . my friend mana heydarpour of new york city learned this lesson the hard way : when she told her strong-willed 3-year-old , ella , that she could n't watch her favorite tv show , she screamed ,  i do n't like you ! i 'm so disappointed with you !   it made my blood boil so much that i could n't help yelling back at her ,  heydarpour says . as a result , ella 's fit lasted for half an hour . potegal calls this the anger trap .  if you get just as mad and irrational as your child , it 's like throwing gas on a fire ,  he says . how to be a take charge mom . but he warns of another trap , too : the sadness trap .  when you comfort a child in the middle of a tantrum , you reinforce the behavior . instead , say ` i 'm sorry you 're upset . when you calm down , i 'll give you a hug and we can talk about what happened . '  this way , you offer support and sympathy while still showing your tot how to regulate his emotions .  since that meltdown , i 've learned to say ` i 'm not talking to you while you 're behaving like this , '  heydarpour says .  ella composes herself so much faster when i manage to do that .  but the above strategy does n't apply to an  escape  tantrum : a child going bonkers because he does n't want to do whatever it is you want him to -lrb- clean up , sit at the table , etc. -rrb- . in this case , ignoring him gives him what he wants : you 're no longer demanding that he wear his coat , or whatever it is that needs to be done . putting him in a time-out chair does n't work , either , since that 's time he 's not putting on his jacket .  every second he 's not complying , he 's winning ,  says potegal . instead , tell your kid that if he does n't get dressed in five seconds , you 're going to put your hands on his and do it together . if your tiny rebel makes no move after the five seconds are up , which he wo n't at first , take his hands in yours and gently force the coat on .  it 's not meant to be pleasant ,  admits potegal , but it should never include physical harm . if your child begins to slap or bite you , continue putting the coat on and then put him in time-out -lrb- or take away a privilege , if that 's your standard discipline tactic -rrb- . that way , your child sees he still has to wear the coat -lrb- so his protests were ineffective -rrb- and now has an additional consequence for his unacceptable behavior . toddlers are a literal force of nature who confound even the most calm and prepared . but there 's a silver lining to these flop-and-flail-filled years : just as kids can quickly slip into anger and sadness , so can they slip out of them . the average tantrum lasts about three minutes , according to potegal 's research . that 's why , shortly after a tantrum , your kid is back to playing as if nothing happened , while you 're still quaking from the event a half hour later . his immature pfc -lrb- that mushy part responsible for social cues -rrb- allows him to move on without dwelling on past hurts .  toddlers can transition from sad to happy and from angry to calm incredibly easily ,  says potegal . so enjoy that post-freak-out cuddle , and gird yourself for the next round . the life of a tantrum . a minute-by-minute breakdown of what happens when your tot blows his top . 0 sec . uh-oh . grocery-store meltdown in aisle 3 . 30 sec . foot stomping by this point means it will be a short one . 90 sec . screaming and kicking : his anger has reached its peak . 3.5 min . and just like that , it 's over . he 's now looking for comfort . 6 min . wow . he 's acting like nothing ever happened . 10 min . if his fits always last this long , talk to your doc . get 2 free years of parenting magazine - subscribe now !! copyright 2011 the parenting group . all rights reserved . reproduction in whole or in part without permission is prohibited .", "summary": " the average tantrum lasts about three minutes , according to potegal 's research .   you can predict a tantrum down to the second .   kids from about 18 months to 4 years are simply hardwired to misbehave .
