{"text": "more than 200 bottlenose dolphins spent a second day penned in a cove by japanese fishermen , u.s. conservationists said sunday , many of them stressed and bloodied from their attempts to escape . the dolphins will spend a third night without food or rest in taiji cove before the fishermen likely start to slaughter them monday for meat , the sea shepherd conservation society said . until now , the fishermen have focused on selecting dolphins to be sold into captivity at marine parks and aquariums in japan and overseas , the conservation group said . twenty-five dolphins , including a rare albino calf , were taken on saturday  to a lifetime of imprisonment ,  and another 12 on sunday , the group said . two dolphins have died in the process . environmental activists have been monitoring activities in the cove in southwest japan , which is a focal point of the taiji community 's annual dolphin hunting season . although the hunting of dolphins is widely condemned in the west , japanese defend the practice as a local custom -- and say it is no different to the slaughter of other animals for meat . caroline kennedy , the recently installed u.s. ambassador to japan , tweeted that she is  deeply concerned by inhumaneness of drive hunt dolphin killing .  the sea shepherd conservation society has been live-streaming video of events in the cove and posting frequent updates on twitter .  many of the 200 + bottlenose dolphins who are in still the cove are visibly bloody & injured from their attempts to escape the killers ,  one update sunday said . another appealed for people to do their part to end the demand for dolphins captured from the wild .  dolphin slaughter in taiji continues because of the captive trade . please do not support aquariums & parks with marine mammals ,  it said . opinion : eat fish , kill a dolphin ? slaughter under tarpaulins . the dolphins earmarked for slaughter include those with nicks or markings which make them less desirable as captives . the sea shepherd conservation society described how about 40 to 60 local fishermen work with nets to divide up the pod , whose initial numbers were estimated by the group at more than 250 .  they tighten up the nets to bring each sub-group together then the skiffs push them toward the tarps . under the tarps in the shallows is where the trainers work with the killers to select the ` prettiest ' dolphins which will sell and make the best pay day for the hunters ,  the group said .  but the process is brutal and stressful . some of them die from injuries incurred during the manhandling or simply the stress .  once the slaughter begins , it will turn the water in the cove red with blood , as documented in footage captured by the sea shepherd conservation society in the past . the fishermen will  kill the ` undesirable ' dolphins -lrb- those with nicks and scars -rrb- under the tarps to hide from our cameras when that time comes ,  the group said . officials say criticism is biased , unfair . cnn has been unable to reach anyone at the town office for taiji , a community of about 3,000 that juts into the pacific ocean , or the local fishermen 's union for comment . but local officials have reacted angrily in the past to western criticism of what they say is a traditional practice dating back centuries . a 2009 oscar-nominated documentary film ,  the cove ,  brought the issue of dolphin hunting in taiji to the fore with bloody scenes of dolphin slaughter . the wakayama prefecture , where taiji is , condemned the film in an online response as distorted , biased and unfair to the fishermen .  the taiji dolphin fishery has been a target of repeated psychological harassment and interference by aggressive foreign animal protection organizations ,  it said .  taiji dolphin fishermen are just conducting a legal fishing activity in their traditional way in full accordance with regulations and rules under the supervision of both the national and the prefectural governments . therefore , we believe there are no reasons to criticize the taiji dolphin fishery .  the japanese practice of whale hunting has also put it in conflict with the views of much of the world . japan 's fleet carries out an annual whale hunt despite a worldwide moratorium , taking advantage of a loophole in the law that permits the killing of the mammals for scientific research . whale meat is commonly available for consumption in japan . environmental activists warn that dolphin meat , also sold for consumption in japan , contains dangerously high levels of mercury and other toxins . cnn first learned about this story through a cnn ireport posted by martha brock , an environmental attorney and activist in georgia .  there are activists around the world that are calling the embassy and the press , but i knew i could n't do much , so i wrote this ireport ,  she said .", "summary": " fishermen have taken 37 bottlenose dolphins to be sold into captivity , conservationists say .   many of the 200 dolphins still in the cove in taiji , japan , will be slaughtered , they say .   local officials have previously defended hunting of dolphins as a traditional practice .   environmental activists say dolphin meat contains dangerously high levels of mercury .
