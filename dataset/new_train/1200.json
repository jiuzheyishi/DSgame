{"text": "a grandfather with no flying experience managed to land a light aircraft after the pilot collapsed at the controls . with his friend dying beside him , john wildey , 77 , flew solo for 70 minutes as he was talked down by an instructor . they told him to ignore most of the plane 's instruments and concentrate on using the joystick to keep its nose up . an raf helicopter acted as an escort.after three abortive attempts , mr wildey made an ` almost perfect ' landing in semi-darkness -- and bashfully denied being a hero , saying his actions were ` nothing really -- i was just holding the joystick ' . the pilot was taken to hospital but died later . scroll down for video . the drama occurred after mr wildey -- who served as a clerk in the raf for 24 years but had never piloted a plane -- and his friend had spent the day flying , as they had done many times before . they took off from sandtoft airfield , between scunthorpe and doncaster , in glorious sunshine on tuesday morning and flew the cessna 172 skyhawk to skegness , on the lincolnshire coast , with a stop at a small airfield for lunch . they were due to return to sandtoft shortly before 7pm . but at about 6.15 pm , the pilot -- whose name has not been released -- fell seriously ill and began drifting in and out of consciousness . ` he said he was sick and asked me to take care of the aircraft controls , ' mr wildey said . ` he set the controls and put me on the right path . then he was unwell again , completely unresponsive . i called his name but he did n't answer . i said we were going to have to land soon but when he did n't respond . ' modest : john wildey back on the ground yesterday -lrb- left -rrb- after landing the plane safely at humberside airport . mr wildey is pictured -lrb- right -rrb- as a clerk in the raf in 1968 . touchdown : the cessna 172 skyhawk , with which mr wildey made an ` almost perfect ' landing in semi-darkness despite having never piloted a plane before . the cessna 172 has dual controls , so mr wildey steadied the aircraft to the best of his abilities . he was wearing a headset linked to the plane 's radio and raised the alarm . ` i called  mayday , mayday , mayday  but forgot to give the registration of the plane , ' he said . ` i said ,  i 've got no flying experience and the pilot is n't very well  . i said he could n't control the aircraft . i said that i thought i was heading to sandtoft . they said they were still trying to sort out what they could do for me . ` they asked if i could circle round sandtoft . i said i would try my best . i circled around sandtoft a few times . the pilot was still conscious but clearly incapable of flying the plane . ` i kept knocking him to try to get him to do something because i had n't a clue how to get down , ' mr wildey said . he had watched his friend bank , climb and descend using the steering column , and had a notion of what some of the baffling array of dials and instruments in front of him did . ` remarkable job ' : mr wildey was forced to make an emergency landing at humberside airport , north lincolnshire -lrb- pictured -rrb- , after his friend the pilot was taken ill . ground control : flying instructor roy murray , who gave mr wildey step plane . he was put through to the tower at . humberside international airport , which has a longer landing strip and . full emergency services , and told to await instructions . flights to and from humberside were suspended or diverted as the runway was cleared for an emergency landing . a sea king helicopter was scrambled from raf leconfield in east yorkshire to fly alongside the cessna to guide mr wildey on the 25-mile flight . roy murray , chief instructor at the airport 's frank morgan flying school was called at his home in the waltham , lincolnshire . route : mr wildey flew the cessna from sandtoft airfield before touching down at humberside airport , in north lincolnshire . he was told that a pilot had passed out and a passenger with no flying experience would need to be talked down . fifteen minutes later , mr murray pulled up at the airport 's air traffic control tower and was taken straight to the radar room . ` the . atmosphere was all calm , nobody was panicking and it was all very . professional , ' he said . he spoke to mr wildey , who was calm despite his . predicament . ` i told him to keep calm and not to over-control the aircraft , ' he said . mr murray decided that the best option available was to guide mr wildey in with a ` blind landing ' , in which he was told to ignore the bulk of the instruments , and use just three main controls : the throttle to lower the plane , the steering column to keep its nose up -- and the brakes to slow the plane down if and when he touched down successfully . ` all cockpits and controls are different and i did n't want john looking around and panicking . it was tense at times , especially the last mile or so , as he was talked in . ' at around 7pm , as it was getting dark , mr wildey , who had been following the sea king helicopter , came into view of the control tower . because the cessna had been flying during the day he had no lights on outside or inside the cockpit . all mr murray could see was the outline of the plane against an darkening sky . as he explained how the plane worked and how mr wildey should land it , he stressed the need to keep the nose up when touching down to avoid smashing off the front landing wheel . in a calm voice , he went on to impress on the novice pilot the need to steer the vehicle when braking , in case it veered off to one side and struck a landing light . ` if he had hit one the landing lights there could be a fuel leak with the risk of fire , ' mr murray said . ` thankfully , he was doing what i was telling him to do . ' on three nerve-racking occasions mr wildey tried to touch down , before pulling back on the steering column to lift the plane up again , increasing the throttle to avoid stalling and swinging round to make another attempt . a sea king helicopter was scrambled from raf leconfield in east . yorkshire to fly alongside the cessna to guide mr wildey on the 25-mile . flight -lrb- file picture -rrb- . mayday : moments before the pilot fell unconscious , a mayday call was sent and the emergency response was declared on the ground . pictured is humberside airport . each ` go round ' was a terrifying . experience for pilot and those on the ground . mr wildey said : ` i could . see the runway lights . they said ,  bring her down gently , take the . throttle back .  and i was doing that and it seemed to be all right but . then they said i was going too low , power up and go , so i powered up and . went round again . ' the . airstrip is one and three-quarter miles long and , if everything went to . plan , he was due to land at a speed of about 80 to 90mph . the runway length , mr murray thought , should give mr wildey plenty of time to brake . guardian angel : air traffic control manager debbie zost , who along with flight instructor roy murray , helped mr wildey land . on . the fourth attempt , he was given the go-ahead but it was still far from . plain-sailing , mr wildey said . ` i know you bring back the controls but i . did n't bring them back hard enough . so really i was sort of nose down . rather than anything else , ' the father of three said yesterday . ` then we touched and there was a right bump -- two or three bumps . i suppose it was a controlled crash really . ` but i just could n't get the brakes because i could n't reach them . i managed to get them in the end . ` but then we sort of went off the runway and all i could see was this runway indicator wall coming towards me and i thought :  i am not going to do it  . but we managed to stop in the end . ' experts said the landing , at 7.30 pm , was ` almost perfect ' . stuart sykes , who saw the aircraft land , said : ` it came down with a bump , a bump , a bump , hit the front end down , i heard some crashing and it 's come to a halt . ' others said they saw sparks as it touched down . mr murray said : ` the emergency services were there immediately and may have turned off the engine . when he landed , we all sort of shook hands and said  thank god for that  . ' miraculously , mr wildey emerged from the aircraft shaken but uninjured . an ambulance took the dying pilot to hospital . mr murray said : ` i 'm satisfied but sad . there was a death involved . but , i 'm satisfied because it could have been a lot worse . ` but , i can say that i would n't be frightened to fly with john . he was very calm and in control . ' mr wildey was described yesterday as a ` hero ' for having kept his nerve during the traumatic incident . but speaking from his home in rossington , south yorkshire , he played down his role as ` nothing really ' . he was simply the man holding the control stick , he said . mr wildey told his local bbc television station : ` air traffic control at humberside , two flying instructors , and also a sea king helicopter were all helping . ` they all did their best , i was just the person holding the stick . they were telling me what to do but because i did n't have any lights on i could barely see any of the sticks , which made it even more difficult .
