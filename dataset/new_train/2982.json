{"text": "the case of three women held as slaves in south london has shocked not just the british public , but people across the world . what makes this particular case stand out is the length of time these women are said to have been held captive - over 30 years . although this is an extreme example , this type of slavery is not uncommon in london . figures from the united kingdom human trafficking centre and serious organised crime agency for this year show that there were 389 potential victims of trafficking in the capital . although the women in this case are not believed to have been trafficked , the case shows that hidden slavery is taking place around us , within our everyday environments , whether it be on construction sites , mobile soup runs for the homeless , at cheap takeaways , in nail bars and in domestic homes in our neighborhoods . read more : how to recover after decades of slavery ? it 's not necessarily organized by criminal gangs - it can involve informal arrangements , carried out by so-called ordinary and even respected people in the community . i recently published a report called  shadow city -- exposing human trafficking in everyday london  that uncovered just how diverse that trafficking is , and that no matter where you live you are probably not that far from someone who is being exploited . sadly , authorities are still blind to this . things need to change , urgently . an overstretched anti-trafficking unit in london 's metropolitan police , and a figure-driven culture , means police are focusing on large-scale organized cases , and neglecting the informal cases that take longer to find , but are sometimes more serious . in this case the three victims were lucky . they are said to have contacted a charity that was able to successfully rescue them . many are not so fortunate . read more : slavery 's last stronghold . but if we continue to lose the expertise of dedicated trafficking officers within the met police , the cultural subtleties behind cases will be missed and traffickers and perpetrators of slavery will continue to largely evade conviction . of course budgets are tight , but if the money made in trafficking exploits is recuperated through the use of specialist teams , then these investigations could pay for themselves . in my report , i made some recommendations that could help tackle the lack of action on informal types of slavery . these included the met 's anti-trafficking unit being urgently protected from further integration into other units , additional human trafficking units to be established in other police forces across the uk , human trafficking to become part of the core syllabus for training new police recruits , and special points of contact to be established in every borough 's police force . the police are not the only agency that needs better systems put in place . it is also vitally important that social workers , teachers , health professionals and benefit agency staff receive training on how to spot signs of trafficking and slavery , and who to consult if they have concerns . for too long many londoners have assumed that trafficking happens elsewhere , and statutory agencies have concentrated too much resource into trafficking that happens through organized crime with a concentration on drugs and sex workers . the case in south london shows that slaves could be living next door . read more : the cnn freedom project . watch more : 12,000 girls rescued from slavery . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of andrew boff .", "summary": " the case of three women held capitive in london has shocked britain , and the world .   while it 's an extreme example , slavery is not uncommon in london , andrew boff says .   authorities are over-stretched and neglecting the informal cases which are hard to find .   this case shows how slavery is a huge problem -- and it 's all around us .
