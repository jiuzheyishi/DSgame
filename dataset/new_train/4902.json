{"text": "washington president barack obama signed legislation thursday evening extending several key provisions of the patriot act shortly before they were set to expire at midnight . the provisions -- passed after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attack -- deal with roving wiretaps , the tracking of alleged  lone wolf  terrorists , and the ability of law enforcement officials to obtain records they deem relevant to an investigation after securing an order from a federal court . the bill passed both the house of representatives and the senate earlier in the day . obama , currently on a trip to europe , directed the use of an autopen -- a signature reproduction device -- to sign the measure , according to white house spokesman nick shapiro . the house was forced to briefly delay the start of its memorial day recess to vote on the measure . a protracted dispute over the legislation in the senate , fueled by conservative newcomer sen. rand paul , r-kentucky , muddied voting schedules . paul reached a deal with senate leaders to allow votes on whether to table two of his amendments . both amendments failed , and the subsequent senate vote on the measure to extend the patriot act provisions for four years passed easily on a 72-23 vote . the 250-153 house vote was tighter , with lawmakers on the right and left opposing an extension for various reasons . for example , some members of congress are concerned about the law 's impact on civil liberties , while others support the law but think it should be made permanent . one of the three provisions , section 206 of the patriot act , provides for roving wiretap surveillance of targets who try to thwart foreign intelligence surveillance act -lrb- fisa -rrb- surveillance . without such roving wiretap authority , investigators would be forced to seek a new court order each time they need to change the location , phone or computer that needs to be monitored . another provision , section 215 of the patriot act , allows the fbi to apply to the fisa court to issue orders granting the government access to any tangible items in foreign intelligence , international terrorism and clandestine intelligence cases . the third provision , section 6001 of the intelligence reform and terrorist prevention act of 2004 , closes a loophole that could allow individual terrorists not affiliated with specific organizations to slip through the cracks of fisa surveillance . law enforcement officials refer to it as the  lone wolf  provision . legislators opposed to the extensions claim that the provisions -- particularly related to wiretapping -- are intrusive and unconstitutional . supporters argue that they are a critical component of u.s. anti-terror operations . paul , a favorite of the tea party movement , engaged in a bitter showdown wednesday with senate majority harry reid , d-nevada , who sought to limit the number of amendments that paul could offer . then on thursday , paul complained that it was senate republican leaders now holding up consideration of his amendments . in a rare public rebuke of his own party 's leadership , paul said he was  disappointed  by their actions and urged people to contact gop leadership offices in protest .  i 've been working for two long days filibustering the patriot act in hopes that we can have a constitutional debate over certain provisions of it and we can try to reform it to take away some of the encroachments on our freedoms ,  paul said .  unfortunately , what we 're finding now is that the democrats have agreed to allow me to have amendments , but my own party is refusing to allow me to debate or present my amendments .  in particular , paul sought to propose an amendment preventing warrantless access to some gun records . republican leaders do n't want a vote on his amendment because they are conflicted by it , paul said . they do n't want to vote to weaken the patriot act by making it more difficult for law enforcement to obtain any information -- including gun records -- related to a terrorism investigation , he said , but they also do n't want to take a vote that could be viewed negatively by gun rights groups . one senate republican leader , sen. jon kyl of arizona , rejected paul 's analysis but refused to explain why or even if gop leaders were blocking paul 's amendment . after reaching the deal to debate two of his amendments , paul said on the senate floor that his motivation was to protect personal liberties rather than to harm the patriot act or undermine security in any way .  it 's very important that we are always vigilant , that we are eternally vigilant about the powers of government ,  paul said in arguing for tighter restrictions on the ability of federal investigators to access some gun ownership records . he went on to complain in general about what he characterized as a federal overreaction to the 9/11 attacks that reduced individual liberty in the name of security . for example , he said , airline travelers are all considered possible terrorists and screened for security reasons ; he described such a strategy as a  shotgun  approach .  are we so afraid that we 're giving up all of our liberty for security ?  paul asked , calling for tighter restrictions on what the government can investigate without a search warrant . however , fellow conservative sen. saxby chambliss , r-georgia , said paul 's amendment to end warrantless access to gun records would hinder the government 's ability to prevent terrorist attacks within the united states .  i do n't understand why we would take this tool away from national security investigators ,  chambliss said , adding that there have been  no reports that the government has ever used these provisions to violate anyone 's second amendment rights .  cnn 's deirdre walsh , ted barrett and dana bash contributed to this story .", "summary": " three key patriot act provisions were to expire at midnight thursday .
