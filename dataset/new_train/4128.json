{"text": "a new buildup of russian troops along the ukraine border raised concerns tuesday that moscow might be contemplating another intervention like the one that annexed crimea earlier this year . according to a nato official , russia now has about 20,000 troops stationed  in an area along the entire border with eastern ukraine .  the buildup nearly doubled the troop deployment in the last week by adding 8,000 more forces to 12,000 already there , the official said . it comes a week after the united states and the european union increased economic sanctions on russia for supporting pro-russian separatists fighting ukraine government forces in the eastern regions of donetsk and luhansk , along the border with russia . in addition , russia 's defense ministry is staging a week of military exercises involving air troops and anti-missile defense forces . the exercises are taking place in russia 's southern astrakhan region , roughly 500 miles from the border with ukraine . similar military exercises in the region preceded russia 's annexation of crimea in march , which escalated the ukraine conflict following the ouster of pro-moscow president viktor yanukovych a month earlier . donetsk braces for offensive . meanwhile , ukraine government security officials said monday they were preparing for a  massive assault  on donetsk city , state media reported . inside the city , a rebel stronghold for months , shelling has already pushed some residents underground into cellars and half-built basements . russia 's foreign ministry claimed in a statement monday that the ukrainian military was firing missiles and using multiple rocket systems in and around the city . it accused ukraine 's government of wanting to continue the war and called for talks to find a political situation to the crisis . with escalated fighting and ukrainian forces making gains , the russian deployment at the border could portend an intervention under the banner of a peacekeeping operation .  on a human scale , the situation in the east -- particularly in donetsk and luhansk -- is disastrous . today , with all certainty , there 's a need to speak about a true war ,  vitaly churkin , russia 's ambassador to the united nations , said tuesday . russian troop buildup . the nato official said russian forces gathering at the ukraine border included a  spectrum  of assets : infantry , mechanized divisions , armor , a lot of artillery , conventional and air defense , and special forces and logistics .  they are very capable russian regular units and can move in a matter of hours and could significantly disrupt the situation  in eastern ukraine , the official said . the ukrainian government and western leaders accuse russia of fomenting instability in its neighbor by arming and supporting the rebels there , which russia denies . the downing of malaysia airlines flight 17 on july 17 exacerbated the situation . malaysian plane downed . u.s. and ukrainian officials allege that a russian-made missile shot down the plane from rebel-held territory , killing all 298 people on board . russia and the rebel fighters deny involvement . earlier this year , russia amassed about 40,000 troops on the ukraine border and threatened to invade , nato said in a fact sheet published last month . putin then ordered most of the soldiers to return to their bases , leaving about 12,000 of july 11 , nato said . on tuesday , ukraine 's national defense and security council said the russian deployment now numbered as high as 45,000 , and that there had been 26 clashes in the past 24 hours , including six attacks from russian territory . meanwhile , russian combat aircraft crew will practice firing at air and ground targets in unfamiliar territory , the defense ministry said of the military exercises in the region . the maneuvers will involve 100 aircraft , including fighter jets , bombers and combat helicopters . in its fact sheet , nato challenged russian accusations that the alliance is escalating the crisis in ukraine by bolstering its support for nato members in eastern europe .  over the past months , russia has also embarked on an unprecedented schedule of no-notice military exercises involving massive numbers of troops and heavy equipment ,  nato said , adding :  russia should explain what its military plans are before it starts accusing others of posing a threat .  search for remains . an official with knowledge of the mh17 investigation told cnn that a significant part of the crash site was between ukrainian and separatist front lines , which constantly change . a 17-vehicle convoy of 110 experts accompanied by nine international monitors made it to the site on tuesday , the organization for security and co-operation in europe said via twitter . the experts , from the netherlands , australia and malaysia , were hampered in their search efforts monday by renewed fighting in the area . monday 's search focused in and around the village of petropavlivka , in the western part of the huge debris field , but the team was unable to complete its mission after an initial delay . they did recover some personal belongings of those on the flight , including photo albums and passports , said pieter-jaap aalbersberg , head of the dutch recovery mission .  although some access to the crash site has been secured , we still do n't have the unimpeded and complete access to the site -- all of it -- that is essential ,  gary quinlan , australia 's ambassador to the united nations , said tuesday . in addition , a team of about a dozen u.s. military specialists arrived tuesday in kiev to assist the recovery effort , pentagon spokesman rear adm. john kirby told reporters .  they are military ; they will not leave kiev ,  he said , adding that the team includes experts in communications , logistics and other areas that can aid the investigation .  recovery operations is something , tragically and unfortunately , the u.s. military has to do and has to be good at ,  kirby said . refugees flee conflict . the ongoing fighting has killed close to 1,400 people -- civilians and combatants -- and more than 4,000 people have been wounded in eastern ukraine since mid-april , according to u.n. officials . the fighting has also forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes and seek shelter either elsewhere in ukraine or across the border in russia . the u.n. refugee agency , the unhcr , said tuesday that the russian authorities estimate that around 730,000 ukrainians have sought sanctuary in russia this year under a visa-free travel program . this includes more than 168,000 who have reported to russia 's federal migration service . unhcr 's european director vincent cochetel told journalists in geneva that about 80 % of the ukrainians who have fled to russia are staying in border areas , while others are with friends or family in other parts of the country . many people in eastern ukraine are russian-speaking and have strong ties to russia . at the same time , nearly 118,000 people are reported to be internally displaced , most of them from eastern ukraine , based on information given to the unhcr by ukrainian authorities and local ngos .  in the past seven days more than 6,200 people have been forced from their homes ,  cochetel said . many have fled with limited possessions , some driven out by the destruction of homes and infrastructure , while others say they fear being caught in the crossfire or suffering persecution . john ging , operations director of the u.n. office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs , called on all sides tuesday to allow people to move freely and safely .  the humanitarian situation is deteriorating , and the worrying increase in violence in urban areas puts a greater number of people at risk .  until violence is ended , we will continue to see an increase in human suffering , and in the number of people displaced . immediate action is required to prevent this crisis from worsening ,  he said , according to prepared remarks . donetsk residents hunker down . mh17 crash site : dangers delay investigators ; ukraine warns of
