{"text": "srinivasa ramanujan , described as a ` natural genius ' , has finally had the mathematical functions he came up with on his deathbed proved correct . researchers have finally solved the cryptic deathbed puzzle renowned indian mathematician srinivasa ramanujan claimed came to him in dreams . while on his death-bed in 1920 , ramanujan wrote a letter to his mentor , . english mathematician g. h. hardy , outlining several new mathematical functions never before heard of , along with a hunch about how they worked , . decades years later , researchers say they 've proved he was right - and that the formula could explain the behaviour of black holes . ` we 've solved the problems from his last mysterious letters , ' emory university mathematician ken ono said . ` for people who work in this area of math , the problem has been open for 90 years , ' ramanujan , a self-taught mathematician . born in a rural village in south india , spent so much time thinking . about math that he flunked out of college in india twice , ono said . ramanujan 's letter described several new . functions that behaved differently from known theta functions , or . modular forms , and yet closely mimicked them . functions are equations that can be drawn as graphs on an axis , like a sine wave , and produce an output when computed for any chosen input or value . ramanujan conjectured that . his mock modular forms corresponded to the ordinary modular forms . earlier identified by carl jacobi , and that both would wind up with . similar outputs for roots of 1 . ramanujan , a devout hindu , thought these patterns were revealed to him by the goddess namagiri . scroll down for video . ramanujan claimed the patterns in numbers were revealed to him by a hindu goddess . however , no one at the time understood . what ramanujan was talking about . ` it was n't until 2002 , through the . work of sander zwegers , that we had a description of the functions that . ramanujan was writing about in 1920 , ' ono said . ono and his colleagues drew on . modern mathematical tools that had not been developed before ramanujan 's . death to prove this theory was correct . ` we . proved that ramanujan was right , ' ono says . ` we found the formula . explaining one of the visions that he believed came from his goddess . ' the team were also stunned to find the function could be used today . ` no . one was talking about black holes back in the 1920s when ramanujan . first came up with mock modular forms , and yet , his work may unlock . secrets about them , ' ono says . a highlight of working on a film about ramanujan 's life was getting to browse through some of the indian master 's original notebooks , said ken ono , right . ` ramanujan 's legacy , it turns . out , is much more important than anything anyone would have guessed when . ramanujan died , ' ono said . the . findings were presented last month at the ramanujan 125 conference at . the university of florida , ahead of the 125th anniversary of the . mathematician 's birth on dec. 22nd . ` raw genius ' ramanujan at cambridge -lrb- centre -rrb- . december 22 , 2012 marks the 125th birth anniversary of srinivasa ramanujan , the self taught mathematician born into a modest and conservative family in kumbakonam , a relatively small town in tamilnad . ramanujan was self-taught and worked in almost complete isolation from the mathematical community of his time . described as a raw genius , he independently rediscovered many existing results , as well as making his own unique contributions , believing his inspiration came from the hindu goddess namagiri . he spent so much time thinking . about math that he flunked out of college in india twice . he overcame several hurdles to find a place among the celebrated intellectuals of cambridge . ramanujan passed away at the young age of 32 of tuberculosis , but he left behind formulations in mathematics that have paved the path for many scholars who came after him .", "summary": " theory came to srinivasa ramanujan in a dream on his deathbed in 1920 - but has never been proved .   discovery could now be used to explain the behaviour of parts of a black hole .
