{"text": "george s. patton did not like willie and joe . bill mauldin , on top of a jeep -lrb- his favored mode of transportation -rrb- , was a hero to soldiers for his cartoons . the famed general was a spit-and-polish man , and  willie & joe  -- bill mauldin 's popular cartoon dogfaces , who appeared every day in the military newspaper stars and stripes -- were anything but : unshaven , rumpled , their boots caked with mud , eyes weary from days on the line . the general made it known that he was not amused , and eventually mauldin -- a 23-year-old sergeant who 'd entered the army to escape an aimless life in the rugged southwest -- was summoned to patton 's impressive headquarters , a requisitioned palace in luxembourg .  now then , sergeant ,  patton said to mauldin , as recalled in a new biography , todd depastino 's  bill mauldin : a life up front  -lrb- w.w. norton -rrb- .  about those pictures you draw of those god-awful things you call soldiers . ... no respect for the army , their officers , or themselves . ... what are you trying to do , incite a goddamn mutiny ?  see some of mauldin 's award-winning work  that was the last thing on mauldin 's mind . he was trying to tell the truth . the cartoonist , who died at age 81 in 2003 , had a storied career that included two pulitzers -- including one for  willie & joe  -- several best-selling books and renown from veterans . but he never let his abiding concern for the regular guy stray far from his thoughts .  if i see a stuffed shirt , i want to punch it . if it 's big , hit it . you ca n't go far wrong ,  he once said . depastino , a history professor at waynesburg college in pennsylvania , found mauldin 's work a revelation . like many of the postwar generation , all he knew of mauldin were the occasional references in charles schulz 's  peanuts ,  in which snoopy would talk about quaffing root beers at mauldin 's house .  i got ` up front ' -lsb- mauldin 's first book -rsb- , read it , and was stunned by the genius of the artwork ,  he recalls in an interview .  it was like a hidden transcription of the war . ... i wanted to know what was behind the cartoons , and why they were allowed to be published .  indeed ,  willie & joe  was unlike anything that had appeared in america during world war ii . in the early years of the war , the u.s. government had focused on the upbeat , but as the optimism of u.s. entry gave way to the two-steps-forward , one-step-back grind of daily battle -- coupled with stark sacrifices at home -- the strategy fell apart . mauldin 's characters were bluntly honest : war was dirty , absurd , bitter hard work .  willie & joe  quickly caught on with both enlisted men and -- upon syndication in the states -- the general public .  i think the home front was hungry for the truth ,  says depastino . mauldin 's cartoons provided  a needed dose of realism ,  he says .  -lsb- the message was -rsb- the enemy is lethal and people overseas are sacrificing more than you are .  but mauldin had some officers on his side , up to and including the supreme allied commander himself , dwight d. eisenhower . when mauldin returned to the states , he was a hero . his first book ,  up front  -- a memoir with cartoons -- became a tremendous best-seller , as did the follow-up ,  back home .  for a time he lived in suburban rockland county , new york , among other successful artists and writers . but life among the creative swells gnawed at him , and in the late '50s he became an editorial cartoonist , first for the st. louis post-dispatch , later for the chicago sun-times . he took on racism , cold war politics , vietnam and chicago mayor richard daley . he also went through the classic changes of his generation . he struggled with alcoholism . he was twice divorced , grappled with the counterculture , watched the world war ii generation become forgotten and then deified . through it all , he maintained a healthy skepticism for the establishment , whether it be martinet officers , self-important politicians or the suits in the corner office . depastino remains surprised that his is the first biography of mauldin , which perhaps speaks to the low regard our culture -- even pop culture -- has for cartoonists .  if mauldin had been a writer , there would have been a biography -lsb- by now -rsb- ,  he says . but the soldiers themselves -- men such as schulz , a world war ii vet who did n't meet mauldin until years after first mentioning him in  peanuts  -- knew mauldin 's value . when he talks about the book , depastino says , he gets his most emotional responses from veterans and their families .  his art was about a group of men who are suffering unspeakable horrors in the trenches . his audience was those very men ,  he says .  it 's odd -- he was kind of mirroring their lives back to them . ... he was doing this for those guys . how many artists do that ?
