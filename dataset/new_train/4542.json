{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- the death of beloved mexican soap opera star lorena rojas this week in miami drew a deluge of heartfelt condolences -- from los angeles to san juan , from dallas to buenos aires . that hordes of latinas and latin americans are mourning the 44-year-old actress , who starred in more than a dozen telenovelas , is no surprise to anyone who understands the deep hold that these soap operas have on the imagination of latino culture . in fact , for americans to fully grasp the culture of the more than 51 million latinos who live in the u.s. , as well as their spanish-speaking brethren south of the border and in the spanish-speaking caribbean islands , they would do well to understand the importance of the telenovela . telenovelas are such an integral part of latino tradition , in the u.s. and in the spanish-speaking world , that soap stars like rojas become part a household 's extended family . fans follow the stars ' lives on and off the screen and live vicariously through both their fictional characters and real lives . they are something like the kardashians of latino culture . what 's more , social media has given fans access to their beloved celebrities 24-7 , which may explain the outpouring of grief when news broke that rojas succumbed to breast cancer that had spread to her liver . it was , after all , like losing a family member . since her debut in the mexican soap  alcanzar una estrella ,  where she played opposite her biological sister , mayra , rojas had been a beloved member of mexican households . among the soaps she went on to star in were the sequel ,  alcanzar una estrella ii ,   cancion de amor ,   rosario ,   pecados ajenos ,  and her latest , filmed in miami , where she lived , the venezuelan series  demente criminal .  rojas , however , was best known for her role as isabel in the deliciously sexy soap  el cuerpo del deseo .  the story revolved around a young woman who falls in love with a 67-year old man , played by the legendary mexican-dominican actor andres garcia . in the show , he dies and comes back to life as a young stud , mario cimarro . in the nightly ritual of telenovela watching for millions of latinas , such fantasy plots are exactly the point . after a hard day 's work , they are the balm or the dirty martini -- the inexpensive reward and gift -- that hispanic women offer themselves . one reason why ? for immigrants , many of them laboring in a new land -- cleaning , cooking for others , slaughtering cows in meat houses , running their own businesses , for instance -- the novelas represent a shared escape , a way to stay connected with loved ones back home and to each other , here in america . they run on fast-paced cycles and feature a roller coaster of emotions and plot twists that fans savor until it all ends a few months later . one veteran actress described it to a reporter this way :  ... cry . in this one you do n't cry . now you are laughing . now you are happy . getting engaged . they 're killing you . you are sick .  the popularity of novelas helped univision edge out nbc in several sweeps months , making the spanish-language network the no. 4 network among adults 18-49 . audience share is a testament of the growth of the latino population in the u.s. , but it could also indicate a dearth of shows targeting this demographic in english-language networks . indeed , while the american soap opera genre has continued to decline in viewership , latino soaps have surged , partly because they have kept up with the times . while 30 years ago most story lines featured sappy cinderella-like plots -- poor girl meets rich guy , falls in love and , after a series of tragedies , ends up with her prince -- they have evolved . plots , twists and characters wink to issues of the day , and in many ways the shows serve as surrogate teachers , where taboos are explored and often debunked . characters are getting divorces , remarrying , having premarital sex , cheating , having abortions , killing and getting killed . they are not just the good girls anymore -- they are naughty , and they 're winning , too . but perhaps the most delightful difference between american soaps and spanish novelas is not just how over the top , fashionable and gorgeous the stars are ; it is also that when they end after several months , evil is taken out , good always wins , and there is , for the most part , a happy ending . a refreshing way to live in a country where people want to deport you and your family ! in some ways , rojas was a standard bearer for the telenovela . she may not have had a happy ending the way many of her on-screen characters did , but she lived her life like many of the women she played on the small screen : valiantly fighting cancer , divorcing , falling in love again and adopting a baby girl . she had more than a quarter-million twitter followers and celebrated her 44th birthday with them in her final days . in her last tweet on february 10 , she thanked her fans :  gracias a todos por celebrar mi cumple conmigo .
