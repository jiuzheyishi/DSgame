{"text": "a pair of trousers found in a chinese graveyard might just be the oldest ever found . the clothing is thought to date back a staggering 3,000 years , and despite the fact the ancient apparel has undergone considerable wear and tear , it still looks remarkably intact . the find was made along with a host of other clothing items in the yanghai tombs in china 's vast tarim basin . what are thought to be the world 's oldest trousers -lrb- pictured -rrb- have been discovered in one of the yanghai tombs in china 's tarim basin . the trousers are made of three bits of cloth , one for each leg and one for the crotch , stitched together . a woven decoration is also visible on the trousers , thought to have been used for horse riding . the trousers , which could actually date up to 3,300 years old , are thought to be the oldest ever discovered . a new paper by ulrike beck and colleagues of the german archaeological institute in berlin suggests the invention of trousers is linked to horseback riding . finds , such as the one reported at the yahghai cemetery , highlight fragments of woollen trousers dating back to the 13th and 10th centuries bc . the age of the trousers corresponds to the known age of horse riding , which is thought to have begun up to 4,000 years ago . ` together with horse gear and weapons as grave goods in both tombs our results specify former assumptions that the invention of bifurcated -lsb- split into two parts -rsb- lower body garments is related to the new epoch of horseback riding , mounted warfare and greater mobility , ' wrote the researchers . ` trousers are essential parts of the tool kit with which humans improve their physical qualities . ' they signify a period when people needed new clothing for horse riding . older clothing such as robes and togas were not suitable for riding , leading to the rise in popularity of trousers . the finding was reported in a paper for the quaternary international . ` this new paper definitely supports the idea that trousers were invented for horse riding by mobile pastoralists , and that trousers were brought to the tarim basin by horse-riding peoples , ' linguist victor mair from the university of pennsylvania told sciencenews . horse riding is thought to have begun up to 4,000 years ago , suggesting that trousers , too , could have originated that far back . the discovery at yanghai were of two men thought to be 40 years-old , wearing the trousers . the clothing suggests they were herders - but they were likely warriors , too . among the items recovered with the men were a whip , a wooden horse bit , a battle-axe and a bow . the find was made along with a host of other clothing items in the yanghai tombs in china 's vast tarim basin . other items have also been found as part of the project known as silk road fashion . these include various garments dating back 3,000 years discovered in eastern central asia . a fur coat -lrb- pictured being analysed by german and chinese scientists -rrb- , is among the finds and each of the relics is said to be of great value . the age of the trousers was estimated using radiocarbon dating and their design , perhaps understandably , was fairly primitive compared to modern standards . in total . the two pairs were each made of three pieces of cloth - one for each leg and one for the crotch . a ` belt ' of sorts had been fashioned from strings , while the garments themselves were decorated with a woven design . the yanghai tombs are a vast ancient cemetery spanning approximately 580,000 square feet -lrb- 54,000 square metres -rrb- . the hot and dry climate in the area known as the tarim basin has helped to preserve corpses , clothing and other artefacts for thousands of years . since digs at the site began in the 1970s , over 500 tombs have been excavated with numerous finds made .", "summary": " ancient clothing artefacts have been found in china 's yanghai tombs .   one of the finds includes a pair of trousers , said to be the world 's oldest .   the trousers are thought to signify the rise of horse riding 4,000 years ago .   the primitive trousers themselves date back to up to 3,300 years .   they are made of three pieces of cloth and have a basic design on them .
