{"text": "follow @@ mike_dickson_dm . andy murray knows exactly what kind of welcome to expect from the french crowd when he walks out to face gael monfils today . and it is unlikely to be : ` bienvenue mon ami ' . in these parts they have an enveloping passion for tennis rarely found across the channel , at least outside wimbledon fortnight , and the charismatic monfils is their last standard bearer at the national grand slam . the attraction of this quarter-final is such that they have put the match on roland garros 's main court philippe chatrier , thus bumping the repeat of last year 's final between rafael nadal and david ferrer across to the suzanne lenglen arena . hot recption : andy murray knows he will be cast as the villain when he meets gael monfils in the french open . patriot games : gael monfils is the last frenchman left in the draw at roland garros . drop shot : andy murray . murray and monfils have met here before , in a far less high-profile first-round clash in 2006 , which the frenchman won in five sets . the only other marquee french name murray has played at roland garros is richard gasquet in 2012 . the scot was roundly jeered as he walked on to court , and again when he lost the first set , before recovering to hammer a notoriously brittle opponent . murray has described the crowd here as ` ferocious ' . his game is respected in france but he is not remotely adored in the same way as , for example , the francophone roger federer . it will help that he has played three away davis cup ties in the past nine months . ` i 'm not expecting the crowd to be for me and i look forward to that because it does n't often happen where the whole crowd is against you , ' he said . ` even in davis cup in italy -lrb- last month -rrb- , we had some great support there , so it 's going to be a good experience for me . ' some shrivel in this situation while others grow . murray is in the latter category , as oppression brings out his belligerent side . it is heartening that the back surgery he underwent is finally beginning to pay a dividend , with the extra rotation gained on his backhand a particular bonus . after beating fernando verdasco he was the most upbeat he has been about his physical condition this year . hot scot : murray smiles after beating frenchman richard gasquet at the 2012 french open in paris . ` the way i 'm hitting my backhand now is 10 times better than it was last year , ' he said . ` moving to that side as well is so much better than it was . ` there were periods this year when i had some problems , but that is to be expected with surgery . it 's starting to get better slowly and i 'm close to being back to 100 per cent . ` that 's exciting for me especially at this stage of the year with a big few weeks around the corner . ` that was what i was hoping , what i was planning for . the australian open was always going to be tough for me to be 100 per cent in terms of match fitness but i did ok there and hopefully between now and the end of the year i can play like this . ' crazy legs ! gael monfil 's elastic movement will make him a difficult proposition for andy murray . monfils , an adversary of murray 's from the age of 10 , has a strong record at roland garros but his good run here has been rather unexpected ; his last tournament was back in late april , after which he struggled with ankle problems . in a bizarre third round against fabio fognini he cramped badly in the fourth set before storming back to win the fifth . one thing that is for sure is that his legs , which contort themselves in the most remarkable way to retrieve the ball , will be made to work phenomenally hard by the scot . they have met five times and murray leads 3-2 . monfils will be the third successive high-class opponent ranked in the 20s that murray has come across this fortnight . if he plays today like he did on monday against verdasco he will extend his head-to-head lead to 4-2 . on a roll : andy murray celebrates after beating fernando verdasco in the previous round . the pugnacious ferrer goes into his battle with a win already this year over nadal on clay . the champion 's opposition thus far has been gentle , and his compatriot will give him a far greater test than he has been through to date . nadal dropped into the conversation at the weekend that his back was causing him pain and affecting his serve . the state of his body is often a mystery but if there really is a problem then ferrer will be good enough to exploit it .", "summary": " andy murray knows he will be cast as the villain when he meets gael monfils in the french open quarter-finals .   british no 1 was jeered when he beat frenchman richard gasquet in 2012 .   monfils is the last remaining frenchman left in the draw at roland garros .   murray leads monfils 3-2 in their personal meetings on tour .
