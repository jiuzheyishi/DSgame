' the size of the horses is unexpected , and the fact that they are wearing sneakers and a halter with their name written in crystal  bling  across the nose always gets a reaction . ` aside from looking very cute , they actually provide a functional purpose , ' diegel explains about the little round shoes . cute : jodie diegel , left , and her horses relax with the volunteers for her mane in heaven pet therapy organization at dynasty farm . training : jodie diegel , left , trains lara budmats , treasurer for mane in heaven , and turnabout , a 2-year-old male miniature horse , to be calm around a wheelchair . ` when we go on a linoleum or tile floor at a facility , without something like the sole of a shoe , it would be very slippery for them . ' diegel , her four board members , and the three eldest miniature horses have all passed the evaluation process of pet partners , a national organization that determines whether animals and handlers are ready for visits to places such as hospitals , nursing homes and schools . ` we 're founded with the mission to train them as therapy animals , ' diegel says , adding that miniature horses are now also being used as guides for vision-impaired persons . ` what 's really exciting is to see my vision and my mission coming to life with these miniature horses .
