{"text": "as evidenced by media stories and public awareness campaigns , americans have resolved to get tough on bullying . in that spirit , it 's time to send a message to bullies with badges . we need to tell police who prey on the vulnerable :  no more ! when you pile on a suspect and beat him to death , we will treat you just like any other alleged criminal . we will arrest you and prosecute you . and if convicted , you will go to prison for a very long time . we will make an example out of you so that other police officers will think twice before abusing their power .  the messenger could be the jury that will hear the case against two police officers in fullerton , california , a city about 25 miles southeast of los angeles . a judge ruled wednesday that the officers will stand trial in the beating death last july of kelly thomas , a 37-year-old homeless man afflicted with schizophrenia . cpl. jay patrick cicinelli is charged with involuntary manslaughter and felony use of excessive force . officer manuel ramos faces the more serious charge of second-degree murder , because prosecutors believe he took a more active role in the assault . both officers have pleaded not guilty . this week , at the preliminary hearing to determine whether enough evidence supports proceeding with a trial , prosecutors aired a graphic video of the savage beating . the footage shows about a half dozen officers punching and kicking and putting pressure on thomas ' chest , firing electric shocks from a taser stun gun , all to supposedly subdue a suspect well beyond the point where he is resisting or capable of resisting arrest . early on , ramos appears to tell the young man who is sitting on the ground :  you see my fists ? they 're getting ready to f -- you up !  another police officer is heard saying :  we ran out of options so i got to the end of my taser and i ... smashed his face to hell .  by the end of the video , thomas is lying in a pool of blood . according to prosecutors , the young man suffered brain injuries , facial fractures , broken ribs and extensive bruises and abrasions . he died five days later . what we see in that 33 minutes of footage , including a defenseless thomas screaming in pain , saying he 's sorry and pleading for help , should never happen in the united states of america . when it does happen , it ca n't be tolerated , justified , or excused . that 's coming from the son of a retired cop . my father wore a badge for 36 years , and he has no stomach for police brutality . in fact , about 20 years ago , when another piece of videotape surfaced -- that of the rodney king beating by police officers in 1991 -- i remember my father telling me that , as far as he was concerned , those out-of-control law enforcement officers wailing on king had ceased being cops and become little more than thugs and criminals . as it turns out , thomas ' father is also a retired law enforcement officer . after his son died , ron thomas made it his mission to make sure the story got out and would not be forgotten . he used social media and the internet to show the world what those officers had done to his son , complete with graphic photos that he took at the side of kelly thomas ' hospital bed . this is a good dad . but he was also , apparently , a good cop who trained fellow deputies on the right way to take down suspects . this is the wrong way . thomas described the officers ' actions as nothing less than a  hate crime against the homeless and mentally ill .  last year , fullerton city officials offered thomas nearly a million dollars to settle the case . he turned it down , and instead pushed for a criminal trial . this should bring some small comfort to ron thomas . he needs it . he has to carry around with him for the rest of his life that , as his son was fighting for his life , he cried out for his father to protect him from these bullies . on the video , we hear kelly thomas screaming :  daddy , help ! they 're killing me !  as a father myself , those words break my heart .  daddy , help ! they 're killing me !  he was killed . and now , if the cops are convicted of this crime , they have to pay .", "summary": " two police officers are charged in the beating death last july of kelly thomas .   ruben navarrette : courts must treat cops the same as any suspected criminals .   victim was a homeless mentally ill man , his dad a retired cop with a mission for justice .   navarrette : it 's hard to watch horrifying video showing thomas begging for his dad .
