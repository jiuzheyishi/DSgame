{"text": "even in victory , these are strange times at old trafford . the natives are restless and it will take more than a win over the 10 men of sunderland to convince them that all is well at manchester united under louis van gaal . supporters booed when jonny evans passed the ball back to his goalkeeper david de gea in the first half . they made no secret of their disapproval in the second when van gaal took off radamel falcao immediately after he had won a penalty . until then , united had struggled to land a glove on a stubborn sunderland side who played with lee cattermole sandwiched between two banks of four . manchester united beat sunderland 2-0 but louis van gaal still has a lot to do before the natives are happy . gus poyet is n't the first to try it at old trafford and he certainly wo n't be the last . but the way united struggled to break down their opponents for so long was not lost on their fans . they chanted ` 4-4-2 ' when united laboured to victory at qpr in january , and ` attack , attack , attack ' here after evans had sent a long pass back to de gea . the frustration is never far from the surface . one can sympathise with both van gaal and the supporters whom he is paid to please . at times this season united 's performances have not only fallen short of the cavalier football under sir alex ferguson , they have been positively joyless . an exercise in attrition . wayne rooney celebrates his opened alongside ashley young as manchester united beat sunderland . while van gaal has tinkered with his tactics and personnel , the outcome has been largely the same . the 2-0 win over sunderland followed an equally uninspiring 3-1 win over burnley on united 's last home appearance when chris smalling scored two of the goals . despite spending more than a # 150million last summer on a squad that was far from shoddy in the first place -- bringing the likes of angel di maria and falcao with him to manchester -- the dutchman has clearly struggled to make united a sum of their parts . di maria was awful here , falcao full of running but offering little threat until he won the penalty with his last contribution of the game . angel di maria yet again struggled to impress for manchester united and was subbed at half time . a generation of fans brought up on the thrills and spills of the ferguson era are having to make do with something altogether less entertaining and a lot of them simply do n't like it . even van gaal admits he is surprised they have been so patient at times . ` in barcelona , the white handkerchiefs would have come out , ' he said in december , reflecting on his first six months in english football . ` in bayern munich , they would have been whistling . in amsterdam , ajax , they would have been shouting for my  friend  cruyff . here they stand up and applaud . unbelievable . ' a relieved manchester united celebrate wayne rooney 's opener against sunderland at old trafford . that goodwill has since become a little strained , but here 's the question . performances or points ? ferguson delivered both but , for now , united fans may have choose one or the other . van gaal has been hired to get united back into the champions league . they are in third place with 11 games to go and through to the fa cup quarter-finals after losing just two of their last 21 games . the alarming decline of the david moyes era has been arrested , at least in terms of results . van gaal has won a trophy in his first season everywhere else , and you would n't bet against him doing it with united at wembley in may . just do n't expect the fa cup final to be a classic . rooney looks at sunderland defender wes brown as brown is sent off after he was shown a red card . if there 's any consolation for supporters , van gaal knows they deserve better . he has talked before about finding the ` perfect game ' , about the players needing time to buy into his ` philosophy ' before it all comes good . in his programme notes for this game he wrote : ` the signs in training , and also in some of the matches , show me that we are improving . what we are striving for now is that good all-round team performance when everything clicks into place . i am sure it is not far away . ' on the evidence of this performance , some fans will remain unconvinced .", "summary": " two goals from wayne rooney earned manchester united all three points .   but the hosts were yet again far from impressive in victory at old trafford .   big money signing angel di maria was hauled off at half time of the win .   radamel falcao also struggled to impress upfront for the red devils .
