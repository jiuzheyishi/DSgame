{"text": "who to believe about the cia 's program of enhanced interrogation -- aka , torture ? on the one hand , the senate 's report states that it did n't produce any intelligence that could not have been gained by other means , that it amounted to brutality for the sake of being brutal . on the other hand , former vice president dick cheney has asserted that the report is  full of crap ,  and that he is personally satisfied that the program was necessary and useful . it seems as if an attempt to gain insight into what the state secretly does to those who threaten it is now being recast as a partisan debate . and that 's tragic , because while some element of petty politics may indeed be involved -- as identified by former democratic sen. bob kerrey , no less -- it should n't distract from the national , moral challenge raised by this report . the challenge for the united states is how to best strike the balance between freedom and security . cheney 's big government conservatives would argue that liberty sometimes has to be surrendered in order to protect life and limb -- and that this trade-off is a no-brainer when the people being asked to make the sacrifice are n't even u.s. citizens and are self-evidently a threat to the united states . in short : who really cares what happens to america 's enemies ? there are two problems with that perspective . first , immoral acts are immoral acts regardless of who they are carried out against . all people are owed their dignity . that principle is there in genesis :  so god created man in his own image , in the image of god he created him ; male and female he created them .  and it 's there in the u.s. declaration of independence : all men are  created equal  and  endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights .  so if the state does terrible things to foreigners , it is , logically , violating what are held to be the universal rights of all people . and make no mistake : the cia violated rights when it practiced its  enhanced interrogations .  the report contains examples of a prisoner being forced to play russian roulette , threats to sexually abuse family members , and a detainee dying of suspected hypothermia due to neglect . such moral outrages are no less outrageous because they happened to bad people who ca n't vote in a u.s. election . second , faced with the gruesome details of this torture , we are compelled to question the idea that surrendering a little liberty to the state will result in increased security . it is true that there have been no more successful terrorist attacks on u.s. soil . but intelligence operations have not noticeably made the world outside america any safer , because they do not address the political , religious and economic factors driving islamism . in my country of great britain , a soldier was virtually decapitated in the street by radicals -- both known , incidentally , to our security services . iraq and syria are fighting off a caliphate . american diplomatic personnel have been killed in libya . it may well be true that the horrors could have been greater without the cia 's dirty work . but , things that did not happen can not be properly assessed . how does dick cheney prove such an unknown unknown ? moreover , any state apparatus that operates beyond the law can not truly be regarded as operating in the interests of the law . covert operations in the 1970s designed to destabilize proto-communist movements did not produce healthy democracies , but resulted in the creation of authoritarian regimes that , without any regard for constitutional niceties , abused their own people . the very fact that so much secret activity is found to operate outside the bounds of congressional oversight and , potentially , the constitution itself suggests that it is more anarchic than conservative . we can see the consequences of having too much faith in state institutions permitted to use violence in the recent riots over the michael brown killing in ferguson , missouri . a tendency towards confrontation and an over-armed police force did not bring order , but instead created the conditions under which the town descended into chaos . do not presume , as dick cheney does , that the use or threat of state violence will guarantee civil peace . on the contrary , undermining liberty can also result in undermining stability . we may find that public interest in this scandal wanes . the 2016 elections will neither be determined by candidates ' stances on the nsa surveillance controversy , nor , probably , will the fate of a few terrorists trouble primary voters . remember that george h.w. bush did not suffer in the 1988 election for his alleged role in iran-contra -- indicating that voters often tolerate what many regard as an excess of well-intentioned enthusiasm in defending the nation . but they ought to feel different . the proper functioning of a democratic republic does not exclusively rely upon having a moral leadership . it also requires having a moral citizenry that regularly scrutinize the things done in its name .", "summary": " timothy stanley : dick cheney says torture report is  crap ,  program was necessary , useful .   stanley : how can u.s. balance freedom , security ?
