{"text": "updated : . 11:34 est , 14 november 2011 . the economic forecasts are gloomy and the threat of a double-dip recession looms large . tomorrow the bank of england will slash growth prospects to just 1 per cent down from 1.5 per cent just three months ago . it 's not what a chancellor toiling away for long hours at the helm of the economy needs to hear . combined with the plethora of european summits it all appears to have left the more rotund than usual george osborne with less time to go to the gym . george osborne returns to downing street this morning after a brisk jog with what appears to be a more rotund than usual waistline . but this morning he stepped out into the morning gloom for a brisk morning jog in shorts and grey sweater . the . chancellor is also aiming to get the economy moving at a faster pace . with a series of schemes for new toll roads , housing and power stations . to kickstart growth . adding to his woes youth unemployment is expected to hit . one million for the first time since records began more than 20 years . ago and fresh details have emerged of coalition infighting over their . plans to get the economy moving , with business secretary vince cable . ruling out tory proposals to freeze benefits . the treasury is desperate to get . money flowing into the economy now by bringing forward major building . projects that might not have got off the ground for several years . what a difference a year makes : george osborne in october 2010 . insiders stress that the government will not change its deficit reduction plans , since that would be an admission they have resorted to plan b. instead , mr osborne is relying on money sitting idle in private sector pension funds and insurance schemes . under the proposals , to be announced in the growth review on november 29 , private investors will be asked to pay # 50billion into infrastructure investment funds . in exchange for their cash now , . investors would get paid a dividend later in the form of tolls from new . roads , rental income from houses or a slice of energy bills . the . plans will flood the construction industry with cash and boost jobs but . are likely to hit consumers in the long-term in the form of higher . motoring and electricity costs . a no 10 source said : ` pension funds are sitting on large amounts of capital and are reluctant to put money in . ` there 's very little public money . available so it makes sense to tap that money . ' today mr osborne also insisted once again that the uk will not not bear the financial cost of bailing out the single currency . writing in the evening standard , he said : ` the financial risks of standing behind the currency will ultimately be borne by eurozone citizens . the eurozone has the financial capacity to restore stability . they now need to deploy it without delay . ' mr osborne also restated his opposition to a financial transaction tax , warning that a levy on financial trading would be ` economic suicide ' for britain and europe . the chancellor said : ` proposals for a europe-only financial transactions tax are a bullet aimed at the heart of london . the eu should be coming forward with new ideas to promote growth , not undermine it . ' despite ` grounds for optimism ' following the formation of new governments in greece and italy , mr osborne warned that ` this remains the most dangerous moment for the world economy since lehman brothers went down in the autumn of 2008 . ' once the immediate crisis is overcome , ` over time eurozone countries will have to pool more resources and share more control over each other 's tax and spending decisions ' , said the chancellor . ` frankly , this is a big loss of national sovereignty for those countries . it is one of the reasons i have always opposed britain joining the euro . but it is the only way to make a currency union work for the long term . ` britain will not be part of this fiscal integration and this government will make sure that our national interests and our voice in the eu are protected . ' at odds : nick clegg , seen here with the prime minister , has blocked tory-backed proposals to make it easier to sack people in order to lessen the burden on small businesses . ed balls said he welcomed the fund but added that one can not have investment projects which do n't affect borrowing . mr osborne has lib dem . support for his building projects , but friction remains at the top of the coalition . about other plans . nick clegg has blocked tory-backed proposals to make it easier to sack people in order to lessen the burden on small businesses . and mr cable yesterday ruled out plans floated by the tories to freeze benefits , rather than uprate them in line with inflation . he said : ` there is no doubt , of course they should be indexed and that 's fully understood . ' but the business secretary did back the # 50billion growth plans . he said : ` what we have to do is create a framework regulation so that private investors will have the confidence to invest in big projects and help get the british economy moving again . ' shadow chancellor ed balls welcomed plans for the fund . but he added : ` you ca n't have public investment projects which do n't affect borrowing , which somehow rely upon the private sector . there is no meat there . ' mr osborne said last night : ` i fully accept we need to have more initiatives , more government plans to stimulate housing , to get homes being built , to help construction , help infrastructure , help small businesses get more credit . ` we 're going to announce plans for all those things in the next few weeks . ' the taxman 's relentless pursuit of those who owe money has seen a four-fold increase in the use of legal powers to seize the assets of late-paying companies . in the past two years , hm revenue & customs has used its ` distraint ' powers to seize assets for auction on 7,004 businesses -- up from 1,675 in 2009 . in many cases the actions left company bosses with no choice but to shut up shop . assets seized are often sold on at fire sale prices that fail to even cover the full amount of unpaid taxes and reduce the chances of other creditors being repaid . tax experts believe the aggressive pursuit is down to huge pressure being piled on to hmrc , which is also facing staffing cuts . stuart mcneill , partner at accountants mcgrigors , said : ` by barging in and selling the assets of a late-paying company without making a proper commercial assessment of the firm 's medium-term viability , hmrc risks sacrificing full payment in a few months ' time for far less cash upfront . ' taxpayers are meant to be able to negotiate late payment of taxes through the government 's ` time to pay ' scheme . but since hmrc was stripped of its ` preferred creditor ' status in 2003 , the taxman is no longer first in line to recoup any money owed if a company goes bust . ` if they do n't take an informed commercial view , they may be dealing the killer blow to some companies with a good chance of survival -- and increasing the unemployment figures , ' said mr mcneill . an hmrc spokesman said it uses its powers when ` other avenues are exhausted ' .", "summary": " chancellor says eurozone must accept ' a big loss of national sovereignty ' to stabilise its finances .   bank of england to slash growth prospects to just 1 % this year , down from 1.5 % just three months ago .   added blow for chancellor with youth unemployment expected to hit record-high .   # 50billion fund from private investors to be spent on infrastructure .
