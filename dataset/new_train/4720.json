{"text": "this should be the day nigeria steps into the spotlight and basks in the glow of hosting the world economic forum in africa . it is the first time the west african country has hosted the vip event since the geneva-based wef came to the continent nearly a quarter century ago -- but the spotlight has shifted . focus is now on the nigeria 's list of problems in the north : kidnappings , terrorist attacks and killings . the country has been a terrific economic growth story for the past few years , humming along at around 7 % . it is at the heart of what many define as an african renaissance . after decades of loans from international lenders such as the world bank , high debt and little development , africa is coming alive . that is why nigerian president goodluck jonathan and his highly regarded economic team were eager to bring global ceos to their turf . but nigeria does have a couple of obvious economic black-eyes , most notably an inability to close the wealth gap between the north and south , which in turn has given fuel to the boko haram movement and , by extension , radical islam . these groups take issue with what they see as the negative influences of globalization . the wef is seen as standing at the forefront of a policy discussion and networking linked to more , not less , globalization . the best indicator for the wealth gap is per capita income . let 's start in the financial capital of lagos and work our way north . in lagos , it is pegged at just over $ 2,900 , according to a survey by renaissance capital . in the political capital of abuja , where the economic forum is taking place , it rises to $ 4,000 . but if one heads north to borno -- the birthplace of boko haram -- per capita income is just $ 1,631 . there is an overemphasis on farming , very little in the way of an industrial base and the financial situation is even worse in surrounding states . in borno , alarmingly , 60 % of the population lives in extreme poverty , according to the nigeria security tracker . poverty and violence often go hand-in-hand , and that is the case here . nearly a third of all violent deaths in the country over the past two years have taken place in this region . one can not overlook the effort by the terrorist group to ramp up the heat ahead of this high-profile business forum . but at the same time one can not ignore the lack of progress in fighting off the violence and persistent corruption . this government 's track record of unleashing pent-up demand is solid . after re-basing its economy in early april to take in services growth , nigeria zoomed ahead of south africa as the continent 's biggest economy . nigeria and south africa are both plagued with high unemployment , but the former 's gdp now stands at over a half trillion dollars while the latter 's is at $ 325 billion . south africa also struggles with less than a third of nigeria 's growth . south africa 's president jacob zuma goes to the polls making the case that his country can serve as a springboard into the faster growing economies of west and east africa , due to its lead in financial and trade services . nigerian private sector banks and telecom providers have a different view . nigeria has all the ingredients for growth : 170 million people , a low debt level and low budget deficit with the blessing of sizable proven oil reserves . at 37 billion barrels , the country is ranked second on the continent behind libya . it is a nice recipe for growth , but the rule of law and rooting out corruption rank high on the foreign investor check list . that is where nigeria remains vulnerable . more from john defterios : pocketbook politics will decide india 's electionopinion : my country , the schizophrenic nigeriaread more : 6 reasons why the world should demand action in nigeriaopinion : nigerians do n't care about their ` new economy '", "summary": " nigeria has a nice recipe for growth , cnn 's john defterios writes .   but he says the country remains vulnerable to violence and corruption .   the rule of law rank high on the foreign investor check list , he says .
