{"text": "washington in her grilling on capitol hill on wednesday , health and human services secretary kathleen sebelius reiterated a frequent assertion in the obamacare sales pitch -- consumers have options when shopping for insurance plans on the health care exchanges .  the 15 % of our neighbors and friends who are uninsured have affordable new options in a competitive market ,  sebelius said in her testimony to the house energy and commerce committee . after apology , sebelius subpoenaed over obamacare website . but a cnn analysis found that consumer options vary significantly from state to state , and many americans are discovering that they have very few options . fact-checking obamacare claims . in west virginia and new hampshire , for example , residents shopping on the exchanges can only purchase plans from a single company . contrast that with the state-operated exchange in new york which has 16 participating companies , an average of five per county . wisconsin , which is on the federal exchange , has 13 participating insurers , although some counties in the state have only one . so what prices are people finding in states where only one insurer lists on the exchange ? in states with many insurers on exchanges , plans vary far more dramatically in price . some are more expensive but many are significantly cheaper . big difference state-to-state . in pennsylvania , for example , with 10 insurance companies listed on the exchange , a 27-year-old can buy a silver plan from highmark for $ 133.83 . highmark is the same insurance company that operates on the west virginia exchange . a 27-year-old in west virginia , meanwhile , can purchase silver plans ranging in price from $ 193.93 to $ 250.69 a month . in new hampshire , that same individual can browse silver plans costing from $ 236.46 and $ 238.62 a month . these prices do not include offsets from subsidies . individuals are also able to view less expensive bronze or catastrophic plans on the exchanges -lrb- the latter only being available for buyers under age 30 -rrb- as well as more expensive gold plans . platinum plans , which offer the highest level of coverage , are not available in west virginia or new hampshire according to the data on healthcare.gov . your options under obamacare . a department of health and human services report released in late september asserted that an average of eight insurance companies would be participating in states on the federal exchange ; try telling that to a resident of new hampshire or west virginia with their single choice . in general , urban and suburban counties with higher populations tend to have more insurers , while it 's common for rural counties to be limited to one or two options . the kaiser family foundation estimates that 12 million people live in counties with only one insurer , compared to the 117 million in counties with more than five insurers . there is no data to indicate how many of those people will be shopping for insurance in the exchange . special coverage : health care in america . rural areas suffer ; not profitable . rural areas are , on the whole , less desirable to insurance companies because they offer a smaller pool of potential customers . it is also more difficult for insurance companies to make a profit in rural counties because there are fewer health care providers and lack of competition allows regional hospitals to charge more for services . yet , the number of insurance companies operating on the exchange is often a fraction of the number that actively sells insurance in the private market . in wyoming , for instance , there are six companies that actively sell insurance but only two advertise plans on the exchange . in north carolina , nine companies sell plans , but only two of those are on the exchange and only one of those sells statewide . some companies are choosing not to participate in certain areas because they are waiting to see how the implementation of obamacare plays out in the first year . it remains to be seen how many will ultimately sign on despite the problems the exchange has faced so far . the technical problems facing the website are , to some extent , drawing attention away from the shortage of insurance options . but some lawmakers are now calling on the administration to address the issue . a group of senators and congressmen from arkansas wrote to sebelius on monday , expressing their frustration at the lack of options in their state and calling on her to release information about her department 's correspondence with state officials .  before the law 's implementation , state insurance officials claimed that there would be as many as eight carriers offering coverage in the individual market ,  wrote senator john boozman and representatives tom cotton , steve womack , rick crawford and tim griffin .  however , a consumer logging on to the ar health connector website will find , at most , four plans offering coverage , while 60 % of the state will have no more than two provider options .   this is a disappointing , if unsurprising , failure of the reforms promised by obamacare , which will mean decreased competition among plans , leading to higher costs , higher premiums , and less consumer choice .  lawmakers : arkansas families pay more . arkansas is one of six states that operate exchanges in partnership with the federal government . the authors of the letter say that families in arkansas now have to pay 100 % -600 % higher premiums under obamacare . new york site lists bakery , mechanic for obamacare help . a lack of options is certainly having an effect on insurance prices -- how much is still up for debate . cynthia cox of the kaiser family foundation looked into the link between options and price , and found that in counties with more than five insurers , the average premium was about $ 20 a month less than in areas with only one insurer . cox specifically compared the pricing available for a 40-year-old individual shopping for a silver plan . the obama administration , for its part , has discounted the significance of this analysis .  under the affordable care act , nearly all consumers -lrb- about 95 % -rrb- will have a choice of two or more health insurance issuers , often many more ,  hhs spokeswoman joanne peters said in a statement to cnn ,  and nearly all consumers -lrb- about 95 % -rrb- live in states with average premiums below earlier estimates .  peters added that ,  in the marketplace , new rating and benefit rules along with bans on pre-existing exclusions allow insurers to compete for customers based on price and quality .  this information is also reflected in the september hhs report . what else can go wrong with obamacare ? comparisons difficult to make . premiums on the federal exchange are lower than those previously projected , but comparing rate changes in any given state is tricky , according to cox , who co-authored a report for kaiser in september outlining the changes that individuals in the private market could expect . because all plans must offer an expanded set of benefits under the affordable care act , they can not be compared straightforwardly to plans offered in the past . another reason why insurance options and prices vary so significantly from region to region has to do with how state governments choose to use their rate review authority , which was expanded under the affordable care act . in some states , officials can prevent insurance companies from raising rates if they believe those rates are unjustified , and some states have used this authority to keep prices down on the exchanges . other states , such as florida , have acted to formally reject their rate review authority , thereby preventing any state influence in prices . state laws can also play a role in promoting insurance competition . in arizona , for example , there is a state requirement that prevents insurance companies from cherry-picking which counties they offer ppo plans in , according to arizona department of insurance spokeswoman erin klugh Ã¢ $  although they can selectively offer hmo plans . because of this rule , arizonans across the state have multiple insurers to choose from . cnn 's adam aigner-treworgy and jessica stanton contributed to this report .", "summary": " cnn analysis shows obamacare choices , premiums vary from state to state .   in west virginia and new hampshire , consumers only have single choice .   rural areas have fewer obamacare options because of sparse population , providers .   kaiser study shows those with more choices pay lower premiums .
