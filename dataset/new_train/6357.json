{"text": "government plans to allow voters to sack their mps were today dismissed as ` worse than meaningless ' . the long-awaited bill to allow mps to be ` recalled ' by constituents was announced in the queen 's speech . it will give constituents the opportunity to sign a petition demanding a by-election if an mp is jailed - or if the house of commons ` resolves that an mp should face a recall petition ' . deputy prime minister , walking with labour 's shadow culture secretary harriet harman in parliament today , has watered down proposals to give voters the power to sack mps . but the proposals were slammed by tory backbencher zac goldsmith , who said mps should not have a role in deciding whether or not they should face a petition to be sacked . he said : ` recall is about empowering people to hold their mps to account at all times , that 's all it is . ` it 's a very simple mechanism that happens all over the world . what this bill will do is that it gives that power to a committee of parliamentarians , of mps - the same committee , by the way , that got into trouble over maria miller . ' mr goldsmith warned that the measures would leave voters with ` no more power after this bill goes through than they do today ' , and predicted an ` immense ' backlash . he added : ` it 's worse than meaningless , it 's a pretense , and voters will know it 's a pretense at the very first scandal . ' he insisted he was still ` pleased ' that there will be a recall bill going through parliament . tory mp zac goldsmith has led a campaign to introduce the power of recall . he wants voters to be given the power to spark a by-election if they want to get rid of their member of parliament . but he added : ` the criteria are so narrow that it 's virtually meaningless , it would be impossible to recall anyone . ` so the danger of this - and it really is a danger , particularly on the back of this huge ukip vote we saw last week - is that people will discover at the very first scandal that they have been duped , that they have no more power after this bill goes through than they do today , and i think the backlash will be immense . former labour mp denis macshane was jailed for six months last year after he was caught fiddling his expenses by more than # 12,000 . ` it 's worse than meaningless , it 's a pretense , and voters will know it 's a pretense at the very first scandal ... that 's the politest word i can possibly think of , it 's a pretense , that 's what it is . ' the taxpayers ' alliance meanwhile said it was an 'em barrassingly weak ' proposal . the group 's chief executive jonathan isaby said :  this stitch-up will do nothing to restore the trust of voters in politics . it will centralise more power in westminster , rather than handing it to voters . ' alexandra runswick , director of unlock democracy , added : ` these recall proposals are symbolic of the government 's attitude to democratic reform . ` they say they want to give power back to the people but never quite manage to manage to follow through . the power to recall an elected representative between elections is an essential mechanism for democratic accountability . ` recall enjoyed cross-party support and featured in every party manifesto . why are the government afraid of giving voters their say ? ` genuine recall empowers voters not parliamentary committees . at the moment when there is a scandal political parties can have a say , they can withdraw the whip from the mp , parliament can have a say through the standards committee but voters are left out in the cold . ` the government 's watered down version of recall risks creating the illusion that people will have a say in recalling their elected representative while ensuring that this will probably never happen in practice . there is a real danger that this could alienate people from politics and politicians even further . '", "summary": " watered-down ` right to recall ' included in the queen 's speech today .   constituents can demand by-election but only if commons agrees it is fair .   tory mps attack the proposal as a con which will only anger the public .
