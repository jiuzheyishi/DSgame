{"text": "since 1941 , comic book fans have followed the exploits of teenaged archie andrews and his friends . this july , they 'll find out how he dies .  life with archie  # 36 hits stores on july 16 , and cnn can reveal exclusively that it tells the story of how archie sacrifices himself to save a friend . few details are known , but it seems fitting that archie would go out a hero . the 37th issue one week later will end the series . the  life with archie  series has been telling the stories of possible future archie scenarios for the past few years , and so archie will continue to be alive in the comics set in the present day . cnn spoke with archie comics ceo jon goldwater -lrb- son of archie creator john goldwater -rrb- about the upcoming issues . cnn : can you explain the  life with archie  series for the uninitiated ? goldwater :  life with archie  is archie 's future -- it gives readers a look into what his life would be like after high school and college , which has never really been explored . most fans are familiar with archie as a high schooler , hanging out at pop 's chocklit shop with his friends .  life with archie  shows what happens when archie becomes an adult and starts dealing with grownup issues . each issue is normally split into two storylines -- one telling a tale of archie married to veronica another with him ending up with betty . the final issue , however , will show readers archie 's final fate in both timelines -- and they 're the same . cnn : why kill archie ? goldwater : i think it 's the natural conclusion to the  life with archie  series . archie dies as he lived -- heroically . he dies saving the life of a friend , and does it in his usual selfless way . archie has always been a representation of us -- the best of us . our strengths and our faults . writer paul kupperberg , with input from myself , has crafted an emotional , impactful and classic story that i know will survive the test of time . this is n't a random one-off or  what-if  story that we 're doing as a gag . this is the story that we mapped out carefully and with much thought . this is the death of archie as we see it , and we 're treating it with that same level of gravitas and import . it 's a once-in-a-lifetime event , and we are being very considerate about it . cnn : what are you hoping to accomplish with this storyline ? goldwater : first and foremost , like with anything we do at archie , we want to tell a great , memorable story . that being said , this story in particular is of the utmost importance to us as a company and as a keeper of the archie brand . we want to not only show how archie 's life ends , but also what he means to the world around him . we want to celebrate his life . after the events of  life with archie  # 36 , fans will leap forward a year to see the aftermath , and how his friends have moved on since his surprising death . what 's jughead doing ? how are betty and veronica dealing with the loss ? it 's not about the attention-grab of the death but about telling a great , evocative story that reminds people why this character is important to the fabric of pop culture -- and showing how heroic a normal guy like archie can be , and how important it is to realize that . this is n't a story we 're going to retcon a few weeks from now . this happened . this is the conclusion to the  life with archie  story and timeline , and it will allow us as a company and the world to take a moment to look at archie 's life as a whole and recognize him as one of the most important characters -- not in just comics -- but in popular culture . we want people to feel the same emotional roller coaster we felt putting this story together -- to feel the range of emotions , from happiness , sadness , anger , joy and pride . we want people to react to this in a strong way because archie is so important to them . cnn : how do you hope fans will react ultimately ? goldwater : we expect some level of shock , outrage and surprise -- followed by understanding . as a company , we are not afraid to take risks . we 're not scared to shake things up to draw attention to the great stories we 're building here at archie . i hope fans will be intrigued by this news , pick up the issues in july and realize they 've been given one of the best comics on the stands . they 'll be handed a piece of comic book history , featuring some of the most well-known characters in the world saying goodbye to an icon . we want fans to talk about this for years to come . we think this story is bigger than anything we 've ever done -- it 's bold , dramatic and best of all , a fitting end to the life of archie . cnn : what do you think archie comics has been doing by shaking things up over the recent years ? archie : we 're a sleeping giant . years ago , before i stepped in as ceo , archie was seen as a dormant , nostalgia brand stuck in amber . we were in suspended animation . people thought the stories were still set in the '50s ! now , while the characters -- like betty , archie , veronica , jughead and reggie -- are at their core the same , riverdale has changed . it 's caught up with the times . the town of riverdale you read about now is like any other in america . it 's diverse , it 's not problem-free , and it represents america in an honest way . archie is about being welcoming , diverse and entertaining . we 've managed to strike that balance in our storytelling for the last five years and managed to not only get attention , but keep people entertained . from the introduction of kevin keller , the first regular gay character in comics to now , the death of archie , we 've not been afraid to take risks . the big thing is , though , our risks pay off because the stories , art and execution are spot-on . we back up what we say . cnn : what will be the long-term impact of this story ? goldwater : well , this is the end . this is how archie dies in the pages of  life with archie .  we will not be retconning , reversing or backtracking on this story in terms of  life with archie .  the main archie line , however , telling stories of archie in high school , will continue .  afterlife with archie  -lsb- the  archie  zombie series -rsb- will continue , and we will keep on taking risks with different and new interpretations of our characters . but as far as we see it , this is how archie dies . that 's how we approached this story and how we 're treating it .", "summary": " archie andrews will die in upcoming issue of  life with archie     life with archie  is a look at archie 's possible future scenarios .   series will end one issue after archie 's death .
