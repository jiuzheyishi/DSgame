{"text": "juneau , alaska it started when a friend handed her the book  scream quietly or the neighbors will hear ,  about violence against women .  i took it home and did n't put it down all night ,  caren robinson told me , laughing nervously and then tearing up , her voice quavering .  and i realized it was me . we just did n't talk about it back then ... i just thought i was the only one .  that was in the late 1970s , shortly after robinson -- a fiery 63-year-old who looks like the alaska version of reba mcentire -- moved to juneau , alaska , to escape an abusive husband who , at different points over years , held a gun to her head , beat her and , one time , sexually assaulted her . she called the cops on him twice , she told me , but he never was arrested or charged . the police told her maybe she should consider a divorce or that , when he used a gun , he was just  teasing  and it had gotten out of hand , she told me . robinson would go on to become a pioneer of the women 's rights movement in a state that needs it more than any other . alaska is estimated to have the highest rate of reported rape in the county , according to fbi crime data . the rate is three times the national average . state surveys show 37 % of women will face sexual violence ; and 59 % will suffer from threats , domestic abuse and/or sexual assault . because those numbers are still so high , robinson sometimes wonders if all her work to end violence against women here has been a waste of time . it has n't , of course . the results can be seen inside the walls of the aiding women in abuse and rape emergencies , or aware , shelter in juneau , which first opened in a two-bedroom house in the late 1970s and at its current location in 1985 -- a time when there were few if any women 's shelters in the state . they can be seen in the lives changed because she took battered women into her houseboat before there was any formal place for them to go . and they can be seen in alaska 's council on domestic violence and sexual assault , which she helped lobby for and create , and which continues to fund violence prevention and treatment programs here . it 's the rest of the state that needs to step up . the lawless ` end of the land ' too many women are n't believed when they come forward to report rape and domestic abuse . too many offenders are n't prosecuted . -lrb- only 46 % of reported sexual assaults in alaska are referred for prosecution and 22 % result in a conviction , according to the university of alaska anchorage justice center . -rrb- . too many families tolerate or just accept abuse and rape they see and hear in their own homes . and far too many communities remain virtually lawless . all that could change if the state would follow robinson 's lead . her life story should be enough of a wake-up call for this state . alaska 's pioneer woman grew up in weatherford , texas , about as far from alaska as an american could get . she was a beauty queen -- became miss parker county at age 17 , wearing a gown her mother made . but she remembers that night more for the violence . it was the first time her then-boyfriend gave her a black eye . he was jealous of the attention , she told me . but she stuck with him , thought she was in love . the rapist next door .  i remember ... hiding , putting makeup on around my eyes , trying to avoid my mother and father for a few days ,  she said .  embarrassed .  it only escalated from there . she tried to leave and he came back for her , one time riding after her on a motorcycle , she said . she ended up moving to alaska to finally get away , for good . they were divorced by then , and a group of her friends drove up to the state on a bus and she followed with her 4-year-old son , on a plane .  i lucked out ,  she said .  it 's the best thing that ever happened to me .  shortly after she arrived in juneau , that 's when a friend gave her the book that would open up all her thinking -- make her realize that she had n't done anything to deserve being beaten and raped , that violence against women was a disease that grew from silence and oppression . she learned that juneau was not up to protecting its women ; the city had no 911 service , let alone a shelter for battered women . so she did something about it : she and a group of like-minded friends started housing survivors of rape and domestic violence in their homes . that 's when she started letting women stay in her tiny houseboat , which she rented because she could n't afford a home in picturesque juneau . to hear her son , shane robinson , in his 40s , tell it , his mom was at this work virtually on her own , his whole life .  she worked pretty much all the time ,  he told me . and he said he thinks now that their lives were at risk because of her advocacy . states where rape is most common . her voice is one alaska did n't want to hear . robinson set up a hot line for victims and responded to some of the emergency calls herself . she remembers waking up in the middle of the night and throwing shane in the car to go to a hospital with a rape kit , to be sure it was used .  unfortunately , the case never went anywhere ,  she said .  i even remember -lrb- police -rrb- called her to take two lie detector tests to make sure she was telling the truth .   we even did radical things like post pictures of known rapists in all of the bar bathrooms ,  robinson told me ,  because we could n't get the assistance we needed from the local law enforcement at the time .  when other survivors of violence were n't willing to speak up , robinson met with members of the state legislature . she said that sharing her story openly helped men who might otherwise ignore these issues pay attention and change laws . forcing that conversation may be robinson 's greatest contribution . she realizes that . 5 ways to help end rape in alaska .  it 's now in the public eye ,  she said .  people ca n't turn their heads any longer . they see it . they hear it . they know it 's happening .  but she wrestles with her legacy . several years ago , she backed away from advocating for victims of rape and domestic violence . after several public officials and community pillars in juneau were outed as abusers , she became paranoid , she told me . she started thinking everyone she met was an abuser or rapist .  there is a blessing in not knowing how bad it is around you , except by picking up the paper and seeing it daily : a 30-year-old man , a 45-year-old woman , a 27-year-old man have been arrested for domestic violence ,  she said . talk to her about the statistics now -- that alaska is still america 's rape capital -- and the life drains from her face as she says she 's not sure anything 's changed . alaska needs to prove her wrong . this state can change . it just needs to wake up , like robinson did all those years ago .  violence inside the home , within the family , is not new , and because it is not new , it is not easy to see it for what it is ,  erin pizzey , a women 's rights activist in the uk , writes in the book that changed the course of robinson 's life back in the 1970s .  people have had lots of practice in ignoring it . they will turn a blind eye or cross the road . they will even , as one woman told women 's aid , turn up the tv to block out the shouting and sobbing next door so that they can no longer hear it .  turn down the tv , alaska . and do it for caren robinson . alaska faces its ` resident evil ' the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of john d. sutter .", "summary": " john sutter meets a pioneer of the women 's rights movement in alaska .   caren robinson once sheltered battered women in her houseboat in juneau .   she later would open one of the first women 's shelters in the state .   alaska is estimated to have the highest rate of reported rape in the country .
