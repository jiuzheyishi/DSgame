{"text": "a terminally ill 28-year-old woman has been granted the right to die by a judge after a dramatic legal battle with her parents . grace sung eun lee , a bank manager from new york who has terminal brain cancer , had told her parents and the doctors : ` i want to die . ' but because her parents are deeply religious and belong to a korean christian church in queens , they believe that allowing her daughter to choose death over life is a sin . a judge at the state appeals court today sided with miss lee after the rift with her parents led to an agonising legal battle for the family . doctors are set to be given the go-ahead to turn off her life support , unless her parents launch further legal action . bitter battle : grace sung eun lee , centre , is on breathing tubes following a seizure from a brain tumour , but her parents will not allow her to be removed from the tubes . devastated : miss lee 's parents are pictured at the hospital after hearing the news that she has won the right to die . happier times : grace , centre , pictured with her parents manho lee , left , and jin-ah lee , right ; her father is a pastor at a flushing , queens church . speaking with the new york daily news , ms lee 's mother , jin-ah lee , said : ` despite all this confusion , -lrb- my daughter -rrb- wants to go to heaven . i keep telling her she can get better . ' her daughter is currently at long island north shore hospital , hooked up to breathing tubes that are keeping her alive . she is paralysed from the neck down due to the tumour on her brain stem . ms lee 's father is antioch missionary church reverend manho lee , and practices out of his church in the flushing neighbourhood of queens . his congregation has flocked behind him to pray for ms lee and tell her of god 's plans for her life . the sin of suicide , they said , would condemn their daughter 's soul to hell . the difference in beliefs has led to an emergency end-of-life hearing at the hospital , with the two sides bitterly re-affirming their respective stances . smiling : ms lee had worked as a manager at bank of america and lived in manhattan . meeting : on october 1 , there was a press conference at north shore hospital to inform the media of grace 's condition . speaking on behalf of ms lee , dr dana lustbader testified that the patient ` consistently asks that her breathing tube be removed . ' however , rev lee and his wife argued that their daughter is heavily medicated , and is not lucid enough to make the life-or-death decision . end-of-life issues are ones that are at once vastly personal and highly polarised . according to the american college of physicians , the important thing is to do what the person said they wanted , rather than what the person forced to make a decision . in cases where the patient can not speak for themselves and there are no specific end-of-life wishes , the acp suggests : ` you can make a decision if you can determine what the person probably would have chosen , ' known as a ` substituted judgment . ' doctors said that her medications , including morphine and an anti-anxiety medication , are not strong enough to cloud her judgment . ms lee 's troubles began last year . before her illness , she worked as a manager for bank of america , living and working in manhattan . she was also training for the famous new york city marathon . she had emigrated with her parents from seoul , south korea , the daily news reported . but ms lee was devastated when she was diagnosed with a tumour in her brain stem . though she received chemotherapy and radiation , the treatments did not successfully target the tumour , and last month , she had a seizure that eventually left her paralysed . ms lee had apparently talked to nurses at north shore about removing the tubes , but her parents interceded . offering support : members of the congregation in ms lee 's room , praying for her to be healed . full of life : grace sung eun lee pictured before her illness . a facebook page entitled save grace sungeun lee cites a passage from the old testament , which reads : ` for i know the plans i have for you ,  declares the lord .  plans to prosper you and not to harm you , plans to give you hope and a future . ' a post from tuesday reads : ` we can see god 's powers working every day and know that god has a plan for her too ! ' children from the congregation have written notes of encouragement for the 28-year-old , with one writing : ` i hope you feel better . i miss you , grace teacher . ' cultural , as well as religious differences have come to play in ms lee 's case . rev young gab hyun said : ` in korean culture ... we believe that the decisions that the parents make have a lot more influence in this type of matter . ' words of love : young members of the church offered kind words to ms lee , calling her ` grace teacher , ' and pleading with her to come back soon . ` the role of religion in medial decision making really pertains to the patient , ' tia powell , m.d. , the director of montefiore einstein center for bioethics , told mailonline . ` if the patient is capable of making her decisions , then that 's where we would honour . ' dr powell added that while it may be heart-wrenching for the parents to face , she said the goal of bioethics is to bring the families together . ` the question is not whether she 's going to die , it 's how she 's going to die . ` there 's nothing worse than losing a child , ' she said , ` but there are limits to medical treatment . there are many things we can not fix , we can not perform miracles . ' dr powell said that there are some practices that could help ms lee 's parents come to terms with their daughter 's illness . ` these are religious people , and they know we are all mortal , ' she said . ` being clear about that can maybe help decrease their suffering .
