{"text": "nasa has given the people of earth a rare treat : a color mosaic that captures not only saturn , but also the tiny dots of earth and other planets in the background . the panorama , released tuesday , was captured by the cassini spacecraft on july 19 , when the sun slipped behind the ringed planet . earth appears as a bright blue dot to saturn 's lower right , just above saturn 's outer , halo-like e-ring . venus is a dot to the upper left , with mars appearing as a faint red dot above and to the left of venus . this is the first image in which saturn , its moons and rings , and earth , venus and mars are all visible , nasa said . the image -- a panorama of 141 wide-angle pictures -- covers 404,880 miles across saturn and its ring system . cassini images showing both saturn and earth are rare because the sun is so close to earth , that targeting the blue planet would damage cassini 's sensors , nasa says . the july 19 image was possible because saturn blocked out the sun . lonely , young planet drifting in space without a star . space-minded earthlings might remember that july 19 was  wave at saturn  day . the cassini team , knowing it would be capturing the saturn-earth images , invited people to take photos of themselves waving to the sky while the spacecraft took earth 's picture . cassini was never going to see people gesturing from the tiny blue speck , of course , but that was n't the point . people shared more than 1,400 images of themselves from that event , and in august , nasa released a collage of those pictures assembled to look like -- from a distance -- a portion of earth 's western hemisphere . the cassini spacecraft was launched in 1997 and has been in orbit around the sixth planet from the sun since 2004 . nasa hopes to have it continue to get more pictures and other data of saturn , its rings and moons through 2017 . diamonds may be produced on other planets , including saturn .", "summary": " image is cassini 's first showing saturn , rings , moons , earth , venus and mars at same time .   the collage is panorama of 141 wide-angle pictures taken july 19 .   image was possible that day because saturn obstructed spacecraft 's view of sun .
