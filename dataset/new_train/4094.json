{"text": "paris -lrb- cnn -rrb- at least a dozen people have been detained in the paris region in connection with last week 's shootings , the city prosecutor 's office said friday . the people arrested are suspected of providing logistical support for the attacks . the arrests were made in the grigny and fleury-merogis neighborhoods , and those arrested were in amedy coulibaly 's entourage , the paris prosecutor 's representative said . coulibaly was killed last friday in a police siege to end a hostage taking at a kosher supermarket in paris . he had killed four hostages and is believed to have shot a policewoman to death in the city a day earlier . two days before coulibaly was killed , brothers said and cherif kouachi had attacked the offices of satirical magazine charlie hebdo , killing 12 people and injuring 11 . they died the same day as coulibaly as police moved in to end a separate siege . there does not appear to be a command-and-control element to the paris attacks other than a general  go forward and do something ,  a western official with direct knowledge told cnn , describing the attack as  highly franchised terrorism with general instructions .  the kouachi brothers  legitimately aligned with aqap  and cherif kouachi was associated with networks that brought him to yemen to train with the terror group , but coulibaly 's alleged connection with isis is still unclear , the official said . aqap refers to al qaeda in the arabian peninsula . investigators are still trying to determine whether coulibaly coordinated with the kouachi brothers in the execution of the attacks or launched his own attack after learning of their actions , said the western official . who were the victims ? france 's frayed nerves will not be eased by the belgian authorities ' operation thursday to dismantle a suspected terror cell believed to be on the brink of carrying out attacks on police . however , investigators have so far found no links with events in paris , belgian prosecutor eric van der sypt said . meanwhile , in the french city of reims , about 90 miles -lrb- 145 kilometers -rrb- northeast of paris , the city hall confirmed friday that a police operation had taken place and that there had been gunfire . it 's not clear whether this is related to the investigation of the paris attacks . however , reims was the hometown of said kouachi . at the same time , a man with a handgun entered a post office in colombes , a northwestern suburb of paris , according to the local police department . police said the man might be mentally unstable and that they did not know yet if this was terror-related . according to french media , there are up to five hostages inside the post office . in his first visit to france since last week 's terror attacks , u.s. secretary of state john kerry said that he  really wanted to come here and share a hug with all of paris and all of france .  standing alongside paris mayor anne hidalgo , kerry added that he  wanted to express to you personally the sheer horror and revulsion  over what he called a  living nightmare .  american singer james taylor also appeared , crooning a customized version of his 1971 hit song ,  you 've got a friend .  kerry met earlier with president francois hollande , when he voiced the  full and heartfelt condolences  of americans .  we watched the people of france come together with a great sense of purpose and unity . it was a great lesson to the world that once again , france 's commitment to freedom and passion of ideas has made an important statement to the world ,  kerry said . kerry laid a wreath at a makeshift memorial at the site of the kosher supermarket attack friday , accompanied by foreign minister laurent fabius . kerry and fabius spoke there for several minutes with joel mergui , the president of consistoire du paris , a national jewish organization . kerry and fabius also paid their respects at the offices of charlie hebdo . francois vauglin , the mayor of paris ' 11th district , where the offices are located , told cnn that kerry 's visit was very welcome .  it 's so important for us to feel supported at this time ,  he said . the street is still cordoned off as investigators continue to comb the area for clues , adding to the sense of disquiet for local residents , he said .  we know that the threat is still very high , and we do n't know how long we will be able to withstand this threat ,  he said . president barack obama 's administration has admitted it erred by not sending a senior figure to a huge unity march held sunday in paris . more than 40 world leaders , including the british , german and israeli heads of state and russia 's foreign minister , joined at least 1.5 million people on the french capital 's streets . the goodbyes continue after the attack on the charlie hebdo offices . funerals are being held for magazine editor stephane  charb  charbonnier , illustrator philippe honore and algerian-born copy editor mustapha ourrad . the question of where to bury their killers is more contentious . cherif kouachi 's widow , izzana kouachi , has requested that both he and his brother said kouachi be buried in gennevilliers , on the outskirts of paris . the gennevilliers mayor 's office told cnn that the city was obliged by law to bury cherif kouachi there , as he was a resident of the city . but a spokesman for the mayor , jean-francois boye , said that it would not do the same for said because he lived in reims .  that 's for sure , he 's not from gennevilliers , we wo n't let him get a funeral here ,  boye said . a  survivors ' issue  of charlie hebdo was published wednesday -- the first since the attack . copies have flown off the racks of newsstands despite a print run of more than 4 million . however , the magazine 's decision to run a cartoon of the prophet mohammed on the front cover -- not for the first time -- has been criticized by a number of muslim leaders , since this is deeply offensive to many muslims . anger over the cartoon boiled over into violence friday in pakistan , where police resorted to using tear gas and water cannons to disperse protesters outside the french consulate in karachi . a pakistani photographer for afp was shot and injured at the protest , the french news agency reported . he is  doing better ,  it said via twitter . ahmed chinoy , chief of karachi 's citizen police liaison committee , told cnn that investigations were underway to determine who shot the journalist . at least 200 protesters were involved in the violence , which broke out after religious parties called supporters out to condemn the cartoon following afternoon prayers , chinoy said . the protests come a day after pakistan 's parliament unanimously passed a resolution condemning the caricatures printed in charlie hebdo . several french media outlets ' websites went down friday morning , including those of radio station france inter , newspapers le parisien and 20 minutes , weekly magazines l'express and marianne , and investigative publication mediapart . this prompted speculation that the outage could be the result of a hack linked to publication of the charlie hebdo cover . but internet service provider oxalide said it was not the result of a cyberattack . with france on its highest level of alert , 10,000 troops have deployed across the country . thousands of police officers are on patrol , including hundreds assigned to protect jewish schools . as france still reels from the shock of the paris attacks , authorities in neighboring belgium swooped in on an alleged terror cell in an operation that left two suspects dead . prosecutor van der sypt said weapons and police uniforms were recovered as part of raids on a dozen properties in belgium , in which 13 people were arrested . the plan was to kill police officers on public roads or in police offices , he said . two people were also arrested in france , he said , and belgium will be asking for them to be extradited . they are belgian nationals who belong to the alleged cell but were found in france , he said . a western intelligence source told cnn that the ongoing terror threat appears to involve up to 20 sleeper cells of between 120 and 180 people ready to strike in france , germany , belgium and the netherlands . al qaeda in the arabian peninsula claimed responsibility wednesday for the charlie hebdo shooting . the attack was years in the making , aqap commander nasr ibn ali al-ansi said in a video , claiming u.s.-born cleric anwar al-awlaki was the mastermind behind it . in the days since last week 's attacks , security services have been working to track those associated with the kouachi brothers and coulibaly . neetin karasular , a suspected belgian trafficker in weapons who met coulibaly 's widow , hayat boumeddiene , is in custody , karasular 's attorney , michel bouchat , told cnn on friday . karasular has been charged with association with wrongdoers and offenses relating to firearms , in a case handled by the local public prosecutor 's office in charleroi , belgium . according to bouchat , police did n't find any weapons at karasular 's house . however , the police investigation revealed that karasular used to spend time in a garage in charleroi where documents were found that mentioned weapons . according to multiple belgian media accounts , these included documents about the type of gun used by coulibaly in the attack on the supermarket a week ago . bouchat told cnn that his client was not at all connected to thursday 's police raids in belgium . according to the attorney , karasular was n't involved in any jihadi group . bouchat confirmed that karasular had previous convictions . how the kouachi brothers were radicalized . cnn 's sandrine amiel and margot haddad reported from paris , and laura smith-spark wrote and reported from london . cnn 's ray sanchez , pamela brown and tim lister contributed to this report .", "summary": " at least a dozen people are detained in paris in connection with last week 's shootings .   u.s. secretary of state john kerry pays respects to the
