' the advertisement also said the chair had ` severe scratch marks ' on the arms ` like someone has been aggressively dragging their fingernails ' . mr williams wrote that some repair work had been done on the piece , but it was not fully restored because he was ` too afraid to touch the chair ' . the seller wrote on the item description that he frequently found the chair on its side after hearing crying and tapping . bidding for the chair starts at $ 25 and the buy-it-now price is $ 666 .
