{"text": "khartoum , sudan many southerners are voting for an independent sudan this week , thirsting for freedom from the north . they equate sharia or islamic law that president omar al-bashir has vowed to strengthen with slavery . al-bashir has declared that if southern sudan votes in favor of separation , sharia will become the main source of sudan 's constitution , islam the state religion and arabic the official language . many in the north are embracing al-bashir 's pledge . newspaper publisher al-tayib mustafa said he will be happy to see his nation break in two . islam , he said , comes above all else .  when the south goes , then the north will be muslim ,  he said .  for a muslim , unity is not as important as religion . sharia is religion . sharia is islam .  but there are other faces of islam in sudan , including a sufi community , and mustafa 's position is hardly shared by all sudanese . some in the north consider themselves arabs , others africans . they speak a dozen different languages , and while a majority of people are muslims , a significant number are christians or practice traditional religions . sharia already is the law of the land in northern sudan , but sudanese authorities have relaxed its enforcement since 2005 when a peace treaty ended more than 20 years of civil war . the war pitted a northern government of arab muslims against blacks in southern sudan who practice christianity and animist religions . it killed 2 million people and displaced several million others , mainly from southern sudan . the president 's comments have stirred fear that the government will implement sharia for the hundreds of thousands of southerners and other non-muslims in northern sudan , including many who fled fighting , disease and famine in the south . even many muslims find the imposition of islamic law troubling , and it 's even more disturbing for the small and ancient christian community in the north .  we as christians , we feel that christianity is a sudanese religion and should be respected ,  said bishop ezekiel kondo , who oversees khartoum 's episcopal church and chairs the sudan council of churches . al-bashir 's vow to strengthen islamic law came as a shock to kondo .  as a church we are not happy with what he said , and we feel as the president -- he is the president for everyone in the country -- he knows very well that there are other religious communities .  but mohammed othman salih , secretary-general of the sudanese muslim clerics council , brushed aside such concerns .  the islamic sharia guarantees the rights of non-muslims better than secular laws ,  he said .  why ? because it 's an issue of a religious duty , and they are human rights sanctified by god almighty .
