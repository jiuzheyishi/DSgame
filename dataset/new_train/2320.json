{"text": "a new chapter in the fast-food wars was created with heinz hiring bernardo hees , former burger king ceo , to lead its company . despite a decades-long relationship , mcdonald 's terminated its contract with heinz due to this hiring decision . while heinz has not publicly addressed its reasons for naming hees ceo , questions have been raised about the strategy behind recruiting him . perhaps , given his fast-food experience , the plan was to have him turnaround a relationship that had been falling apart for several years . while many perceive the hiring of hees as an abrupt end to the heinz mcdonald 's relationship , it actually began souring during the 1973 tomato shortage . heinz , in a 2011 interview with the wall street journal , revealed that it only was serving two u.s. markets -- minneapolis and pittsburgh -- for mcdonald 's . within that same article , heinz announced new ketchup packaging that , while not specifically developed to lure mcdonald 's back , created hope that the door could be reopened . to date , that has not happened , and with hees at the helm , the door is now completely closed . possibly , heinz expected hees fast-food industry background to rejuvenate its mcdonald 's relationship and drive revenue from it . if that was the rationale , the strategy clearly backfired . however , the expectation of success primarily based on prior industry experience parallels a common salesperson hiring strategy . executives in search of fast , high performance often focus their recruiting campaigns on candidates within their industry -- with a watchful eye on the competitor 's top salespeople . is this a brilliant growth strategy or a myth that , more often than not , leads to failure ? to share a story ... during the dot-com boom , i was the director of sales for a large technology training company . at that time , microsoft , cisco , novell , and ibm were experiencing explosive growth -- which created tremendous demand for information technology training to support its products . while our company was doing well , a competitor had fallen on hard times which led to my receiving a phone call from one of its top salespeople . he , and a group of five others , were interested in joining our firm . it would be inaccurate to say that the six salespeople were interviewed by our company . the truth is job offers were fast-tracked because of their industry background .  this group requires no training and is bringing clients with them ... fast , high performance .  -- at least that is what we believed . all six accepted the job offers and all six were no longer with the company within ninety days of their hiring . we thought they would succeed -lrb- and fast -rrb- because of their industry experience -- but the plan was flawed . while they had been successful with a competitor , they were mismatched with our company . our executive team , like so many others , was blinded by the myth of assured success when hiring those with industry background . while prior industry experience is certainly helpful to a salesperson , it is not a guarantee of success -- far from it . many executives cite  complexity of the industry  as a reason to exclusively hire salespeople from competitors -- inferring that industry knowledge is too hard to teach . if that 's true , how did these executives learn their industry ? they certainly did n't come out of the womb with that insight . those executives are really communicating that they do n't want to train salespeople on the industry fundamentals . it also dangerously assumes that the competition is doing a better job of training salespeople than they are . of course , another reason executives pursue the competition 's salespeople is the expectation they will bring a book of business with them -- also a myth . moving clients from one supplier to another is very difficult to do - unless there are reasons other than the salesperson changing business cards . not to mention , there are potential legal issues when salespeople try to move  their  clients when changing jobs . limiting salesperson hiring to just those with industry experience creates a scalability problem for the company . there are only so many people with industry experience and only a small subset who the company would want on the team . what happens when the candidate pool runs dry and there are job openings on the sales team ? rather than blindly pursue those salespeople with industry mastery , first study each sales role and identify the factors that affect performance . what causes salespeople to succeed or fail in the role ? understanding the performance factors provides the means to carefully assess sales talent for matches to those factors . not only does this help identify which candidates with industry background will succeed in the company , but it also opens the door to strong candidates without prior industry experience . cast the  industry experience  requirement aside and hire those salespeople who have what it takes to succeed in the company . hiring right is the first step of positioning the business for success . the second is to create a sales on boarding program teaching salespeople the requisite knowledge to deliver fast , high performance for the company . reviewing performance factors before hiring and developing on boarding programs are not just sales hiring strategies . these steps are also applicable for leadership positions . had heinz taken this approach , they may have selected a different ceo to lead the company . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of lee b. salz .", "summary": " mcdonald 's terminated contract with heinz after hiring former burger king ceo .   management expert lee salz says hiring former competitors is flawed strategy .   ignore  industry experience  hiring practice , says salz .
