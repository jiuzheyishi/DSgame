{"text": "women who take antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to have a child with autism -lrb- file picture -rrb- . women who take antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to have a baby with autism , new research has revealed . the u.s. study supports previous research which has shown that taking ssri antidepressants during pregnancy increases a woman 's risk of having a child with the developmental disability . despite the link , researchers say the chances of a woman who takes ssris during pregnancy having a child with autism remain very low . for the latest study , researchers at drexel university , in philadelphia , analysed large population based registers of nearly 750,000 births in denmark from 1997 through 2006 . they found that about 1.5 per cent of children born to women who had taken an ssri during pregnancy were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder -lrb- asd -rrb- , compared to about 0.7 per cent of children born to an otherwise similar group of women not taking the medication . ` we found a two-fold increased risk for asd associated with in utero exposure to ssris compared to the unexposed reference group , ' said lead author dr nicole gidaya . dr gidaya , added that ` if the increased asd risk we saw here is real , it is important to realise that the number of asd cases that could be prevented by reducing ssri exposure in pregnancy still represents only a small fraction of overall cases of asd . ' the researchers also urged people to be cautious about the results as they say it is difficult to distinguish between the effects of the underlying condition and of the medication . ` as we complete research in our attempts to understand autism 's causes we continue to realise that there are likely many genetic and non-genetic contributors , ' said dr craig newschaffer , director of the a.j. drexel autism institute and professor in drexel 's school of public health , and the study 's senior author . ` we must begin trying to map these multiple risk factors on to common pathways , so that these pathways can be a focus in our effort to prevent the impairment associated with asd . ` pathways involving the brain 's serotonin system are still one viable candidate . ' some 1.5 per cent of children born to women who took ssris during pregnancy develop autism -lrb- file picture -rrb- . the news comes just after another u.s. study suggested that mothers-to-be who take antidepressants may be three times more likely to have a baby boy with autism . researchers from the john hopkins bloomberg school of public health found boys were much more likely to develop autism when their mothers took antidepressants than girls were . they also found that the link between autism and ssris was particularly pronounced in children whose mothers took the drugs during the third trimester of their pregnancy .", "summary": " mothers-to-be who take ssris are twice as likely to have an autistic child .   1.5 % of children born to mothers who took the drugs have autism .   0.7 % of the children of women who did not take them have autism .
