' like most people , sherr only learned about ride 's 27 year relationship with her partner , tam o'shaughnessy , after the former astronaut died of pancreatic cancer in 2012 , aged just 61 years old . ` sally was very good at keeping secrets , ' writes sherr on her book . despite spending much of her life on the public stage , ride was an introvert and fiercely private person . she and o'shaughnessy first met in . their teens when both were aspiring tennis players , although ride had several relationships with men before the friends started an intimate relationship . according . to o'shaughnessy , the couple kept their relationship a secret throughout . ride 's life for fear it would n't be accepted and concern over the . impact it would have on their business . the pair co-founded sally ride science , a program aimed at encouraging young girls to explore science , in 2001 . ride 's sexuality is one of number of secrets revealed in a new book , sally ride : america 's first woman in space , written by former abc news correspondent lynn sherr , right . ` we both lived through billie jean 's . horrors , of being gay and being in the public eye . and we both were . afraid it would hurt the business . so we elected to be private about . it . ' tam o'shaughnessy , sally ride 's lover . ` corporate america is really nervous about gay women , ' o'shaughnessy told sherr . ` when we started sally ride science , we were just worried that it would affect the growth of the company , the sponsorships . ` we both lived through billie jean 's horrors , of being gay and being in the public eye . and we both were afraid it would hurt the business . so we elected to be private about it . ' like many . gay people of their generation , both ride and o'shaughnessy felt . uncomfortable about openly expressing their sexuality in public . ` we . never publicly said ,  we 're gay .  we did n't like labels of any kind , . but especially the ones referring to sexuality : queer , lesbian , . homosexual , ' said o'shaughnessy . the couple were good friends with billie jean king , who was outed in 1981 , although the former tennis star tells sherr that ride never asked what effect coming out had had on king 's career . ` never . i thought it was weird , ' said king . ` selfishly i thought it would be . great if sally came out , and if tam came out , but i knew they were n't . there . i thought it would be great for an example of being gay and . powerful and all the wonderful things , to be yourself and to be . authentic . ' ` but it 's easy for me to say , i 'm in a different place . when you 're not in that place , you 're just frightened . ' returning hero : ride gets a big hug from her astronaut husband steven hawley . the couple divorced after five years of marriage . ' i believe that sally did love me when we got married , ' he said . ride left nasa in 1987 and in 2001 she co-founded the sally ride science , a program aimed at encouraging young girls to explore science , along with her partner . ride 's overwhelming need for privacy is a reoccurring theme throughout the book . sherr describes her as a ` resolutely guarded ' person and writes that ` while tam -lrb- o'shaughnessy -rrb- kept nothing from her best buddies , sally told no one , not even the insiders . ' a friend of o'shaughnessy says that around other people a lot of the relationship ` was about looks and actions , not words . ' ' i never heard sally say ,  i love you ,  to tam , ' said kay loveland . ` but you could tell they were in love by the way they would touch each other when they 'd go by . ' although the ` superb compartmentalizer ' ride never publicly acknowledged her sexuality and her relationship with o'shaughnessy , the situation was different away from the spotlight . among their close group of friends - gay and straight - the couple were far from closeted . they regularly traveled together , staying together in hotels and attending public functions together , even attending each other 's university events . the pair also wore matching rings - each on the fourth finger of their left hand . friends : former tennis star billie jean king said ride never asked her about what effect coming out had had on her career . ' i thought it was weird , ' said king . while still a student at stanford university , ride was one of 8,000 people who answered an advertisement in the student newspaper seeking applicants for the space program . she was chosen to join nasa in 1978 and while she excelled at her work , her ` fiercely private ' nature meant she struggled with the media attention that descended upon her after she was selected as america 's first female astronaut . during press conferences , she was asked questions like , ` will the flight affect your reproductive organs ? ' and ` do you weep when things go wrong on the job ? ' despite this and the historical significance of the mission , ride insisted that she saw herself in only one way - as an astronaut . a good example of ride 's desire for privacy was her marriage in 1982 , a year before her first flight , to fellow astronaut steven hawley . the couple got married in secret at his parent 's house and the media was only informed until a month later . despite rumors that nasa had put pressure on ride to marry ahead of her maiden space flight , her ex-husband denies it . on june 18 , 1983 , ride , then 32 , became the first american woman in space as a crew member on space shuttle challenger for sts-7 . ' i believe that sally did love me when we got married , ' said hawley , ` and that she entered the marriage in good faith . ' the couple divorced five years later , just when ride was leaving nasa , although they remained good friends throughout the rest of her life . on june 18 , 1983 , ride became the first american woman in space as a crew member on space shuttle challenger for sts-7 . aged 32 , she was the first woman to use the robot arm in space and the first to use the arm to retrieve a satellite . she remains the youngest american astronaut to travel to space . the mission went off without a hitch , but the problems for ride started when she returned to earth to discover that everybody wanted a piece of her . not a comfortable situation for a ` fiercely private individual ' . she was invited to the white house to meet president regan and despite her reservations she carried out countless public appearances to help publicize the space program . but as an introvert , ride felt traumatized by all the public attention and confided in o'shaughnessy that she felt she was ` losing her equilibrium . ' tam o'shaughnessy prepares to accept the presidential medal of freedom on behalf of dr. sally ride from president obama at the white house last november . ride was awarded the highest civilian honor posthumously after she died from cancer in 2012 . ' i felt anxious and unsettled , ' she told tam . ' i knew i needed help . ' in her personal memo book , ride called the attention ` draining ' and wrote that she felt better in new york city . she described walking in nyc as ` therapeutic ' -- ` the freedom , exercise , anonymity , in the midst of crowds . ' in a bid to cope she consulted a psychologist who ` helped me figure out what to do . ' the final straw for ride came when she was asked to appear on a bob hope tv special . blast off with bob was a tribute to nasa and ride was adamant that she did n't want to appear on it . telling her bosses ' i do n't like the way he exploits women . ' in the end she went awol rather than appear alongside the showbiz legend . as an introvert , ride felt traumatized by all the public attention that she received and she felt she was ` losing her equilibrium ' ride flew challenger once again in 1984 , but in 1986 the space shuttle tragically exploded 73 seconds after launch . she was the only serving astronaut appointed to the investigation committee . at the same time her marriage to hawley started to come apart , and she secretly began her relationship with o'shaughnessy . to have the personal life she wanted , ride had to forge a career outside of nasa and she left the next year . ` there is . no question in my mind that if sally ride had been openly gay and if she . had applied to nasa , number one , she never would have been selected as . an astronaut , ' writes sherr .", "summary": " sally ride became america 's first woman in space in 1983 , aged 32 .   but the ` fiercely private ' person struggled to deal with the fame when she returned to earth .   her five-year marriage ended and she left nasa in 1987 .   it was only after ride 's death in 2012 , that her partner revealed that the pair had been lesbian lovers .   a new biography - sally ride : america 's first woman in space - reveals previously unknown information about her private life .   ` we .   never publicly said ,  we 're gay .  we did n't like labels of any kind , .   but especially the ones referring to sexuality , ' said her long-term partner .   her ex-husband steven hawley denies rumors that nasa put pressure on ride to marry ahead of her maiden space flight .   ride - an introvert - was so traumatized by all the public attention that she saw a psychologist .   the final straw for ride came when she was asked to appear on a bob hope tv special and she went awol .   ` there is .   no question that if she had been openly gay she never would have been selected as .   an astronaut , ' writes lynn sherr .   sally ride : america 's first woman in space , published by simon & schuster , is out now .
