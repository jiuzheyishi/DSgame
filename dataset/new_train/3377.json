{"text": "it sounds like the holy grail for humankind ; a technique that could slow down ageing by up to half . now geneticists in japan have found a way to achieve just that -- albeit in a flower , and not a person . the breakthrough allows bouquets to remain fresh for much longer and could help unravel secrets on how to prevent cell decay in other organisms . japanese scientists say they have found a way to slow down the ageing process in flowers by up to a half , meaning bouquets could remain fresh for much longer . researchers at the national agriculture and food research organisation in tsukuba , east of tokyo , said they had found the gene believed to be responsible for the short shelf-life of flowers in one japanese variety of morning glory . ` morning glory ' is the popular name for hundreds of species of flowering plants whose short-lived blooms usually unfold early in the day and are gone by nightfall . by suppressing the gene -- named ` ephmeral1 ' -- the lifespan of each flower was almost doubled , said kenichi shibuya , one of the lead researchers in a study carried out jointly with kagoshima university in southern japan . researchers at the national agriculture and food research organisation in tsukuba , east of tokyo , said they had found the gene believed to be responsible for the short shelf-life of flowers in one japanese variety of morning glory -lrb- pictured -rrb- . scientists in japan suppressed the gene ` ephmeral1 ' to double the lifespan of morning glory . living to the ripe old age of 500 might be a possibility if the science shown to extend worms ' lives can be applied to humans , scientists have said . in december , u.s. researchers tweaked two genetic pathways in the tiny lab worm caenorhabditis elegans and boosted the creature 's lifespan by a factor of five.the research raises the prospect of anti-ageing treatments based on genetic interactions , they said . ` what we have here is a synergistic five-fold increase in lifespan , ' said lead scientist dr pankaj kapahi , from the buck institute of age research , novato , california . ` the two mutations set off a positive feedback loop in specific tissues that amplified lifespan . ` basically these worms lived to the human equivalent of 400 to 500 years . ' ` unmodified flowers started withering 13 hours after they opened , but flowers that had been genetically modified stayed open for 24 hours , ' he said . this means the plant has fresh purple flowers alongside the paler blooms from the previous day , he said . ` we have concluded that the gene is linked to petal ageing , ' professor shibuya told afp . the finding could lead to developing methods to extend the life of cut flowers , he added . ` it would be unrealistic to modify genes of all kinds of flowers but we can look for other ways to suppress the -lrb- target -rrb- gene ... such as making cut flowers absorb a solution that prevents the gene from becoming active , ' professor shibuya said . for some flowers , such as carnations , florists currently use chemicals to inhibit ethylene , a plant hormone which sometimes causes blooms to ripen . but ethylene is not involved in the ageing of some popular flowers , such as lilies , tulips and irises . a gene similar to ephmeral1 could be responsible for petal ageing in these plants , professor shibuya said , meaning the ability to suppress it would extend their life . ` unmodified flowers -lrb- stock image used -rrb- started withering 13 hours after they opened , but flowers that had been genetically modified stayed open for 24 hours , ' said kenichi shibuya , one of the lead researchers in a study carried out jointly with kagoshima university in southern japan .", "summary": " scientists supressed ` ephmeral1 ' gene to slow down ageing by half .   find could lead to better techniques that extend the life of cut flowers .   for instance , cut flowers could absorb a solution that prevents the gene from becoming active .
