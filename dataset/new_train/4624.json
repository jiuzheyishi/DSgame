{"text": "a former university of north carolina football player has become the first to sue the university over an 18-year academic scandal that kept athletes eligible to play sports by taking classes that never met . mike mcadoo was a football player who lost his eligibility in 2011 when he was accused of getting too much help with a paper , and was one of the first athletes revealed to have taken part in  paper classes ,  for which the only requirement was completing a single paper . now he 's suing the university in federal court , saying unc broke its promise to give him an education in return for playing sports . his lawsuit is a class-action suit that the other 3,100 students who enrolled in the fake classes -- nearly half of whom are athletes -- could easily join .  from selection of a major to selection of courses , the unc football program controlled football student-athletes ' academic track , with the sole purpose of ensuring that football student-athletes were eligible to participate in athletics , rather than actually educating them ,  says his lawsuit , filed thursday by the law firms of ferguson , chambers & sumter in charlotte , north carolina , and mehri and skalet in washington , d.c.  unc has reaped substantial profits from football student-athletes ' performance for the school , but it has not provided them a legitimate education in return . as such , unc has breached its contract with plaintiff and class members , in violation of north carolina common law ,  wrote his attorney , jeremi duru , who is also a professor of law at the washington college of law . on monday , the school responded to the suit :  the university of north carolina at chapel hill became aware friday of the lawsuit filed by former student michael mcadoo . the university will reserve further comment until we 've had the opportunity to fully review the claims ,  said rick white , associate vice chancellor for communications and public affairs at unc . mcadoo 's story . mcadoo , who spoke to cnn earlier this year , says he was recruited by many schools as a high school senior but chose unc because he was promised a good education .  when the coaches and academic staff came to my house all the way in tennessee , you know they , they was n't even talking football , they was talking academics ,  he told cnn earlier this year .  so they were saying , ` you know what , we ca n't promise your son that he 's going to go to the nfl , but one thing that we can promise him is that he will get a college degree . '  that did n't happen . mcadoo lost his eligibility and never graduated , caught up in the paper class scandal that was known to and used by about two dozen administrators , according to a scathing independent report released last month . mcadoo was a pretty good student , but his grades and test scores fell much below the average student admitted to unc , a top national public school with a reputation for rigorous academics and selective admission . mcadoo 's high school gpa was 2.9 . most admitted unc students have high school gpas between 3.6 and 4.3 , according to the school 's website . the report last month by former federal prosecutor ken wainstein followed an eight-month investigation and confirmed what whistleblowers had been saying : many student athletes were admitted to play sports when they were underprepared for college classes at unc . mcadoo told cnn earlier this year that he felt he was scapegoated in 2011 , when he was kicked off the team for cheating . since 2011 , when the fraud first came to light , the university has refused to acknowledge that members of the academic support staff knew about the paper classes and funneled athletes into them in the way that mcadoo described . he insisted they did know , and his story matched that of whistleblower mary willingham , who was also disregarded by the university administration for years and is also suing the school . unc in january : we failed students ` for years ' mcadoo told cnn he had expressed interest in studying criminal justice , but was told on his first day of scheduling that he had to pick from three majors that fit his football schedule -- exercise and sport science , communications , and african-american studies , where the paper class scandal existed . mcadoo said his predetermined schedule included some of the paper classes . the report done by wainstein , a partner with cadwalader , wickersham & taft , found that many of the things mcadoo told cnn were true . there were , the report said , nearly 30 staffers and administrators who knew about the paper classes , including mcadoo 's academic advisor , beth bridger . then-head football coach butch davis also acknowledged knowing about the scheme .  i lost an education . i lost trust in the school -- someone i thought had my best interest . i definitely lost out on two seasons of football which would have put me in a better situation than i am now ,  mcadoo told cnn shortly after wainstein 's report was made public . in the suit , duru asks that a judge appoint someone to make sure that student athletes are no longer forced into certain majors as a condition of playing sports .  we 're not trying to vilify unc , we 're trying to restore one of its greatest traditions ,  duru said . it also seeks some kind of relief for the athletes like mcadoo who did not get the education they were promised .  now the key is trying to make it right for those student athletes who were done wrong ,  duru said . what this could mean . mcadoo 's lawsuit could potentially uncover even more than the damning wainstein investigation , which was by far the most thorough and provided a slew of information that had previously been discounted by unc . the difference is in the power of subpoena . mcadoo 's lawyers will be able to depose people who declined to talk to wainstein -- potentially key participants whom wainstein called out for refusing to cooperate , like the former director of football cynthia reynolds and the former interim head football coach everett withers . withers is now a coach at james madison university and reynolds is in academics at cornell . the former associate dean and director of the men 's basketball team , carolyn cannon , and another counselor for football , octavus barnes , also refused to cooperate , according to the wainstein report . willingham , who is suing unc in a whistleblower-related lawsuit , said she also hopes to depose people who were not interviewed by wainstein 's team , such as members of the board of trustees .  there 's still a lot of denial , and wainstein did not conduct his investigation with anyone under oath , nor did he have subpoena power ,  willingham said .", "summary": " mike mcadoo is a former football player who was involved in the scandal .   he lost his eligibility and says he was cheated out of an education .   a report last month found unc used fake classes to keep athletes eligible .   mcadoo 's class-action suit could include other athletes who took the classes .
