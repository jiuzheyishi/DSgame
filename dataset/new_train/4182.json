{"text": "it 's a view of the michael brown shooting we had n't seen before , but could it be enough to shape the way a grand jury handles the controversial case ? an exclusive video first broadcast wednesday on cnn shows two construction workers ' reactions just after a police officer shot the unarmed african-american 18-year-old last month in ferguson , missouri . the contractors shown in the short video clip told cnn they saw brown with his hands up as officer darren wilson pursued him and opened fire . several legal analysts describe the video as a  game changer .  others said it might not make much of a dent in the case . here are three reasons legal analysts told cnn the video could be important : . 1 . the witnesses it depicts are white and do n't live in ferguson . the race of the witnesses should n't matter , but it could for the grand jury that 's investigating the case , said mark geragos , a cnn legal analyst and criminal defense attorney . there are nine whites and three african-americans on the 12-member panel tasked with deciding whether wilson , who is white , should be charged .  you now have some witnesses who the majority of this grand jury are going to better relate to . i hate to say it , but that 's the reality of it , and that 's why it 's a game changer to me ,  geragos said . 2 . it shows their reactions shortly after the shooting . lots of people have come forward with their accounts of what happened the day wilson shot brown . but it 's significant to have the immediate reactions of two witnesses on tape , said cnn senior legal analyst jeffrey toobin . in the video , one of the construction workers raises his arms in the air -- just as , the contractor says , brown was doing when he was shot .  you have practically in real time someone discussing what they saw , and that 's just good evidence ,  toobin said . 3 . their observations echo other witness descriptions . some witnesses say the teenager assaulted the white officer at the outset and tried to grab his gun ; other witnesses say wilson was the aggressor . this is n't the first time we 've heard witnesses say brown 's hands were up . when eyewitnesses ' accounts coincide , that 's a key part of building a case for prosecutors , said sunny hostin , a cnn legal analyst and former federal prosecutor .  they 're saying that he was running from the police officer and that his hands were up ,  she said .  i do n't know what other witness testimony at this point or account we have to hear . the bottom line is having your hands up is the universal sign for surrender .  but she criticized claims that the testimony of white witnesses from outside the community would be more valuable .  five other witnesses from the community said the exact same thing , and it is befuddling to me how with these two witnesses , suddenly this is a game changer ,  she said . analysts also gave several reasons to be skeptical the video will have much of an impact : . 1 . the witnesses did n't see how it all started . the men depicted in the video , who asked not to be identified after cnn contacted them , say they were standing about 50 feet away from brown and wilson . they say they could n't see how the altercation between the teenager and the police officer began .  you have to look at where they 're standing ,  said neil bruntrager , general counsel for the st. louis police officers ' association . the angle the video was shot from is important , he said , adding that it seemed like the witnesses were more like 100 feet away from the shooting .  they could n't have seen everything ,  he said . 2 . there 's a lot more evidence we have n't seen . officials have said it could take months for the grand jury to review all the evidence in the controversial case . and there 's a lot of things that could shape the direction the case takes , geragos said , such as wilson 's initial account immediately after the shooting and forensic investigations about where the shell casings from his gun fell .  somebody 's going to go through and do a detailed analysis of all that ,  geragos said . 3 . it does n't show the shooting . even though it 's valuable to see the aftermath , the video does n't show the shooting itself . if wilson 's charged , that could give his defense an opening , geragos said . an attorney for the man who filmed the video told cnn he started recording about 40 seconds after the shooting . the video shows an officer putting up crime scene tape -- a sign , bruntrager says , that it could have been made  well after the shooting .   what you have is a conversation that 's occurring after the fact ,  he says . complete coverage of the michael brown shooting and protests .", "summary": " a cell phone video shows witnesses reacting to the michael brown shooting .   some legal analysts say it could be a game changer in the case .   others are skeptical and stress that there 's more evidence in play .
