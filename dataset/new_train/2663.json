{"text": "the arkansas geological survey is trying to unravel a mystery : what is causing earthquakes in the town of guy , arkansas ? since september 20 , the community of 549 residents north of little rock has experienced an almost constant shaking from 487 measurable earthquakes .  we 've had 15 today including a 3.1 -lrb- magnitude -rrb- from this morning ,  scott ausbrooks , geohazards supervisor for the geological survey , said monday .  these are shallow quakes between two and eight kilometers -lrb- between one-and-a-quarter and five miles -rrb- below the surface .  while earthquakes are n't unusual in the southeast state , the frequency is .  this time last year we had 39 quakes total for the entire state ,  said ausbrooks . most of the quakes in the swarm -- a localized surge of earthquakes with all of them about the same magnitude , according to the united states geological survey -- are so small they go unnoticed . the largest , a 4.0 on october 11 , caused the only documented damage , cracking a window at a visitor 's center to a state park . guy mayor sam higdon said when the swarm first happened , citizens took notice .  they were calling city hall asking ,  what are you going to do ? '  he said . in response to the constant bombardment of tiny quakes , higdon 's office has organized a three-hour long town meeting , and sought the help of state geologists and members of the oil and gas industry to find answers .  my wife wants to buy earthquake insurance . i 'm trying to talk her out of it ,  the mayor said monday . there are several geologic faults in the area , but none associated with the new madrid fault , the large seismic fault in the region and one that was the source of an estimated 7.0-magnitude earthquake in 1811 . and there was another historic flurry of earthquakes in 1982 , 15 miles south of guy . geologists know it as the enola swarm , responsible for 15,000 quakes within a year 's time , followed by more shaking in 2001 . at first , town officials assumed the current wave of shakes came from work at a gravel company on the outskirts of town . ausbrooks says the state geological survey has no idea whether the current swarm is a natural or man-made event , but his office is seriously exploring the latter .  we see no relation to the drilling in the area , but we have n't ruled out a connection to the salt water disposal wells ,  he said . according to the arkansas oil and gas commission , there are at least a half dozen  disposal wells  within a 500-square-mile zone around guy . licensed by the state of arkansas , disposal wells are a byproduct of the oil and gas industry and are used to inject drilling waste water back into the earth after drilling . ausbrooks said drillers inject waste water into the earth at high pressure , and in the area around the town the disposal wells go as deep as 12,000 feet . he points to incidents in colorado in the 1960s at rocky mountain arsenal , where deep water injection was tied to earthquakes . last week the state of arkansas issued a moratorium on new drilling permits . lawrence bengal , director of the arkansas oil and gas commission , said previously his office required only monthly reports outlining the operations of injection wells .  we 're asking well operators to provide daily reports now ,  benegal said . ausbrooks said his office is poring over the data trying to determine whether there is a correlation between the disposal wells and the shaking , and he hopes to present preliminary findings to the state next month .", "summary": " the town of guy , arkansas , has been shaken by hundreds of small earthquakes .   geologists have counted 487 measurable quakes since september 20 .   that 's almost equal to one per resident in the town of 549 .   state officials are investigating whether the quakes are natural or from industrial work .
