{"text": "colonel richard kemp , who led uk forces in afghanistan , claimed allowing women into battle would ` put lives in danger ' women lack the ` killer instinct ' to serve in frontline combat operations , a retired british army commander has warned . colonel richard kemp , who led uk forces in afghanistan , claimed allowing women into battle would ` put lives in danger ' . ministers are expected to announce they are ready to lift the long-standing ban within weeks , but critics say it risks damaging the fighting capabilities of the armed forces . in may this year philip hammond , then the defence secretary , said it was time for the armed forces to abandon the ` macho ' image and show they were open to everyone who was fit enough . he said the us , canadian and australian armies allowed women to serve in combat roles -- and so should britain . he ordered a review into who can take combat roles , which is expected to report shortly . but mr kemp accused mr hammond -- who is now foreign secretary -- of pursuing a ` transparent political agenda ' . writing in the times , he said : ` prioritising political correctness and a misguided idea of equal opportunities can only serve to undermine fighting effectiveness and put lives in danger . ' he said it was the machismo in the forces which mr hammond ` seems to despise so much ' which was needed when troops must make the decision to ` kill or be killed ' . ` infantry close combat demands ferocity , aggression and killer instinct . these characteristics are far more common in men than women , ' he said . ` even in the high-tech 21st century , 100 years after the outbreak of the first world war , the infantry soldier 's ultimate purpose is still to get out of a trench and charge into the teeth of enemy fire : to close with the enemy and kill him face to face with bullets , bayonets , grenades and if necessary in hand-to-hand combat . ' he questioned how many women would take up the chance to transfer to frontline combat roles in the infantry . ` physically and emotionally , few women will have the aptitude to join the combat arms and perhaps even fewer will want to do so , ' he added . philip hammond , then the defence secretary , said it was time for the armed forces to abandon the ` macho ' image and show they were open to everyone who was fit enough . jo dyer , 24 , left , a friend of prince william , was killed by a roadside bomb in basra in 2007 and right , medic sarah bryant was killed in afghanistan in 2008 . women can find themselves on the frontline and extremely close to the enemy while serving as medics , intelligence specialists , artillery spotters , logisticians or signallers . however , they remain barred from all infantry battalions and royal marine commando units -- including special forces -- and from tank regiments and other armoured units . theoretically , women would be allowed to join the special forces , such as the sas . but to do so they would be expected to pass the unit 's gruelling mental and physical selection process . the ministry of defence stressed that the final review has not yet been completed . a spokesman said : ` the review process into women in combat roles is ongoing : no decisions have been made and so any suggestion to the contrary is inaccurate . as such , it would be wrong for the department to comment further at this stage .
