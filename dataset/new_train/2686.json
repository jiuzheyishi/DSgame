{"text": "hawaii 's garden isle , kauai , may appear to run on a different clock than the rest of the world -- unless you happen to glance at those 24 timepieces lining the west wall of the island 's lihu'e airport departure lobby in three neat rows . then , for however many seconds you wish to suspend your whole notion of time , it 's the exact same hour , minute and second everywhere on the planet . in belfast and bhopal . rio de janeiro and reykjavik . mogadishu and santo domingo . and according to several other location-specific clocks straying from the usual tokyo-paris-new york scheme .  when you look at these clocks it 's a little bit odd ,  says parker croft , a kauai-based architect , farmer and the creator of  time for one world ,  an international art exhibit that aims to dispel , however momentarily , the whole divided -lrb- and delusive -rrb- notion of multiple times around the globe . inspired by einstein ... and y2k . launched at vermont 's burlington international airport , the exhibit was conceived by croft while working as a college professor in new england .  it was 1999 , shortly before the millennium change , and i was fascinated by that whole y2k furor going on ,  recalls croft .  it led me into researching what time is really all about and how -- as einstein poignantly put it -- time is ` man 's most pervasive illusion . '  the world 's time zones , notes croft , are  currently based on political borders and outdated views of travel , commerce and communications . divisions that are often illogical .  to address the point , the architect designed an alternative artistic model of a single , shared 24-hour cycle worldwide , which  challenges us to relax our preconceived notions of structures that are contrived and artificial .  one universe . one world . one time . in croft 's model , time would be re-calibrated biannually on the equinoxes -lrb- fall and spring -rrb- . leap year adjustments would be replaced by a brief semi-annual time stoppage -lrb- about three hours -rrb- , a  free time  recess dedicated to a worldwide celebration of humanity and relationships . can you imagine that ? could john lennon even imagine that ? wounded knee , hiroshima , falkland islands represented . the overall effect of 24 oddly labeled clocks evoking universal time  can be unsettling for some -- even threatening ,  says croft . in fact , the curious clocks of kauai serve to achieve the opposite . to unite and embrace .  we are a planet that is joined in the beat of a single heartbeat ,  says croft .  and that heartbeat is best appreciated when it 's recognized and celebrated .  travelers glancing at the distinctive lihu'e airport clocks , installed more than a decade ago -lrb- the installation is on long-term loan to the lihu'e airport , says croft , but is n't necessarily permanent -rrb- have plenty to get their time-addled heads around before their flight departs . there are no numbers on the clocks , which are divided into 24-hour faces instead of twelve , with each clock displaying the exact same time in perfect sync . then there are the 24 locations labeled below each clock -- selected from 24 separate 15-degree segments of the earth 's surface , and all associated with important historical events . ross ice shelf . falkland islands . bikini atoll . watts . not your typical wall clock reference points . auschwitz is written in polish . hiroshima in japanese . tiananmen square in mandarin . non-sioux speakers will wonder where the clock labeled cankpe o -lrb- wounded knee -rrb- refers to -- which is just the point . some references should be obvious enough -lrb- chernobyl -rrb- . others , like san francisco -lrb- summer of love ? -rrb- or ahmedhabad -lrb- hint : gandhi -rrb- or injinoo may require personal interpretation or the services of google . which is also the point .  the inspiration for independent research is an important part of this mission ,  notes croft .  the viewer 's participation is critical .  a world without leap year . in a world as troubled and triumphant as this one , sliced into manufactured time zones that accentuate distance over connection , the presence of 24 perfectly synchronized world clocks beating as one in a small south pacific airport might , at the very least , give travelers a moment 's pause . and beyond that ? are there fans of croft 's suggestion to just stop time for three hours in the spring and fall ?  i do n't think anyone takes it that seriously as a proposal ,  says croft with a laugh .  but there are certainly fans of the art installation who take the notion of stopping to celebrate humanity quite seriously .  personally ,  he adds ,  i think it would be a big improvement over new year 's eve .
