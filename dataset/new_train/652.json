{"text": "a woman with a rare condition that means she collapses every time she laughs fears she may have passed the rare illness onto her young son . kelly timson can not visit a comedy show or even go to the pub with her friends as every time she laughs , she collapses in a literal fit of giggles . she suffers from a rare neurological condition called cataplexy which means her body goes into a state of total paralysis in response to strong emotions such as amusement , surprise , anger and even love . inherited ? kelly timson has both cataplexy and narcolepsy -lrb- right -rrb- . her younger son ronnie is undergoing tests after experiencing a fit a few weeks ago . just gazing in motherly admiration at her two young children charlie , five , and ronnie , two , brings on an attack leaving kelly totally unable to move or speak . often , she finds herself collapsed in a heap on the floor having injured herself on the way down and once she nearly suffocated after landing face-down on the sofa . she suffers up to 20 cataplexy attacks a day and has to have her mother or brother around her all the time in case she collapses . she also suffers from the related condition narcolepsy which means she randomly falls asleep throughout the day , no matter what she is doing . limits : kelly can never have a bath alone as she could have an attack and drown . kelly , 25 , from ashford , kent , said : . ` i 've lost count of the number of times i 've fallen asleep face down in . my dinner . i ca n't even go to a restaurant with my boyfriend in case i . nod off at the table . it 's so embarrassing . ` once . i had an attack of cataplexy in the supermarket and then another and . another . i must have had about 20 in a row and i think people must have . thought i was drugged or drunk . every time i stood up , i collapsed . again . ` when i have an . attack , i can see and hear but i ca n't move or communicate at all . it . can last a few seconds or it can last for an hour . ` the . worst times are when there is no one around . i might be laid on the . floor , completely paralysed and the boys will be pulling all the food . out of the cupboards and there 's nothing i can do . that 's why i do n't . like to be left alone with the boys in case anything happens to me or . them . ' kelly first noticed the narcolepsy when she was 16 and would fall asleep suddenly in front of the television or while sat on the sofa , even after a long night 's sleep . her condition worsened over time until the point where she never knew where she might nod off.kelly said : ' i would be in the middle of eating my dinner and i would just fall asleep or i would fall asleep in the bath . ' i used to work on a dunking doughnuts kiosk as a teenager and once i fell asleep while i was frothing some milk for a cappuccino , which is impressive when you think of the noise those machines make . i just fell asleep standing up and i was lucky i did n't burn myself on it . ` eventually i saw a consultant who diagnosed me with narcolepsy and gave me some medication . ' then , at the age of 19 , she fell pregnant with charlie and everything changed . suddenly , kelly would find herself going limp and heavy while she was holding her new bashe said : ' i would have to call to my mum to come quickly and grab charlie off me in case i dropped him . ' i would just be looking at him and thinking how much i loved him and then all of a sudden my arms would go floppy . ' i was really worried because i was terrified of hurting him . ' over time , kelly found her attacks were becoming more frequent and more severe , causing her to become completely paralysed and unable to speak whenever she had one . in 2007 , she was officially diagnosed with cataplexy . while cataplexy is extremely rare , 70 per cent of sufferers also suffer from narcolepsy . in addition , kelly also suffers from poor short term memory and often forgets what she did the previous day . kelly found her attacks got worse after having ronnie -lrb- left -rrb- and charlie . kelly said : ' i often panic when i 'm going into an attack and i 'm always hurting myself . one time i landed on the sofa on my nose and i could n't move my head in order to breathe . the cushion was pushed up against my face and i thought i was going to suffocate . ` my boyfriend was asleep on the sofa and i could n't even make a sound to alert him to what had happened . ` it felt like it lasted for ages although it was probably less than a minute and then the attack started to ease off so i was able to move my neck just enough to breathe . at times like that the attacks can feel like forever . ` another time i went down and hit the doctor 's desk while i was in the middle of talking to her . she did n't even realise what was happening until it was too late and i had smacked my head on the edge . ' like many epileptics , kelly needs constant supervision and can not drive or even take a bath on her own . however , she can suffer up to 20 attacks a day and is not entitled to extra support for her condition . now she is worried she may have passed the condition onto her son ronnie , who suffered a fit in a supermarket two weeks ago . he is currently awaiting tests to see if he has inherited either of his mother 's rare conditions . she said : ` i 'd hate for ronnie to have it as it affects every aspect of my life . ` i 'd love to be able to go for a drink and have a laugh with my friends , but i ca n't . as soon as someone cracked a joke i would be paralysed on my barstool and it would be mortifying . ` i 'm trying some new medication at the moment and i 'm waiting to see how that goes . with any luck it will help my condition and i might even be able to go to a comedy club someday .
