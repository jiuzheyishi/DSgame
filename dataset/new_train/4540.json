{"text": "since islamic state fighters entered iraq from syria , they have given the world a revolting look at their ruthlessness . they have left the severed heads of their vanquished on spikes . they have filled mass graves with the summarily executed . they have slaughtered and enslaved ethnic minority yazidis . when the islamic state drove tens of thousands of them up mountains , where many died of thirst , it seemed the last straw . u.s. president barack obama ordered airstrikes to beat them back . but the same cruelty has fumed next door in syria -- along with the atrocities committed by forces loyal to president bashar al-assad against rebel fighters . while the world focused on the plight of the yazidis in iraq , 500 syrian civilians died practically unnoticed . so , why is the united states intervening in iraq , while avoiding syria ? the answers lie in some clear differences in the two conflicts : . 1 . international opposition . no nation protects islamic state . even al qaeda is disgusted by its viciousness . but international political entanglement awaits any power pondering action in syria , due to loyalties to al-assad . as the united states and its allies have called for action against his regime , china and russia have put their foot down in the un security council . and russia has kept al-assad well-armed . although russia rails against muslim extremists , a u.s. intervention -- even only against islamic state -- would meet with deep distrust in the kremlin , especially after the relationship with washington hit the dustbin over ukraine . iran , a close al-assad ally , would likely also be up in arms . tehran is allegedly supplying shia militia hezbollah , which has crossed from lebanon to shore up al-assad 's troops . 2 . confusing battlefield . syria 's war is a checkerboard battle -- government troops and hezbollah in a fight against islamic state and other resistance groups , who also battle each other . obama does n't see a strong partner in the politically fractured free syrian army , because it 's hardly a formidable force against al-assad 's professional army . in iraq , the battle lines are clearer -- the iraqi government with u.s. support vs. islamic state . baghdad has made a shaky showing against the militants . but in the north , washington has a strong , loyal partner in semi-autonomous kurdistan . many of the u.s. advisers deployed to iraq are stationed in its capital irbil to support peshmerga troops in hot confrontation with islamic state . 3 . ineffective airstrikes . the syrian government has professional air defenses , including its own air force , which would give the u.s. military serious resistance . though islamic state has struck some aircraft , its air defenses are flimsy when compared to al-assad 's . the iraqi government was bombing islamic state long before u.s. drones and warplanes joined them , and the kurdish government has begged for u.s. air support . president obama has approved targeted strikes in iraq , but his hawkish critics in washington have called for much tougher u.s. military action against the islamist extremists . 4 . we broke it . we fix it . it 's a moan often heard in the united states these days . iraq would not be in this predicament , had u.s. forces not invaded and destabilized it . morally , the country owes them . add to that the american and civilian lives lost in the war to depose former dictator saddam hussein , the hundreds of billions spent , the training and arming of iraqi forces . the u.s. has no such vested interest in syria . but , says cnn analyst fareed zakaria , that 's a stance washington ca n't afford to maintain .  the united states should develop a more cogent and integrated policy approach that deals with syria and iraq together -- the challenges in both countries are becoming more interlinked ,  he said . 5 . a wariness to step in . to be sure , the president 's stance has its critics . republican senators john mccain and lindsey graham want obama to take the fight against islamic state into syria . respect for its borders take a back seat to stopping the extremists , they say . former u.s. ambassador to syria robert ford resigned in protest of america 's inaction against al-assad . he has found fault with washington for allowing islamic state to burgeon in syria . and former secretary of state hillary clinton recently said that the president does not apply u.s. might aggressively enough . but , after pulling the country out of two wars in afghanistan and iraq , the president has said that the united states should be leery of trying to solve the world 's crisis . as he has reportedly said ,  do n't do stupid stuff .  how religion could complicate u.s. intervention in iraq . opinion : what the u.s. can realistically do in iraq .", "summary": " islamic state cruelty has fumed in syria , too , along with government atrocities .   but complex entanglements would make it more difficult to act there than in iraq .   in syria , the government would fight against the u.s. ; in iraq they are partners .
