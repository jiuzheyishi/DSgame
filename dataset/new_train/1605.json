' the record low seen in 2012 , followed by the large increase in . 2013 , is consistent with the theory , she said . even ipcc report co-authors such as dr hawkins admit some of the models are ` too hot ' . he . said : ` the upper end of the latest climate model projections is . inconsistent ' with observed temperatures , though he added even the lower . predictions could have ` negative impacts ' if true . but if the pause lasted another ten years , and there were no large volcanic eruptions , ` then global surface temperatures would be outside the ipcc 's indicative likely range ' . professor curry went much further . ` the growing divergence between climate model simulations and observations raises the prospect that climate models are inadequate in fundamental ways , ' she said . if the pause continued , this would suggest that the models were not ` fit for purpose ' .", "summary": " study says warmer temperatures are largely due to natural 300-year cycles .   actual increase in last 17 years lower than almost every prediction .   scientists likened continuing pause to a mexican wave in a stadium .
