pretending you care about the super bowl is easy . nfl fans are sure everyone cares about the super bowl , even if you 're secretly hoping the men in tight pants quit throwing the brown  ball  around so you can see more $ 10 million doritos commercials . conference championships are another story . in fact , you may be asking ,  what 's a conference championship ?  fear not , you indifferent soul you . cnn has you covered with five things that will make you look as though you have more than the slightest idea what is happening sunday . in the national football conference , the seattle seahawks and the green bay packers will face off in seattle at 3:05 p.m. et , while the new england patriots and indianapolis colts will kick off the american football conference championship in foxborough , massachusetts , at 6:40 p.m. et . what 's a seahawk ? do n't ask that aloud . no one knows . but they 're the defending champions after stomping the denver broncos in last year 's super bowl . want to start a fun conversation over the dip bowl ? ask how it is that denver quarterback peyton manning is always mentioned among the greatest , yet with one exception , always loses at some point in the playoffs . after the heated debate dies down , you can say matter-of-factly ,  well , at least he has a career in shilling pizza and insurance to fall back on .  then , toss some chips in your mouth and walk off . it appears las vegas is not expecting much of a contest in either game . both games are predicted to be decided by a touchdown , which is a rather large spread for a conference championship . in the regular season , the seahawks beat the packers by 20 points in week 1 , while the patriots beat the colts by 22 in week 11 , but do n't pay that too much attention . weeks can be like dog years in the nfl . seattle is a 7 - or 8-point favorite over green bay , which is n't that surprising given seattle has been on a tear of late , green bay 's quarterback is gimpy -lrb- more on that shortly -rrb- and centurylink field is one of the more terrible venues to play in . they have this thing called the 12th man , which is actually tens of thousands of astonishingly loud fans . they have their own flag , and they do n't care that navy blue and neon green clash . new england is also expected to win by 7 , to hear vegas tell it . the patriots have lost only two games since september , and one of those losses -- to the buffalo bills on december 28 -- may have been a product of the pats not taking the game too seriously since they had already locked up their division . they also have tom terrific -lrb- aka brady -rrb- , who tends to shine in big games , though it should be noted that the patriots have lost the last two afc championships and their last two super bowls . green bay quarterback aaron rodgers has been getting it done since week 4 , after telling uneasy packers fans to  relax  after the team got off to a 1-2 start . the packers have lost only two games since then . rodgers is surrounded by talent , as his offensive line -lrb- the five men resembling redwood trunks who squat in front of the quarterback before each play -rrb- , running back eddie lacy and wide receiver jordy nelson have been getting it done all season . the green bay defense is led by clay matthews , who will be looking to disrupt seattle 's rushing and passing games . look for seattle running back and skittles aficionado marshawn lynch and quarterback russell wilson , another insurance salesman , to make some big plays -- but in seattle , defense reigns . you might remember cornerback richard sherman from his abominable sportsmanship after last year 's nfc championship , but also look for safeties earl thomas and kam chancellor to be prowling the gridiron . especially keep an eye on chancellor . it 's possible that he could 've beaten the carolina panthers all by himself last week . that 's only a slight exaggeration . in the afc championship , you 'll want to watch indianapolis quarterback andrew luck . he was the first round draft pick in 2012 -- effectively resulting in a colts legend , manning , leaving for denver -- and he 's been showing he is worth the hype , passing for almost 13,000 yards in his first three seasons . with little in the way of a running game , you 'll see him using his tight ends a lot , while looking for wide receiver t.y. hilton to make big plays , something the patriots have promised to prevent . the patriots have a solid defense -- cornerback darrelle revis and linebackers jamie collins and dont ' a hightower will look to make life hellish for luck -- but they 're better known for a rounded team effort on offense . yes , brady will be looking for the 6-foot-6 rob gronkowski to break free in mismatches , but expect him to spread the ball around plenty , especially to running back jonas gray , who showed his upside in a four-touchdown effort earlier this season ... against the colts . in seattle and the boston area ? oh , most certainly . the national weather service on sunday morning issued a high wind warning for northwest washington . winds are expected to reach speeds of up to 40 mph , with gusts up to 60 mph , but forecasters predict they will die down before kickoff . there 's also about an 80 % chance of rain . with the wet and the wind , the kicking and passing games could be tricky for both teams , but the seahawks and packers have outstanding running backs in lynch and lacy , so that may make life easier for them . on the plus side , it will be in the high 40s or low 50s throughout the game , so they wo n't be battling bitter cold . it will be a little colder in foxborough for the afc championship , but not much -- somewhere in the mid-40s . the boston area also has a good chance of rain , and winds will be moving at around 15 mph . though brady and luck are both skilled ball handlers -- and both ply their trade in chilly locales -- there 's always the possibility that the wind and rain will make for a sloppy game , especially when you consider neither team has the safety net of an awesome running back . maybe you 've heard the phase ,  aaron rodgers ' leg ,  in recent days ? or perhaps ad nauseam ? yes , it would be hard for even the most disinterested of fans to have missed the news that rodgers ' calf is torn . how badly is unclear , but the seahawks ' thomas has said he is n't buying the line coming out of the packers camp . what 's clear is that rodgers was far from mobile in last week 's game against the dallas cowboys . despite rodgers hobbling around in the pocket , the cowboys failed to put pressure on him -- especially in the fourth quarter -- as the one-legged wonder completed 24 of 35 passes for 316 yards and tossed three touchdowns . do n't expect seattle 's defensive players to be so merciful . expect them to bring the house -- and often -- against rodgers and try to knock him down on every play . and do n't expect the legion of boom to go any easier on his receivers or on lacy , who has been complaining of knee soreness ahead of sunday 's matchup . in foxborough , you 'll have a more traditional story line in the old guard versus the new . brady , of course , is the poster boy for winners -- and not because of the ugg boots contract and being married to gisele bundchen . since coming to the nfl in 2001 , he 's played in five super bowls and won three of them . this will be his ninth afc championship game . but remember , he 's lost his last two conference championships and his last two super bowls , so do n't be surprised when commentators wonder aloud if luck , 25 , who has taken the colts to the playoffs in each of his three seasons , is ready to take the crown from the 37-year-old brady 's head . want a fun drinking game ?
