{"text": "reforms to stop elderly people having to sell their homes to pay for care will be passed into law before 2015 , nick clegg revealed today . the deputy prime minister sought to diffuse growing anger about coalition delays in overhauling the social care system , two years after a commission called for a cap on the amount individuals are expected to pay . the move comes amid warnings that elderly people have suffered ` an abominable betrayal ' over social care . every year , at least 20,000 people have to sell their homes to pay for care but the coalition is to legislate to cap costs in the future . the coalition 's mid-term review , published yesterday , did little to suggest any progress was likely to be made soon . but mr clegg today told mps the government would ` enshrine ' in law the principle of capping care costs , with the taxpayers picking up the rest of the tab . under england 's current system , pensioners with assets of # 23,500 or more -- including the value of their homes -- have to pay unlimited care charges . it means that every year , at least 20,000 have to sell their homes to pay for care . deputy pm nick clegg revealed the government would legislate before 2015 . two years ago an independent commission led by economist andrew dilnot suggested these charges should be subject to a lifetime cap of around # 35,000 , with the state paying the rest . the measure is designed to stop pensioners being forced to sell their homes to cover costs . it is understood the coalition is likely to opt for a cap of around # 75,000 . mr clegg revealed the government will set out legislation on introducing a cap within weeks which ` will address this issue of how to avoid individuals and households facing catastrophic costs in funding their care ' . speaking in the commons he added : ` we have said all along that we believe in the principles and basic models set out by andrew dilnot . ` of course there is an issue about how we pay for this in future , but as you quite rightly identify the first step is to enshrine this approach in legislation which we will be seeking to do during this parliament . ' treasury opposition to a multi-billion pound reform of the care system has been blamed for the lack of progress to date . last week care minister norman lamb pleaded with the chancellor george osborne to ` get on with it ' . ` my absolute determination is to get the principle in legislation so we have that debate rather than it remaining in the long grass , ' he told mailonline . it came after his predecessor , paul burstow , suggested curbing the winter fuel allowance for all but the poorest pensioners to raise # 1.5billion-a-year to help pay for the reforms . in the commons today , mr burstow said the mid-term review only committed to the principles of a cap and reform of means-testing ` to end the care lottery that we have in this country ' . he called on mr clegg to ` now go further than just looking at principles and commit the government to introducing the legislation during the life of this parliament ... to give people the peace of mind they deserve ' . meanwhile professor john ashton , incoming president of the faculty of public health , said the generation who established the welfare system were being let down by a lack of funding . the number of elderly people receiving daycare from their councils has fallen by nearly a quarter since 2009 . ` the elderly are frightened of what is going to happen to them . there is a debt of honour we owe the elderly . ' they fought in world war two or contributed to the war effort and wanted to create a secure environment that came to be known as the welfare state which is now being portrayed as dependants and layabouts . it is an abominable betrayal , ' he told the daily telegraph . ` social care has to be properly funded and all parties are avoiding this issue . without proper funding we are going to have more and more care scandals . ' yesterday prime minister david cameron insisted that the coalition government would set out reforms to cap  the potentially huge cost  of social care , but prof ashton claimed ministers were ` fiddling while rome burns ' .", "summary": " nick clegg reveals legislation will be introduced in this parliament .   dilnot commission recommended capping costs at # 32,000 but ministers likely to opt for # 75,000 limit .   head of faculty of public health accuses ministers of ` abominable betrayal ' "}
