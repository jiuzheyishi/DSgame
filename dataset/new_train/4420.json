{"text": "ian mclagan , a fun-loving keyboardist who played on records by such artists as the rolling stones , lucinda williams , bruce springsteen and his own bands -- the small faces and its successor , the faces -- died wednesday , according to a statement from his record label , yep roc records . he was 69 . the cause of death was complications from a stroke , according to yep roc . kenney jones , the faces ' drummer who later joined the who , expressed his sadness in the statement .  i am completely devastated by this shocking news and i know this goes for ronnie -lrb- wood -rrb- and rod -lrb- stewart -rrb- also .  the rock and roll hall of famer 's resume was varied and eclectic , his soulful and often joyous organ fills heard on such albums as the stones '  some girls ,  lucinda williams '  car wheels on a gravel road  and john mayer 's  battle studies .  a rousing live performer , he played with bob dylan and springsteen and was scheduled to tour with nick lowe this winter . his death comes on the heels of that of another stones sideman , saxophone player bobby keys , who died tuesday . mclagan established his abilities while touring with the small faces and the faces . the latter band was particularly known for its good-time habits , like demolishing hotel rooms in classic rock 'n' roll fashion .  you could n't go from one town to another and not walk into the identical room in every town ,  he explained to cnn in a 2004 interview .  so we hurt them .  the small faces were heroes of britain 's youth and had a great deal of success there , though just one of their songs , 1967 's  itchycoo park ,  cracked the top 10 in the united states . when lead singer steve marriott left the band in 1969 , the height-challenged group reformed around the much taller rod stewart and ron wood and dropped the  small  from its name . the faces ' hits included  stay with me  and  cindy incidentally .  mclagan , known as  mac ,  was born in hounslow , middlesex , england , in 1945 . he joined the small faces in 1965 and the band had a four-year run of hits , including  sha la la la lee ,   all or nothing  and  afterglow of your love ,  the latter from their uk no. 1 album ,  ogden 's nut gone flake .  the post-marriott faces were known for such albums as  a nod is as good as a wink to a blind horse  and  ooh la la ,  but it was their marathon live performances that really made their reputation -- sometimes unfairly .  we had the reputation of big drinkers , but we paced ourselves ,  mclagan told cnn .  we all knew our limits . ... i 'm now fighting this reputation of being sloppy , but listen -lrb- to the music -rrb- .  the band tried to juggle group dynamics with stewart 's soaring solo career , but the writing was on the wall when the singer left in 1975 . wood joined the stones and mclagan became an in-demand session musician . mclagan recorded a handful of albums on his own , including  troublemaker  -lrb- 1979 -rrb- ,  bump in the night  -lrb- 1980 -rrb- and  united states  -lrb- 2014 -rrb- , and in recent years led the bump band from his adopted hometown of austin , texas . when he was n't in austin he was on the road , a place where he was always happy . describing the travels of the small faces in the '60s -- when touring was pretty much a do-it-yourself affair -- he could n't help but wax fondly .  a favorite memory keeps coming back : it 's just us in the car , going to gigs ,  he told the los angeles beat in 2012 .  we used to smoke , listen to music , laugh and giggle , and had the best time ! we 'd get to the gig and we 'd play music , then we 'd leave the gig and we 'd listen to music . then we 'd go back to the hotel and we 'd play music , then we 'd listen to music . it 's all we did , and it was fabulous ! you ca n't have a better life .  people we 've lost in 2014 .", "summary": " ian mclagan was a rock and roll hall of fame keyboardist .   he was part of the small faces and the faces , later a noted session man .   he played on albums by the rolling stones , lucinda williams , bruce springsteen .
