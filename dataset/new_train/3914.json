{"text": "an ash cloud crisis even worse than the icelandic eruption , which grounded thousands of flights four years ago , could be possible , scientists have claimed . the warning comes after the discovery that volcanic ash has travelled from alaska to northern ireland - overturning previously held assumptions about the distances deposits could drift . it is the first evidence that ash clouds can travel across the vast atlantic ocean . scroll down for video . queen 's university belfast scientists found volcanic ash had travelled from alaska to northern ireland . it is the first evidence that suggest ash clouds -lrb- stock image shown -rrb- can cross the atlantic . this could mean airways are more susceptible to volcanoes than first thought . dr sean pyne-o'donnell , from queen 's university belfast -lrb- qub -rrb- , who helped conduct the research , said it could have major implications for the aviation industry . he said : ` the usefulness is the awareness that such a thing can happen . ` airlines are always interested in risk management . this allows them to be better prepared for such eventualities . ' on monday , alaska 's most active volcano began to calm down . it began spewing ash 35,000 ft -lrb- 10,700 metres -rrb- into the air over the weekend , but scientists said the volcano has a pattern of prolonged eruptions of varying intensity and they 're not ready to consider the explosion over . pavlof volcano began erupting on wednesday 12 november , culminating with a major blast on saturday that lasted eight hours before its seismic activity dramatically dropped . the national weather service warned aircraft to avoid the area over the weekend because of the ash plume . academics have traced ash found in sites across europe , including sluggan bog near randalstown in county antrim , northern ireland to the so-called white river ash resulting from the eruption of the alaskan volcano , mount bona-churchill , in 847ad . chemical ` fingerprinting ' was used to match the white river ash to tephra layers - material produced by volcanoes - in ireland , norway , germany and greenland . for 20 years it was believed these layers had come from iceland - the source of most ash in europe . in 2010 , plumes spewed out by the volcano eyjafjallajokull in iceland caused major disruption and grounded over 100,000 international flights , costing airlines more than # 2 billion -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- . volcanoes like mount bona-churchill in alaska are much more volatile and are scheduled to erupt on average every 100 years , increasing the risk of another ash cloud drama with consequences for transatlantic as well as european travel . in 2010 , plumes spewed out by the volcano eyjafjallajokull in iceland caused major disruption and grounded over 100,000 international flights -lrb- image shown -rrb- , costing airlines more than # 2 billion -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- . the latest findings suggest a similar disruption from another volcano may not be as unlikely as thought . dr pyne-o'donnell , from queen 's school of geography , archaeology and paleoecology , added : ` if this was to happen again , which is not improbable , it would have massive implications for airspace . ` this is a very large area and is very busy with travel . there could be large-scale disruption . ' the findings were made by qub scientists in partnership with an international team of academics and have been published in the journal geology . researchers also speculate that other tephra layers from similar transatlantic eruptions may yet be uncovered in other irish sites .", "summary": " scientists found that recent volcanic ash had travelled from alaska to northern ireland .   it is the first evidence that suggests ash clouds can cross the atlantic .   this could mean airways are more susceptible to ash than first thought .   the 2010 eruption of volcano eyjafjallajokull caused major disruption .   another ash cloud could have similar consequences for transatlantic , as well as european travel .
