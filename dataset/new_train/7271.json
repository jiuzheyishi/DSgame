' lord patten then issued a barbed comment , saying : ` it may be thought -- however admirable she was -- slightly pushing it to persuade jesus to change its name . ' campaigners have been demanding recognition for lady thatcher since her death in april . they also want her bestowed with a posthumous honorary degree after she was snubbed in 1985 by embittered academics protesting against cuts in university funding . it means lady thatcher is the only oxford-educated prime minister not to have been given an honorary degree , a move that entrenched divisions between the thatcher government and the left-wing educational establishment . when she retired , lady thatcher handed her official papers to the archives centre at churchill college , cambridge , where sir winston churchill 's papers are also kept . in another snide boast , lord patten said oxford 's bodleian library had secured the official papers of lord howe , the former deputy prime minister whose resignation from the thatcher cabinet in 1990 precipitated her downfall . lord patten dismissed demands for the university to make good its snub to lady thatcher three decades after it refused her an honorary degree . they are pictured in 1997 when he was governor of hong kong . boris johnson suggested the idea of a thatcher college to make amends for oxford not awarding her an honorary doctorate . ` it 's absolutely true that margaret thatcher has left her papers to churchill college . ` it 's also true that geoffrey howe has left his papers to the bodleian . ` the conservative party archive is also held in oxford . ` at present the most important issue in oxford about margaret thatcher 's legacy is a campaign starting at her old college somerville to start thatcher scholarships . ` i hope that will be a lasting memorial to an extraordinary woman who changed the way this country is governed . ' asked if lady margaret hall -- an oxford college set up in honour of lady margaret beaufort , founder of the tudor dynasty -- might also honour lady thatcher , he said : ` that lady margaret was the mother of kings and i 'm not sure that 's yet on the -lsb- cards -rsb- . ' lord patten seemed unaware that christ church has already changed its name once . originally called cardinal college after henry viii 's chief minister cardinal wolsey , it was renamed when he fell from grace . mr johnson said last month : ` i 'm still waiting for the oxford dons to accept the gravity of their error , and in the spirit of magnanimity to award baroness thatcher not only a posthumous doctorate , but why not endow a college ? '", "summary": " boris johnson said a thatcher college would make amends for not giving ex-pm an honorary doctorate .   but lord patten , chancellor of oxford , said the idea was ` pushing it '   instead lady thatcher 's former college is to offer scholarships .
