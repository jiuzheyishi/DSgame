{"text": "dara torres lingered in the water after the other swimmers had climbed out of the pool . her long career was finally over . she wanted to soak up the moment as long as possible . the 45-year-old torres came up short in her bid to make it to the olympics for a sixth time . she finished fourth in the final of the 50-meter freestyle monday night , her only event at the u.s. swimming trials . sinking in : dara torres lingered in the water after the other swimmers had climbed out of the pool after the 50-meter freestyle qualifier race when she came in fourth place . humbling : the 45-year-old mom waved to fans after she realized she would not make it to her sixth olympic games . ` this is really over . that 's it , i 'm going to enjoy some time with my daughter , have a nice summer and cheer on the u.s. team , ' torres said . after winning three silver medals at the beijing olympics , torres underwent radical knee surgery and put all her hopes into a chaotic dash from one end of the pool to the other . those hopes were slashed when jessica hardy won in 24.50 seconds , while kara lynn joyce took the other olympic spot in 24.73 . ` obviously i was hoping to make the team , ' torres said . ` that was my goal and missing it by less than a tenth of a second is tough , but i do n't think there 's anything i could have changed . ' torres was denied a trip to london by nine-hundredths of a second , also touching behind third-place christine magnuson -lrb- 24.78 -rrb- . reading the score : torres knew it was over when she saw her time -lrb- 24.82 -rrb- and noted it came in fourth . congratulatory : torres -lrb- left -rrb- praised her competitors kara lynn joyce -lrb- top -rrb- who came in second and winner jessica hardy -lrb- bottom -rrb- who will both be going to the london games . torres smiled when she saw her time -lrb- 24.82 -rrb- and hugged both hardy and joyce . when torres finally got out , she began motioning for her daughter , 6-year-old tessa , to join her . torres walked into the stands , still dripping wet , and scooped up tessa , who was wearing a green shirt that said ` go mom . ' ` she 's bummed she 's not going to london now . i told her i 'd still take her , ' torres said of her daughter . in the last event of the eight-day trials , andrew gemmell won the grueling 1,500 freestyle in 14 minutes , 52.19 seconds . connor jaeger was right with him all the way , taking the second spot for london in 14:52.51 . torres said she had the same nervous anticipation before her last race as she did at her first u.s. trials in 1984 , when she earned a spot in the los angeles games . she had no illusions about being a serious medal contender in london , but she wanted to end her career with one more trip to the olympics . ` being 45 , getting fourth in olympic trials against girls almost half my age , it 's ok , ' torres said . support : torres walked into the stands , still dripping wet , and scooped up her six-year-old daughter tessa , who was wearing a green shirt that said ` go mom ' ` i 'm used to winning , but that was n't the goal here . the goal was to try to make it . i did n't quite do it , but i 'm really happy with how i did . i was able to hang in there . ' torres remembered her late coach , michael lohberg , who died in 2011 from a rare blood disorder that was diagnosed just before she swam in beijing . ' i was very emotional before my swim , ' torres said . end of an era : torres has competed in five olympics and won 12 medals during her expansive career . ` when i was putting my suit on with my trainer , anne tierney , we started crying because i started thinking about michael . in july of 2010 , he had said to me ,  let 's go for this .  i really wanted to finish the story that i started with him . i did n't make it but i know he would have been proud . ' hardy said it was an honor to compete against torres , who retired twice but came back to win five medals at the 2000 sydney games , then three more silvers in beijing . this time , she 's retiring for good . ' i love racing dara , ' the 25-year-old hardy said . ' i wish she could have made it this year , but swimming with her the past couple years has been really an awesome treat for sure . ' hardy failed to qualify for the olympics in her best event , the 100 breaststroke , but she bounced back to win the 100 and 50 freestyle , capping her comeback from a failed doping test that kept her off the team four years ago . an arbitration panel ruled that hardy was the victim of a tainted supplement . ` doing so well , winning two races here , i could n't have predicted this in a million years , ' hardy said . ` i 'm so happy and so grateful that this meet went as it did . ' joyce did n't even get out of the preliminaries of the 100 free , but she came back in the 50 free to make her third olympic team . ' i did n't start out the meet very well , ' joyce said . ' i did my best to visualize and prepare my body . it was my one chance to lay it all the line for this 50 . i ca n't believe i did it .
