{"text": "it 's the battle of the tech titans . no , not apple versus samsung . sony has gone head-to-head with microsoft after releasing their next-generation gaming platforms for the holiday shopping season . and according to a recent sales report , sony 's playstation4 seems to have won the first round of the battle . the ps4 sold 1.25 million units in the united states during november , while the xbox one sold 750,000 , said michael pachter , an analyst at wedbush morgan , in a recent note to investors . as for global sales , the japanese manufacturer announced they had sold more than 2.1 million ps4 units worldwide at the beginning of december . microsoft say they sold over 2 million systems . with the xbox one starting at $ 499 , and the ps4 at $ 399 , pachter says the the $ 100 price difference is responsible for sony 's success :  the reason sony beats microsoft is solely the price . microsoft loses the next generation unless they cut price .  in at the starting line . from the start , it was far from clear which console would reign over the world of gaming .  these are two systems that are well-balanced to keep the furious battle between xbox and playstation going for the next decade ... which can only be good for gamers everywhere ,  says david hutchinson , chief video games writer for the times of london . the tech landscape has transformed drastically since the last time these two electronics giants went head to head with the xbox 360 in 2005 and the playstation 3 in 2007 . back then , smartphones and tablet devices did n't even exist . while ps4 is being touted as the perfect machine for social media lovers -- offering games that players can share easily with friends -- xbox one is said to be ideal for those after a multimedia machine that can multitask and switch between games , movies , music and applications quickly and seamlessly .  the playstation 4 has been set as more of a games machine versus the xbox one 's aim to be the multimedia entertainment center at the heart of your living room ... both systems are essentially pcs in a console shell ,  explains hutchinson . the two systems have everything from motion tracking and facial recognition to cameras and redesigned controllers . what 's more , the xbox one can not only be plugged into your cable box for on-demand tv and movies , but can also be personalized to a user 's interests running a series of apps and programs , including skype , netflix and lovefilm . smart strategies . seven years ago , microsoft pushed development on the xbox 360 so that they could put their console on the market a year ahead of the playstation 3 . hutchinson says this move gave microsoft plenty of time  to gain an audience within a gaming community where the playstation had previously ruled supreme .   they gained a huge market share in that unchallenged year ,  he explains .  sony are obviously aware how this has affected their market dominance , so in this cycle of consoles they have made sure to release the ps4 slightly ahead of their rival in the u.s. to make sure they are n't left behind again .  at the industry 's e3 conference in june , not long after sony went public with their early release date , microsoft announced they 'd priced their console $ 100 more than sony 's ps4 . though the news did n't sit well with gaming enthusiasts , microsoft refused to budge on the price . a gamer backlash ensued when fans found out the xbox one was not going to allow offline gameplay or secondhand games to be used on the device . in turn , resistance from fans forced microsoft to reverse its decision , explains hutchinson .  xbox were wise to backtrack on their initial idea that you would n't be able to easily resell secondhand games or pass old games onto friends more than once ,  says hutchinson .  it showed a lack of understanding of the importance of selling on games for younger gamers , but also showed microsoft 's maturity in knowing when to backtrack if mistakes have been made .  the death of consoles ? in recent years , the video game industry has seen users develop a growing appetite for mobile devices . this has led some to question the future of the console industry .  rumors of gaming console death are a bit premature ,  says eric smith , a consumer electronics expert from strategy analytics .  it 's been a down year in 2013 -lsb- for consoles -rsb- , but going forward , this next generation is going to boost sales for several years to come .  industry analysts attribute few top game releases and the tail end of the last generation of consoles as contributing factors for this year 's downturn . meanwhile mobile play continues to grow at a significant rate . research firm gartner forecast in their latest report that revenue from mobile gaming alone is predicted to  nearly double between 2013 and 2015 from $ 13.2 billion to $ 22 billion .   casual gamers i think have moved on most likely to mobile platforms . tablets and phones are cheaper -lsb- and -rsb- more easily accessible ,  says smith .  these are impressive machines that have been released , they are enjoying great sales and beforehand , they were enjoying great pre-orders ... but the audience has shrunk and i do n't think those casual gamers are going to return .  so with casual gamers moving over to their smartphones , hardcore gamers have been left to save the console for future generations . smith says :  -lsb- xbox one -rsb- does gaming as well , but it is targeted towards a much broader audience and i think there is a risk in that gamers look at it and say : ` this is not for me , this is not built for gamers first ' ... but at the same time , if these functions do catch up , -lsb- microsoft -rsb- stands to gain sales down the road .  meanwhile , hutchinson hopes that neither electronics giant will reign supreme as it means a better and more competitive experience for the fans themselves .  the joint dominance of the xbox 360 and the ps3 marked a great era for the gaming public ,  he says .  with no monopoly , gamers get better deals on games and hardware after the initial round of console launches are out of the way . long may this continue .
