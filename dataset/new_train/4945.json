{"text": "le bourget , france once upon a time , the airship was hailed as the future of flight : as glamorous , luxurious and fashionable as the art deco era which marked its heyday . but a series of disasters , not least the crash of the hindenburg in new jersey , in 1937 , with the loss of 36 lives , put paid to the dreams of intercontinental zeppelin travel . blimps are still a familiar sight in advertising , but those who design and build these aircraft believe there 's much more to them -- and to their future -- than simply signposting the local car dealership or giving tv audiences a better view of the football field during the big match . now , 90 years after the launch of america 's first airship , the uss shenandoah , dirigibles and aerostats are undergoing something of a renaissance . among those hoping to lead the charge is california-based aeros , which is developing what it hopes will be a revolutionary new cargo airship , the aeroscraft , combining elements of regular ` lighter-than-air ' -lrb- lta -rrb- craft and traditional fixed-wing planes . in addition , it has a magic ingredient : the vertical take-off and landing capabilities of a helicopter , meaning it has no need for a runway or airfield . read more : test your aviation knowledge . the idea was developed by kazakhstan-born engineer igor pasternak , who moved to the u.s. in 1994 and set up in business building advertising blimps . he 's spent the past two decades working to solve the problems posed by traditional airships .  i understand airships well ,  he told cnn .  i 've built a lot of them .  his aeroscraft is a rigid-hulled dirigible measuring a whopping 169 meters in length , with a payload of 66 tonnes -lrb- and plans for a 250 tonne version -rrb- , a cruising speed of up to 120 knots , and a range of 3,100 nautical miles .  it 's a little bit like my dream vehicle ,  he said .  in natural disasters and other situations where infrastructure is non-existent , the aeroscraft could be used to bring in emergency supplies : food , water , blankets -- 66 tonnes of relief at a time ,  explained the company 's communications director john kiehle . and while its primary purpose is likely to be logistical , moving cargo , military troops and humanitarian relief supplies into remote and inhospitable terrain , the company admits that down the line there may be other uses for the technology , from  floating hotels  to  sky yachts for millionaires .  read more : 50 years of paris airshow . so far , the company has created a scaled-down version of the aircraft to prove that the design can work ; the next step is a full-size prototype . the aim is to have the first aeroscraft flying by 2016 , and the initial fleet of 24 vehicles up and running by 2020 to 2021 .  this truly is a game-changer ,  said bill feeley , the company 's director of strategic finances .  it 's a real shift in industrial technology , on a par with the building of skyscrapers , or the creation of nuclear energy .  pasternak and kiehle say one of the aeroscraft 's biggest advantages is that it runs on regular diesel , rather than expensive aviation fuel which can be tough to get hold of in the world 's more inaccessible regions . but another airship project currently in research and development could end up being even cheaper and easier to power : innovation and engineering consultancy group altran 's sun cloud is a dirigible powered by solar energy . it 's an area the company has some experience in , having already worked on solar impulse , the world 's first plane powered solely by the sun . like aeros ' airship , the sun cloud is designed to carry large loads of cargo over long distances -- but the sun cloud is missing one component likely to be key to the aeroscraft 's success : the pilot . altran 's feasibility study is examining whether it is possible to move payloads of up to 250 tonnes from place to place in what is effectively a super-sized drone . read more : on your marks , jet set , go !  we 're not looking to replace traditional forms of cargo transportation ,  explained the program 's manager , ali jafaar .  container ships can carry 500,000 tonnes at a time -- we 're not looking to do that .  instead the idea is to be able to move large items , such as plane parts , long distances from one factory to another . reliance on solar power means the aircraft would be far slower than a regular plane , traveling at just 25km an hour , but the fact it is is unmanned means it could potentially remain airborne , at high altitudes , for lengthy periods of time .  it 's all about speed , and optimizing energy ,  said jafaar .  what uses up energy is going fast . humans always want to be going faster but we 're not going to be carrying humans , so the slower speeds can be tolerated .  if and when the sun cloud gets off the ground -- which jafaar admits is not likely to happen for some years yet -- it may well find it is n't the only airship hovering around above us . u.s. defense contractor raytheon is already planning to put its own aerostats -lrb- airships which are tethered to the ground -rrb- into the skies above the u.s. capital , washington . read more : paris airshow 's incredible moments . but instead of carrying troops or manufacturing supplies , raytheon 's blimps will be loaded with surveillance equipment , to watch for the threat of attacks . the catchily-titled joint land attack cruise missile defense elevated netted sensor , or jlens for short , is designed to scan the skies , the seas and the streets below for signs of danger , be it from incoming missiles and drones , or suspicious boats or trucks .  an airplane can only stay up for so long , but jlens is persistent ,  said raytheon 's keith mcnamara .  because it 's tethered , with its power source on the ground , it can stay up there 24/7 for 30 days at a time .  and because it 's so much higher up than radar on the ground , it can see much further , hundreds of kilometres , as opposed to tens of kilometres .  while raytheon 's blimps will be equipped with all the latest technology , the idea itself is nothing new : hydrogen-filled balloons were used for surveillance during the american civil war . it seems that some 260 years after the montgolfier brothers first ascended into the skies above paris in a hot air balloon , the glory days of the dirigible may be yet to come .", "summary": " u.s. company aeros developing massive airship to carry heavy cargo long distances .   aeroscraft will take off and land vertically , like a helicopter , without need for a runway .   project is just one of a number of airships and aerostats being planned for a variety of uses .   airships once feted as future of flying , but fell out of favor after the hindenburg disaster .
