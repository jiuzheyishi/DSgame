{"text": "millions of americans are none too happy with the federal government right now . the shutdown is over after 16 days , but the things we missed while the government was closed are still fresh in our minds . here are nine things readers are thrilled to have back , in no particular order . add your own in the comments below and we might add them to our list . 1 . national parks -lrb- + panda cam -rrb- . parks make us happy . that was the battle cry from photographers , campers , newlyweds and other outdoor lovers turned away from national facilities ranging from yellowstone national park to the neighborhood playground during the shutdown .  i missed the first part of canoe season on the buffalo national river in nw arkansas , just as leaves started on fall color ,  tulsa , oklahoma , attorney teresa m. burkett wrote on twitter . as soon as she heard the impasse was breaking , she set up a canoe trip for this weekend .  the nation 's first national river is america at its finest . truly the best part of our federal government : america 's national parks .  lovers of the national zoo 's panda cam were also at a loss for cuteness . the webcam was back up by thursday morning -lrb- the 8-week-old panda cub was sleeping , last we checked . -rrb- . yellowstone protester : stop ` holding our parks hostage ' 2 . health care research . the national institutes of health and centers for disease control and prevention offer life-saving treatments for a lot of hopeless people . young mother michelle langbehn has been through nine months of chemotherapy , two cycles of radiation , a spinal fusion and several tumor removal surgeries for her cancer . when the government shut down , she was waiting for the nih to review her medical files to determine if she was eligible to enter a clinical drug trial . she 's since learned that she did n't qualify , but countless other patients will benefit from that study and others . open for business again . 3 . weather information . our environment plays a key role in our daily lives , even if we are n't giving much thought to which way the wind blows . the absence of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 's website made it harder for some to find out about current weather conditions or see views of the northern lights . those who depend on this information for school or other research were missing a key resource .  it 's day 14 of the shutdown and i have lost two weeks of thesis research because nasa and noaa 's websites are down ,  tweeted a user named nicole . omoju miller , a resident of california 's earthquake-prone bay area , tried to visit the u.s. geological survey website , but saw it was closed .  so we had a small earthquake in the middle of the night ,  she wrote .  went to usgs , guess what ? they are furloughed because of the government shutdown !  4 . museums . the smithsonian institution 's museums -- including the national air and space museum , the most-visited museum in the country -- were closed during the shutdown , spoiling vacation plans for thousands . but now that they 've reopened , treasures like the wright brothers ' airplane , the original star-spangled banner , the hope diamond , dorothy 's ruby slippers and spacecraft that actually went to the moon are again on view to the public , and all free .  any of the smithsonian museums are wonderful . and the price is just right ,  noted reddit user empirialest on a discussion about favorite museums . do n't forget your astronaut ice cream ! 5 . space exploration . gazing up at the sky to see what 's out there is a pastime here on this planet , but there is so much the naked eye ca n't see . those addicted to space and the stars rely on nasa 's website for views of what 's out there in outer space , but with the shutdown in action , they were missing their space and science fix . the thought of it all coming back made some very happy , like twitter user angela schmidt , who likes to tune in to what 's happening with the international space station .  the government is gon na reopen !  schmidt wrote excitedly .  i finally get nasa tv back ! missing my daily iss updates !  another twitter user , jeffery elliott , wrote an abbreviated letter of support to the agency during the shutdown .  dear nasa ,  he said ,  on behalf of the american people , i want to apologize . we took you for granted and now we 're paying the price . we 're so very sorry .  6 . libraries and archives . the library of congress , u.s. census and other government departments keep the flow of information going . students and researchers realized how much they needed access to archival materials during the shutdown . georgia tech graduate research assistant and ph.d. candidate glo ross missed having census data at her fingertips .  the #shutdown just got real for this phd student . access to census data for research ? denied ,  she tweeted . ross uses geographic information systems , spatial statistics and other data obtained from the u.s. census site . she is writing her dissertation on the transformation of food deserts in atlanta . cutting off access to federal data  stops knowledge flow and creativity -- big disadvantage to those studying past trends and predicting future ones ,  she said . 7 . being able to change names . san francisco safety donte whitner 's name change was n't the only one put on hold because of the shutdown -lrb- he wanted to drop the w and go by hitner -rrb- .  no name change , but enjoyed the convo ,  courtney ziller wrote on twitter after a trip to the local social security office in minneapolis , only to be told she could n't file the paperwork for a new social security card because of the shutdown . the social security office also stopped issuing replacement social security cards , replacement medicare cards and proof-of-income letters . 8 . getting paid . ` our shutdown fears have been realized ' hundreds of thousands of federal employees are ready for the government to show them the money . more than 400,000 were still furloughed at the end of the shutdown , and it was twice that when the shutdown began . essential workers -- those who kept working without pay during the shutdown , including military service members -- can now receive their back pay .  it feels like crap ,  said air force archaeologist and cultural resources manager tom penders when the shutdown began .  we live paycheck to paycheck as it is and barely make ends meet .  plenty of other workers and business owners will never recoup their losses , such as hotel server joy lorien , who was temporarily laid off from her job at the skyland resort in virginia 's shenandoah national park at the height of tourist season . there were other serious impacts on low-income families . head start preschool programs were forced to close in six states until a houston couple donated $ 10 million to keep them running through the shutdown . 9 . our sanity . while the government stood still , some americans felt their heads spinning . angie smith missed  that sense of peace knowing things are functioning as they should .  e. kate g. missed  being proud of our country .  and tim w. missed  common sense ,  saying  i have no reason to believe it will be back anytime soon .  what government resources are you glad to have back ?
