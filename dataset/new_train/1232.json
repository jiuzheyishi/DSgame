{"text": "author -rsb- . scientists have warned that the collapse of bee colonies could trigger a farming crisis , but why populations are being hit so hard has remained largely a mystery . now one group of experts has proved that two widely used neonicotinoids - a class of insecticide -- harm honeybee colonies over the winter , particularly when temperatures drop . research revealed that even low doses of an insecticide called clothianidin had an adverse effect on hives . although hv1a/gna was carried to the brain of the honeybee -lrb- stock image -rrb- , it had no effect on the insect , which suggests the highly selective spider venom toxin does not interact with the calcium channels in the bee . there are only enough honeybees in britain to properly pollinate a quarter of the country 's crops , scientists claim . destruction of huge swathes of grassland and the use of agricultural chemicals have caused a spiralling drop in the populations of honeybees , which are vital for food production . professor simon potts of the university of reading , who led the research project , said : ` we face a catastrophe in future years unless we act now . ' the research , published in the journal plos one , found that europe has 13.4 million too few honeybee colonies to properly pollinate all its crops . bee populations have plummeted as their meadowland habitats were concreted over and their wildflower food supply killed by herbicides . previous studies have estimated that the number of british honeybees have halved over the last 25 years . scientists think the bee shortfall is leading to reduced crop yields and they warn that in future farmers may have to look at mechanical or hand pollination . the study by the harvard school of public health -lrb- hsph -rrb- in cambridge , massachusetts , strengthens the scientists ' findings from last year that low doses of imidacloprid - another neonicotinoid - are linked to colony collapse disorder -lrb- ccd -rrb- where bees abandon their hives over the winter and eventually die . although other studies have suggested that ccd-related mortality in honeybee colonies may come from bees ' reduced resistance to mites or parasites as a result of exposure to pesticides , the new study found that bees in the hives exhibiting ccd had almost identical levels of pathogen infestation as a group of control hives , most of which survived the winter . this finding suggests that the neonicotinoids are causing some other kind of biological mechanism in bees that in turn leads to ccd , according to the study , published in the bulletin of insectology . ` we demonstrated again in this study that neonicotinoids are highly likely to be responsible for triggering ccd in honeybee hives that were healthy prior to the arrival of winter , ' said lead author chensheng -lrb- alex -rrb- lu , associate professor of environmental exposure biology at hsph . the new pesticide , hv1a/gna , has no effect on bees ' learning , which is key to their foraging for food . researchers said that the chemical cocktail has potential as an environmentally friendly ` bee safe ' pesticide and an alternative to those suspected of decimating colonies . a stock image of crop spraying is pictured . since 2006 , there have been significant losses of honeybees from ccd . pinpointing the cause is crucial to mitigating this problem since bees are prime pollinators of roughly one-third of all crops worldwide . experts have considered a number of possible causes , including pathogen infestation , beekeeping practices , and pesticide exposure . recent findings suggest that ccd is related specifically to neonicotinoids including imidacloprid and clothianidin , which may impair bees ' neurological functions . together with experts from the worcester county beekeepers association , the scientists studied the health of 18 honeybee colonies in three locations in central massachusetts between october 2012 and april 2013 . at each location , the researchers separated six colonies into three groups - one treated with imidacloprid , one with clothianidin and one untreated . there was a steady decline in the size of all the bee colonies at the beginning of winter , which is typical among hives during the colder months in new england . the battle bee-gins : since 2006 , there have been significant losses of honey bees -lrb- pictured -rrb- from ccd . pinpointing the cause is crucial to mitigating this problem since bees are prime pollinators of roughly one-third of all crops worldwide . beginning in january 2013 , honeybee populations in the control colonies began to increase as expected , but populations in the neonicotinoid-treated hives continued to decline . by april 2013 , half of the neonicotinoid-treated colonies were lost with abandoned hives that are typical of ccd . while the 12 pesticide-treated hives in the current study experienced a 50 per cent ccd mortality rate , the authors noted that in their 2012 study , bees in pesticide-treated hives had a much higher ccd mortality rate of 94 per cent . that earlier bee die-off occurred during the particularly cold and prolonged winter of 2010-2011 , leading the authors to speculate that colder temperatures , in combination with neonicotinoids , may play a role in the severity of ccd . ` although we have demonstrated the validity of the association between neonicotinoids and ccd in this study , future research could help elucidate the biological mechanism that is responsible for linking sub-lethal neonicotinoid exposures to ccd , ' said professor lu . ` hopefully we can reverse the continuing trend of honeybee loss . ' in a bid to stop the rapid decline , experts fitted ` backpack ' sensors to 5,000 bees in australia in january to unravel why colonies there do not seem to be affected by the ` colony collapse disorder ' that is decimating bee populations in other countries . the research aims to improve honey bee pollination and productivity on farms as well . scientists at the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation -lrb- csiro -rrb- fitted 5,000 tiny sensors , measuring just 2.5 mm squared to the backs of honeybees in hobart , tasmania , before releasing them into the wild . it is the first time such large numbers of insects have been used for environmental monitoring . ` honeybees play a vital role in the landscape through a free pollination service for agriculture , which various crops rely on to increase yields ' said csiro science leader dr paulo de souza , who is heading up the swarm sensing project . ` a recent csiro study showed bee pollination in faba beans can lead to a productivity increase of 17 per cent . ` around one third of the food we eat relies on pollination , but honeybee populations around the world are crashing because of the dreaded varroa mite and colony collapse disorder . the research will also look at the impacts of agricultural pesticides on honeybees by monitoring insects that feed at sites with trace amounts of commonly used chemicals . scientists at the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation -lrb- csiro -rrb- have fitted 5,000 tiny sensors , measuring just 2.5 mm squared to the backs of honey bees in hobart , tasmania , before releasing them into the wild .", "summary": " harvard university scientists have proved that two widely used neonicotinoids - a class of insecticide -- harm honeybee colonies .   low doses of an insecticide called clothianidin had an adverse effect on hives - particularly in cold winters .   finding strengthens a previous study that found low doses of imidacloprid - another neonicotinoid - are linked to colony collapse disorder -lrb- ccd -rrb- .   ccd causes to bees abandon their hives over the winter and die .   study suggests neonicotinoids are causing some kind of biological mechanism in bees that leads to ccd .
