{"text": "when preparing to propose marriage , create a moment that 's right for her and that accurately reflects -- in a beautiful , emotional and thoughtful way -- what 's special about you . if you 're a great couple , those two things wo n't conflict . she loves you , so she 'll love you expressing who you are in a moment that 's totally focused on her . one of the biggest mistakes people make is thinking that there should be a crowd of strangers as onlookers . for some women , that 's just right . but for most , it is n't . it 's fine for women to drop hints to their boyfriends about the general kind of proposal they would want , i.e. , how public or not . do not dictate the specifics , and remember it 's not just about you ; it 's about him expressing himself in a beautiful , fragile moment of bravery and humility that 's all about love . celebrate him as much as he 's celebrating you . setting the scene . sometimes the most magical moment you can create is in a space that you have all to yourselves . i tricked my wife into ending up with me alone on the stage of the fox theatre in atlanta , when it was dark . the spotlight came on , our song played through the room . magic . why i proposed marriage in public . i got another couple into a major league baseball park when it was empty . she thought they were on a private tour for just a few members of her family . when they reached the pitcher 's mound , her boyfriend went down on one knee , as their song echoed throughout the stadium and a video about them played on the jumbotron . then the sprinklers came on , getting them just a little wet . no big crowd . beautiful . captured on video . booyah ! who got it right ? of the recent sprinkling of public marriage proposals making the rounds , the  lip dub  video speaks to my point . clearly it thrilled the bride-to-be and was an expression of the future groom 's personality . no big crowd of strangers , just , presumably , people they would both want to be there . it 's clever , original , positive , adorable . they 're not pretending to be all professional and perfect . i 'm not worried about something going wrong in a plan like that , because it would n't have mattered . it was n't about a perfect show -- it was about joy and a celebration of love . the problem is that guys see videos like this and feel pressured to do something that 's public or viral , and they lose track of the point . does it have to be public ? your proposal is not a performance ! it 's not about proving to the world how cool you are . and its value does not lie in how many people witness it , watch it later or hear about it . its value lies entirely in how special it is to the two of you , and the kind of story it gives you both to share and celebrate for the rest of your lives . what 's with public marriage proposals ? that 's the potential problem with the proliferation of public proposal events , with men trying to outdo each other and create youtube moments . if you enter that game , you lose the point . there 's a high that comes from a magic proposal . and no matter how many people see it , only the two of you get that  high .  if you 're going for magic in that moment , that 's the central feeling you want to achieve -- not the ego boost of strangers praising you . close the deal . another important note on proposals : stick the landing ! i ca n't tell you how many guys plan for the buildup and the question , but then ooze awkwardness and have no clue what to do after she says yes ! especially when there 's a crowd of people there and the applause is over . have a plan for what you 're going to do at the very end of the magic proposal event . for some couples , the simpler the better . how did cnn 's josh levs become a proposal expert ? watch his tedx talk to find out ! would you propose in public or want your partner to do so ? share your take in the comments section below .", "summary": " josh levs says a marriage proposal should reflect the personality of the couple .   a public proposal should be well-thought-out and not for the benefit of observers .   public or private , a proposal should be an expression of love and commitment .   your proposal is not a performance , but you should be confident enough to seal the deal .
