{"text": "days before he became the first person diagnosed with ebola on american soil , thomas eric duncan answered  no  to questions about whether he had cared for a patient with the deadly virus . before leaving liberia , duncan also answered no to a question about whether he had touched the body of someone who died in an area affected by the disease , said binyah kesselly , board chairman of the liberia airport authority . witnesses say duncan had been helping ebola patients in liberia . liberian community leader tugbeh chieh tugbeh said duncan was caring for an ebola-infected patient at a residence in paynesville city , just outside monrovia . earlier thursday , kesselly told cnn that the authority  will seek to prosecute  if duncan lied on his health screening questionnaire before leaving west africa . liberian president ellen johnson sirleaf told canadian public broadcaster cbc on thursday that she would consult with lawyers to decide what to do with duncan when he returns home .  the fact that he knew -lrb- he was exposed to the virus -rrb- and he left the country is unpardonable , quite frankly ,  johnson sirleaf told cbc .  i just hope that nobody else gets infected .   with the u.s. doing so much to help us fight ebola , and again one of our compatriots did n't take due care , and so , he 's gone there and ... put some americans in a state of fear , and put them at some risk , and so i feel very saddened by that and very angry with him , to tell you the truth .  duncan 's family said he had n't mentioned any exposure to ebola in liberia . his girlfriend says he told her he had n't been in contact with anyone with ebola . wilfred smallwood , duncan 's half-brother , said thursday that he does n't believe duncan knew he had ebola when he left liberia for the united states . but he said it is n't out of the ordinary to come to the assistance of suffering people . asked about whether duncan had contact with ebola patients , he said ,  -lrb- it 's -rrb- what we do in liberia -- our tradition is to help somebody who needs help .  ebola reaches u.s. : a tragedy of errors . complete coverage on ebola . screened several times before leaving liberia . the health questionnaire typically contains questions about the passenger 's recent contact with ebola patients . passengers also are asked whether they 've experienced any symptoms consistent with ebola , such as vomiting , diarrhea or joint pain , in the past couple of days . duncan was screened three times before he boarded his flight in liberia to brussels , kesselly said .  the first screening was at the gate , before you get to the parking lot . the second time is before you enter the terminal building and the third is before you board the flight . at every point your temperature is scanned .  his temperature at those checkpoints was a consistent 97.3 degrees fahrenheit , centers for disease control and prevention chief thomas frieden told reporters thursday .  basically , he did n't have a fever ,  frieden said , noting that the ebola patient 's temperature was taken by a trained cdc health care worker with a thermometer approved by the food and drug administration . kesselly said airport authority would seek to prosecute duncan  if it is determined that he made a false declaration during the health screening questionnaire .   we can not make the -lrb- ebola -rrb- risk zero until the outbreak is controlled in west africa ,  said frieden . he went on to say that isolating west african countries completely through travel restrictions would make it more difficult to assist in controlling the outbreak , and would eventually put the united states at greater risk . family quarantined . duncan is in serious condition at texas health presbyterian hospital . so far , no one who had contact with duncan has shown any indication of having contracted ebola , dallas county judge clay jenkins told reporters thursday . smallwood said that when duncan first visited texas health presbyterian hospital , neither duncan nor the hospital knew then that he had ebola . this was duncan 's first time in the united states , smallwood said . the liberian national was visiting his son and his son 's mother in dallas , smallwood said . the partner of duncan has been quarantined in her dallas apartment where duncan became sick with the virus , the woman told cnn 's anderson cooper . the woman , who asked to be identified only by her first name , louise , is quarantined with one of her children who is younger than 13 and two nephews in their 20s . the four of them were in the apartment when duncan became ill , cooper said . louise and her family are in isolation with sheets and towels used by the ebola-stricken duncan , cooper said . louise did use bleach to clean her apartment ,  but it 's not clear to me how systematic the cleaning was ,  he said . authorities are working to find  more suitable living arrangements  for the family , jenkins said . up to 100 people being contacted . health officials are reaching out to as many as 100 people who may have had contact with duncan , a spokeswoman with the texas department of state health services said thursday . these are people who are still being questioned because they may have crossed paths with the patient either at the hospital , at his apartment complex or in the community .  out of an abundance of caution , we 're starting with this very wide net , including people who have had even brief encounters with the patient or the patient 's home ,  spokeswoman carrie williams said .  the number will drop as we focus in on those whose contact may represent a potential risk of infection .  the number of direct contacts who have been identified and are being monitored right now is  more than 12 ,  a federal official told cnn on thursday .  by the end of the day , we should have a pretty good idea of how many contacts there are ,  the official said . being  monitored  means a public health worker visits twice a day to take the contact 's temperature and ask them if they are experiencing any symptoms . none of the people being monitored has so far shown symptoms . most are not being quarantined , though dallas county health officials have ordered four close relatives of the patient to stay home and not have any visitors until at least october 19 .  the family was having some challenges following the directions to stay home , so we 're taking every precaution ,  texas department of health spokeswoman carrie williams said about why the state had issued a legal order . two things are still spreading in dallas : fear and frustration . some parents are scared to take their kids to the schools that his girlfriend 's children attended . attendance at those schools thursday was down to about 86 % on thursday , said mike miles , superintendent of the dallas independent school district . custodians are stepping up cleanup work at the schools , he said .  we do n't think there 's any virus at any of those buildings , but we 'll take that off the table , so we 're doing extra cleaning and disinfecting ,  miles said . others are upset at the hospital where duncan first sought care , which sent him home and raised the possibility he could infect others for at least two additional days . u.s. president barack obama contacted dallas mayor mike rawlings on thursday to make sure dallas was getting the federal resources it needs  to treat the patient safely , and control this case so that it does not spread widely ,  the white house said . your ebola questions answered . should americans worry about getting ebola ? how ebola spreads . hospital : ` flaw ' in electronic records hid travel history . on september 24 , four days after he arrived in dallas from liberia , duncan started feeling symptoms . that day is significant because that 's when he started being contagious . late the following night , he went to texas health presbyterian hospital dallas with a low-grade fever and abdominal pain , the hospital said . duncan told a nurse he had been in africa . but  regretfully , that information was not fully communicated throughout the full team ,  said dr. mark lester , executive vice president of texas health resources . duncan was sent home with painkillers and antibiotics , only to return in worse condition on september 28 . that 's when he was isolated .  it was a mistake . they dropped the ball ,  dr. anthony fauci , director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases , said of the miscommunication at the hospital .  you do n't want to pile on them , but hopefully this will never happen again . ... the cdc has been vigorously emphasizing the need for a travel history .  why did n't doctors know duncan had been to liberia ? the hospital said thursday night that a  flaw  in its electronic health records prevented doctors from seeing duncan 's travel history even though he shared it on his first visit to the hospital . duncan told a nurse he 'd been in africa , but that information was entered into a document that is n't automatically visible to physicians , texas health presbyterian hospital dallas said in a statement thursday . after discovering this , the hospital says it has changed the system so doctors and nurses will see travel history documentation .  we feel that this change will improve the early identification of patients who may be at risk for communicable diseases , including ebola ,  the hospital said . the hospital released a detailed description of what it said was the chain of events when duncan first came to the hospital on september 25 .  in the interest of transparency , and because we want other u.s. hospitals and providers to learn from our experience , we are , with mr. duncan 's permission , releasing this information ,  the hospital said . nurses and doctors at the hospital followed protocols , the hospital said .  when mr. duncan was asked if he had been around anyone who had been ill ,  the statement said ,  he said that he had not .
