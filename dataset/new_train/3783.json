{"text": "samir nasri will miss manchester city 's clash with his old club arsenal on sunday with a calf injury that is expected to keep him out for up to a month . the news is a major blow to the premier league champions as they try to keep pace with leaders chelsea at the top of the table . nasri , who has been in top form this season , is set to miss four league games and the fa cup fourth round tie against middlesbrough , but he should be fit to face barcelona in the champions league first knockout round on february 24 . ` we have some problems during the week with samir nasri , ' said manager manuel pellegrini . ` he has a calf injury so he will not be fit for the next game . he will be out for around three weeks or a month . before that is difficult . all the rest of the team are fit . ' samir nasri has been ruled out for up to a month and will miss saturday 's clash against old club arsenal . nasri played 89 minutes of city 's last game against everton but sustained a calf injury . manuel pellegrini won premier league manager of the month for december after winning five of six matches . pellegrini rejected suggestions that the signing of swansea striker wilfried bony in a # 15million deal this week will signal the end of stevan jovetic 's city career . the montenegro star has been linked with a return to italy with juventus just 18 months after joining city , but pellegrini insists that bony has been signed as a replacement for alvaro negredo , who joined valencia on loan in the summer . ` stevan is a very important player for us , ' he added . ` bony arrives now in the window . it was a decision we took after we sold alvaro negredo , and he is replacing negredo . we sold him because he had personal problems and did not want to continue here . bony is replacing alvaro , not jovetic . ` it was important to replace negredo . when we sold him we said we were going to have the decision in december after seeing these four months . we have too many injuries so it was important to have a fourth striker . after that , when you have the squad , it depends on the performance . ` i think that bony is similar to negredo . he is strong , he supports the ball so in the way we play it is important to have that support , so players can arrive from midfield in the second line . he is an important striker inside the box , same as alvaro , so i think he is more similar to him than edin -lrb- dzeko -rrb- or kun -lrb- aguero -rrb- or jovetic . ' jovetic and bacary sagna are among the candidates to drop out of city 's champions league squad to accommodate bony , but pellegrini would not be drawn on the issue . ` i do n't need to do it , ' he added . ` maybe in february we need to give the squad list for the champions league and we will see what happens in that moment and decide which is the player who will not be in the list . ' pellegrini insisted that yaya toure -lrb- left -rrb- is ' 100 % committed ' to manchester city . aguero returned on the bench against everton last weekend after a month out with a knee injury . pellegrini confirmed that the argentina striker is ` 100 per cent fit ' with fans looking forward to his duel with alexis sanchez who has been outstanding for arsenal since his arrival from barcelona in the summer . ` i think alexis is a very good player , and he is having a very good season in england , ' said pellegrini of his chilean compatriot . ` it is not easy for a player in his first season here to score so many goals . alexis is repeating what he did in the last two seasons at barcelona and scoring a lot of goals . ` i am very happy for him because he is a young player and very enthusiastic player and improving . but i do n't want to compare with sergio . ` it is not the first year from alexis here in europe . alexis has eight or nine years , when he was very young first in italy with udinese and then returned on loan to south america . he played really well in barcelona the last two years and now in england . the football fans in chile are very happy for him and for the country . ' pellegrini 's side picked up 16 points from a possible 18 in the month of december . city beat arsenal 6-3 in a thrilling game at the etihad last season when they were almost unstoppable in front of goal . pellegrini added : ` it is difficult to score six and three goals again but i think for fans it will be a very attractive game , ' he said . ` i hope we can score the same amount of goals and arsenal have more problems to score three goals . ` it is difficult to compare one season with another . last season we scored more . we have big scores here at etihad but it is not easy to repeat . we are always trying to do it , that is very important . ` this season there is more merit because in the last month we have no strikers and we continue scoring two or three goals every game we play . last season was more easy .
