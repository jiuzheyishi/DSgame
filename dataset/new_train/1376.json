{"text": "a mother died and her daughter injured when they were struck by a runaway van which rolled down a hill , a jury heard . mohammed karani had parked the ford transit connect van on swindon road , dewsbury while doing some electrical work at the madina academy . stephen wood , prosecuting , told leeds crown court that cctv footage showed him twice returning to the vehicle and removing tools . mohammed karani , 44 , denies causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving . but around 34 minutes after he was last seen at the van it was captured moving backwards slowly down the incline , gradually increasing speed until it disappeared from view . at the same time , out of view below simran ahmed , 46 , was crossing willans road with two children including her 10-year-old daughter kiran . ` what then unfolded was seen by a number of witnesses and you may think must have been traumatic to view , ' said mr wood . the van with no one inside picked up speed until it reached about 15mph , careering across the road and crushing mrs ahmed against a wall and seriously injuring kiran . mr wood told the jury one witness seeing the van remembered thinking to himself ` brake , brake ' as he saw what was happening but , of course , it did not . ` witnesses at the scene immediately thought the worst , ' said mr wood . ` sadly they were right . simran ahmed sustained catastrophic internal injuries from which she could not recover . her daughter suffered a fractured skull . ' people rushed to help and one man pushed the van off the pavement where it had come to rest trapping the pedestrians , others gave first aid until the ambulance and paramedics arrived . no one entered the van which was locked . while the police were there karani came down the hill and went to unlock it but was moved away and the keys were taken from him . the van was examined by investigator john green and no mechanical defect was found . he noticed the gear stick was in neutral and the parking brake was only partially applied on two notches out of a possible six . mohammed karani parked his van here on swindon road , dewsbury while doing some electrical work at the madina academy . the incline , the bottom of which was where mrs ahmed was walking when karani 's hit and killed her . tests showed when on four it was easily able to hold its position on the hill . mr green concluded the brake was not applied fully , the vehicle was left in neutral rather than forward gear and , had the full steering wheel lock engaged , the wheels would have been at an angle that would have stopped the vehicle going backwards in a straight line . mrs ahmed died here -lrb- white wall -rrb- when she was hit by a ford transit van . karani , 44 , denies causing the death of mrs ahmed by careless or inconsiderate driving on april 26 last year . mr wood told the jury it was the crown 's case it was still careless driving even if karani was not behind the wheel at the time if it was ` careless in the way he left the vehicle ' . he said that meant assessing how the notional competent and careful driver would have parked on a road with this degree of incline . ` when mr karani got out of the vehicle he must have appreciated just how steep this road was . ' ` the standard of the competent and careful driver is set by the highway code , ' mr wood added . simran ahmed , 46 , was walking two of her children home from school when she was hit and killed by a van that rolled down the incline . locals have placed flowers at the scene in willans road , dewsbury , west yorkshire where shabana ahmed was killed and her daughter seriously injured when they were hit by a ford transit connect van . when karani was interviewed he confirmed parking the van and said he was inside the college when someone shouted it was at the bottom of the hill . asked if he left it in gear he said he did not remember , but usually did . mr wood told the jury it was the prosecution case he had not left the brake on fully , had left the gear in neutral and had not turned his wheel lock on fully . ` the inescapable conclusion is that had mr karani taken these precautions then this tragic collision would not have occurred , ' mr wood added . he urged the jury to put aside any emotional response to the events . ` such feelings are entirely understandable , ' he said . ` it is entirely human and humane response to such a tragedy . ` but such feelings or emotions have no part to play in your deliberations over the guilt or innocence of mr karani .
