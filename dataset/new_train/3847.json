{"text": "a fisheries department in australia is refusing to pay a $ 188,000 bill for removing a whale carcass from a popular beach because ` whales are mammals , not fish . ' while that is scientifically true , the local council in the city of stirling , west australia , insists that because the whale came from the sea , the state 's fisheries department has to pay for its removal . the 17 metre carcass washed ashore on scarborough beach on november 3 , leaving stirling city to arrange for special earthmoving equipment to lift the rotting body up and transport it by lorry to a waste facility where it was buried , the abc reported today . scroll down for video . over $ 188,000 was spent by the city of stirling to clean up a 17 metre whale carcass that washed ashore on scarborough beach . stirling 's mayor , giovanni italiano , said the equivalent of $ 188,000 was spent on the equipment hire , waste ground fees , cleaning the beach and paying for labour and security . ` i 've asked the premier of the state and the minister for fisheries to arrange for the state government to pick up the bill - but all we 've been offered is $ 8,000 for the waste fees and the cost of the contaminated sand , ' said mr italiano . ` the minister for fisheries ' office said they are not going to foot the bill because it 's a mammal , not a fish . they believe it 's not in their jurisdiction . ' mr italiano told the abc that that the state government should have arranged to tow the dead whale out to sea before it was washed onto the beach . the local council in west australia has claimed that the state 's fisheries department has to pay the bill . ` we 're not going to pay this and the ratepayers are not going to pay it . ` we pay the government $ 26.3 million for fire and emergencies services levies and this was an emergency . ' he insisted that if another whale carcass was washed onto the beach , his council would not handle the clean-up . meanwhile a spokeswoman for the minister for fisheries said the fish resources management act of 1994 ` does not envisage the department of fisheries managing whales , whether they are alive or dead . ' however the minister for the fisheries ' office said the carcass was ` not in their jurisdiction ' due to being a mammal , not a fish . whales are classified as mammals because , unlike fish , they are warm-blooded and breath air with lungs , taking in oxygen directly when they come to the surface at regular intervals . when they surface , they exhale the air they have previously breathed in , puffing it out through ` nostrils ' known as blowholes . they give birth to live young and suckle the new-born on milk secreted by mammary glands . in addition , they have hair , or rather bristles , usually on their heads . science has taught us that whales , along with dolphins , seals and walruses left the land some 55 million years ago and went into the water , where they evolved into today 's creatures . it was the same whale that made worldwide news when australian man harrison williams , from perth , climbed on top of it . ` it was definitely a stupid act but i did n't mean any disrespect to anyone . mum thinks i 'm an idiot , and dad is n't too proud either , ' mr williams said . the whale in question is the same one that harrison williams , from quinns rocks near perth , climbed on top of after he jumped off a boat on saturday afternoon . he became stranded when sharks started to circle the dead whale . ` he -lsb- the shark -rsb- was too busy chomping on the whale so it was n't too bad , ' he said . the extreme sports enthusiast added his parents were not impressed with his brush with the whale . ` i 've done it , i do n't need to do it again , ' he said . ` it was definitely a stupid act but i did n't mean any disrespect to anyone . mum thinks i 'm an idiot , and dad is n't too proud either .
