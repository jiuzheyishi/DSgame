{"text": "facebook has hiked up the size of its initial public offering by almost 25 per cent , making the social media site worth an estimated $ 104billion . with that estimate , facebook becomes more valuable than brands that have been cemented in america 's culture for decades -- including kraft , mcdonald 's , and even disney . a single share for the eight-year old company is expected to open at $ 38 , helping disprove naysayers ' warnings of the site 's long-term potential , even as general motors pulled their advertisements . reason to smile : facebook , created by mark zuckerberg some eight years ago , has hiked up the size of its initial public offering by almost 25 per cent . not lovin ' it : facebook could surpass other global brands like mcdonald 's , left , and disney , right . the u.s. automaker confirmed a report by the wall street journal today . gm 's marketing executives decided facebook 's ads had little impact on consumers . gm said it will still have facebook pages marketing its vehicles , but it will drop use of paid ads . anyone can create a facebook page at no cost . it is crucial for facebook 's future that the rest of the auto industry continues to buy adverts on the site . the journal notes that it spends the most advertising dollars in the u.s. - last year alone , the industry spent $ 13.89 billion on advertisements . ` we regularly review our overall media spend and make adjustments as needed ... it 's not unusual for us to move our spending around various media outlets - especially with the growth of multiple social and digital media outlets , ' gm said in a statement . gm spends about $ 40 million on its facebook presence , but only about $ 10 million of that is paid to facebook for advertising . the rest covers the creation of content and the agencies involved , the journal said . facebook , the company founded eight years ago by mark zuckerberg in a harvard dorm room , said on wednesday it will add about 84 million shares to its ipo , floating about 421 million shares in an offering expected to be priced on thursday . out : gm said that facebook ads do n't pay off and withdrew their advertising ahead of the social media company 's ipo . facebook fever : facebook says 25 per cent more shares will be sold as investors clamor for a piece of the year 's hottest stock offering on nasdaq . invested : an investor holds literature explaining the facebook stock after attending a show for facebook inc 's ipo earlier this month . the additional shares will be sold by early investors including paypal co-founder peter thiel , accel partners ' james breyer and investment manager tiger global management , the company said in a filing . the company itself has not increased the number of shares it will sell . zuckerberg 's voting power will be reduced to about 55.8 per cent from about 57.3 per cent after the ipo as a result of the issue of additional shares , the company said . the expanded size , coupled with facebook 's recently announced plans to raise the ipo price range , would make facebook the third-largest initial share sale in u.s. history after visa inc and general motors . the social networking company is drumming up massive demand for the offering even as slowing revenue and user growth spur questions about the long-term facebook story . those concerns over revenue growth were underscored on tuesday , when gm said it planned to pull out of advertising on facebook . business as usual : workers continue their daily tasks at the facebook office in menlo park , california ahead of the ipo . thanks : facebook released a picture of some staff thanking users for their support ahead of its $ 5billion initial public offering . but some users do n't think that is enough thanks and they want a cut of the money . ` this is much more a spectacle , a media event and a cultural moment than it is an ipo , ' said max wolff , an analyst at greencrest capital . ` this is not a game of models and fundamentals at this point . ' gm 's announcement , while ill-timed for facebook , should not seriously hurt the ipo 's reception for now as it may not be representative of advertisers ' overall attitude , said brian wieser , an analyst with pivotal research group . among the soon-to-be facebook millionaires and billionaires is graffiti artist david choe , who was commissioned to paint murals in the palo alto facebook office . rather than receive payment , he chose to receive shares of the company 's stock . he stands to earn around $ 200million . likewise , bono , the front man of u2 and activist could earn up to $ 1.5 billion . in february , business insider estimated that facebook coo sheryl sandberg , who is the company 's highest-paid employee , could earn as much as $ 1.25 billion . the housing market in silicon valley is booming as well , as it anticipates a whole new level of affluent young workers hoping to snatch up a luxurious home . ` the demand for the ipo probably wo n't be affected materially by this , ' he said , adding , however , there were probably a lot of calls between underwriters and investors following gm 's announcement . the ipo , silicon valley 's largest , eclipses the roughly $ 2 billion debut by google inc in 2004 . the price range hike , coupled with strong results from internet and social media players groupon and china 's renren inc , contributed to a dotcom rally on wall street on tuesday . shares of pandora media inc rose 10.3 per cent , zynga inc was up 7.7 per cent , groupon climbed 3.7 per cent and renren gained 6.4 per cent , reuters reported . before the ipo size was increased , facebook would have raised about $ 12.1 billion based on the midpoint price of $ 36 and the 337.4 million shares on offer originally . at this midpoint , facebook would be valued at roughly 27 times its 2011 revenue , or 99 times earnings . google went public at a valuation of $ 23 billion , or 16 times its trailing revenue and 218 times earnings . apple inc went public in 1980 at a valuation of 25 times its revenue and 102 times earnings . facebook 's ipo comes as some investors worry the company has not yet figured out a way to make money from a growing number of users who access the social network on mobile devices such as smartphones . meanwhile , revenue growth from facebook 's online advertising business , which accounts for the bulk of its revenue , has slowed in recent months . with some 900 million users , it had $ 1 billion in net income on revenue of $ 3.7 billion in 2011 . the company has also extended the time frame for its $ 1 billion acquisition of mobile app maker instagram , projecting the deal would close this year instead of the second quarter as it previously indicated . it provided no reasons , though a source familiar with the matter told reuters last week that the u.s. federal trade commission has reached out to google and twitter as part of the agency 's standard review for deals of that size . facebook is scheduled to begin trading on the nasdaq on friday . a host of wall street banks are underwriting the offering , with morgan stanley , jpmorgan and goldman sachs serving as leads . mark zuckerberg . age : 28net
