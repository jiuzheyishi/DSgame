{"text": "london , england who are the greatest feminist film characters ? buffy the vampire slayer ? g.i. jane ? catwoman ? what about an astrophysicist ? if it was up to academy award-winning actor natalie portman , our feminine heroines would n't be limited to ass-kicking wonder women . they could even be -- wait for it -- nerdy scientists . the 32-year-old star of hollywood blockbuster  thor : the dark world ,  hopes her role as astrophysicist love interest jane foster will encourage a new generation of young women to enter the sciences -- much like  star wars '  princess leia is believed to have done over three decades ago . watch : marvel and portman make science cool .  it 's really cool that marvel -- the comic company behind the thor series -- is working on what they call stem : science , technology , engineering and math ,  portman told cnn in an interview in london , ahead of the premiere this week .  women are underrepresented in those fields so they are trying to encourage girls to study them more , because obviously there 's no reason why they should n't be .   and that 's really exciting because that 's exactly what you want with these kinds of movies . they 're big and they 're fun and if you can have a little bit of impact on a young girl seeing them and saying ` wait , that 's possible too , ' then that would be really cool .  while the original  thor  comic book portrayed the superhero 's sweetheart , jane foster , as a nurse , the character has been reinvented as a scientist for the big screen . could portman become the new role model for female scientists , much like jodie foster as astrophysicist ellie arroway in 1997 film  contact  , or sigourney weaver as zoologist dian fossey in 1988 drama  gorillas in the mist  , or even sci-fi hero carrie fisher as princess leia in the  star wars  series ? she certainly hopes so . for portman , feminist characters are n't necessarily the ones who keep up with the boys -- they come in all shapes and sizes .  the fallacy in hollywood is that if you 're making a ` feminist ' story , the woman kicks ass and wins ,  she told elle uk in the magazine 's november 2013 issue .  that 's not feminist , that 's macho . a movie about a weak , vulnerable woman can be feminist if it shows a real person that we can empathize with .  featuring australian actor chris hemsworth as thor , the crown prince of asgard , the second installment of the film tells the story of an otherworldly superhero who has been exiled from his homeland to earth .  at the beginning of thor 2 , jane foster is really focused on her scientific inquiries . thor has been missing in action for a couple years , has n't called , has n't written ,  explains portman .  she 's seen him on tv in new york and he has n't made contact so she 's pretty angry at him . but she 's just trying to move on with her life and that 's where we find her ,  added the mother-of-one , who reportedly watched  physics for dummies  , to prepare for the role . french feeling . born in jerusalem , the only child of her american film agent mother and israeli fertility specialist father , portman moved to the u.s. at three years old , eventually settling in new york . as a youngster she attended theater camp and entered science fairs , until at age 11 she scored her big break as a gun-toting orphan in english-speaking french film  leon : the professional  . decades before chloe moretz appeared as a 13-year-old hitgirl in 2010 action film  kick-ass  , portman was targeting her own bad guys in the 1994 thriller which launched her career . almost 20 years later , portman , who won an academy award in 2011 for her portrayal of a disturbed ballerina in darren aronofsky film  black swan  , may again be returning to french cinema . it was on the  black swan  set that she undertook a year of training with future husband , french dancer and choreographer benjamin millepied . the pair now have a two-year-old son , aleph .  well i hope i 'll be able to work in french cinema , that will depend on what people will hire me for ,  said the actor who speaks french , hebrew , and german .  i think i 'd probably need to work on my french a little , but i 'd be happy to try . a little jean seberg kind of accented french ,  she added , referring to the 1960s american-born screen siren . women in cinema . portman , who in 2008 served as the youngest member of the 61st annual cannes film festival jury , added that she would like to see more female filmmakers and pointed to directors sarah polley , lena dunham and sofia coppola as inspirations .  you still really see that the majority of american filmmakers and writers are predominantly male . which is great , i want men to keep making movies , but i 'd love for there to be more female voices as well . and of course it influences the kind of material you read because the stories that a male perspective has , the way women figure into it , is very different ,  she said .  you get a lot of girlfriends and muses and shrews . and every once in a while there 's a magic moment where there 's a really interesting perspective . my hope would be that they widen the access to women , and women are more inspired and encouraged to take on those kinds of roles .  portman , who has a degree in psychology from harvard university , also pointed to the defined gender roles on set :  you do n't see female directors of photography , you do n't see female technical crew members . usually they 're more on the hair and makeup , and wardrobe side .  and it 's more common to have all of the grips and gaffers and electric and camera , to be entirely male , which is just interesting .  if portman has her way though , there wo n't just be more females on film sets -- but in science laboratories as well .", "summary": " natalie portman says new role in ` thor : the dark world ' could encourage female scientists .   academy award winner and mother-of-one may turn to french cinema .   israeli-born american wants more female directors , fan of lena dunham , sofia coppola .
