{"text": "washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- bernie sanders is well aware that if he runs for president in 2016 -- a decision he says he will announce by march -- he will face a monumental challenge . he is n't a registered democrat , but would be vying for the party 's presidential nomination . he does n't have much name recognition , but would be likely going up against the uber-recognizable hillary clinton . and as of late , it does n't even seem like he has the support of his base . liberal group moveon.org ready to kick-off $ 1 million campaign . in the last few months , the liberal activists inside the democratic party have been organizing around the possibility of a long-shot presidential run by sen. elizabeth warren of massachusetts , not sanders ' seemingly more likely run . liberal groups have been pining for a warren run for months and on tuesday , a coalition of groups announced they would kick off their efforts in new hampshire with a rally and plans to open local offices . this comes despite the fact warren bluntly said  no  when asked if she was running in 2016 . sanders ' hope , although he is somewhat loathe to admit it , is that he will someday get that same support .  obviously one would hope one would have as much support as possible from all walks of life ,  he said on tuesday when asked why he thinks those groups are n't rallying around him .  i am a great fan of elizabeth and as for what people do and why they do n't do it , i am not going to speculate .  ben wikler , the washington director of move on , said that although moveon members have  enormous respect for bernie sanders ,  it is warren who is  on fire .  with a new knee , webb 's still considering 2016 plans .  sen. warren is perfectly in tune with this moment in history and her message , which has been a consistent , singularly focused message ... resonates with an almost electric energy ,  wikler said . a source at moveon , however , was more blunt in their assessment of why warren over sanders .  you can see when the needle breaks the gauge ,  the source said .  it happens with warren . it happens with warren in a way that it does n't happen with anyone else right now .  this is a problem for sanders : the people he could once rely on -- liberal organizers -- have found someone else to support .  if we ca n't do that ,  sanders said on invigorating the grassroots to get around him ,  then i am not going to -lsb- run -rsb- .  campaign should focus on issues , not personality . sanders is the most serious progressive candidate actively entertaining a run at the presidency in 2016 . he has taken a number of trips to iowa and new hampshire , two presidential mainstays , and regularly speaks at liberal conferences across the country . on tuesday , in an editorial board meeting with cnn , he reiterated that he was strongly considering a run as either a democrat or a independent . but that is about all he was interested in talking about regarding 2016 . torture report splits 2016 democrats .  ten minutes into this discussion and no one has asked me about any of the major issues facing this country ,  sanders said after a group of cnn producers and reporters peppered him with questions about the race , hillary clinton and his prospects for running .  -lsb- i have -rsb- no intention of taking on hillary clinton , that is not the issue , that is the wrong question ,  he said .  i am not taking on hillary clinton . i am taking on the issues .  to sanders , elections should be more simplified . candidates outline where they stand on complex issues , devoid of personality politics and poll questions about who americans would rather have a beer with . a number of times in the hour , sanders -- a senator who has come to be known as much for his fly-away hair as his passionate speeches in the senate -- bluntly lamented the way political journalism in the united states focuses on personality as it does .  i think this is not about personality ,  sanders said , raising his vermonter-by-way-of-new york voice .  i am not a singer , i am not a dancer , i am not an entertainer .  these 2016 long-shots think they can win ? sanders would rather have voters know his policies , than his favorite vacation destination or his childhood icons . in sander 's view , it was personality -- not policy -- that elected former president george w. bush , someone the independent says was a  very nice guy ... but the worst president this country has had .   i think the media , and i have to throw this back at you guys , makes it too easy to cover my grandchildren ,  he said .  or mitt romney 's dog riding on the top of his car . very interesting , but it is not important .
