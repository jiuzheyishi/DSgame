{"text": "a teenage cat owner has been devastated to find her beloved pet brutally murdered , hanging from a tree with one eye missing . to make matters worse , it 's believed 19-year old amelia -lrb- who wishes not to share her surname -rrb- , from morayfield in queensland 's moreton bay region , was taunted by the cat killer , who placed tufts off the cat 's fur around amelia 's house every day as amelia searched for her pet . the rspca believe the adored cat , zeus , was bludgeoned to death with a hammer . it all began when the morayfield resident made a creepy discovery when her pet was peculiarly found with a shaved back . amelia was distraught when her cat , zeus , was found hanging from a tree with his eye missing . amelia and her partner mark had owned zeus since he was six-week-old and adored the feline , who she describes as ` happy and playful ' it was just a day after amelia 's sister-in-law 's cat theo also turned up mysteriously shaved in their home . ` we laughed it off when theo turned up shaved and joked that our cat , zeus would be next , ' amelia told daily mail australia . amelia told daily mail that a man across the street 's cat has also been found with its fur shaved . the next day , amelia , her partner mark and her partner 's sister lisa came home to find zeus was gone . tufts of fur were found in the house in mysterious locations everyday for the five days zeus was missing . the day before zeus went missing , he mysteriously turned up in the family home with his back shaved . ` it was out of character for zeus to be missing , ' amelia said . ` we saw him before we went out one night but came back and he was gone . ' a day after zeus went missing , lisa found a clump of her cat 's fur , which appeared to be carefully placed in their house . ` while my partner 's sister was cooking dinner , she found a clump of zeus ' fur in the window . ' ` it definitely had n't been there before . it just appeared . ' everyday another large clump of ginger fur was found in a different ominous place , and the family immediately knew something was wrong . the family found tufts of zeus ' fur around the home , which they believe were placed by the person who took zeus before he was killed . on the second day , lisa came out to the sinister sight of cat fur placed in her car 's windscreen wipers . three days after zeus disappeared , fur was found on a toilet paper roll , which was directly under an open window -- but there was still no sight of zeus . the next day , fur is believed to have been placed whilst amelia was in the house . fur was found on the home phone , which had not been there when the phone was used moments before . ` we think someone jumped the fence and came through the backyard , ' amelia told daily mail australia . ` myself and lisa were both in tears when it happened . we did n't understand how someone could be so disgusting to bring in our cat 's fur while he was missing . ' the rspca conducted an autopsy on the cat , in the hope of finding out more about the killer . they put up posters of zeus , desperate to bring their ` friendly , playful ' cat back home . ` one day , we did n't find any fur at all and i was kind of glad . but then i got a call , ' explains amelia . ` i received a call from someone saying they 'd found a cat matching zeus ' description . ` i was excited and asked where he was located . ' amelia 's worst fears were realised . ` the person told me that zeus was up a tree , but he is deceased . ' the rspca believe amelia 's beloved cat zeus was bludgeoned to death with a hammer . amelia 's boyfriend mark immediately knew something was drastically wrong when he saw her face . mark ran out of the house first , with lisa and amelia behind me , to find out if the awful news was true . ` i was last to get there but the first thing i saw my partner 's sister crying and i knew it was true . ` i saw my cat , basically hanging in the tree and he was missing an eye . ` it was a massive shock , i could n't stop crying . my partner told me to go home . ' the cat was high up in the tree and had to be cut out . zeus was buried by the family , and to their horror they found another tuft of ginger hair placed in their house the next day . the family is devastated and have locked up their home , terrified more harm will come to their other pets . ` we were kind of worried that if the person watched us bury him , that they might dig him back up . ' the rspca conducted an autopsy on the cat and are waiting on more results , having sent more samples to america , according to amelia . rspca spokesman michael beatty says the incident is disturbing , particularly the ` game ' that tauned the cat owners , and confirmed the cat was killed from a strike to the head . the rspca is looking for more information about who conducted the heinous killing .  they could face charges of animal cruelty , whether or not they would be in the extreme end , probably not , depending on the circumstances , ' mr beatty told courier mail . two other cats in the street have also been found shaved , which happened to zeus before he disappeared . cat owners in the street have been advised to keep their animals in doors . ` we should n't have to keep our cats inside but you kind of have to , ' amelia said . ` we also have two dogs and they are stuck inside now . we 've locked the back door . ' amelia says she also feels like her own safety and wellbeing in compromised . ` everytime we hear something in the middle of the night , we get scared . ' ` it was heartbreaking to see him hanging from that tree . ' amelia and her family are having trouble sleeping and feel their own safety is compromised .", "summary": " adored cat zeus was found dead in a tree , hanging with an eye missing .   19-year-old owner amelia was taunted for five days after he went missing .   day before zeus disappeared , he turned up peculiarly partially shaved .   two other cats on the street in morayfield , queensland have also been found partially shaved .   everyday after pet disappeared , fur was ` placed ' inside amelia 's home .   it 's believed zeus was bludgeoned to death with a hammer before he was found hanging from a tree .
