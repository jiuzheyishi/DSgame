{"text": "the new york city medical examiner 's office friday confirmed what demonstrators had been saying for weeks : a police officer 's choke hold on a man being arrested for selling loose cigarettes killed him . eric garner , 43 , died july 17 after being confronted by police on staten island for allegedly selling cigarettes illegally . during the encounter , garner raised both hands in the air and told the officers not to touch him . seconds later , a video shows an officer behind him grab the 350-pound man in a choke hold and pull him to the sidewalk , rolling him onto his stomach .  i ca n't breathe ! i ca n't breathe !  garner said repeatedly , his cries muffled into the pavement . the cause of garner 's death was  compression of neck -lrb- choke hold -rrb- , compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police ,  said julie bolcer , a spokeswoman for the medical examiner 's office . the death was ruled a homicide . acute and chronic bronchial asthma , obesity and hypertensive cardiovascular disease were listed as contributing conditions in a controversial death that sparked anti-police demonstrations and calls for a federal investigation . on saturday , garner 's widow , esaw , appeared at a harlem rally with the victim 's mother , gwen carr , and the rev. al sharpton .  first of all , i want to thank the god above for giving us justice for my husband so that we can move forward ,  she said .  i met with the prosecutors and i feel like i did the right thing by doing that and i just want them to do the right thing and get me justice for my husband .  sharpton is planning a march across the verrazano-narrows bridge , which connects brooklyn and staten island , for august 23 . douglas auer , a spokesman for the richmond county district attorney 's office , said the investigation into the death was continuing .  we await the issuance of the official death certificate and the autopsy report ,  he said in a statement . the u.s. justice department has said it is monitoring the investigation . if local prosecutors decline to file criminal charges , the federal justice department could conduct an investigation into whether the victim 's civil rights were violated .  the district attorney will be examining the case to determine if the use of the choke hold was necessary to subdue and arrest garner , or was an excessive use of force resulting in death ,  cnn legal analyst paul callan said . a former deputy chief of homicide for the brooklyn district attorney 's office , callan said a choke hold does not violate state law but is prohibited by nypd guidelines on excessive force . mayor bill de blasio friday expressed his  deepest sympathies  to garner 's family .  my administration will continue to work with all involved authorities , including the richmond county district attorney , to ensure a fair and justified outcome ,  he said in a statement .  we all have a responsibility to work together to heal the wounds from decades of mistrust and create a culture where the police department and the communities they protect respect each other ... i 've said that we would make change , and we will . as mayor , i remain absolutely committed to ensuring that the proper reforms are enacted to ensure that this wo n't happen again . the video of the incident showed the staten island man lying on the ground motionless after he was taken down by a group of officers . an asthmatic , garner was later declared dead at a nearby hospital . police said he suffered a heart attack and died on the way to the hospital .  this is a terrible tragedy that occurred . ... a terrible tragedy that no family should have to experience ,  de blasio said after the death , calling the video of the incident  very troubling .  garner , a grandfather with six children , had a lengthy criminal history , including more than 30 arrests , and had been previously arrested for selling untaxed cigarettes in may , according to police . but demonstrators in new york called the police response during his arrest excessive and criminal . on july 19 , garner 's friends and family rallied with sharpton in harlem , demanding a full investigation into garner 's death . officer daniel pantaleo , who is seen on the video choking garner , was put on modified assignment and stripped of his badge and gun amid the investigation , the new york police department said . a second police officer was placed on desk duty . the choke hold tactic is prohibited by the nypd . two emts and two paramedics also were suspended without pay , according to erika hellstrom , vice president of development at richmond university medical center . in a statement , patrolmen 's benevolent association president patrick j. lynch called pantaleo 's reassignment  a completely unwarranted , kneejerk reaction for political reasons .  he said the move  effectively pre-judges this case and denies the officer the very benefit of a doubt that has long been part of the social contract that allows police officers to face the risks of this difficult and complex job .  on friday , the police union expressed  sympathies and prayers  for the garner family and said it stood  firmly in support of all police officers  put in difficult circumstances .  police officers do n't start their days expecting or wanting something like this to occur in the performance of their duties ,  pba president patrick lynch said in a statement .  the me 's report indicates that mr. garner was a man with serious health problems so there will have to be a complete and thorough analysis of all the factors that played a part in this tragedy . we believe , however , that if he had not resisted the lawful order of the police officers placing him under arrest , this tragedy would not have occurred .  police commissioner william bratton ordered an extensive review of the nypd 's training procedures after garner 's death . after a two-hour meeting with nypd training commissioner ben tucker last week , bratton ordered a  top to bottom review of all the training that this department provides to its personnel , specifically focusing on force , how do we train our officers for a takedown , how do we train them to use the various levels of force that they 're authorized to use .   i would anticipate that coming out of this effort that there will be a retraining of every member of the new york city police department in the weeks , months and potential years ahead ,  bratton said . what led to choke
