' residents claimed some english defence league supporters were involved in organising vigilante patrols of young white men under the name enfield defence league on tuesday night . they split into three 30-strong groups in contact by mobile telephone and blackberry to patrol the streets . underlining police concerns , the edl said yesterday : ` supporters have taken to the streets to help defend their communities and prepare for the clean-up operations that must follow the last few days of rioting and looting . ` we already have members organising themselves in london , manchester , liverpool , norwich and birmingham , and are also looking to organise efforts in bristol , leeds , wolverhampton , salford , nottingham , leicester and hull . ' drain on resources : police officers detain a man in eltham , south london , on tuesday night , where members of the edl had gathered to act as anti-riot ` vigilantes ' mobs : a police van is patrols the streets in eltham , south-east london , as vigilantes mill around waiting for looters to appear . hundreds of police officers descended on a london suburb last night to disperse about 60 men who claimed to be protecting shops and businesses there for a second night . the men , apparently supporters of the extreme-right english defence league , gathered in a pedestrianised square in eltham drinking cans of beer and chanting ` we love you england ' . with shops and pubs in the high street shut , the group -- white men aged in their 20s to 50s -- brought carrier bags with beer in them and drank and sat on benches . but around 300 police officers flooded the high street , surrounding the group . around 8.30 pm , the order was given to disperse the group of edl supporters -- and youths who had arrived to see what was going on . officers moved in to shepherd the group away from the square , known as passey place , and out of the town down eltham hill . it was reported that some bottles were thrown at the police . the presence of the edl in eltham has been condemned by local politicians . eltham mp clive efford , a shadow home office spokesman said : ` the english defence league just want to put a sinister racial twist on this . ` all these police resources for what ? to deal with the english defence league ? that 's appalling . these police officers could be used elsewhere , protecting communities across london , but they have got to be in here to deal with these drunken yobs who have decided to come to eltham and cause racial tension . ' on tuesday night around 50 members of the group joined with 150 to 200 locals to protect eltham from looters they claimed were expected to try to attack the area . they tried to march towards lewisham -- hit by rioting on monday night -- but were pushed back towards eltham by police and dispersed around 11.30 pm . there were no arrests and no reports of damage . speaking as he toured enfield . yesterday , mr godwin said : ' i am worried that there are groups out there . like the edl and bnp who are trying to hijack this and cause more . tensions in the community . they are politically motivated groups who . have another agenda . ' he . added : ' i have not got a problem with community groups protecting their . property or places of worship , which was n't needed in the end . ' but . he warned : ` the police will arrest anyone committing a criminal act , . whether they are looting or vigilantes breaking the law . ' the met 's deputy assistant commissioner steve kavanagh echoed those warnings yesterday , saying : ` what i do n't need is these so-called vigilantes , who appeared to have been drinking too much , taking policing resources away from what they should have been doing -- which is preventing the looting . ' he spoke out after hundreds of residents in several london areas joined together to drive off would-be looters . some groups had armed themselves with lengths of pipe and baseball bats , while some shopkeepers had knives in their stores , claiming that police were ` nowhere to be seen ' and had ` failed ' them during the first three days of violence . sikh men armed with hockey sticks and metal bars were on guard yesterday in both west london and west bromwich and stressed they were there with the ` full knowledge ' of police . yesterday , the edl said : ` we are hoping to safeguard local businesses through a strong physical presence , and discourage trouble-makers from gathering in our town and city centres . ` the edl , and all decent people , be they black , white , christian , sikh , jewish or muslim , are sickened by this mindless , selfish and ultimately self-defeating behaviour . ' but searchlight , the anti-fascist organisation , expressed deep concern last night at the edl involvement , saying : ` the news that the edl is promising to come out on the streets to defend our communities from rioters should be met with the derision and contempt it deserves . ` the edl is the last thing our communities need .
