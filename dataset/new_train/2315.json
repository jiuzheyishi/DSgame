{"text": "chengdu , china the researcher dressed in blue plastic smock , slippers and gloves is having a tough time getting his work done . every time zhang zhen sets up his camera on a tripod in an effort to document the behavior of one of the panda cubs scattered on a grassy hillside , one particularly frisky baby panda comes wobbling towards him , interrupting his shoot .  mumu !  he yells in frustration , as the four-month old cub rears up on her hind legs , lunging towards him . he picks mumu up and deposits her at the opposite end of the enclosure .  i 'm not sure why she 's been all over me like this . i think she 's excited today ,  zhang says . mumu is the oldest of fourteen baby pandas that were born last summer here at the research base of giant panda breeding in chengdu , china . china 's panda experts have improved the science of breeding and raising members of this endangered species in captivity . the proof of their success is in the baby panda enclosure , where visitors can watch as the newest generation of pandas takes turns napping , playing and exploring their outdoor habitat . the fuzzy young cubs are still shaky on their feet , and often trip and roll down the enclosure 's slight incline . while two cubs wrestle , another tries to climb a tree and then tumbles onto its back , slowly performing a backwards somersault , much to the amusement of onlookers . giant panda tian tian likely miscarried .  there are new breakthroughs , so that 's why the panda population has continued to increase ,  said deng tao , the chief zoo keeper at the chengdu base . when deng first began working at the base 12 years ago , he said there were only 20 pandas here . today , the center is responsible for more than 100 animals . deng recently returned from the atlanta zoo , where he spent months assisting with the birth and care of twin cubs who were born there last july .  now we have new technologies that can very accurately identify when a panda is ovulating and do artificial insemination during a precise point in the -lsb- reproductive -rsb- cycle ,  deng explained . on its website , the atlanta zoo credited deng and his colleagues in chengdu with developing a technique using incubators and taking turns rotating twin cubs with the mother to better ensure the newborns ' chance of survival .  before when a panda had twins , the mother panda could only take care of one cub so we have resolved the issue of having twin pandas and helping them to integrate ,  deng said . the next big challenge facing china 's panda keepers involves reintroducing captive animals back to the wild .  we have made a training base to return pandas to the wild ,  deng explained .  once they are mature and able to forage for food and hide from danger , then we will release some pandas .  national zoo 's panda cub is healthy , officials say . wildlife conservation groups say china 's effort to save the giant panda from extinction is a rare success story . according to the world wildlife fund , as of 1988 there were only around 1,000 pandas left living in the wild . in 2004 , that number was estimated to have grown to 1,600 wild pandas . more recent panda census statistics are not yet available .  the government put the resources -lsb- into conservation -rsb- . they 've actually set up some mountains just as a habitat for the panda ,  said may mei , the chief representative in china for the conservation group wildaid . china has lavished resources on the conservation of the giant panda - rather than on some other indigenous endangered species - in large part because the animal is such an important national symbol .  they are a treasure for people in china ,  mei said . the breeding center in chengdu is also something of a panda theme park . excerpts from the animated dreamworks film  kung fu panda  play on a giant screen at the entrance to the facility , which receives more than a million visitors a year . inside , tourists travel in panda mobiles , decorated with the cartoon movie 's main character , po the panda . in addition to stuffed animal pandas , souvenir shops offer a variety of hats , ear muffs , and even fuzzy nunchucks decorated with the panda 's distinctive black-and-white panda patterns . visitors walk along paths , gazing and taking photos of pandas in large outdoor pens . the animals seem to completely ignore humans . in one pen , a 25-year-old male named shi-shi lies on his back , gorging himself on bamboo which he holds in his front paw with the help of what trainers call the panda 's  pseudo-thumb .  other adults seem to spend much of their time fast asleep in their enclosures . but the big lumbering animals clearly have charisma .  they 're cute man !  says chris delbene , a 21-year-old university student from orego who is studying chinese in beijing .  they live a great lifestyle , play all day , eat , sleep .  what 's cuter than one baby panda ? panda twins ! cnn 's steven jiang contributed to this report .", "summary": " china 's panda experts improved breeding pandas in captivity .   12 years ago , chengdu zoo keeper had only 20 pandas , now center has more than 100 animals .   challenge is reintroducing captive pandas back into the wild .
