{"text": "fired : rachel brothers has been awarded compensation after being let go from her job with the black educators association in canada in 2006 . a biracial woman has won an $ 10,200 payout after she was fired from her job at the black educators association -lrb- bea -rrb- in nova scotia , canada because she ` was n't black enough ' . rachel brothers , was awarded the sum last week after donald murray , the chairman of the board of inquiry at the nova scotia human rights commission , ruled that she was discriminated against because of the color of her skin . according to a report published by the board , brothers was singled out by a subordinate at the association , catherine collier , who undermined her because ` she was younger than , and not as black , as ms collier thought ms , brothers should be . ' evidence was given to the board that claimed collier told brothers her biracial skin color was a ` barrier ' to black people and that she was ` too light skinned to ` officially represent them because she was n't black enough ' . another staff member at the bea told brothers she ` should go work for whitey ' . murray claimed that brothers was fired from her job in 2006 , after less than a year as a regional educator at the association 's annapolis valley regional office in kentville , because her decisions were viewed through the bea 's ` colorist thinking ' and behavior . according to the chronicle herald , colorist thinking occurs to ` someone who believes the closer a person 's skin tone comes to pure white , the better the chances of getting jobs , accommodations and other opportunities available to  actual ` white ' people . ' indeed , colorists also think the ` more visibly black , east indian , american indian or asian a person is , ` the greater the potential there will be for discriminatory distinctions to be made based on ` color , ' murray wrote . ruling : this is the headquarters of the black educators association in halifax , nova scotia - at which rachel brothers suffered discrimination . according to murray 's report , collier , who had applied for the same job as brothers , would make comments that made brothers job untenable at the bea . murray said that brothers was fired from her job because of work decisions the bea made in which skin color was paramount and ` the problems that her skin color had created in her office for another employee . ' the board also ruled that acting executive director of the bea was aware of ` colorist and ageist comments being made ' and did nothing to stop them . despite being dismissed in 2006 , it was n't until 2008 that brothers filed her complaint and it has taken six years for it to be heard . murray claimed in evidence collier obviously still hated brothers and displayed ' a continuing , petty vindictiveness towards ms. brothers ' that ` was , frankly , appalling . ' indeed , while executives from the bea said brothers was fired for financial irregularities , murray found no evidence . he believes she was fired because collier , who took brothers job , was better placed to work with the bea 's head office . the black educators association was founded in 1969 to help african nova scotian communities .", "summary": " rachel brothers fired in 2006 was awarded compensation eight years later .
