{"text": "bankers get a bad press . if they are not in news studios trying to defend their annual bonus being more than most people earn in a lifetime , they are attempting to brush off the latest multi-million pound fine they received for ripping off the public . not so in the latest edition of the global talk finance program . representatives from the banking sector talk enthusiastically about how they 've reformed their risky business practices and raised billions to fight against poverty and climate change . they herald the introduction of a  robin hood  tax , where speculators pay around a 0.1 % tax on their financial transactions , as a  triumph .  ok , so it may not strictly be real life . the news anchor is played by  walking dead  star andrew lincoln , he quizzes characters played by some of europe 's biggest stars -- bill nighy , clemence poesy , javier camara and heike makatsch who says the tax was  a profoundly important moment -- it 's been good for business and it 's brought billions for jobs in europe .  yet fiction is not so far away from reality . eleven european countries , including france , germany , italy and spain are signed up to a financial transaction tax which could raise up to 30 billion pounds annually and be implemented as early as next year . it is the best chance we have of ensuring those responsible for the crisis pay their fair share to put things right . unfortunately the uk is refusing to join in , even attempting to block the proposal with a groundless legal challenge in the european courts of justice . as bill nighy 's character demonstrates masterfully as he squirms out of questions over how the money could help stop cuts to public services , it means the uk will also lose out on the benefits . bill nighy has been involved with the  robin hood  tax campaign since its inception in 2010 . he came with us to see first-hand the impact of the financial crisis only a few miles away from its epicenter in the city of london . a food bank in the london borough of putney , where emergency food parcels are given out to those in the most dire need , had seen numbers increase 50 % in a year . there are now over 350 trussell trust food banks across the uk , at one point opening at the rate of one a week , as people struggle to make ends meet in a perfect storm of public service cuts and decreasing standards of living . yet the devastation wreaked by the crisis rippled out far beyond national borders . oxfam estimates it left a $ 65 billion dollar hole in the budgets of the world 's poorest countries -- the people least responsible for the crisis are paying the heaviest price . meanwhile back in the financial sectors of london and new york , bankers were cushioned from impacts of their own actions -- public money bailed them out and continues to subsidize them today . but it 's not just about ensuring banks give something back , it 's about refocusing our economy away from the fool 's gold of financial sector riches . financial products such as derivatives can be useful for the economy -- they allow a haulage company , for example , to buy a petroleum future , meaning their costs are predictable over time . but all sense of proportion has been lost , the market in derivatives is now a mind-boggling 70 times the size of global gdp . this frenetic swarm of speculative trades may earn a small cabal of the super-rich ever more money , but it brings with it huge risks and when things go wrong , as they did so spectacularly five years , ago billions can be wiped from the real economy . the low rate of the tax would help curb these speculative trades whilst avoiding impacting on people 's pensions and savings . as the film 's director david yates , best known for directing the final four films in the harry potter series , said :  i agreed to direct the film because the  robin hood  tax is a simple yet brilliant idea . we need to learn the lessons of the financial crisis and ensure that banks and hedge funds work in the interests of society not the other way around .  he 's not wrong . as france and germany are due to make an announcement on the tax and countries will agree the details in coming weeks . let 's hope they agree the best possible tax that raises the most money -- it will help create a financial sector we can all be proud of . read more : u.k. moves to block europe 's tobin tax . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of simon chouffot .", "summary": " eleven european countries , including france , germany , italy and spain are signed up to a financial transaction tax .   campaigner simon chouffot says ftt could help deal with the devastation wreaked by the financial crisis .   harry potter director david yates directs the campaign 's spot staring bill nighy and clemence poesy .
