{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- achong is struggling to push our longboat against the current of borneo 's batang ai river , so we jump into the water to help him .  stay in the boat ,  he pleads , but we ignore him . it 's dry season and every ounce of weight is a factor as the longboat 's hull scrapes the bottom of the shallow waterway . this is the only time we ignore achong . like other tattoo-covered iban tribesman , he 's a master boatman and this is his territory . the iban , once fearsome headhunters , are also expert trackers who have turned their talents to trailing one of the world 's most fascinating endangered creatures : orangutans . the ape pursuit takes us to sri aman division , a remote area of sarawak that nudges the border of kalimantan , the indonesian portion of borneo . borneo and neighboring sumatra island are the only places the shaggy-haired red ape survives . the chances of seeing them in the wild are increasingly slim .  there 's no guarantee ,  warns borneo adventure in its publicity blurb for the red ape trail , the safari that has brought us deep into the asian island 's dense , steamy jungle .  ape numbers are about 20,000 and constantly declining due to forestry , palm oil crops and poaching .  far more certain is searing heat , humidity of 80-100 % , slippery conditions and the possibility of leeches .  this walk demands a great deal of physical and mental exertion ,  says philip yong , borneo adventure 's co-founder .  the region is totally isolated from the outside world .  pampering base . fortunately there 's a soft option -- surprisingly , it involves a longhouse . longhouses are the large jungle huts that generations of iban and other dayak tribes have called home . usually built on stilts , they 're dark , communal living spaces often shared by several families . the hilton batang ai longhouse resort in the sarawak region of malaysia 's portion of borneo island takes its inspiration from traditional local homes , and translates this into luxury accommodation . seen from its jetty on the batang ai , a massive man-made reservoir in the sri aman region , the hilton-managed resort appears like any other longhouse in the area . built from large chunks of belian -lrb- ironwood -rrb- , it sits amid swirls of mist on the edges of the reservoir . a huddle of pastel pink and blue painted longboats are tethered to its moorings . this will be our pre-and-post-punishment pampering base . here we can cool off in a swimming pool -- safely out of leech reach -- and escape the melting humidity in air conditioned suites . the next morning , we head upriver . deep in the tropical forests , we get a taste of life among the local iban communities that have lived here , reputedly , since the 17th century . along the batang ai and its tributaries , colorful longhouse settlements unfurl like streamers on the riverbanks . rice paddies cloak surrounding hillsides in velvet green crops .  as shifting cultivators , they always built their homes near navigable rivers ,  says our guide , mashour .  they were designed to last as long as their exploitation of rice farming in the area , before they moved on to new pastures .  tattooed bodies . some traditional iban dwellings are big enough to house 20 families he adds . they 're about 200 feet long . most are old ramshackle structures . while some iban now live in new cement longhouses that have a generator-powered tv set or fridge , most stick to old customs . with one major exception . the iban 's name was once synonymous with headhunting -- tribes often saved the severed heads of their human victims as trophies . the tattoos swathing their bodies bragged of their triumphs . headhunting was largely extinguished by the british colonial regime in sarawak in the early 20th century . it made a brief comeback during world war ii when the heads of 1,500 occupying japanese forces were paranged with glee . -lrb- parangs are machetes , swords and other blades used across the malay archipelago . -rrb- . heads were mounted like trophies in iban homes . the iban have since lent their hunting skills to less grisly pursuits . in 2002 , iban trackers helped map out the red ape trail for borneo adventure . the trek got the backing of the uk 's orangutan foundation for its noteworthy conservation efforts . today , a safari with the iban offers one of the best chances of encountering the apes in their natural environment . fleeting glimpses . after traveling up the delok river to borneo adventure 's nanga sumpa lodge , we head out in search of orangutan . the red ape trail traces old iban hunting tracks -- used for hunting heads as well as animals . on the four-hour walk to genting tunu , we stop midway for lunch by the river . our guides , apau and nam , dip nimbly into the surrounding forest where , in contrast to their bloodthirsty ancestors , they use their parangs for chopping foraged bamboo shoots and edible ferns . nam stuffs bamboo logs with the jungle greens , chicken and rice and smokes them on a riverside fire . later , after an exhausting day of trekking through the jungle , we return to our base camp at the hilton longhouse . at the wood paneled nanga mepi restaurant , we 're not so far from authentic iban life . lapping up the lake nightlights , we eat local fish and sago puddings , more bamboo chicken and stir-fried jungle ferns . our encounters with the ape have been fleeting : glimpses of the world 's largest arboreal animal crashing through the trees in the distance . however , there were also opportunities for closeups at the nearby semenggoh wildlife center , where apes that have been injured or illegally kept as pets are looked after before being returned to the wild . we can hardly be disappointed . we 've sensed the presence of this amazing creature in one of its only surviving habitats . borneo adventure , 55 main bazaar , kuching , sarawak , malaysia ;
