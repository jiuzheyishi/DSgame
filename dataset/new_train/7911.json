{"text": "golfers have the best memories of all professional sports people , a psychologist has claimed . a combination of their visualisation techniques and the uniqueness of each shot they play contributes to their elephantine memories , said dr joel fish . each shot is filed away into the memory backs to be accessed for future reference when they are faced with a similar situation . luke donald tees off on the 16th tee during the fourth round of the us open at merion golf club . each shot is unique and golfers can remember them in astonishing detail , maintains a sports psychologist . ` golfers can remember significantly more , ' compared to athletes from other sports , dr fish , the director of the centre for sport psychology in philadelphia , told the new york times . golfers are helped to remember because each shot is unique , whether distance , approach , wind speed or slope . moreover , they get a long time to consider how to play the shot , unlike most other sports people who have to make an instant decision . his claims were backed up by golfers such as ernie els , with two british and two us open championships under his belt , who said : ` the majors , i really remember my wins . i really remember almost every shot . ' luke donald said there are things outside golf that he struggles to remember but that it is completely different with the sport when ` it does n't take me long to remember things ' . josh teater , a golf pro since 2001 , put it down to the length of time golfers get to consider what to do : ` you 're living in the moment for a while , as opposed to shooting a basketball . ' ernie els -lrb- left -rrb- can remember every shot he made in his open triumphs in britain and the us . but matt kutchar -lrb- right -rrb- disputes the idea that a good memory helps golfers - he says he plays ` much more in the present than the past ' but it 's not all advantageous , said alan goldberg , a sports psychologist from amherst , massachusettes . he maintains that it is best to rely on the unconscious memory -- the hindbrain -- to conscious thought -- the forebrain -- because of the risk of performance anxiety . ` think of them as two different-caliber golfers ,  he said .  the hindbrain is a pro , excellent technique and timing . the front brain is a hacker . if you gave the front brain a golf club , it would n't know what end to hold . ' golfer jerry kelly said that under pressure golfers can quickly reveal their shortcomings : ` you go through so many processes in your head , you forget about one key bit of information that could have saved a shot . ' and matt kuchar , said his memory is far from perfect , which he regards as beneficial to his play : ` i get up in a press conference after a round , and a guy asks me what i did on 15 , and i ca n't remember what 15 is .  i just try to play the shot in front of me . i 'm much more in the present than the past . '", "summary": " golfers remember ` significantly more ' , says dr joel fish .   may be because each shot is unique , whether distance , approach , wind speed or slope .   also get longer to consider each shot , unlike other sports people who have to make an instant decision .
