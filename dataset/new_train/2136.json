{"text": "we often walk past them without a second thought , but most murals tell a story about the communities in which they live . and yet , as features of our public spaces , they mean something different to each of us when we view them through our own individual filters . for our first cnn instagram community assignment we invited followers to photograph murals or street art in their communities and tell us about them . we were thrilled to see more than 300 submissions from all over the world and hear the many stories behind them . below are just a few highlights . check out all of the submissions by searching the #cnnmuralstories tag in instagram . erica firpo : rome , italy . erica firpo captured the latest mural by renowned italian street artists sten and lex , whose stencil art has appeared in cities worldwide . this mural on the side of a building in rome 's garbatella neighborhood was completed in december .  this abstract landscape -lrb- a deviation from their usual pointillist portrait -rrb- was entirely locally crowd-funded and chosen by the neighborhood to be a permanent public work , blurring the lines between street and fine art ,  firpo noted . ragheeb faatih moazzem : chittagong port , bangladesh . ragheeb faatih moazzem 's instagram depicts a portrait of 20th century bengali statesman sheikh mujibur rahman , leader of the movement that led to the independence of bangladesh from pakistan in 1971 . rahman later became the first president of the bengali state . found on a wall near chittagong , the country 's largest seaport , the portrait commemorates a historic speech by rahman that called for liberation from pakistan , moazzem said in his instagram post .  if it had n't been for bangabandu -lrb- friend of bengal -rrb- sheikh mujibur rahman and his historical and emotional speech , we would to this day be the victims of oppression and torture . we are forever in his debt .  jorge quinteros : brooklyn , new york . jorge quinteros came upon this work in progress in brooklyn . the artists told him they 'd been working on this mural of nelson mandela for three days . they told him that they owned the wall and typically used it as advertising space .  we had a little spare time from work and we wanted to pay tribute to this amazing man .  kimber kirton : miami , florida . kimber kirton documented a mural created this year by evoca1 for 2013 art basel miami beach . the south florida-based artist aims to  merge art and humanity together for a timeless collection  through his art and sketches for mankind , a collective whose work includes outreach to miami 's homeless population . this mural is based on sketches the artist created from photographs of two homeless men . word has it that the artist brings his subjects to the completed walls and shows them these beautiful interpretations , kirton said .  i can only imagine their emotional response , for even mine changed when i took a second glance at it after learning its backstory .  julian castaneda : uppsala , sweden . jullian castandea showed off his pride in his small city in uppsala , sweden , and its coffee roasting plant  lindvalls kaffe .  located near the plant , the mural proudly proclaims  en bÃ ¶ nas vÃ $ g ,  which means  the road of the bean ,  castaneda said .  we may be a little city , but at least we can be proud to say that the best coffee -- ` lindvalls kaffe ' -- is done right here .  mike gutkin : new york , new york . mike gutkin captured an authentic 20-foot section of the berlin wall in its current residence in a plaza in midtown new
