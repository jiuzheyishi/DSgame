' there are a number of possible factors which could be ` loading the dice ' , including declining arctic sea ice , solar variability and long-term ocean cycles . the workshop focused on the latest research looking at how these drivers can influence weather patterns and discussed future research can be targeted to push forward understanding in this area . there are a wide range of factors that could be causing the cold winters such as changes in the arctic climate . dr james screen , from the university of exeter , said : ` there has been a lot of talk about declining arctic sea ice playing a role in our weather patterns , but really that 's just one aspect of changes in the arctic climate -- which has seen rapid warming compared to other parts of the world . ` those changes mean there is less of a difference in temperature between the arctic and tropics , which could impact the position of the jet stream . ' another driver of colder winter weather has already been identified and is known as sudden stratospheric warmings -lrb- ssws -rrb- . recent research in this area has meant the met office was able to give good advice up to a month ahead on cold spells in recent seasons when they have been driven by this phenomenon . professor belcher said : ` this workshop has looked at some really cutting edge research and helped us identify key areas for future work to improve our understanding of potential drivers of some of the unusual seasons we have seen . ` this work will help us continue our work to push forward understanding in this area so we can give better forecasts and advice on longer timescales in the future . ` source : met office .", "summary": " six out of the last seven uk summers have seen above average rainfall .   it is thought that long-term atlantic currents are to blame .   tomorrow is expected to be the hottest day of the year , with 30c forecast .   humidity could spark rain and thunderstorms .   soaring temperatures caused by warm air from continent .
