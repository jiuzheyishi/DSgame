{"text": "at dawn syrian civil servants abu asaad and abu abdo each begin their commutes across the war-torn city of aleppo , a once-short journey that now takes 10 hours . a frontline slices through the former economic hub from north to south , with rebels in control of more than half of the devastated city . people like 45-year-old abu asaad , who works as a driver for the state , must travel for more than 400 kilometres -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- by bus just to get from one side to the other . a damaged sign in the industrial area of aleppo , pictured on november 18 , which has been devastated by the syrian civil war . commuters in aleppo taking the bus must now pass through checkpoints run by murderous isis militants . they face grave danger as they detour through an area under the control of the islamic state -lrb- is -rrb- jihadist group , which has seized large areas in syria and neighbouring iraq . until a year ago , residents could cross from one side of aleppo to the other through a checkpoint at bustan al-qasr . but because of snipers , it was closed . after working for 10 days straight in a regime-held neighbourhood , abu asaad waits for the bus at a station in the new aleppo district to go home to shaar , a rebel area just five kilometres -lrb- three miles -rrb- away . to get there the bus must first cross an area that is under army control , before reaching a desert zone that has become a no-man 's land over the course of the more than three-year-old war . he and other passengers then risk their lives as their bus drives through al-bab , an area of aleppo province that is controlled by is . from there , the bus travels back into aleppo city . ` before we reach the is checkpoint , women climb into the back of the bus and veil their faces completely , ' said bus driver mohammad , who makes the risky journey three times a month . ` they are not allowed to travel alone , according to the laws imposed by the jihadists . so we must make sure they are accompanied by their husband or brother . i check carefully , because i will pay the price if anything goes wrong , ' he told afp . for abu asaad , each journey is now a dive into the unknown . until a year ago , residents could cross from one side of aleppo to the other through a checkpoint at bustan al-qasr . but because of snipers , it was closed . the ruins of a company head office in the syrian city of aleppo . some commuters are risking their lives on the bus journey around aleppo -lrb- pictured -rrb- two or three times a week . syrian rebels and bystanders watch bulldozers clean the debris outside dar al-shifa hospital in aleppo , a city that now has a frontline running through it from north to south . ' a jihadist from daesh gets on the bus , armed with a sword rather than a kalashnikov , ' he said , using an arabic acronym for is . ` he checks everyone 's documents , and forces suspects to get off the bus , threatening them with his weapon . i always say i am a tailor , because if i admit i am a civil servant , they will throw me in jail , ' abu asaad said . but all of the forces on the ground - loyalists , the is and the rebels - have their databases . ` one mistake , and you disappear , ' he said . abu abdo lives in the rebel district of sakhur . he too crosses the frontline to get to the ministry where he works . ` our journey from one side of aleppo to the other is filled with danger . it used to take 10 minutes , but now it takes 10 hours because of a big detour , ' he told afp . ` there are many checkpoints and dangers along the way , but i must make the journey because i am a civil servant and i have no other source of income . sometimes , i make the journey twice or three times a week . god have mercy on us , ' he said . the bus ticket price has shot up because of the war . the bus journey for some workers across aleppo now involves travelling across no-man 's land , as well as through government-controlled areas and militant check-points . war-torn : a ruined mosque in aleppo . it used to cost just 20 syrian pounds to get from one neighbourhood to the other . now it costs 2,500 pounds -lrb- $ 12.5 -rrb- from the government to the rebel sides . about 800 people make the journey each day from the regime side , while roughly the same number leave from the rebel area , said munir , who runs the bus station . people living on both sides say loyalists and rebels demand bribes to let them through their checkpoints , but is poses the biggest danger for drivers . one told afp he received 30 lashes because the jihadists thought his beard was too short . another said he was lashed because he forgot to switch off the radio before he reached the is checkpoint . a third driver said he spent 48 hours in an is jail , and that he was only set free when he could recite a prayer correctly . many passengers make sure to have one last cigarette before climbing on board , because is forbids smoking . ` this is the road of fear . it is absurd to have to drive for hours through the desert to get from one side of the city to the other , ' said abu ahmad , who travelled to the regime-held side of aleppo to see his doctor . ` this division of aleppo is absurd . ' one commuter described the division of aleppo as ` absurd ' syrian men sit next to a wrecked factory in aleppo 's industrial area , a potent symbol of an economy lying in ruins .", "summary": " three-mile , 10-minute commutes in aleppo now take around 10 hours .   workers must risk their lives taking buses from one area to the other .   the normally short journey is now impossible because of snipers .   buses must now travel 250 miles through isis checkpoints and the desert .
