{"text": "april , the cruelest month : time for tax deadlines and tax policy follies . hence , the resurrection of the so-called buffett rule . named after warren buffett , who said it was an outrage that he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary , the proposal is designed to ensure that the really rich -- those with annual reported taxable incomes of more than $ 1 million -- pay an  effective tax rate  of 30 % . the idea is another attempt by president barack obama to restore some measure of progressivity to the tax code . baffled and blocked by the mythical joe the plumber , obama has been unable to restore the top marginal tax rate on those reporting more than $ 250,000 a year to their pre-george bush levels , a top rate of 39.6 % from its current 35 % . that seemingly modest proposal was a centerpiece of obama 's landslide 2008 election campaign . it has gone nowhere . neither will the buffett rule . why ? because the idea has three fatal flaws . 1 . the buffett rule is moot . it 's dead on arrival . the rule has no chance of getting through the house , even it can get through the senate . and if history is any guide , any form of tax increase , on anyone , will not bring votes to any person or party in november , so there are no political points to score here . ask joe the plumber . the practical political fact sits alongside some pressing fiscal facts : america is running massive deficits . our spending is too high . our revenues are too low . we are a greece waiting to happen . meanwhile , inequality of all forms is getting worse . we need to do something , not nothing . empty april symbolism is nothing . 2 . the buffett rule wo n't help solve the real problems . it wo n't help the fiscal problem because it is a drop in the bucket . the most optimistic projections are that the rule might raise $ 50 billion a year . that 's unlikely , because people plan around tax increases , but even if we get it , it is about 3 % of the projected $ 1.5 trillion deficit . the rule could only be meaningful if it were some kind of first step . but first step toward what ? history shows that marginal tax rates were raised on the very highest bracket to 94 % in the midst of world war ii . history also shows that almost no one paid tax in this bracket . why do it then ? because a top rate of 94 % made lower rates of 50 % and 70 % look more palatable . is the buffett rule a first step toward lowering the 30 % flat rate to those making more than $ 250,000 , or raising other middle-class taxes ? it is hard to see anything very good happening here . 3 . the buffett rule , even if enacted , wo n't work because it wo n't really affect warren buffett ! the really , really rich in america do n't pay high taxes because they do n't report high incomes . and they do n't report high incomes for perfectly legal reasons . as i have been writing for decades now , the really , really rich , including robert kiyosaki 's  rich dad ,  follow the three simple steps of tax planning 101 : buy , borrow and die . by buying assets that rise in value without producing cash , the really , really rich benefit from  unrealized appreciation  that need not go down on any tax form . this is key to the business and investment strategy of buffett 's berkshire hathaway . when the really , really rich want to consume , they borrow , also tax-free under the income tax . to cash it all out , the really , really rich die , like we all do -- and then the so-called stepped-up basis on death means that their heirs can sell off assets and pay off debts , tax-free . we can and should attack tax planning 101 and make the really , really rich pay some tax . we should address the tax benefits of unrealized appreciation and , even more so , of borrowing . we can do so , surprisingly simply , by a progressive consumption tax , as i and others , like robert frank and greg mankiw , have advocated for years . that 's real reform that would really affect warren buffett . as such , i suppose it must wait until april passes .", "summary": " the buffett rule is designed to make sure those who make over $ 1 million pay more tax .   edward mccaffery : the idea has three fatal flaws .   he says that even if it 's enacted , it would n't really affect namesake warren buffett .   mccaffery : real reform can be achieved with a progressive consumption tax .
