{"text": "syria 's embattled government will get at least 10 fighter jets from russia -- and they want more , russian state media reports -- moves that come amid rocky diplomatic efforts to peacefully end the middle east nation 's bloody civil war . a source involved in russia 's defense complex told the official itar-tass news agency friday that russia will sell syrian president bashar al-assad 's government mig-29 fighter jets to fulfill a  contract ... concluded long ago .  a syrian delegation in moscow is pressing for even more jets , with mig executive sergei korotkov telling russia 's state-run ria novosti 's news that his company and these syrian authorities are talking about the  details and time frame of a possible contact .  such discussions come on the heels of the european union 's decision to end its syrian arms embargo . that move was seen as opening the door for european nations to help rebel fighters militarily , though it may give russia more wiggle room to back its longtime ally , assad . it 's not clear how weapons , fighter jets and ammunition flowing into syria will affect the fighting there , much less the heretofore unsuccessful attempts to forge a negotiated settlement . about 80,000 people have been killed since the start of hostilities more than two years ago , u.n. general assembly president vuk jeremic said earlier this month . another 1.5 million or more people have fled the country . in addition to the fighter jets , russia reportedly sold six s-300 air defense systems to syria under a 2010 contract . asked thursday about these and other arms sales , al-assad said it is  not our policy to talk publicly about military issues in terms of what we possess or what we receive .  blast in damascus neighborhood kills 8 .  as far as russia is concerned , the contracts have nothing to do with the crisis ,  he told hezbollah 's al-manar tv , according to a transcript from syria 's official sana news service .  we have negotiated with them on different kinds of weapons for years , and russia is committed to honoring these contracts .  moscow , however , has said such deliveries would conform with international law and has denied supplying syria with weapons that can be used against civilians . u.s. secretary of state john kerry described any transfer of s-300s to the region as  not helpful .   whether it 's an old contract or not , it has a profoundly negative impact on the balance of interests and the stability of the region , and it does put israel at risk ,  he said . kerry added that halting the bloodshed peacefully should be everyone 's first priority .  the best chance to save syria -lrb- and -rrb- for a future syria that represents all syrian people and moves beyond this massacre , devastation , killing , sectarian violence ... is through a peaceful resolution that comes about in an organized way ,  he said friday at a joint news conference in washington with german foreign minister guido westerwelle .  in geneva , we will test who is serious . are the russians serious pushing to that ? i believe they are . -lrb- but -rrb- it is not helpful to have a lot of other ammunition , other supplies overtly going in .  syrian arms embargo : why more weapons to syria is a mistake . conference on crisis planned for switzerland . he was referring to an international conference on the crisis slated for switzerland . the plans are being worked out , but al-assad predicted it will take place in june .  we have announced a couple of days ago that we agree in principle to attend ,  he said . but the syrian leader made clear that his position may change , and damascus ' delegation may withdraw , if certain conditions are imposed .  so the idea of the conference , of a meeting , in principle is a good one ,  he told al-manar tv .  we will have to wait and see .  the national coalition , the main rebel umbrella group , has demanded al-assad step aside in order for it to take part in the talks , which were originally scheduled for this month .  it is difficult to continue when syrians are constantly being hammered by the assad regime with the help of outside forces ,  george sabra , acting chairman of the national coalition , said in a statement . he cited the siege of qusayr and attacks on eastern gouta , a suburb of damascus , as well as what he said was an  invasion  by iranian militia members in support of al-assad . al-assad said it 's too early to discuss whether or not he 'll run again for president in the 2014 election . he 'd do so if  there is a need and public desire  for him to stay on , but wo n't  if i feel that the syrian people do not want me to lead them .  the syrian president his only condition is that anything agreed to address the crisis should not be binding until syrians approve it through a popular referendum .  either side can propose anything , but nothing can be implemented without the approval of the syrian people . and as long as we are the legitimate representatives of the people , we have nothing to fear ,  the syrian leader said . ` open-ended ' syrian conflict draws in region . opposition group : 50 prisoners executed . all the deals and the talk have done little to change the situation on the ground in syria . the killing continued friday , with the opposition local coordination committees reporting 189 deaths , including six women , five children and 19 who died after being tortured . there were 74 people killed in aleppo province , including 50 prisoners who the group said were executed by government forces in aleppo 's central prison , the group said . in addition , syrian state-run television have reported that forces loyal to al-assad killed three westerners -- an american woman , a briton and a person whose nationality was not revealed . the news outlet said thursday the three had been fighting alongside the rebels and were found with weapons . the report said they were ambushed in their car in the flashpoint province of idlib in northwestern syria , where government forces have been battling rebels for control . tv video showed a bullet-riddled car and three bodies laid out on the ground . it also showed weapons , a computer , a hand-drawn map of a government military facility and a flag belonging to the al qaeda-affiliated al-nusra front . the united states is aware of the report of the reported killing of the american and is working through the czech republic mission in syria to obtain more information , a state department official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told cnn . citing privacy concerns , the official said ,  we are unable to comment further .  pictures circulating on the internet show the body of nicole lynn mansfield , 33 , of flint , michigan , her father and daughter told cnn on friday . the uk foreign office confirmed that a british national was among the dead .  their family has been informed and we are providing consular assistance ,  it said . kerry , the top u.s. diplomat , said that some 1,500 to 2,000 american fighters may be in syria .  it 's hard to get a peg on the exact number ,  he said . american 's family : she went to syria to help .", "summary": " new : russia will send 10 mig-29 fighter jets , russian state media reports .   new : a syrian delegation in moscow is pressing for more fighter jets .   new : 189 are reported dead nationwide , an opposition group says .   syrian president says the balance of power favors his armed forces .
