{"text": "lord steel , who introduced the 1967 bill which legalised the practice , said it was ` thoroughly undesirable ' that 36 per cent of terminations are now to those who have already had at least abortion . the father of the abortion act has spoken out to warn of the growing ` problem ' of women having repeat terminations as an alternative to contraception . lord steel , who introduced the 1967 bill which legalised the practice , said it was ` thoroughly undesirable ' that 36 per cent of terminations are now to those who have already had at least one abortion . in a dramatic intervention , he said it was ` never the purpose ' of his historic reform that tens of thousands of women would use abortion as a ` form of contraception ' . the indication that the former liberal leader , who brought forward his bill when he was a young backbencher , now believes his legislation has gone too far seems set to reignite the debate over abortion . latest figures show that in 2011 , there were 189,931 abortions , of which no fewer than 68,105 were on women who had already had a foetus terminated - a proportion of 36 per cent . this compares to 64,303 repeat terminations the year before - a proportion of 34 per cent . repeat abortions cost the cash-strapped nhs almost # 1million every single week . lord steel made his comments in the lords last week during a question-and-answer session on abortion with health minister earl howe . he asked the minister : ` will he confirm that there has been a welcome drop in the total number of abortions recently , but that there is still a problem of what are called repeat abortions , where women present who are clearly using abortion as a form of contraception , which is thoroughly undesirable ? ' earl howe replied : ` the abortion rate across england and wales has been static since 2009 . the good news is that the abortion rate for women under 18 has gone down . there was a 9.6 per cent decrease in the rate between 2010 and 2011 . ` on repeat abortions , the news is not so good . the proportion of repeat abortions for women who had abortions in 2011 was 36 per cent . the figure was higher than it had been the previous year , which is a matter for concern . ' latest figures show that in 2011 , there were 189,931 abortions , of which no fewer than 68,105 were on women who had already had a foetus terminated - a proportion of 36 per cent . the 2011 figures on repeat abortions show that many women are going back time and time again for terminations - a sign , according to lord steel , that they are being used as a form of contraception . some 17,241 women were on at least their third abortion ; 434 were on at least their sixth and - astoundingly - 76 were on at least their eighth . speaking later to the daily mail , lord steel said : ` it is odd that so many women present for repeat abortions , some more than twice , which does suggest they are treating abortion as contraception . ` this was never the purpose of the 1967 reform . ' josephine quintavalle , of the pro-life alliance , said : ` david steel needs to face the reality of the provision of abortion in this country , that it is not just being provided for women in dramatic need but is available on demand . ` it was verging on the ingenuous of him to imagine when he brought forward his legislation in 1967 that abortion would n't end up being available on demand . the 2011 figures on repeat abortions show that many women are going back time and time again for terminations - a sign , according to lord steel , that they are being used as a form of contraception . ` the trouble is that many people think there is nothing wrong with repeat abortions . they say : abortion is either right or wrong , so if you can have one you should be able to have as many as you can ask for . ' ann furedi , chief executive of abortion provider bpas , said : ` it is unfair to women and wrong for politicians to assume that women can live a modern life and not have the option of accessing abortion services . ` too many politicians - particularly as they get older - forget that abortion is a part of life . ` she said repeat terminations happen because ` women in their teens and their 20s are often very fertile and find it difficult to manage their fertility by contraception alone ' . ` women are not using abortion simply as another method of birth control , ' she said . ` what is happening is that contraception fails , or sometimes we fail to use it properly . ` when abortion is legal and easily available , it is not surprising if women use it - and that is not a bad thing . '", "summary": " 36 % of abortions are to those who have already had one procedure .   lord steel said it was ` thoroughly undesirable ' and ` never purpose ' of act .   latest figures show that in 2011 , there .   were 189,931 abortions .   68,105 were on women who .   had already had a foetus terminated .
