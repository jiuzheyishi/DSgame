{"text": "the catholic diocese of trenton , new jersey says it was n't responsible for a teenage boy 's molestation because the priest was ` off duty ' at the time of the abuse . victim chris naples claims reverend terence mcalinden , now 73 , sexually assaulted him hundreds of times over the course of a decade , starting when he was just 13 years old . now 42 , naples is suing the diocese in mercer county since other church leaders knew about the abuse and did nothing . abused : chris naples -lrb- left -rrb- , now 42 , claims he was sexually assaulted hundreds of times by revered terence mcalinden -lrb- right -rrb- over more than 10 years . the assaults took place at church and even on trips out of new jersey . naples previously lost a suit against the diocese in delaware , where some of the abuse allegedly took place . it was during that case that attorneys for the diocese used the controversial argument that they could n't be held responsible for rev mcalinden 's actions , because abusing a child is not part of a priest 's ` duties ' . young : rev mcalinden - aka father mac - started abusing naples at the age of 13 . naples ' mother let her son spend time alone with father mac because she thought he was a good role model . above , a school picture of a young naples . ` how do we determine when a priest is and is not on duty ? ' one of the justices asked . ` well , you can determine a priest is not on duty when he is molesting a child , for example , ' the diocese lawyer responded . ' a priest abusing a child is absolutely contrary to the pursuit of his master 's business , to the work of a diocese . ' naples told the new jersey star-ledger that he was astounded by the church 's argument . ` any hope i had that the church was concerned about me as a victim or about the conduct of its priests was totally gone , ' naples said . ` they were washing their hands of it . i was shattered . i just could n't believe that was one of their arguments . ' naples first came forward about the decade-long abuse in 2007 , when he had a breakdown and nearly committed suicide . instead , he came forward to the diocese with the heart-breaking tale of how rev mcalinden - aka ` father mac ' - took advantage of him from a vulnerable age . naples told the star-ledger that he first met father mac in the mid-1980s when the priest headed the youth group at st theresa 's parish in little egg harbor , new jersey . father mac promised to take naples out for a ride on his boat during their first meeting at a weekend leadership retreat in 1985 . his mother , a highly-religious single mom , agreed to let her young son accompany the priest - thinking father mac was a great role model . naples said nothing happened on that first trip out on father mac 's boat ` the poor box ' , but that the outing was soon followed by an overnight trip on the fourth of july when the priest first molested him . he claims the priest went on to molest him hundreds of times for the next 10 years , at the youth group 's headquarters , the church rectory , father mac 's parents ' house , and on trips to delaware , connecticut , new york , atlantic city and the virgin islands . coming clean : father mac and naples ceased their sexual relationship in 1997 , and remained on good terms for another 10 years . but keeping their ` secret ' caused naples to have a breakdown and he eventually told his wife and the diocese about the priest 's wrongdoings . perhaps most damning for the diocese is that other leaders in the church knew about the abuse and did nothing . chris naples . the abuse went on until 1997 , when naples was in his mid-20s , and the two continued to remain on good terms . father mac even introduced him to his current wife patty , a school teacher . he presided over their wedding , baptized their two children and acted as godfather for one . naples says it was father mac 's psychological control over him that kept him quiet for another 10 years . ` he knew how to manipulate , ' naples said . ` he would say things like ,  if your mother found out about this special thing we have , she would die ,  ' naples said . ` he called it our little secret . and i thought i was the only one . ' naples finally told the diocese about father mac in 2007 , after his wife confronted him for his distant behavior . aftermath : father mac lost his position after naples ' revelations . he was n't expelled from the priesthood however , and still receives his pension . pictured above opening his door for a new jersey star-ledger reporter . he refused to comment . keeping the secret led naples to become withdrawn and he even contemplated killing himself . mrs naples says she could n't believe it at first , when her husband revealed he had been abused by the close family friend . but when he broke down in tears in front of her , she knew it was true . the diocese of trenton conducted their own investigation into naples ' claims and promptly suspended rev mcalinden from the ministry . however , they did not remove him from the priesthood . rev mcalinden is still technically a priest and receiving his pension which he supplements with work as a real estate agent . after coming out about the abuse , naples also realized he was n't the only one father mac abused . patrick newcombe said in a 2011 press conference that the diocese paid him to be quiet about the abuse with a settlement in 1992 . bob markulis , who claims he was abused by father mac in the 1960s when he was working at his first assignment at our lady of victories church in sayreville , received an undisclosed settlement two years ago , his attorney gregory gianforcaro said . however , rev mcalinden continues to deny he ever abused children . in a december 2012 deposition , he admitted to having an ` intense ' sexual relationship with naples , but that it did n't start until the younger man was 18 . accountability : naples now lives in new gretna , new jersey with his wife and two children he says he 's suing the diocese not for the money , but to hold them accountable for not protecting children . he also admitted to sleeping nude with a ` number of ' other teen boys in the youth group and that it was ` standard practice ' to bathe naked with the young men in his parent 's hot tub . rev mcalinden remained unapologetic when naples confronted him in a taped phone call . ` at no time did i feel like i was using your or taking advantage of you , ' mcalinden says on the tape , obtained by the star-ledger . naples won an individual judgement against mcalinden in delaware for $ 3million . he has n't received any of that sum yet and does n't believe he ever will since the priest has no assets . he maintains it 's not about the money though , but about exposing mcalinden 's for ` the monster that he is . ' naples has now moved on to suing the diocese , which he believes could have done more to protect him and other vulnerable boys . ` they knew about mcalinden . they could have done something about it . and they did what every other diocese did . they kept it hush-hush and paid behind-the-scenes settlements , ' naples said .", "summary": " chris naples claims he was sexually abused hundreds of times by rev terence mcalinden over the course of a decade starting when he was 13 .   now 42 , naples is suing the diocese of trenton , new jersey for knowing about mcalinden 's abuse and doing nothing .   however , the diocese argued they were n't responsible for his behavior since mcalinden was ` off duty ' as a priest when the sex crimes happened .   mcalinden was suspended from his position in 2007 , when naples first came forward about the molestation .   two other men have admitted to being abused by mcalinden , and took undisclosed settlements from the diocese .   mcalinden was never officially removed from the priesthood , so he 's technically still a priest and receives his retirement pension .
