{"text": "opposed : ed miliband and labour voted against the benefits cap . working families would have to earn more than # 41,000 a year to get the same as many living on state benefits if the labour party was in charge of the welfare system , the tories claimed last night . the government 's benefit cap -- introduced yesterday -- limits the amount of money a household can claim in welfare payments to # 26,000 a year , the before-tax income of the average working family . ed miliband 's party opposes the cap and voted against it in the commons , even though opinion polls show that it is hugely popular with the public . official figures , contained in an impact assessment of the policy , show that on average those who will see their benefits capped will lose # 4,836 a year : about # 93 a week . a working family would need a pre-tax salary of # 32,000 to match the # 26,000 a year in state handouts allowed under the cap . but if nothing had changed and labour got its way , the benefits claimants hit by the cap would have been given nearly # 31,000 and a working family would need # 41,000 before tax to match them . tory mps seized on the figures as evidence that labour 's opposition to welfare reform discriminates against those who work . the cap was introduced yesterday in four london boroughs -- haringey , enfield , croydon and bromley -- and will be rolled out nationwide from september . it does not affect those on disability benefits or anyone working more than 16 hours a week and claiming working tax credits . the cap limits will be set at # 500 a week for couples , with or without children , and lone parent households and at # 350 a week for households of a single adult with no children . clear message : work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith said days of ` outrageous claims giving people incomes far above those of hard-working families are over ' work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith said : ` we have a very clear message : we will provide support to those who need it , but the days of outrageous claims giving people incomes far above those of hard-working families are over . ' tory chairman grant shapps said : ` conservatives are firmly on the side of people who want to work hard and get on in life . ` unbelievably , labour oppose capping benefits . they 've got no idea -- they want some out-of-work households to be able to claim an average # 4,800 a year more in benefits than the average working family takes home in wages . ' ministers also repeated their claim that the introduction of the benefit was already persuading people to return to work . the department of work and pensions published figures last week showing that the number of families affected by the cap has been cut from 56,000 to 40,000 . menace : peter owens was caught driving five different high-powered cars without insurance . of these , 8,000 have got a job and another 8,000 have disappeared from welfare rolls . critics have claimed the figures are not proof of behavioural change in those affected . but dwp minister mark hoban said : ` i do n't know how much time -lsb- they 've -rsb- spent in jobcentres in recent months , i suspect not very much . i 've been talking to people who have been implementing these changes , and the very clear message is that this has provided a spur to people , to get them thinking about getting into work , whereas perhaps in the past they have n't . ' mr miliband responded to the criticism by saying : ` we 're in favour of a benefit cap but it 's got to be adjusted regionally . ' labour work and pensions spokesman liam byrne said : ` ministers have got this so badly wrong that even members of the cabinet think it will cost more than it saves . ` the truth is the benefits bill is soaring # 21billion higher than expected because this government is failing to create jobs and the welfare revolution we were promised is descending into chaos . ' but business leaders backed the government . simon walker , director general of the institute of directors , said : ` the benefits cap establishes a sensible principle , that welfare should not pay more than working . ` it is morally wrong as well as economically damaging to have a benefits system that prices employers out of the market . this is a welcome move .
