{"text": "he may be the infamous founder of italian fascism who allied with adolf hitler , tore up democracy and introduced a string of anti-semitic laws to italy . but it seems former dictator benito mussolini is still lauded in the country almost 70 years after he was shot , strung up by piano wire and his body spat upon by passers resurgence : former italian dictator benito mussolini , pictured left in 1940 , is still lauded by many with sales of calendars featuring his image said to be selling in higher numbers than a decade ago . and while calendars featuring mussolini are nothing new - they go on sale alongside ones featuring sports stars and animals every year - worryingly sales are on the up according to one of the firms that makes them , with many young italians starting to idolise the dictator once again . renato circi , head of rome printer gamma 3000 , told the guardian that his company are selling more mussolini calendars than they were a decade ago . he said : ' i did n't think it was still a phenomenon , but young people are buying them now too . ' the re-emergence of mussolini ideology seems to have made something of a resurgence in italy . fascism has long left its mark on the country , with groups of so-called ultras sporting extreme views that hark back to 1920s italy taking to the nation 's football terraces for several decades . but the cult-figure appears to have slipped back into mainstream public consciousness . he is venerated by neo-fascist youths who stormed rome high schools back in october clutching neo-fascist flags and launching smoke bombs into classrooms while lessons were going on . popular : calendars of the italian dictator are nothing new - pictured are calendars from this year and last - but sales are said to be on the increase by manufacturer gamma 3000 . the capital has been rocked by an increase in extreme right militancy since the autumn with neo-fascist youth group blocco studentesco holding weekly demonstrations in rome that have often ended in violent clashes with police . and in november , an attack on tottenham hotspur fans , who had travelled to rome for a europa league match against serie a giants lazio , was linked to neo-facist fans . a 25-year-old spurs fan , ashley mills , was stabbed in that incident . earlier in 2012 , a village south of rome paid tribute to field marshal rodolfo graziani by splashing out # 100,000 on a statue of the infamous general . a leading businessman also mooted the idea of renaming forli airport in northern italy as mussolini airport . idolised : fascist ideology has been adopted by extreme football fans known as ultras for decades , but mussolini 's views seem to be re-emerging in mainstream consciousness . not only is the re-emergence of fascist ideas attributed partly to silvio berlusconi who brought post-fascist conservatives into his coalition government in 1994 and 2001 . but while germany sought to distance itself from fascism following the fall of the nazis in 1945 , italy has never fully endorsed powers that outlaw the existence of fascist parties drawn up in 1952 . partly because it posed a risk to the italian constitution and partly because of a ` sneaking admiration ' for fascist ideology , according to james walston , politics professor at the american university of rome . his resurgence as an idol among some italians is also said to be the result of the recession , which has hit italy particularly hard . the country is in the grip of its fourth recession in a decade and its economy has barely grown in that period . italy 's national debt is among the largest in europe . and it is thought that many young italians are increasingly looking to right wing groups and ideologies in the hope that a strong leader may emerge and improve the nation 's fortunes . of course italy was in financial dire straits following the first world war and mussolini 's economic fascism saw the economy grow more than 20 per cent in four years at the start of the 1920s and unemployment fall by almost 80 per cent . italian neo-fascist group casapound 's vice-president simone di stefano told the guardian : ` whoever buys the -lrb- mussolini -rrb- calendar admires his work - the two things can not be separated . ` there is a need today for his politics , for someone who will put the banks and finance at the service of italy . ' benito mussolini pictured giving a fascist salute . benito amilcare andrea mussolini was born in predappio , northern central italy , in july 1883 . the son of a blacksmith , he moved to switzerland in 1902 because jobs were scarce in his home region and became involved with socialist politics there . he moved back to italy two years later and began work as a journalist on socialist papers . mussolini later broke from socialist ideologies when italy decided to enter world war one and he was enlisted in the army in 1915 . he formed the fascist party following the war in 1919 and capitalised on the support of unemployed veterans organising supporters into squads known as the black shirts who terrorised anyone who disagreed with their politics . as italy fell into political chaos in the autumn of 1922 , mussolini 's black shirts marched on rome and he was invited to form a government . he made himself dictator in 1925 and gave himself the nickname il duce , setting about re-establishing italy as a major european power . mussolini supported general franco in the spanish civil war and became involved in an increasingly strong alliance with adolf hitler 's germany . his declaration of war on britain and france in june 1940 exposed italian military weakness and was followed by a series of defeats in north and east africa and the balkans . in july 1943 , allied troops landed in sicily . mussolini was overthrown and imprisoned by his former colleagues in the fascist government . in september , italy signed an armistice with the allies . the german army began the occupation of italy and mussolini was rescued by german commandos . he was installed as the leader of a new government , but had little power . he was eventually killed in april 1945 by partisan italians as the allies moved north through italy .", "summary": " calendar sales have increased over the past decade .   a surge in support for neo-fascism in italy is blamed on the recession .
