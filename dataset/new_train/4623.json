{"text": "threatening your guests rarely yields smiley happy reviews . it 's a lesson union street guest house in hudson , new york , learned monday after the new york post highlighted the hotel 's attempt to fine wedding parties $ 500 for any negative online reviews posted by any members of their parties . hundreds of people took to yelp.com on monday to complain about the policy and write mostly fake , eviscerating reviews of the property . at one point monday there were more than 700 reviews on yelp , but the company had deleted many reviews by monday afternoon because they did n't reflect  first-hand experiences ,  according to yelp .  trying to prevent your customers from talking about their experiences is bad policy and , in this case , likely unenforceable anyway ,  yelp said . screen shots of the policy , which had been removed from the hotel website as of monday afternoon , read  there will be a $ 500 fine that will be deducted from your deposit for every negative review of usgh placed on any internet site by anyone in your party and/or attending your wedding or event .  apparently guests who do n't like their stays at the guest house just do n't understand the historic buildings or region , according to the hotel website .  please know that despite the fact that wedding couples love hudson and our inn , your friends and families may not ,  the website says .  this is due to the fact that your guests may not understand what we offer -- therefore we expect you to explain that to them . usgh & hudson are historic . the buildings here are old -lrb- but restored -rrb- .  our bathrooms and kitchens are designed to look old in an artistic ` vintage ' way . our furniture is mostly hip , period furniture that you would see in many design magazines . -lrb- although comfortable and functional -- obviously all beds are brand new . -rrb- if your guests are looking for a marriott type hotel they may not like it here .  cnn.com called the inn repeatedly but only reached a busy signal , and an e-mailed request for comment was not returned . the inn posted an explanation on its facebook page , which was later removed .  the policy regarding wedding fines was put on our site as a tongue-in-cheek response to a wedding many years ago . it was meant to be taken down long ago and certainly was never enforced ,  the post said . but one yelp reviewer posted complaints about the policy last year after he posted a negative yelp review .  the management of this hotel had the gall to email us twice to threaten us financially about the negative review !  wrote one reviewer , whose yelp handle is rabih z . he continues :  here is an excerpt from their first email : ` please note that your recent on-line review of our inn will cost the wedding party that left us a deposit $ 500 . this money be charged via the deposit they have left us unless/until it is removed . any other or future reviews will also be charged to the wedding party -lrb- bride & groom -rrb- from the guarantee they have provided us . '  other parts of the hotel 's website are a little cranky , too . one example :  we reserve the right to cancel a reservation at any time for any reason .  another policy about cancellations :  if your stay is longer than 3 days we do not accept cancellations of any kind .  positive online reviews equal more hotel revenue , said josiah mackenzie , director of reviewpro , an online hospitality reputation management company .  the answer is not to fine guests but to use feedback to make changes in your operations ,  he told cnn .  that leads to guests having happier experiences and sharing these reviews on these review sites . ", "summary": " a hudson , new york , inn had a policy on its website imposing a fine for bad online reviews .   internet users responded with a vengeance , posting negative comments and reviews on yelp .   language about the $ 500 penalty for bad reviews was removed from the inn 's site .   fine was  tongue-in-cheek ,  according to a facebook post that was later removed .
