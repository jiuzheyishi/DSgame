{"text": "my eight-year-old daughter nancy appears in the kitchen looking cross . ` what 's that disgusting thing bobbing about in the bathroom sink ? ' she demands . ` it 's just a silkworm cocoon , ' i reply airily -- much to nancy 's baffled disgust . no wonder . at the age of 46 , there is almost nothing i wo n't try to keep the years at bay -- but this must be the strangest yet . frances applying a cocoon to her skin . at the age of 46 , there is almost nothing she wo n't try to keep the years at bay . the latest weapon in my anti-ageing arsenal is , in truth , fairly revolting : silkworm cocoons , the casing that silkworms -- which are in fact a type of caterpillar -- spin for themselves before they turn into moths . it is the mulberry silkworm cocoon , the same as used to spin silks in industrial production . the cocoons are harvested in asia and shipped to europe . they look and feel like a tiny , hollow white bird 's egg covered in embossed wallpaper and have been hailed on internet forums as the latest secret to flawless skin . frances uses the mulberry silkworm cocoon , the same as used to spin silks in industrial production . the cocoons are harvested in asia and shipped to europe . according to naomi moriyama , author of japanese women do n't get old or fat , trainee geishas in kyoto have used them for centuries . ` japanese women are obsessed with beautiful skin . they are far more comfortable using natural products than many western women , ' she says . ` some of our remedies are thousands of years old , ' adding that it was the youthful hands of women who extracted silk from cocoons in ancient china and japan that first alerted sharp-eyed matrons to the potential cosmetic benefits of silkworms . now the idea has gained traction again thanks to the internet and our new obsession with all things natural . even so , the idea of rubbing an insect cocoon on my face horrifies me . the silk worm -- which look like a white maggot -- spins the cocoon from its saliva glands . yuck ! the silk worm -- which look like a white maggot -- spins the cocoon from its saliva glands . however , considering my distinctly greying , lined face , i decide it 's worth a go . surprisingly , the cocoons are easy to find . when i look them up on amazon , i 'm pleased to find they cost a mere # 3.99 for ten . they are described , perfunctorily , beneath a photograph as ` white silkworm cocoon facial cleanser ' . i order 30 . they turn up three days later in little plastic wallets covered in bubble wrap , without any instructions , or in fact , any information at all . thankfully , there is some cursory guidance on the retailer 's amazon page , advising me to soak the cocoon in hot water to soften it , then rub it gently over my face concentrating on lines and blemishes . each cocoon should only be used once . soaking my first cocoon in the bathroom sink frances was surprised and gratified that it dis n't disintegrate into a sludgy mess . before i actually dare to rub the cocoon on my skin , i seek the advice of top cosmetic specialist dr michael prager -- who is surprisingly enthusiastic . ` women have used oils from the cocoon as a moisturiser for over a thousand years . it 's wonderful stuff , packed full of healing properties , ' he says . ` when you soak the cocoon , you release sericin , the substance that binds the silk thread together . this is an amazing protein , containing 18 amino acids , which will definitely help your complexion . ' he explains that sericin acts as a thin film over the face , sealing in moisture to keep skin hydrated . what 's more , he says , it 's been shown to replenish collagen , the substance that keeps skin elastic . i decide to put silkworm cocoons to the test by having my skin scientifically analysed before and after using the cocoons . to this end , i visit dr sunil chopra at the london dermatology centre , whose skin-analysing visia machine measures the signs of ageing -- skin texture , pore size , wrinkles , spots and uv damage . depressingly , i do badly on spots -- 90 per cent of women my age have clearer skin than me -- and my uv damage is worse than half of women my age . however the elasticity of my skin is good and i 'm cheered to learn that my pore size is better than three out of four women my age . ` there 's some discolouration and scarring from acne and there is quite substantial uv damage around your mouth and on your forehead , ' dr chopra says . he advises using the cocoons every other day for a month as part of my beauty routine -- i apply my usual moisturiser afterwards -- before we analyse my skin again . soaking my first cocoon in the bathroom sink i 'm surprised and gratified that it does n't disintegrate into a sludgy mess . i leave it for a couple of minutes in hot water , then pop it onto the end of my finger and rub it in a circular motion around my face -- concentrating especially on my chin and forehead where i have most acne scarring and sun damage . frances with dr sunil chopra at the london dermatology centre , whose skin-analysing visia machine measures the signs of ageing -- skin texture , pore size , wrinkles , spots and uv damage . the cocoon feels slightly abrasive and surprisingly solid for something that 's been soaking . it certainly does n't feel greasy . afterwards my skin has a sort of pinkish glow . i wonder if i 've overdone it and simply peeled off the top layer of skin . applying my moisturiser , my face feels a bit raw . it stings a little and i resolve to be gentler next time . looking at my face the next day , i ca n't see any difference at all . in fact all week and then into the second week , there 's no change . in all honesty , i 'm highly suspicious of these cheap white cocoons with their bubble-wrap packaging . i like my cosmetics to smell lovely and be beautifully boxed . while the elasticity of frances ' skin was good for her age , she did less well on the number of spots she gets . by the third week , the novelty of soaking my cocoons has worn off , and i 'm convinced it 's just a gimmick not worth 4p , never mind # 4 . to top it all , i start to get a nasty spot near the right side of my mouth . i can feel it coming up on tuesday evening and rubbing the cocoon over it , i wonder whether i 'm doing more harm than good . on wednesday morning however , the spot is shrinking . it hovers beneath the surface of my skin for a couple of days and then , miraculously , it slinks away . at the same time , i notice my skin feels softer , and my complexion looks a little bit plumper and fuller . peering into the mirror , i wonder whether i 'm imagining things . frances ' acne spots , uv damage and scarring improved by 20 per cent . a quick internet search reveals an answer : it turns out any new skin regime will take around four weeks to work , as that 's how long it takes the skin the renew itself . meeting my friend laura for lunch , she stares at me quizzically before asking what on earth i 've been doing to my face . ` you look much less wrinkly , ' she says bluntly , adding that i look five years younger . dr chopra , too , when i see him at the end of the month tells me that my skin looks much better . ` your complexion is clearer and smoother . i can see that without the visia , ' he says . the results from the visia are astounding . my acne spots , uv damage and scarring have improved by 20 per cent and the texture of my skin is now better than 96 per cent of women my age -- an improvement of 20 per cent . my wrinkles too , have noticeably softened , especially around the mouth and eyes . analysing the results , dr chopra is impressed . ` for a completely natural product with no side-effects this is pretty stunning , ' he says . he tells me that my results are backed up by a study in the indian journal of scientific & industrial research , which demonstrated sericin 's hydrating and healing properties . the only way that my skin could have shown an improvement of that magnitude , he says , is by increased collagen . ` the sericin in the cocoon has clearly promoted collagen production . this explains the healing of acne scars , the increased elasticity and the huge improvement in pigmentation and uv damage . i 'd carry on using those cocoons if i were you , ' he says . as we leave the clinic i notice the nurse on her ipad . ` what are you doing ? ' i ask . ` ordering some of those cocoons of course , ' she replies .", "summary": " aged 46 , there is nothing frances childs wo n't try to keep the years at bay .   the mulberry silkworm cocoon is also used to spin silks .   the silk worm spins the cocoon from its saliva glands .   frances ' acne spots , uv damage and scarring improved by 20 per cent .
