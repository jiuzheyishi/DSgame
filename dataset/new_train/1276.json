{"text": "the suspended ` dirty ' dentist at the centre of an infection-control investigation raked in more than # 1,000 a day seeing huge numbers of patients to fund his lavish lifestyle . desmond d'mello 's alleged flouting of nhs safety guidelines sparked the biggest patient recall after he was secretly filmed as he treated up to 40 patients in one morning . nhs bosses have urged any former patients who were treated by the 60-year-old at daybrook dental surgery to come forward for blood tests for hiv and hepatitis . a whistleblower claimed he re-used dirty equipment and failed to change his gloves between patients . and it emerged the latest cqc report by health inspectors who examined the surgery in july found medical equipment was stored in a staff toilet , posing ' a risk of these items coming into contact with body fluids which may be contaminated ' . dentist desmond d'mello is at the centre of a major public health scare amid allegations he flouted infection-control measures at his nottinghamshire practice over a 32-year period . so far more than 2,000 of his former patients have sought help and advice . it has emerged mr d'mello raked in around # 1,000 a day treated a huge number of patients to fund his lavish lifestyle . he sold his georgian mansion on the outskirts of nottingham for # 1.5 million earlier this year and moved to a luxury nottingham flat , pictured . six months earlier inspectors had given mr d'mello a clean bill of health . detectives are also investigating whether the death of 23-year-old patient amy duffield is linked to dental treatments she received . more than 1,300 people have so far contacted a helpline set up to advise former patients , and another 600 have visited a dedicated clinic to seek blood tests . it comes as the true scale of mr d'mello 's vast income has emerged , fuelled by a huge turnaround of patients to fund an extravagant lifestyle . the 60-year-old lived in a lavishly furnished georgian mansion and drove a range of sports cars , including a mercedes , a porsche and a ferrari , with personalised number plates . the impressive georgian mansion stands in seven-acres of grounds . it features seven bedrooms , three reception rooms and a study , garages for three cars , a tennis court , pond , wood , meadow and secret garden . it is built on land formerly owned by the seely family , renowned landowners in nottinghamshire . he sold the # 1.5 million grade two listed property , ramsdale farm , on the outskirts of arnold , nottinghamshire , earlier this year and moved to a luxury flat in an upmarket area of nottingham . dentists are paid per patient , earning a minimum of # 18.50 for a basic check-up and polish on the nhs . health bossees revealed mr d'mello saw 166 patients in a three-day period when he was filmed by a whistleblower in june . at an average of 55 patients a day , mr d'mello would have earned a minimum of # 1,017 a day and around # 3,071 if all patients were paying the minimum fee . if 55 patients a day was an average for mr d'mello , it means the 60-year-old would have earned in excess of # 371,000 a year , before tax . it is not known how many of mr d'mello 's patients had their treatment fully funded by the nhs . but it is unlikely that over the course of the three-day period in june mr d'mello only treated those patients charged the minimum fee . dentists charge nhs patients according to three bands - a band two appointment costs # 50.50 and a band three , for the most complex procedures including dentures and bridges , costs # 219 . it is therefore likely that mr d'mello 's earnings were in excess of # ,3,071 across the three days , and # 371,000 a year . nottinghamshire police are making enquiries into the death of amy duffield , 23 , a patient of mr d'mello who died unexpectedly last year . dr doug black , a medical director for nhs england in nottinghamshire , said : ` he saw 166 patients in a three-day period . ` that is a lot of patients . the footage showed us there were serious lapses . ' mr d'mello , who studied at the university of manchester and qualified in 1977 , was suspended for just 18 months in august by the general dental council , pending the start of the investigation . nhs dentists are paid according to three bands . band 1 : # 18.50 covers an examination , diagnosis and advice . if necessary it will also cover x-rays , a scale and polish and planning for further treatment . band 2 : # 50.50 covers all treatment covered by band one , plus additional treatment including fillings , root canal and removing teeth . band 3 : # 219 covers all treatments covered in bands one and two , plus complex procedures including crowns , dentures and bridges . miss duffield , 23 , visited her gp on august 18 , 2013 , suffering from palpitations , and was taken to queen 's medical centre before being transferred to nottingham city hospital , where she died on august 22 of viral acute myocarditis . now nottinghamshire coroner mairin casey , who was not made aware that she had visited mr d'mello 's surgery prior to her death , has asked police to investigate . miss duffield 's death was attributed to natural causes and because she died in hospital no inquest was held . the coroner has to power to order an inquest if she feels there are any questions over her death . nhs england has set aside # 500,000 for a massive operation to recall the 22,000 patients he treated in a career spanning three decades . patients say their dentist 's fall from grace has sent shockwaves through their community . he was as a well-liked and popular man before he left his role at the surgery earlier this year . one former patient of mr d'mello , chris dalkin , told mailonline he had only ever been impressed by his dentist of more than 20 years . mr d'mello worked for 32 years at the daybrook dental practice , pictured , in mansfield road , nottingham . nhs bosses stressed the practice is under new ownership . he said : ` he is a brilliant dentist . professional , courteous and the same goes for the staff . ' a very popular dentist as the large numbers involved prove . ` the whole thing stinks . i hate to think what mr d'mello is going through . ' rumours of his suspension had spread through the community before this week 's report was released by the general dental council , criticising his hygiene practices . inspectors from the care quality commission visited daybrook dental surgery on july 17 . their inspection came a month after a whistleblower raised concerns with health bosses over alleged infection-control breaches . in august , a report into their findings , found the practice failing in three of the five areas assessed - cleanliness and infection control , safety , availability and suitability of equipment and assessing and monitoring the quality of service provision . the report highlighted a range of hygiene concerns . inspectors noted : ` we observed the staff toilet and the room next to the toilet were being used as store rooms for equipment . ` this posed a risk of these items coming into contact with body fluids which may be contaminated . ` this risk had not been identified by staff at the dental surgery and no action had been taken to minimise it . ` we saw that mops and buckets for cleaning the practice were stored directly next to the staff toilet , in the same room , which again posed a risk of this cleaning equipment coming into contact with body fluids which may be contaminated . ' the report noted the practice had an infection-control programme in place , and that it had been reviewed in february 2013 . inspectors had visited the clinic just six months before , in november last year , and gave it a clean bill of health . martin clamp , 24 , a construction worker from daybrook said : ` when my partner told me about it , i was speechless . i came straight down to the centre and registered to be tested . ' i had three teeth out earlier this year and there were no problems but it makes you think . ` it all makes me feel uneasy , worried and a little bit scared . i 've been going there all my life and if i 've got something in my blood and passed it on to my partner , she could have given it to my son when she was pregnant . ' emma hopewell , 27 , from arnold , said she was worried about the situation because she is eight months pregnant . she said : ` i 'm having to get my children to go and have blood tests because of this , and i 'm pregnant i should n't be having to worry about it . ' i think it 's disgusting . it 's a small dentist so i know they kept files in the toilets , so it would n't surprise me if he kept equipment in there as well . ' she said they had been given packs with advice in and now had to wait 14 days until they find out the results . her mother , iris brace , 54 , also of arnold , said : ` it 's absolutely disgusting . to think that our whole family has been going to see him for so long and now we 're all having to get tested over this . ' nhs england said 1,333 patients had so far called the helpline , and more than 600 people had gone to a clinic set up to deal with queries and perform precautionary blood tests . a spokeswoman said 452 patients had so far been tested at the clinic in arnold , nottingham . a dedicated advice line has been set up offering guidance on how to access additional support . anyone who is concerned can call the advice line on 03330 142479 from 8am to 8pm , seven days a week . nhs england has also set up a temporary community clinic for patients , to provide further advice , counselling , and where necessary blood testing . patients can visit the clinic from 8am to 8pm seven days a week , at the arnold health centre , located at highcroft medical centre on high street in arnold , nottingham . anyone who lives outside the area , or is housebound should contact the advice line for information about how to access screening .", "summary": " desmond d'mello has been suspended amid claims he flouted safety rules .   dentist , 60 , ran daybrook dental surgery in nottingham for 32 years .   in june whistleblower filmed him treating 166 patients over three days .   nhs launched investigation over serious infection control concerns .   emerged he raked in more than # 1,000 a day seeing dozens of patients .   huge turnaround of patients funded mr d'mello 's lavish lifestyle .   more than 22,000 patients are estimated to be at risk of blood-borne viruses .   those former patients at high risk will be tested for hiv and hepatitis .
