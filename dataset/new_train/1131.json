{"text": "when anne morshead , a couples counsellor for relate , met her partner liam she was n't aware of his dependency on alcohol . ` over the next five years i changed into someone i did n't recognise , ' she writes in her new book , in which she tells the story of their relationship in ireland . ` someone my friends started not to recognise . ' i became physically ill , certainly emotionally distraught and i am forced to admit now what my mental capabilities were suspect as well on many occasion . ' initially , anne thought she could change liam . that she could fix him . she felt his recovery depended entirely on her being there - and not only because liam was an alcoholic , but because he was also going blind . in blind drunk anne tells the story of how they met , fell in love , tumbled into the destructive co-dependency of addict and carer , and eventually saved themselves and their relationship by having time apart . anne , left , likens living with a blind alcoholic to being the ` carer of a delinquent teenage rebel ' writing about when she and liam first met -lrb- in a pub -rrb- , anne wonders if it was his ` helplessness ' that drew her in and attracted her to him . she says : ` had liam just been drunk i wonder whether we would have got entangled , but since he was blind and drunk , disadvantaged in life , presently fearful and very anxious -lsb- ... -rsb- i felt for him thinking i could ease his emotional pain . ' similarly , anne 's strong personality was a draw to liam , who had endured an abusive relationship at the hands of his alcoholic father . she writes : ` he had tried to cling to his mother and she probably did her best to protect him , especially as he was visually impaired . ` as a result , my guess is that he was attracted to me as a solid , older woman who had surprisingly stayed and listened to him . ' anne expects that liam used alcohol to drown the sorrows of a traumatic childhood and a degenerative eye condition . but liam 's blindness made their relationship trickier , with anne often excusing his behaviour to herself and to friends , or thinking he was acting in certain ways because he could n't see , not because he was inebriated . ` suddenly his mood would change , ' she says . ` not to mention the staggering , knocking into furniture and falling down , but after all , i told myself , he was blind . ` his eyesight was a big stumbling block for me ! sometimes it seemed i had become the carer of a delinquent teenage rebel . ' as liam became emotionally absent and began lying to her and hiding alcohol , anne became angry and aggressive . life , she says , was ` unmanageable ' . iam 's blindness made their relationship trickier , with anne often excusing his behaviour to herself and to friends , or thinking he was acting in certain ways because he could n't see , not because he was inebriated . things came to a head on 7 july 2005 , the morning of the 7/7 bombings , when anne told liam she would n't see him again until he stopped drinking . at this point blind drunk becomes a guide to being the partner to an alcoholic . anne says an alcoholic must want to recover themselves , and that your insistence that they do so is simply not enough . she advocates ` detachment ' : distancing yourself from your dependent and focusing instead on improving your own life . ` by detaching and leaving him to it i showed i cared . it sounds perverse but by staying , coping and being a martyr in effect , i was exercising pity and indicating liam was a failure and had no hope of going it alone or recovering . ' and it worked . liam benefited from their detachment , recovered , and the couple are still together . ` when they make it sobriety really is reincarnation in the same lifetime , ' anne says . alcohol is a drug that is extremely addictive . what to remember : . your family member or friend is not a bad person . they crave a drug that is addictive . this addiction is probably 10 % physical , 90 % psychological . no one forces them to put a glass to their lips , but they never meant their lives to go down this route . anyone can become addicted : if you drink enough for long enough , even you . most people deny they have a problem . denial has many sides , layers and levels to it . the drinker has a disease , and that disease is progressive . you and the whole family are affected by it . the drinker can stop , but only if they stop drinking .", "summary": " anne morshead 's partner liam has alcoholism and vision impairment .   both afflictions run in the family - liam 's father was alcoholic .   anne initially thought she could help him come to terms with blindness .   liam is now sober after anne practiced ` tough love '   anne 's autobiography blind drunk chronicles their life together .   teaches others how to deal with similar situations .
