{"text": "flamboyant property tycoons robert and vincent tchenguiz could sue the serious fraud office for # 100million following the collapse of britain 's biggest-ever fraud inquiry . the brothers -- who were arrested as they prepared to stage a champagne party on their yacht in cannes -- were questioned as part of an investigation into the collapse of icelandic bank kaupthing . however , the inquiry quickly became bogged down in legal disputes which exposed procedural blunders by sfo officials . playboy lifestyle : property tycoon vincent tchenguiz -lrb- left -rrb- pictured with his sister lisa and brother robert . yesterday , in a humiliating climbdown , the agency dropped its inquiry into robert , 52 , just four months after ending its case against his 55-year-old brother . now robert is threatening to join vincent , who has issued a # 100million ` letter before action ' over compensation . the claim would almost certainly break the agency , which faces questions over its future and ability to handle the most complex cases . the brothers -- who are said to have had a combined wealth of # 4billion before the 2008 banking crisis -- are renowned for their playboy lifestyle . as well as the # 30million london mansions , and offices adorned with damien hirst sculptures , there were dates with beautiful models and a place at the table alongside the movers and shakers of society . they bought their first property -- a # 47,000 one-bedroom flat in london 's marble arch in 1979 -- after their father , the shah of iran 's former jeweller , gave them # 1million with which to go into business . just six months later , they had sold it for # 73,000 . before long , the brothers were major london landlords , renting out flats to students and tourists . soon after , they founded their company , rotch . the pair have continued to live a jet-set lifestyle . in 2010 , despite reports that he lost # 1billion in just 24 hours in the collapse of the icelandic banks , robert had allegedly commissioned a 200ft yacht . probe : the brothers - who were arrested as they prepared to stage a champagne party on their yacht in cannes - were questioned as part of an investigation into the collapse of icelandic bank kaupthing . the tycoon -- who it is claimed introduced dodi fayed to princess diana -- also continued to live in a # 30million five-storey house next to the albert hall . it was reported last year that vincent still manages a # 10million yacht and has kept hold of his car collection , which included a lamborghini , two rolls-royces , two bentleys and an aston martin . in a statement yesterday , sfo director david green said he has discontinued the investigation because there is ` insufficient evidence to justify its continuation ' . the sfo moved in during a probe into the collapse of kaupthing , one of three icelandic banks which failed in october 2008 . the fraud inquiry was one of the biggest-ever seen in britain , with a senior tory donor , at least one multi-millionaire and a leading luxury property developer all being dragged into the net . they are now not under suspicion . at one point , investigators even considered sending undercover officers into the mayfair nightclub annabel 's to gather evidence . the iranian brothers , who once owned 1 per cent of all british residential property , were arrested in march last year after questions were raised over the circumstances in which they secured huge cash loans against their property portfolios while also being depositors . the close links between the bank and one of its major investors was key to a 2,300 page report ordered by the icelandic parliament . high life : it was reported last year that vincent still manages his # 10million yacht , the veni vidi vici . it identified robert as the ` largest debtor ' in kaupthing as well as a shareholder in exista , an investment company that was the biggest shareholder in kaupthing . in july , the high court set aside warrants against both tchenguizes , after finding that they had been unlawfully obtained . a month later it ruled the agency had acted unlawfully and unfairly in its search of the tchenguizes properties . in a damning verdict two judges questioned whether the sfo was adequately funded and accused it of being incompetent . earlier this year it also emerged that the sfo had secretly offered to accept a # 50million payment to charity from robert in return for closing its investigation . the climbdown is another setback for the organisation following a series of high-profile failures . in 2006 the sfo caved into pressure by halting the investigation of alleged corruption at bae systems . its cases against employees of diy chain wickes and durex maker ssl also collapsed . in a statement , robert tchenguiz said he ` welcomed the decision by the sfo to clear him formally of any wrongdoing in the collapse of kaupthing bank ' . he added : ` i look forward to closing this chapter and getting on with business . ' an sfo spokesman insisted a closed case was not a failed case . he added : ` it would be unrealistic to expect every investigation to lead to a prosecution .
