{"text": "up to six new nuclear power reactors will power 14million homes for 60 years following a massive deal announced yesterday . in the most significant boost yet for government plans for a new network of atomic power stations , japanese engineering giant hitachi took on a project to construct plants in wales and gloucestershire . the # 700million deal will create 12,000 jobs for construction workers , engineers and other skilled employees , and spark a broader multi-billion-pound investment in the nuclear industry . deal : masaharu hanyu , hitachi 's vice president and executive officer , at a news conference in tokyo as it confirms it is to buy horizon nuclear power . two british firms , power systems provider rolls-royce and engineering services group babcock international , will work with hitachi on the project . britain currently has ten nuclear power stations , generating a total of ten gigawatts of electricity , around 19 per cent of britain 's electricity needs . by 2023 , all but one -- sizewell b in suffolk -- will have become obsolete . this could trigger an energy crisis , as one third of britain 's old-fashioned coal-fired and oil-fired power stations will effectively be outlawed by environmental legislation at the same time . the future of the nuclear industry had . been thrown into doubt , however , by the decision of germany 's e.on and . rwe to pull out of developments in the uk . energy secretary : ed davey said the move was a ` vote of confidence ' in uk energy policy . now hitachi is buying horizon nuclear power -- which has the rights to build reactors at wylfa on anglesey , north wales , and oldbury in gloucestershire -- from the german firms . ministers and unions hailed the deal , but green campaigners described it as a ` risky and expensive gamble . ' david cameron said the announcement was a ` decades-long , multi-billion-pound vote of confidence ' in the uk . the prime minister added : ` it will support up to 12,000 jobs during construction and thousands more permanent highly skilled roles once the new power plants are operational , as well as stimulating exciting new industrial investments in the uk 's nuclear supply chain . ' energy and climate change secretary edward davey said : ` hitachi bring with them decades of expertise , and are responsible for building some of the most advanced nuclear reactors on time and on budget , so i welcome their commitment to helping build a low-carbon secure energy future for the uk . i particularly welcome hitachi 's firm commitment to involve the uk supply chain and local workforce . ` new nuclear is n't only about keeping the lights on and emissions down , it 's an industrial strategy with big potential wins . ' the minister said there had been a ` huge amount of interest ' from across the world in buying horizon , adding that the uk could now become a ` springboard ' for nuclear development in other countries . he stressed there would be no public subsidy and that developers would be responsible for decommissioning costs . mr davey added : ` we have made it very clear that there will be no public subsidy for new nuclear . there is no taxpayer subsidy in this at all . ' hitachi and ministers played down safety fears in the wake of last year 's fukushima power plant meltdown in japan , pointing to the uk 's strong regulatory regime and the company 's track record in building safe nuclear plants . tatsuro ishizuka , vice-president of hitachi , said the company would invest billions of pounds in uk nuclear operations , adding : ` our aim is to build safe nuclear power stations , on time and on budget , to provide long-term , affordable energy . ' investment : hitachi plans to employ its advanced boiling water technology , which is already in use in four reactors in japan . however , hitachi uses an advanced boiling water reactor for its plants -- different from existing nuclear plants in britain -- raising concerns that it could take years to approve the projects . mike clancy , general secretary-designate of the prospect union , said : ` while hitachi 's advanced boiling water reactor design has yet to undergo the uk 's generic design assessment approval process , it is a proven technology and therefore any construction in the uk will benefit from lessons learned from its construction in japan . ' unite national officer kevin coyne said : ` this is good news for the uk nuclear industry , for jobs and for a low-carbon future . ` there are massive job opportunities here in the uk and we urge hitachi to maximise the uk supply chain . ' greenpeace energy campaigner leila deen said : ` it speaks volumes about the uk 's struggling nuclear programme that the government is promoting a reactor that 's years from being granted uk safety approval and is designed by the company that helped build fukushima . ' the government has plans to develop new nuclear reactors on eight sites , but until yesterday had struggled to persuade companies to invest . the move by japanese giant hitachi to build new reactors in the uk has led to renewed calls by environmentalists for the nuclear programme to be abandoned . hitachi 's advanced boiling water reactor is different from existing nuclear plants in britain and from designs being developed by other companies for sites here , prompting claims it will take years to approve the projects . greenpeace energy campaigner leila deen said : ` it speaks volumes about the uk 's struggling nuclear programme that the government is promoting a reactor that 's years from being granted uk safety approval and is designed by the company that helped build fukushima . ` instead of waiting years to find out how much billpayers will end up subsidising this project , the government should join japan and germany , abandon nuclear , and invest instead in clean , renewable energy . ' friends of the earth 's guy shrubsole said : ` this is a risky and expensive gamble for hitachi that other energy firms are unwilling to take - and contrary to the promises the coalition has made , the public will end up funding it . ` nuclear has always delivered late and over budget , and crucially it wo n't reduce emissions until the 2020s , when to tackle climate change , we need emissions cuts to happen straight away . ' he added : ` last night 's nuclear safety alert in the face of hurricane sandy was a stark reminder of fukushima and how vulnerable our energy infrastructure can be . ' hitachi said there were four advanced boiling water reactors in japan , all of which were delivered on time , and another four under construction in japan and taiwan . the design is based on previous boiling water reactors , using water heated directly by the nuclear core to create steam to drive electricity turbines , of which there are 84 worldwide including in the us , germany , netherlands and india . the reactors at fukushima , where nuclear disaster struck when the site was hit by an earthquake and subsequent tsunami in march 2011 , were also boiling water reactors . but professor andrew sherry , director of the dalton nuclear institute at the university of manchester , said the reactors at fukushima dated back to the 1960s . ` the design will have advanced significantly between the 1960s and 2000s . ' professor paul howarth , director of the national nuclear laboratory , said boiling water reactors had to conform to the same safety standards as other plants , which the uk understood well . but he said the uk would need to train up operators so they understood the ` subtly ' different requirements of boiling water reactors . prof sherry said he thought today 's announcement was very good news for the uk , which had challenging targets to cut carbon that required the development of nuclear as well as renewables . but he said the need for a nuclear renaissance would not lead to corners being cut or decisions rushed through , saying ` that could n't happen in the uk ' . future : the existing power station at wylfa , on anglesey , where hitachi will build new reactors .", "summary": " japanese firm to buy horizon nuclear power from german owners e.on and rwe npower .   hitachi intends to progress plans to build reactors on anglesey , north wales , and in gloucestershire .   david cameron said the deal represents a ` multi-billion pound vote of confidence in the uk ' "}
