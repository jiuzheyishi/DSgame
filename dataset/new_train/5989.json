{"text": "dozens of indian jews who claim to be the descendants of a lost biblical jewish tribe emigrated to israel from their village in india on monday , celebrating their arrival after a five-year struggle to get in . the bnei menashe , from the northeastern part of india , say they are descended from jews banished from ancient israel to india in the eighth century b.c. . an israeli chief rabbi recognised them as one of the 10 ` lost tribes ' in 2005 , and about 1,700 moved to israel over the next two years before the government stopped giving them visas . overjoyed : immigrants from the bnei menashe tribe of the jewish community in manipur , northeast india , reunite with their family members at ben gurion airport near tel aviv on monday . new life : fifty members of bnei menashe arrived this week to join the 1,700 already resident in israel . emotional : friends and relatives who were forced apart tearfully embrace , while others prepare to build a life alone or with just their immediate family . hopeful : no genetic studies have yet proved ancestry for the bnei menash , who claim they were exiled in the eighth century bc . ` dream ' : family members greet relatives , with a further 7,200 bnei menashe waiting to join them from in the indian states of mizoram and manipur . arguments : members of the tribe are eligible to emigrate if they convert , although the indian authorities have resisted the process . israel recently reversed that policy , agreeing to let the remaining 7,200 bnei menashe immigrate . fifty-three arrived in tel aviv on a flight monday . michael freund , an israel-based activist on their behalf , said nearly 300 others will arrive in the coming weeks . ` this is a very moving aliyah , ' he told ynetnews.com . ` we feel like our lost brothers have come home . ' the bnei menashe -lrb- sons of manasseh -rrb- claim descent from one of the ten lost tribes of israel , who were sent into exile by the assyrian empire -lrb- above -rrb- more than 27 centuries ago . their ancestors wandered through central asia and the far east for centuries , before settling in what is now northeastern india , along the border with burma and bangladesh . the bnei menashe practise judaism , observing the sabbath , keeping kosher , celebrating the festivals and following family laws . an israeli chief rabbi recognised them as one of the 10 ` lost tribes ' in 2005 , and about 1,700 moved to israel over the next two years , helped by israel-based organisation shavei , before the government stopped giving them visas . another 7,200 remain in india , hoping to move , and israel recently agreed they too would be allowed to immigrate , provided they convert first . india , however , does not support the policy , which may trigger a mass exodus . some do not believe the tribe qualify as jews , however , claiming that they simply want to escape poverty in india . avraham poraz , a former interior minister , said they were not linked to the jewish people and claimed israeli settlers were using them to strengthen israel 's claims to the west bank . several genetic studies have been undertaken , but none has yet proved ancestry , according to author nadia abu el-haj . freund , who joined the flight from india , said that during the trip ` we all had tears of joy in our eyes , realising that this is part of the closure of a 2,700-year historical circle of this lost tribe . ' freund stressed that ` their immigration to israel demonstrates the power and determination of the jewish faith : despite being cut off for hundreds and thousands of years , they never forgot who they were and where they want to return to . ' lhing lenchonz , 26 , arrived in israel with her husband and eight-month-old daughter . ` after waiting for thousands of years , our dream came true , ' she said . ` we are now in our land . ' ben asher , 23 , who arrived with his family , added : ` israel is my heritage and religion . israel is everything to me . we are very happy . we 've been waiting for this moment for hundreds of years . ' he plans to join the israel defense forces soon . ' i want to serve my country in any way possible , ' he added . zimra danapa , 20 , flew to israel with her mother and sister . ' i have fulfilled my dream , ' she said . ` after many years of hoping to arrive in israel , i am very excited to be here . ` we plan to build our life here and bring more family members here . ' zvi kalfa , a community member who immigrated to israel 13 years ago , leaving his parents behind , said : ` at the airport there was an exciting reunion . some of the immigrants united with their relatives who have already been here for years . ` our hope is to bring everyone here . ' but not all israelis think bnei menashe qualify as jews , and some suspect they are simply fleeing poverty in india . avraham poraz , a former interior minister , said they were not linked to the jewish people . he also charged that israeli settlers were using them to strengthen israel 's claims to the west bank . when chief rabbi shlomo amar recognized the bnei menashe as a lost tribe in 2005 , he insisted they undergo conversion to be recognised as jews . he sent a rabbinical team to india that converted 218 bnei menashe , until indian authorities stepped in and stopped it . faith : the bnei menashe practise judaism , observing the sabbath , keeping kosher , celebrating the festivals and following family laws . a former israeli interior minister , said that israeli settlers were using the bnei menashe to strengthen israel 's claims to the disputed west bank . the bnei menashe come from the states of mizoram and manipur near india 's border with myanmar , where , they say , their ancestors landed after the assyrians banished them . over the centuries they became animists , and in the 19th century , british missionaries converted many to christianity . even so , the group says they continued to practise ancient jewish rituals , including animal sacrifices , which they say were passed down from generation to generation . jews in the holy land stopped animal sacrifices after the destruction of the second temple in jerusalem in 70 a.d.", "summary": " villagers from northeastern india will be allowed to settle in israel .   they claim to be the bnei menashe , who were banished in eighth century .   they were recognised by a rabbi in 2005 but many israelis dispute it .   some say they are not jews and are simply fleeing poverty in india .   nearly 300 will arrive in the coming weeks .   ex-minister says israel is using them to strengthen its claims to west bank .
