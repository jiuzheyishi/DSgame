{"text": "do n't tempt me ... britons are being told by the . health watchdog nice not to offer treats to friends and family who . are trying to lose weight . -lrb- stock picture -rrb- . britons are being told by the health watchdog not to offer sweet treats to friends and family who are trying to lose weight . they are also being instructed not to invite colleagues who are attempting to cut back on alcohol to go the pub after work . the watchdog , nice , says it is neither ` helpful ' nor ` a joke ' to deliberately try to tempt those who are desperately trying to stick to resolutions to become healthier . guidelines issued by the organisation today also urge doctors , nurses and midwives to question patients about their lifestyles when they arrive in a&e , have a routine appointment or scan , or come in to pick up a prescription . staff should use ` every opportunity ' to help patients change unhealthy habits . they are told not to be too ` embarrassed ' to ask overweight patients sensitively whether they have thought about going on a diet , or would consider doing do so . and if they suspect someone has a drink problem , they are encouraged to ask them questions designed to assess their alcohol intake . the guidelines -- published when millions have made new year 's resolutions to tackle their weight or drinking -- are intended to help health staff and the general public tackle the rising problem of obesity and excessive drinking . employers are told to consider banning staff from smoking throughout the working day and to ensure they motivate staff who are trying to lead healthier lives . the advice also reminds local councils they have the power to ban pubs from opening in areas where there are already a high number of licensed premises . but critics have accused nice of ` nannying ' and say the last thing adults need is to be ` lectured ' on healthy living by their own friends and family . robert oxley , of the taxpayers ' alliance campaign group , said : ` this is subversive nannying from a health quango that puts out this kind of drivel in a desperate attempt to justify its continued and costly existence . ` many of us will be trying to shed a few extra pounds or cut back on the booze over the new year , but we do n't need quangocrats lecturing our friends and colleagues while we do so . this is further evidence that nice is both a waste of everybody 's time and taxpayers ' money . ' with more than a quarter of britons now obese , the guidelines urge medics not to be too ` embarrassed ' to ask overweight patients sensitively whether they have thought about going on a diet , or would consider doing do so . but professor mike kelly , director of the centre of public health at nice , said : ` the idea is quite simple . first of all you should share your goals with friends , family and work colleagues so they understand what you 're trying to do . ` they also must understand it 's not helpful or a joke to tempt people deliberately . some do -- it 's a bit of fun . they go on a diet , and someone says ,  oh come on this cream cake wo n't do any harm  . ' ` say for example someone says ,  i 'm going to make a real effort to cut down on my drinking .  if the first thing that happens within the next five minutes is that a colleague says ,  come on , we 're all going down the pub after work  , that does n't help . ` it 's asking people to be a bit more thoughtful , a bit more understanding of the difficulties . when people fall off their best intentions , they ca n't keep on the diet , that 's where friends , family and so on can help . ` it 's a bit of encouragement and it 's a way of sharing the task rather than people trying to do it on their own . it 's based on very sound psychological principles which acknowledge that our ambitions often outstrip our human capacity to do things . ` it 's that nudge in the right direction that can keep people on track . ' just over a quarter of adults in britain are now obese while nearly half of men and a third of women drink too much alcohol . nice , the national institute for health and care excellence , says britons have done very well in recent years to cut down on smoking , but obesity and excessive drinking remain huge public health concerns . the watchdog is also in charge of deciding which new drugs should be available on the nhs and it has been criticised in the past for rejecting life-extending cancer drugs . last year not one of the 11 new drugs made available was approved . some of its other health guidance has been deemed controversial . last year it suggested councils should raise parking charges to encourage the public to walk .", "summary": " nice tells britons it 's not ' a joke ' to deliberately tempt those trying to slim .   new guidelines also urge medics to question patients about their lifestyles .   staff told not to be 'em barrassed ' to ask overweight patients about dieting .   but critics call the advice ` subversive nannying from a health quango ' "}
