{"text": "there appeared to be little chance of escape for this pelican when the jaws of a huge humpback whale opened up beneath it . but after disappearing into the huge mouth of the whale , these pictures show the incredible moment the bird re-emerged , then made its bid for freedom . the pelican spent a few desperate moments flapping its wings before taking flight off into the air as the whale 's jaws closed shut . the game is up : a pelican found itself trapped in the jaws of a huge humpack whale after diving for fish in port san luis harbour , in avila beach , california . collision course : it appears the pelican and the whale had both aimed for the same pool of fish when they collided . it seems the bird had tried to dive for the same group of fish as the whale in port san luis harbor , avila beach , california , and ended up stuck in the humpback 's jaws . but it appears the humpback whale , which tends to feed on krill and fish , had no interest in eating a feathery alternative and , instead of descending to the watery depths which would have crushed the pelican to death , decided to open up its jaws to let it go . this amazing sequence of pictures were taken by amateur photographer rob bishop who lives near the harbour . he said : ` there have been an unusually large number of small fish in the harbour this year . ` huge amount of brown pelicans have arrived and are diving for the fish . they have been followed by humpback whales coming into the harbour to feed on the fish . lethal : if the humpback whale went under the water with the pelican still trapped in its jaws , the bird would almost certainly have died . miracle escape : the bird frantically flaps its wings to escape the jaws of the humpback . ` whales come up from below the surface with their mouths open and then close them before going back under the surface . ` in this case the pelican was diving down while the whale came up , causing the unlucky pelican to get caught in the whales mouth . ` it appeared the whale opened his mouth back up to safely let the pelican back out . ' mr bishop revealed he managed to secure this incredibly close-up images because the whale had ventured unusually close to the harbour walls . he added : ` at the time i took the pictures i was standing on the port san luis pier along with around to 100 other people . freedom : the pelican finally frees itself from the whale 's mouth in port san luis harbor . big friendly whale : photographer rob bishop said the whale appeared to open its mouth wider to let the bird out before going back under the water . ` the whales had been coming up farther out in the harbour , but suddenly this one came up fairly close to where we were standing . maybe 75 to 100 feet away . ` it is very rare for them to come in this close to where people and boats are . it was amazing because there were so many pelicans flying overhead and diving into the water , a lot of seals also swimming around , and then the whales suddenly coming up so close to us . ` the sounds of all this along with the ooohs and aaahs of the crowd was very surreal . ' the humpback whale - also known as a megaptera novaeangliae - is a species of baleen whale and adults range in length from 12 to 16 metres and weigh approximately 36,000 kilograms . humpback whales typically migrate up to 16,000 miles each year and only eat in summer while fasting during the winter .", "summary": " unlucky pelican was diving for fish when it collided with the humpback whale .   the bird could easily have been crushed or drowned by the huge mammal .   incredible escape captured by amateur photographer rob bishop at port san luis harbor , avila beach , california .   mr bishop said the whale , which only eats krill and fish , appeared to open its jaws up wider to let the pelican escape .
