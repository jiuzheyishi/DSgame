{"text": "president barack obama said sunday that the united states  ca n't accept  last week 's killing of 12 people at washington 's navy yard as  inevitable ,  but the shooting should instead  lead to some sort of transformation  on gun violence in the united states .  it ought to be a shock to all of us , as a nation and as a people ,  obama said at the marine barracks , just a few short blocks from the navy yard .  it ought to obsess us . it ought to lead to some sort of transformation .  the president said during his speech that grieving with the families impacted by mass shootings is something he has had to do five times in his presidency , citing shootings in fort hood , texas ; tucson , arizona ; aurora , colorado ; newtown , connecticut ; and now the washington navy yard .  part of what wears on as well is the sense that this has happened before ,  obama said .  what wears on us , what troubles us so deeply as we gather here today , is how this senseless violence that took place in the navy yard , echoes other recent tragedies .  the president continued :  sometimes i fear there is a creeping resignation ... that this is somehow the new normal . we ca n't accept this .  twelve people were killed and eight were wounded when aaron alexis , a navy contractor , entered the sizable naval instillation in washington and opened fire in building 197 . the victims , whose ages ranged from 46 to 73 , all worked at the navy yard and many were gunned down as alexis shot at them from above in the navy building . the issue of gun violence has dominated much of obama 's second term in office , with a concerted effort to strengthen gun laws coming after 26 people -- including 20 children -- were killed at sandy hook elementary school in newtown in december 2012 . ` there 's a guy slaughtering people with a shotgun ' the push , however , eventually failed , with the lawmakers on capitol hill failing to pass any laws tightening gun restrictions . groups including the national rifle association and gun owners of america vociferously protested the proposed changes . in response to last week 's shooting at navy yard , most gun-control advocates were resigned to the fact that not much in the of legislative changes would be made in response .  we do n't have the votes ,  said senate majority leader harry reid , a supporter of gun control , on tuesday .  i 'd like to get them but we do n't have them now .  the nra , in response to the shooting , on sunday suggested more armed guards at military installations . obama attempted to take what he saw as acceptance of gun violence head on , worrying that mass shootings could not become the  new normal .   i do not accept that we can not find a common-sense way to preserve our traditions including our basic second amendment freedoms and the rights of law-abiding gun owners while at the same time reducing the gun violence that unleashes so much mayhem on a regular basis ,  obama said , pointing to the fact that other countries , like great britain and australia , lowered gun violence by restricting access to guns after mass shootings rocked their country . throughout much of the speech , the president acknowledged a hesitance in washington to fight over gun laws and , instead , said change would need to come because of the american people 's desire for it . who were the victims ?  it may not happen tomorrow , it may not happen next week , it may not happen next month , but it will happen , because it 's the change that we need ,  the president said . obama also used the speech to give a glimpse into the life of each of the 12 victims , mentioning everything from arthur daniels ' love of polishing his white crown victoria to john johnson 's last words to his wife :  good-bye , beautiful . i love you so much .   our tears are not enough ,  he said to the families .  our words and our prayers are not enough . if we really want to honor these 12 men and women , if we really want to be country where we can go to work and go to school and walk our streets free from senseless violence without so many lives being stolen by a bullet from a gun , then we 're going to have to change . we 're going to have to change .  washington , d.c. , mayor vincent gray joined obama on sunday in calling for tighter gun laws in response to the shooting , telling the audience that  our country is drowning in a sea of guns .  in taking the stage , obama was stepping into a role he has become very familiar with , counselor-in-chief , and sunday 's remarks were reminiscent , in some ways , of past speeches he has given at memorial services for mass shootings . reframing the gun control debate : is mental health the next focus ? obama , however , is not the first president to play the role of counselor-in-chief . presidents ronald reagan and bill clinton were praised for the leadership they showed in the aftermath of two domestic disasters -- the space shuttle challenger explosion in 1986 and the oklahoma city bombing in 1995 . representatives from the military , including secretary of defense chuck hagel , secretary of the navy ray mabus and vice adm. william hilarides , commander of naval sea systems command , also spoke at sunday 's event . all honored the fallen by noting that they died in the line of duty , just like those killed in battle .  these 12 members of our navy team , our navy family , were killed in the line of duty , they died in the service to our nation , the service to our navy , service they were just as committed to as anyone in uniform ,  an emotional hilarides said .  for that service , we honor them . for that service , we will never forget them .  opinion : tackling the military 's insider threat .", "summary": " obama says u.s.  ca n't accept  killing of 12 at d.c.
