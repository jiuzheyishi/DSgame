{"text": "boast : aides to culture secretary maria miller highlighted her children ahead of an internet porn summit . maria miller has been criticised for claiming she understands the need for internet porn controls because she is the ` only mother at the cabinet table ' . the culture secretary 's aide made the comment ahead of yesterday 's whitehall summit on the issue . mrs miller , who is married with three children , said at the weekend : ` as a mother , i am determined to protect my children from the depravity of internet porn . ' the cabinet 's other women -- home secretary theresa may , northern ireland secretary theresa villiers and international development secretary justine greening -- have no children . labour 's media spokesman helen goodman said it was a ` foolish ' choice of words . she added : ` the job of secretary of state is to stand up to the industry , not to start talking about her personality and family situation . ' mrs miller today hosted a summit in parliament with senior figures from internet , communications and computing firms including google , microsoft and bt . the meeting agreed a new approach to tackling online child abuse images with a beefed-up role for the internet watchdog . mrs miller said they had agreed a ` fundamental change ' to the way the internet watch foundation -lrb- iwf -rrb- works , with the industry-funded body set to adopt a role actively seeking out and blocking child pornography . the main uk internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- have agreed to provide extra funding for the iwf , understood to amount to # 1 million , to help it take on the extra duties . under current arrangements the iwf only acts on content that has been reported to it rather than proactively seeking out illegal images . representatives from yahoo! , google , microsoft , twitter , facebook , bt , sky , virgin media , talktalk , vodafone , o2 , ee and three were summoned to the meeting . the culture secretary said illegal child abuse images had caused concerns ` particularly in recent months ' . checks : the internet watch foundation is to have a beefed up role in actively seeking out and blocking child pornography -lrb- file picture -rrb- . the parents of murdered children april jones and tia sharp have called for more action to tackle child porn on the internet as the government and technology giants agreed a new crackdown . in interviews with channel 5 news , five-year-old april 's parents paul and coral jones and 12-year-old tia 's father steven carter both agreed their children 's killers were spurred on by sick images found online . mark bridger , who killed april in mid-wales , and stuart hazell , murderer of tia in south london , were both found to have accessed child and violent pornography and some experts argue there is a clear link between their obsessions and their actions . mr and mrs jones told channel 5 news that they want prime minister david cameron to get personally involved in the fight against child abuse online . mrs jones said : ` april was a fighter from the word go and i promised her i 'll do this for her .  i said i 'll help other children , so their family do n't have to go through this , their brothers and sisters . ` it 's not just us it affects , it affects brothers and sisters as well . ' i just want it stopped and i think the government should put more pressure and get it done now . ' mr clark has told channel 5 news that stopping indecent images of children from being published online could have saved his daughter tia , who was brutally murdered by stuart hazell . he said : ` you 're fuelling the beast and it needs to be stopped , it should have been stopped a long time ago when these people were setting up companies they should be looking at , right , what would be the outcome of indecent images of children ? ' mark bridger , who killed april jones , . and stuart hazell , murderer of tia sharp , were both found to have . accessed child and violent pornography and some experts argue there is a . clear link between their obsessions and their actions . mrs . miller added : ` i think any parent or anybody who is a resident in this . country wants to see illegal child abuse images dealt with , and dealt . with swiftly . ' but aides to the minister last night actively highlighted the fact that she is the ` only mother in the cabinet ' . helen . goodman , labour 's shadow media minister , said : ` i think that was . foolish . it would be much better to come to parliament and say this is . what we are thinking than briefing that you are the only mother in the . cabinet . i do n't think we care about that . ' ms goodman claimed the package agree was a ` damp squib ' . she added : ` the job of secretary of state is to stand up to the industry not to start talking about her personality and family situation . ` we are not interested in how much people care . we are interested in how effective they are . there is not caring and wringing your hands if you do n't make some change . ' she added that it was ` really shocking ' that mr cameron only had one mother in cabinet . the remark risks being seen as insensitive towards her cabinet colleagues . home secretary theresa may , the most . senior woman in british politics , last year revealed her sense of loss . at not being a mother . she said : ` it just did n't happen . i mean , this is n't something i generally go into , but things just turned out as they did . ` you look at families all the time and you see there is something there that you do n't have , ' she told the daily telegraph . other cabinet ministers without children include justine greening , eric pickles and william hague . in 2010 mr hague revealed how his wife ffion has suffered ` multiple miscarriages ' . he said : ` i have made no secret of the fact that ffion and i would love to start a family . ` for many years this has been our goal . sadly this has proved more difficult for us than for most couples . ' it was also noted that faith minister baroness warsi , who attends cabinet but is not a full member , has a daughter . a tory colleague said : ` maria has been briefed against and is probably defending herself from the recent continuous background attacks . ` however her language was a little bit sloppy , protecting vulnerable people and enhancing online safety measures is a matter for all policy makers , whether they are a mother , father , grandparent , aunt uncles or simply a constituency mp .
