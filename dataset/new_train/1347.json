{"text": "the final design of the new type of usb plug that will replace all other usb connectors , has been unveiled . the usb type-c plug is reversible so users will no longer have to stab blindly at usb ports in order to connect and charge gadgets , because plugs will fit in sockets in either direction . the usb promoter group said that the next generation design is thinner than its predecessors so it can be used in increasing sleek smartphones , tablets and ultrabooks . the usb promoter group unveiled its usb type-c plug which is reversible and slimmer than previous standards . different types of ports are also pictured . the plug is designed for slimmer smartphones , tablets and ultrabooks but will not be compatible with older computer equipment without an adapter . the usb type-c connector is a completely new design . it has been designed for use with thinner , sleeker devices , such as tablets and ultrabooks . it claims to be robust enough for laptops and slim enough for smartphones . it is being built on existing usb 3.1 and usb 2.0 technologies . the plug is smaller than current laptop connectors , and more closely resembles the size of the current 2.0 micro usb . crucially , it will be reversible meaning it will work whichever way it is plugged in . this is similar to how apple 's lightning connector works . ` the usb type-c specification establishes a new cable and connector scheme tailored to fit mobile device product designs , yet robust enough for laptops and tablets , ' the san francisco-based group said . reports of the fabled plug began in december last year and renderings of what it might look like leaked in april . the usb 2.0 specification was released in 2000 and became the standard by the end of 2001 , followed by usb 3.0 in 2008 , and 3.1 in july 2013 . apple uses its own lightning connector on newer models of iphone and ipads , which can be inserted either way up . the type-c connector will work in a similar way , while resembling the size of the current micro usb plug . according to the group , the type-c will be ` the only connector one will need across all devices . ' in april , renderings were released shat showed a thinner usb dock , better suited for tablets and ultrabooks -lrb- illustrated -rrb- . it is only now that the design and full specifications have been released . crucially , however , because the new design is different to the current versions of usb plugs , users of older computing equipment will need an adapter to use the new plugs . ` interest in the usb type-c connector has not only been global , but cross-industry as well , ' said brad saunders , usb 3.0 promoter group chairman . ` representatives from the pc , mobile , automotive and internet of things industries have been knocking down our door anticipating this new standard . ' it is anticipated that everyday devices connected to the internet , from smart light bulbs to smart fridges will become increasingly common in years to come , as more consumers embrace the internet of things . ` this specification is the culmination of an extensive , cooperative effort among industry leaders to standardise the next generation usb connector as a long-lasting , robust solution , ' he added . the new cable and connector supports usb performance at superspeed usb 10 gbps -lrb- gigabits per second -rrb- and provide up to 100w of power .", "summary": " the usb promoter group unveiled its slimmer usb type-c plug .   reversible design means days of jabbing at usb ports to make plugs fit will be over as the new design will work both ways .   next-generation plug is slimmer to fit smartphones , tablets and ultrabooks .   as the new design is different to the .   current versions of usb plugs , users of older computing equipment will .   need an adapter to use the new plugs .   currently there are no plans for apple to adopt the new standard .
