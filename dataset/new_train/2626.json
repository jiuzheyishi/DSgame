{"text": "in 2010 , the american board of internal medicine suspended or revoked the certification of 139 physicians for giving away or soliciting examination questions for a board review company . cnn subsequently reported on residents preparing for certification examinations using questions reproduced by people who took previous exams . residents taking the american board of radiology medical physics examination wrote down test questions -lrb-  recalls  -rrb- , and shared them with future examinees . dermatology residents also reproduced questions -lrb-  airplane notes  -rrb- minutes after the certification examination . question reproduction violates copyright policies . however , some physicians cnn interviewed said that recall use is like preparing with a study guide since questions are used to confirm underlying knowledge , not rote memorization of answers . consistent with this view , only 43 % of medical students surveyed at a uk medical school thought it was clearly wrong to convey information about test content to another student examinee . however , such behavior should create concern for the quality and integrity of patient care . medical students who cheat on examinations are more likely to falsify information in a patient 's medical record . patients want physicians to be certified based on a valid assessment of the knowledge necessary to provide high-quality care . if patients can not trust the knowledge that board certification is expected to measure , the medical profession loses the public 's confidence . moreover , certification should indicate the ability to care for patients , rather than efficient test preparation . notably , although patients express a highly favorable view of certification , it is not required by most hospitals and health care plans . the distinction between cheating and guided study is crucial . old test questions and recent examination experience are routinely used to create study materials . the american college of physicians produces a summary of concepts and information most likely to appear on the abim certification exam . the content of this summary is shaped by post-examination residents . the first aid series for medical students is updated annually based on examinee reports . using a focused study guide created based on examinees ' input bears some similarity to studying from practice questions that may have been on a recent examination . the difference lies in the detail and specificity of the information conveyed . nevertheless , from the public 's perspective , both practices represent  shortcuts  for examination success . drivers of dishonest behavior . cheating in education and sports creates unfairness between  competitors .  unlike performance-enhancing drugs , the use of ritalin and valium to improve test performance is not considered cheating . difficulty concentrating and anxiety are perhaps considered abnormal disadvantages from which examinees deserve sparing . the unfairness perspective is reflected in a dean 's observation in the cnn report -- since use of reproduced questions is so pervasive , this norm does not cause any unfair advantage . unfortunately , 57 % of surveyed medical students claimed that others ' cheating had unfairly disadvantaged them . the difficult content of the radiology physics exam is one reason for the use of reproduced questions . for most physicians , the exhaustive study of biochemistry and pharmacology is a rite of passage based on knowledge rarely used . in fact , the physicians interviewed by cnn said that the necessity to demonstrate proficiency of arcane material unimportant for practice was a root cause of residents using reproduced questions for exam preparation . in other words : test content that medical students view as unnecessary for clinical care makes them more likely to cheat . of course , a desire to succeed underlies the decision to cheat : 40 % of 665 medical students across six schools admitted to doing something unethical to avoid a poor evaluation . however , fear of failure is not generally sufficient -- social context is important . academic dishonesty is strongly connected to peer behavior . many medical students believe certain forms of cheating can be justified if the motivation is to assist friends . of 2,459 medical students from 31 schools , 41 % had cheated during high school and 59 % thought that cheating was too common to eliminate . when misconduct becomes an established norm , as it apparently has among certifying residents , it does not become acceptable , but can be difficult to stop . how to limit unethical behavior . the use of reproduced questions for board examination preparation threatens medicine 's integrity and public trust . moreover , indisputably dishonest behaviors are far too common among trainees . punishments and honor codes do little to reduce academic dishonesty in medical education . responses to unethical acts have also been hampered by divergent opinions about the severity of specific violations and appropriate punishments . however , peer behavior has a strong impact on ethical decisions . the image of dermatology residents writing down test questions together in a restaurant suggests this has become an established norm . trainees find it more acceptable to engage in unethical conduct when their friends are as well . the best way to limit unethical behavior is to embed academic honesty into institutional cultures , perhaps through role models and curricula that emphasize the respect that a virtuous professional may earn . case-based ethics training may improve moral reasoning , although the impact on conduct is unknown . examination content must be highly relevant for the patient-care activities that will be endorsed . esoteric questions suggestive of academic hazing should be eliminated . not reusing test questions would reduce the incentive to reproduce questions in verbatim form , but might jeopardize the consistency of passing standards , while increasing expenses . in the end , successful certification must demonstrate that physicians are vested with the trust of both their peers and the public . sponsoring rigorous examinations that cover material critical for patient care will bolster what the profession provides patients . ultimately , the integrity of the medical profession and the faith that patients place in physicians demand the highest moral standards . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of gregory ruhnke .", "summary": " doctors were disciplined for sharing examination questions .   gregory ruhnke says cheating is surprisingly common among medical students .   he says cheating fosters behavior that can persist through doctor 's career .
