{"text": "landlords will now be able to shop around for the best deals when ordering beer , which could see the price of a pint fall . britain 's drinkers could see the price of a pint fall in the biggest shake-up of the pub industry in centuries . mps have voted to scrap the ` beer tie ' under which breweries that rented out pubs to landlords locked them into selling their beer . the surprise move means landlords will now be able to shop around to get the best deals when ordering beer . some experts say this could lead to consumers enjoying cheaper pints but pub groups claim it will mean less choice as they will have to close outlets and axe jobs because of lower profits . shares in enterprise inns , which has 5,500 pubs , fell 19 per cent yesterday , while rivals punch taverns lost the same amount . almost half of britain 's 50,000 pubs are ` tied houses ' , a controversial deal that forces landlords to pay over the odds for their beer . research by the campaign for real ale last year showed that tied licensees were paying around # 150 for a keg of fosters lager , which contains 11 gallons , compared with the wholesale price of # 85 . that 's a difference of 77 per cent , or 73p per pint . but pub firms claim they rent out their outlets at a discount so that tenants are able to get a foothold into the industry without having to start with large amounts of capital . some publicans have complained that such deals can be unfair and offer very low salaries , which led to the government suggesting plans for reform in june . however , official research showed that sweeping changes could lead to pub closures and job losses . with the sector having already suffered from the smoking ban and cheaper alcohol sold in supermarkets , no change was proposed . the coalition was then surprised on monday night when a backbench rebellion led to mps voting in favour of an amendment to the small business , enterprise and employment bill , by lib dem mp greg mulholland , that wiped out ` tied ' pubs . simon townsend , the chief executive of enterprise inns , said the amendment was a ` disproportionate ' response . embarrassed : minister jo swinson . ministers were assessing what went wrong yesterday after they suffered their first defeat on a coalition bill when 17 conservatives and 24 liberal democrats voted to help pubs buy cheaper beer . the government had opposed plans to make it easier for pubs to buy drinks from different brewers , but it was left embarrassed after whips failed to head off the backbench rebellion . chief whip michael gove faced shouts of ` resign ' as the coalition suffered its first legislative defeat since 2010 . matt hancock , one of the ministers responsible for the bill , was reportedly seen ` grovelling ' to the prime minister after an amendment was passed by 284 votes to 259 . the rebellion was particularly embarrassing for lib dem business minister jo swinson , who had spoken for the government during the debate . the rebels included her husband , duncan hames . a number of mps who were absent for the vote were thought to have been on the campaign trail in rochester and strood for today 's crucial by-election . in january 2013 , the tories were defeated in the commons on plans to redraw constituency boundaries before 2015 , but that bill had not been brought jointly with the lib dems . ` we continue to believe the tie offers the best operating model for the vast majority of our publicans , ' he said . ` we take a flexible approach to all our lease and tenancy agreements . in light of the vote we will continue to assess all options to safeguard the interests of publicans and shareholders . ' stephen billingham , executive chairman of punch taverns , said : ` punch has been at the forefront of improving the support for pub tenants and we remain committed to a sustainable future for british pubs . however , the amended bill would have significant , adverse consequences for britain 's community pubs . ' david forde , managing director of heineken , said : ` what the great british pub needs most is sustained investment to improve standards and attract more customers . ' analysts at barclays estimate a switch of all pubs from rent only could hit profits at enterprise and punch by 19 per cent and 24 per cent respectively . the pub groups are considering a legal challenge and the changes are expected to be fiercely debated in the house of lords . if the bill gets royal assent the change will be gradual , with pubs withdrawing from the beer tie as contracts expire and are renegotiated .", "summary": " price of a pint could fall after mp 's vote to scrap ` beer tie '   pubs rented from breweries no longer locked into buying their beer .   landlords will now be able to shop around to get the best deals .   pub groups claim lower profits will see outlets close and jobs axed .
