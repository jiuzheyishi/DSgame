{"text": "the businessman who has built his own toll road around a road closure in somerset should be knighted in the next honours ' list . he is an inspiration . by taking matters into his own hands to solve the chaos caused by a 14-mile diversion on a busy commuter route , mike watts has set a shining example to anyone who has ever moaned about public services . faced with months of roadworks and upheaval , and the loss of business at the party supplies shop he runs with his wife wendy in bath , the pioneering 52-year-old did n't just complain . scroll down for video . mike watts at the kelston toll road , which be built after becoming sick of roadworks causing massive detours . enterprising : he spent # 150,000 on the gravel track next to the a431 in kelston and charges driver # 2 a day . he put his money and his effort where his mouth is , rented a nearby field and built an alternative road to allow traffic to bypass the closure , charging drivers # 2 each way . he spent # 150,000 on the gravel track next to the a431 in kelston and says he will probably spend that again to maintain it . he says he only wants to break even before december when the council is due to re-open the proper road , which was closed after a landslip . of course , the council has been quick to question his efforts , citing that mealy-mouthed old staple -- health and safety . rather than thanking him , they 've subjected mr watts to all sorts of snooty checks and inspections . well , they must be furious . they have been utterly humiliated by him . he has shown up the jobsworths at the town hall who say a road closure can not possibly be dealt with swiftly and efficiently -- by sorting it out swiftly and efficiently himself . but it 's not just the council that should sit up and take notice of this have-a-go-hero . if you ask me , this is a lesson for us all about what can be achieved if individuals stop whingeing about parlous public services and take action . he spent # 150,000 on the gravel track next to the a431 in kelston and says he will probably spend that again to maintain it . the motto for the toll road is ` helping to keep bath and bristol on track ' mr watts only wants to break even before december when the council is due to re-open the proper road . mr watt 's pioneering spirit is a tonic in an age where , all too frequently , we seem resigned to failure . too often in this country , apathy holds the day . we brits are too good at enduring bad service . typically , we mutter crossly under our breaths , forgetting that we once possessed a blitz spirit that made ordinary citizens capable of great feats of endeavour to keep this country going against the odds . i wonder sometimes if we have been brainwashed into believing the nonsense we are fed by officials . the fact is that the authorities who fob us off with laughable excuses about unfathomable train delays or roadworks that have been dragging on for years need more people like mr watts to put the proverbial boot up their behinds . source of the trouble : the a431 near bath , which is closed until december . thankfully , there are encouraging signs that mr watts may not be alone , that our spirit of defiance and perseverance may be re-emerging -- chiefly , i might say , through the efforts of the middle-aged and the elderly . take retired grandmother margo kirk , for example . fed up with a lack of bus services to and from her dorset village two years ago , mrs kirk , 63 , decided to start her own . just five months later , the community of milborne st andrew had a new service called bus2go . people in tiverton , devon , have been repairing potholes themselves after becoming fed up with a bumpy road that damaged their vehicles . it might sound daunting at first , but collipriest lane was easily improved after 16 households donated # 10 each to buy asphalt to patch potholes caused by heavy traffic . in highgate , north london , residents recently employed their own private security firm to patrol their streets after a spate of break-ins . having asked police for more patrols to no avail , those living in sheldon avenue and stormont road decided to pay for a private firm to patrol their streets in a security van . police have now had to admit that there has been a sharp fall in burglaries and vehicle crime in the area since the patrol was set up . aerial view showing the kelston toll road on the left and the main road on the right . in and around the lancashire village of wennington , 100 or so locals -- most grey-haired -- are so fed up of waiting on the government 's promises of high-speed internet broadband that they embarked on a voluntary community project to lay the necessary fibre optic cables themselves , digging trenches and connecting homes . and in essex , residents frustrated by long waits to see a gp are trying to start their own medical centre . the bid to run a gp surgery funded directly by the community in wivenhoe is particularly intriguing because it has echoes of the free schools initiative started by former education secretary michael gove . if parents can set up a school where there is sufficient local demand , why not have the same principle for gp surgeries , or for hospitals , parks , policing and bin collections for that matter ? if people are prepared to put in the effort , could this be the future of public services ? realistically , until there is a sea change in funding principles , public-spirited individuals will have to bear the cost . but it need not be a deterrent . in south london , where i live , i have often thought how liberating it would be if the residents of my street could club together to hire a private garden-waste collector . ' i am convinced businessman mike watts lead the way in showing us it is worth the effort ' writes melissa kite . lambeth council charges # 35 a year to issue us with green canvas bags stamped with a permit which we must fill with our hedge clippings and grass cuttings . but even though the service is on top of our council tax , they often refuse to take bags for petty reasons . i was once told my bag could n't be collected because it was ` contaminated ' -- an inch-long piece of cellophane from a cigarette packet was on the top of the greenery . it must have blown into the bag which was left on the street for collection . but the council still refused to take it . why should we put up with this nonsense ? it would only take a man with a van for hire to drive along the street once a week to collect garden trimmings and take them to the local dump -- then we would be free of this horrendous meddling . we could easily pay him with the money for the council 's garden waste collection permits . and we would be treated as proper customers -- unlikely to be refused service for ` infringements ' . with a little fine tuning we could extend the principle to other kinds of waste , perhaps starting with bulky items binmen wo n't normally touch . the possibilities are endless . i often wonder what might be achieved if people stopped demanding action and took action themselves . recently , i have been involved in a campaign in surrey , where i ride horses , to save a local beauty spot which is being increasingly abused by people who want to have sex in public . ` of course , the council has been quick to question his efforts , citing that mealy-mouthed old staple -- health and safety ' the so-called ` dogging ' site at ockham common just off the a3 has deteriorated over the years until there are now people openly performing sex acts near picnic areas where there are children playing . walkers , horse-riders and parents have been fobbed off by the police , who say they have n't the resources to put in cctv cameras -- and intimate that they do n't want to install them anyway , because the doggers are a minority who have the right to express their sexual orientation . perhaps we could club together and install our own cameras . the police would probably take action then -- against us . but it would be an interesting test case if it went to court and it might embarrass the authorities into making sure the beauty spot reverts to its rightful use . if those who rule us do not do what they ought to do , the public will do it instead . we might be accused of meddling or taking the law into our own hands , but i am not advocating that we all become vigilantes . all i am saying is that sensible initiatives taken by a public at its wits ' end because of official inertia can work wonders -- and might even shock bureaucrats into pulling their socks up . needless to say , it is a blasted cheek that taxpayers have to stump up money and put in their own effort to sort out the neglected state services we 've already paid for . but i am convinced businessman mike watts -- along with all the local entrepreneurs who have restored bus services , filled potholes and demanded their own surgery -- lead the way in showing us it is worth the effort . perhaps this is what david cameron meant when he talked about the big society . if so , he will surely be delighted to hear that his idea is finally getting off the ground .", "summary": " businessman mike watts spent # 150,000 of his own money to build toll .   it was after part of the a431 in kelston , somerset collapsed and closed .   he took matters in own hands to solve chaos caused by 14-mile diversion .   mr watts has shown up council ` jobsworths ' who say road ca n't be fixed .
