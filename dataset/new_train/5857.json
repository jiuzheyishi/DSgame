{"text": "the food and drug administration has announced that it will require manufacturers of zolpidem , a popular sleeping pill commonly sold as brands including ambien and edluar , to reduce recommended dosages amid concerns about morning drowsiness caused by the pills . new research released thursday shows that the drugs remains in the bloodstream at levels high enough to interfere with alertness and coordination , which increases the risk of car accidents . regulators are ordering drug manufacturers to cut the dose of the medications in half for women , who process the drug more slowly . hidden dangers : new research shows that zolpidem remains in the bloodstream at levels high enough to interfere with alertness and coordination . the fda has recommended drug companies reduce the recommended dosage of ambien because it causes morning drowsiness . doses will be lowered from 10 milligrams to 5 milligrams for regular products , and 12.5 milligrams to 6.25 milligrams for extended-release formulations . the fda is recommending that manufacturers apply these lower doses to men as well , though it is not making them a requirement . a scripps health study published in the british medical journal last year found that sleeping pill usage may have contributed to as many as 500,000 ` excess deaths ' in the united states in 2010 , and noted that sleeping pill users have a fivefold increased risk of ` early death . ' the new doses apply to all insomnia treatments containing the drug zolpidem , which is sold under different brands including ambien , edluar , zolpimist , stilnox , sublinox and in generic forms . it is the most widely prescribed sleeping aid in the u.s. . the changes do n't affect other popular sleeping medicines like lunesta and sonata , which use different drugs . fda officials pointed out that all sleeping drugs carry warnings about drowsiness . morning drowsiness caused by sleeping pills containing zolpidem has been found to interfere with alertness and coordination , increasing the risk of car accidents . ambien has been blamed for high-profile driving accidents involving tom brokaw and kerry kennedy . ` all sleep drugs have the potential . to cause this , so health professionals should prescribe - and patients . should take - the lowest dose that is capable of preventing insomnia , ' said dr. ellis unger , a director in fda 's office of drug evaluation . unger added that the fda will begin requiring developers of sleep drugs to conduct driving simulation studies going forward . ambien . has been blamed for several recent high-profile driving accidents in . the past year , including tom brokaw in september and kerry kennedy in . july . the fda has received more than 700 reports of driving-related problems connected to zolpidem over the years . ` but in most cases it was very difficult to determine if the driving impairment was actually related to zolpidem , ' unger said . ` usually the reports did not contain information about when the accident happened or how much time had lapsed since taking the drug . ' the agency decided to take action after recent driving simulation studies showed that , in some patients , drug levels remained high enough to cause difficulty driving . the data came from company studies of intermezzo , a new form of zolpidem which was approved in 2011 for people who wake late at night and ca n't get back to sleep . the data showed that 33 percent of women and 25 percent of men taking extended-release zolpidem had enough of the drug in their blood to interfere with driving as much as eight hours later . zolpidem is present in sleeping aids including zolpimist and has been found to have a much stronger effect on women than men . when the dose was cut in half only 15 percent of women and five percent of men had those same drug levels . fda analysis was unable to determine why women metabolize zolpidem so much more slowly than men . according to fda staff , the difference can not be accounted for by usual factors like size and weight . for now , patients should continue taking their currently prescribed dose until they can talk to their doctor about the best way to proceed . ` we really do n't want people to change the dose they 're on . we want them to talk to their health care provider , ' unger said . ambien is marketed by sanofi , intermezzo by purdue pharma lp and zolpimist by novadel pharma inc. .", "summary": " the fda is forcing manufacturers of zolpidem , commonly sold as ambien , to reduce recommended dosages after tests found it stays in the bloodstream .   tests also found that women process the drug much slower than men .   ambien is the most widely prescribed sleeping aid in the u.s.   it has been blamed for several .   recent high-profile driving accidents , including tom .   brokaw and kerry kennedy .
