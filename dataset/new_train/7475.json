{"text": "the 380-million-year-old fossils of pre-historic fish could help scientists explain how the modern-day ` six pack ' evolved . swedish researchers found that the ` miraculously preserved ' placoderm fish from north west australia had well-developed powerful abdominal muscles ` not unlike the human . equivalents displayed on the beaches of the world every summer ' . and this gives scientist a rare opportunity to understand how modern-day abs have developed . rare soft tissue samples have been found by swedish scientists in the fossils of fish from the gogo formation of north western australia . they show that the jawed fishes had strong neck and abdominal muscles . placodermi comes from the greek for ` plate-skinned ' they are an extinct class of prehistoric fish which lived around 400 million years ago - from the late silurian to the end of the devonian period . their head and thorax were covered by articulated armoured plates and the rest of the body was scaled or naked , depending on the species . placoderms were among the first jawed fish and their jaws are thought to have evolved from their gill arches . a 380-million-year-old fossil of one species represents the oldest known example of live birth . the fish were found in the gogo . formation , a sedimentary rock formation in the kimberley region of north-western australia . the area is renowned for being a trove of preserved fossil . fishes including the placoderms - an extinct group that includes some of the earliest jawed fishes . researchers from uppsala university in sweden made this latest discovery and found that the muscle and soft tissue were well preserved . the strong abdominal muscles that swedish scientists believe would have featured in the jawed fish of the australian gogo formation are ` not unlike ' those seen in modern-day human six-packs , such as daniel craig 's in bond film casino royale , pictured . bones and teeth fossilise far more easily . than soft tissues and are usually the only traces of the animal that . remain . this makes the rare fossil localities that preserve soft tissues . - such as the one discovered by the swedish university - all the more valuable . the team , led by professor per ahlberg noticed that the fish would have had a well-developed neck musculature as well as powerful abdominal muscles . living fish , by contrast , usually have a rather simple body musculature without such specialisations . ahlberg said : ` this -lsb- discovery -rsb- shows that vertebrates developed a sophisticated musculature much earlier than we had thought . ` it . also cautions against thinking that we can interpret fossil organisms . simply by metaphorically draping their skeletons in the soft tissues of . living relatives . ' australian researchers had previously . discovered that these fossils contained soft tissue . now with the . help of ahlberg 's team and the esrf synchrotron in grenoble , france , they have managed to resconstruct the . musulcature of the fish . an artist 's impression of what the placoderm fish that the australian fossils came from would have looked like . placoderms were among the first jawed fish and their jaws are thought to have evolved from their gill arches . their name comes from the greek for ` plate-skinned '", "summary": " rare soft tissue taken from fish fossils found in north west australia show that the fish had powerful abdominal muscles .   swedish scientists claim that these are not unlike those muscles found in human six packs .   living fish have simple body musculature meaning scientists can use this discovery to track how abs changed and evolved .
