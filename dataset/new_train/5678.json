{"text": "train punctuality has tumbled to its lowest level for two years - and railway officials do not expect to meet their targets for arriving on time until the end of the decade . the admission comes despite the announcement of plans to invest # 37.5 billion into the rail network - which will require several more years of inflation-busting price hikes . according to data released by network rail , train punctuality has never consistently reached its target of 92.5 per cent , and stood at just 85.3 per cent in november/december 2012 . just two of the 15 private rail operators hit the punctuality target in the latest period , with several - particularly those running long-distance lines - recording figures of no better than 80 per cent . punctuality : the blue line shows what proportion of trains arrive on time month-by-month ; the red line shows a moving annual average ; and the green line shows the trains arriving within one minute of schedule . the figures record a train as being late if it is more than five minutes behind schedule for a short-distance service , or 10 minutes for long-distance . alternative statistics measuring how often trains arrived within one minute of their scheduled time show that just 57.1 per cent of service are precisely on time - a number falling to 41.9 per cent for long-distance services . when nr announced its development plans for 2014-19 , it admitted that the 92.5 per cent target would not be met until the end of that period . the company resisted pressure to set a more ambitious target - and warned that ` increasingly congested ' trains would make it hard to make any further progress on punctuality . expansion : new plans to upgrade britain 's train systems have been announced by network rail . ` we want to do better than that , but we are facing up to some problems that come with success - that is , more trains and more passengers on an increasingly congested network , ' a spokesman said . ` even the smallest delay at busy times can cause a ripple effect which disrupts passengers several hours later , hundreds of miles away . ' despite the failure to increase the number of trains arriving on time over the past two years , nr 's plans for britain 's trains assume that fares will continue to rise by one per cent above inflation . its scheme for the next seven years was announced yesterday , just days after most fares went up by an average of 4.2 per cent . a top railway official said the plan was dependent on fares rising each year at a rate of one per cent above the rpi inflation rate , and added that any change to that assumption would require a larger subsidy from the taxpayer . the subsidy is instead scheduled to fall to no more than # 2.9 billion by 2019 , down from # 4.5 billion a decade earlier . tight squeeze : nr hopes to introduce 170,000 extra seats on the morning commute . given the size of the national deficit and the government 's commitment to fiscal austerity , ministers are unlikely to reverse their course on reducing the subsidy . the nr plan for 2014-19 will provide 170,000 extra morning commuter seats at peak times , including a 20 per cent increase on services into central london . the firm also envisages 225million more passengers per year travelling by 2019 , and 355,000 more trains in service . specific projects include various electrification schemes , such as the great western and midland main lines , station improvements at birmingham and reading , and reopening 31 miles of railways in scotland closed under the beeching cuts 50 years ago . nr chief executive sir david higgins warned that the railway network had ` entered an era of trade-offs ' and would have to compromise over the various demands made on it . ` increasingly we have to balance the need to build more infrastructure , run trains on time and cut costs , and in many areas choices will need to be made , ' he said .", "summary": " just 85.3 % of trains arrived on time in december despite 92.5 % target .   network rail announces target will not be met until 2019 .   fares will continue to rise by rpi plus 1 % for rest of the decade .
