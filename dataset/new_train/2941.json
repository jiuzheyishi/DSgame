{"text": "britney spears ' latest album is supposed to be intimate , but it 's left a number of critics cold . the 32-year-old singer 's eighth record ,  britney jean ,  was officially released on tuesday after streaming on itunes for the past week . as early reactions indicated ,  britney jean  is n't quite as warm and inviting as spears has made it sound .  i poured my heart and soul into this album ,  spears told her fans in an open letter on her website .  i know i keep telling you it is my most personal record yet , but it 's true and i 'm really proud of that . i have been through a lot in the past few years and it has really inspired me to dig deeper and write songs that i think everyone can relate to .  yet to entertainment weekly , which gave the album a b + grade ,  britney jean   tells you virtually bupkus about her struggles over the years . but in just 10 tidy songs , it brings us closer than ever before to that distant dreamer .  the washington post was n't as gentle in its review , finding that the ironic lack of intimacy on  britney jean  makes the disc  instantly forgettable .   the result is n't remotely personal , does n't venture much beyond the usual britney themes -- fame is confusing , sex is fun , i am a totally normal person with the same worries as you , let 's dance -- and will do nothing to reassure anyone that the once familiar , pre-2007 britney is in there anywhere ,  the review says . the atlantic agrees , dismissing  britney jean  as spears '  most disappointing release yet , a snoozefest of shallow mid-tempos and limp club tracks that chase trends rather than invent them . and the glimpses into britney jean spears , the artist , are , frankly , neither interesting nor informative .  the los angeles times warns that  whatever unique skills spears once had -- what were they again , anyway ? -- ` britney jean ' suggests she better prepare herself for the reality that she 's losing them fast . ... there 's very little beneath the album 's many cliches to suggest insight , let alone the unfiltered honesty of autobiography .  that said , if you 're a fan of post-2007 spears , which includes the smash album  blackout ,  then  britney jean  might be your cup of dance-pop tea . rolling stone gave spears ' effort three-and-a-half stars , appraising  britney jean  as continuing  the roll she 's been on in recent years . ... like her excellent late-summer electro-sleaze hit , ` work b *** h , ' ` britney jean ' adds up the high price of stardom . it 's a concept album about the loneliness of pop life -- with a high-profile broken engagement behind her , brit gets personal and drops her most bummed-out music ever .  mtv , too , was able to see the heart underneath the driving beat .  most of the tracks sound like a wild night out ,  the network said in an early review . but added  it 's when you dig under all the reverb and edm beats that you hear that ` britney jean ' really is coming from her heart -- one beating at 500 miles an hour . ", "summary": " britney spears ' eighth studio album was released on december 3 .   the record ,  britney jean ,  is intended to be more intimate .   yet some critics have found the disc to be impenetrable .
