{"text": "a high-performing primary school has missed out on ofsted 's top grade after being judged too english . pupils at the rural primary lacked ` first-hand experience of the diverse make-up of modern british society ' , declared the watchdog . however , around 97 per cent of the population in the town to which the school belongs are white . middle rasen primary school in market rasen , lincolnshire , has missed out on an ` outstanding ' rating from ofsted because it is ` too english ' . pictured : headteacher melonie brunton -lrb- back middle -rrb- with pupils . inspectors penalised the 104-pupil school for not being multicultural enough , despite 97 per cent of the town being white and the majority of pupils not being from ethnic backgrounds . ofsted refused it an ` outstanding ' rating and graded it ` good ' instead . it said the school was failing to do enough to ensure pupils understand the ` cultural diversity of modern british society ' and experience ` first-hand interaction with counterparts from different backgrounds ' . but parents complained middle rasen primary in market rasen was being punished for factors outside its control and had effectively been told it was ` too english ' . the row is the latest controversy over new rules on teaching ` british values ' introduced in the wake of the trojan horse scandal , in which muslim extremists tried to infiltrate schools in birmingham . schools are required to ` actively promote ' british values such as democracy , tolerance , mutual respect , individual liberty and the rule of law . however the rules -- and ofsted 's enforcement of them -- have brought criticism from some schools and faith groups . a christian school in reading says it was warned it could face closure for failing to invite imams and other religious leaders to take assemblies . in another case , a roman catholic school in east anglia was marked down for failing to do enough to ` teach students about the dangers of extremism and radicalisation ' , although the report was later withdrawn . head melonie brunton -lrb- left -rrb- said ofsted 's comments were a backlash against the so-called trojan horse plot , while rev charles patrick -lrb- right -rrb- , former head of governors , said town did not have many non-white residents . the 104-pupil middle rasen primary , in the town of market rasen on the edge of the lincolnshire wolds , was inspected last month . ofsted praised it for high standards of teaching and leadership and the courteous and enthusiastic behaviour of pupils . but the inspector said : ` the large majority of pupils are white british . very few are from other ethnic groups , and currently no pupils speak english as an additional language . ' it said the school should ` extend pupils ' understanding of the cultural diversity of modern british society by creating opportunities for them to have first-hand interaction with their counterparts from different backgrounds ' . elsewhere , the small school had been highly praised in the report for its management and teaching , plus its well-behaved , courteous and enthusiastic pupils . yesterday parents attacked the ofsted decision . mother-of-two kirsty egen , 29 , said : ` i think it 's ridiculous . it 's a brilliant school . ` why would the school spend time on trying to teach the children how to integrate with people who are n't even there ? it seems very vindictive to just mark them down for something they can not change . ' jodie miller , 35 , whose daughter dylann , six , attends the school added : ` we are a small rural community , there just are n't many children here from different backgrounds . ' the town -lrb- pictured -rrb- is believed to be made up of about 97 per cent white residents , but the school was told that pupils should be more exposed to a range of different backgrounds . julia weeks , 47 , who has a son of ten at the school , said : ` to mark a school down for something they can not control is crackers . if there were more people from ethnic minorities around then maybe you could have a complaint , but there just are n't . ' father-of-one benjamin bannan , 33 , added : ` it 's outrageous that a british school can he punished for being too british . ' head teacher melonie brunton said the school was now looking to partner with an inner-city school in an effort to comply with ofsted 's recommendation . ` ofsted are very keen on british values , ' she said . ` we were very pleased to have got the very positive comments . we are a rural lincolnshire school and that is always going to be an issue . ' ofsted said : ` we judged this school to be good across all areas , including teaching quality and pupils ' behaviour . all schools must teach pupils about fundamental british values . ' jodie miller , pictured with daughter dylann , said it was ` bizarre ' for ofsted to ` punish ' the school for being ` too english ' father-of-one benjamin bannan , 33 , added : ` its outrageous that a british school can be punished for being too british . it just does n't make sense at all . ` we would welcome people from different cultures with open arms i 'm sure - but there just are n't any ethnic minorities around here . ' ms brunton said the school would look to look to partner with an inner-city school to develop their understanding of multicultural issues . she said : ` we would have liked to be ` outstanding ' but we were very pleased to have got the very positive comments . ` we all worked really hard - everybody , the staff and the pupils have worked hard . ' i think the problem is that we are a rural lincolnshire school and that is always going to be an issue . i agree that we could do more and we are trying to get a partnership with an inner city school . ' the head said school trips usually involve visits to the countryside , such as farms and zoos . but they recently had a trip to derby , which included a mosque visit as well as touring the rolls-royce factory . she added : ` we try to do things but not enough . i felt the ofsted comments were a backlash against the birmingham trojan horse issue and ofsted are very keen on british values . ' reverend charles patrick , who was head of the governors at the time of the report , added : ` there is always more that you can do and maybe now we look at twinning the school with ones from other minority areas or something like that . ` but this is a rural area , like 80 per cent of the country , we do n't have many non white residents . perhaps it would be a different matter if we were in the middle of london or manchester or something . ' tory mp for gainsborough sir edward leigh said : ` this is political correctness gone mad . ` middle rasen primary school is an outstanding school by any standards , and melonie brunton is a brilliant headteacher - i back the school and its head one-hundred percent . ` just last week i wrote to nicky morgan , the education secretary , objecting strenuously to the new so-called ` equality ' regulations she is implementing in schools . ` conservatives have always stood for freeing our schools from the deadening hand of state-enforced orthodoxy . ` why there has been such a massive u-turn under nicky morgan is inexplicable to me . ` multiculturalism is an irrelevance in lincolnshire with its low number of ethnic minorities , who are already welcomed and well-integrated into our local communities , as they should be . ' a spokesman for ofsted reiterated that it was not the only factor in depriving the school of its ` outstanding ' rating . he said : ` we judged this school to be good across all areas including leadership and management , teaching quality , and pupils ' behaviour and safety . ` all schools must teach pupils about fundamental british values including mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs . ` that way they will be prepared for the future wherever they go . ' according to the office for national statistics , the latest census from 2011 shows the demographic of the 5,417 people living in market rasen is chiefly white british . under the country of birth , the statistics show 5,165 were born in the uk . there were 90 people born in eu countries , with 29 born in africa and 62 born in the middle east and asia . there were just 30 people born in the americas and the caribbean , while nine were born in oceania . under the category entitled ` ethnic group ' , 5,200 people were white british , while 23 were white irish . there were 76 people under the category of white other . there were just 16 residents of mixed white and black ethnicity , with 16 of mixed white and asian ethnicity . there were 17 of indian ethnicity and 19 of chinese ethnicity . there were 22 of black , african , caribbean or black british origin . in terms of main languages spoken , there were 5,246 people who classed english as their first language . just 24 had another european language as their first language - including romanian , lithuanian , greek , swedish and danish - while another 27 had their first language marked as an east asian language .", "summary": " report said pupils at middle rasen primary school in lincolnshire lacked ` first-hand experience ' of modern british society .   said pupils should interact with ` counterparts from different backgrounds '   but parents criticised ` bizarre ' decision because small town is 97 % white .   ` very few ' at the 104-pupil school are from ethnic groups , report says .   headteacher believes comments are reaction to so-called trojan horse plot .
