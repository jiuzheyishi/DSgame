{"text": "on the subject of silvio berlusconi italians and non-italians are , to paraphrase george bernard-shaw 's famous quip about britain and america , divided by a common political language . we think we share the view that in a political world dominated by mass communications , there is little room for forgiveness about scandals , or other personal failures , or a poor record in office . yet on those grounds , berlusconi should have died a political death long ago , rather than coming a very close second in this week 's italian elections . foreigners , perhaps , will always remain baffled by berlusconi 's success in continuing to attract voters . but italians , horrified by him though plenty of them are , tend to be a lot less surprised . that is because they think of him in context , rather than in isolation . in italian politics , the context is all . what this means , and what it meant for berlusconi 's remarkable feat in nearly doubling his share of the vote between his opinion poll ratings in november 2012 and the election itself , can be laid out in the following evidently misleading indicators : . he makes unbelievable promises . in part this is true : one of berlusconi 's traits is his willingness to say one thing today and the opposite tomorrow , to attract attention from different groups or on different occasions , totally without shame . italians know this , and those who support him tend to see it as an endearing part of his character , part of his desire to entertain and to please . but also it is misleading : the key promise he made during the 2013 election campaign was entirely believable -- that he would cut or even abolish a dreaded property tax , known by its italian initials as imu . his record makes him untrustworthy . yes , on overall economic policy . but not on taxes . he has promised to cut them before , and has delivered on at least some of those promises . the promise to cut imu was made in an incredibly artful way , as he wrote to voters saying he would pay them back for the tax from his own pocket , which very few will have believed . but that did not matter : it drew attention to the proposal in an eye-catching way , and reinforced the only important point -- that he would cut the tax . opinion : italy 's election leaves country , and eurozone , on financial high-wire . he is irresponsible . yes , but so is almost everyone to the cynical italian political mind . his plan for how to finance this tax cut had as many holes in it as a sieve , but that did not really matter . it would have to be financed by taxes on other people , or cuts in spending on other things . fine , said his voters : at least this awful tax will go . in offering a relentless focus on that tax , he showed that he was listening to the pain of his voters and taking them seriously , rather than talking down to them like most other parties . his trials and sex scandals make him a national shame . not really , though at times his behavior has stretched even the italian tolerance . but the context is important : plenty of people think the justice system works disastrously badly in italy , so if berlusconi is caught up in it -- like so many others -- then so what ? and his sex scandals are really part of his own marketing plan : he cavorts with scantily clad young women in order to make himself look glamorous , young , entertaining and happy . moreover , his antics with women act as a distraction from his other weaknesses , like a kind of tranquillizer for those who might otherwise get angry with him . a lot of italians , especially young women , hate him for this . but enough either do n't care or are sympathetic enough to him to mean that this does not harm him fatally in political terms . his opponents are more statesmanlike and responsible . yes , that is true of mario monti , the caretaker prime minister for the past year who then decided to run in the elections with a centrist list of candidates . but it is not particularly true of his big opponents -- including the left-wing democratic party , which has its own scandals , its own selfish interests and , during the election campaign , its own evidence of the abuse of political power in the case of italy 's third-largest -lrb- and oldest -rrb- bank , monte dei paschi di siena , whose business was allegedly run and distorted in the interests of local democratic party politicians in that area . so the pd -lrb- by its italian initials -rrb- is also viewed as selfish by the public , neutralizing berlusconi 's disadvantage on that measure . since both the pd leader , pier luigi bersani , and monti are dull , leaden communicators who failed to offer any positive , hopeful message for their voters , the way was opened for berlusconi . news : italy seeks way out of political chaos . only one party in the election really stood for change : the five star movement of beppe grillo . this meant that berlusconi 's old-fashioned , tax-cutting message , geared towards preserving his own political power , had plenty of space in which to operate . and although berlusconi did not stand for change , he was at least cheerful , smiling and entertaining . politics is now all about personalities , as was shown by the rise of grillo , but he and berlusconi are opposites in this regard . it is true that the discrediting of traditional political parties , combined with the preeminence of television , has given personalities a huge advantage in italian politics , even if neither the pd nor monti seemed able to grasp this . personalities and even personal stories breed attention and loyalty , even if from different groups . one of the last italian politicians to understand and exploit this was , unfortunately , benito mussolini . oh , and did i forget to mention that berlusconi owns italy 's three main commercial tv channels and its biggest advertising sales agency , and has billions of euros in cash to hand around to supporters and allies ? well , that is n't a misleading indicator . but it is a reason , perhaps too obvious to dwell upon , for berlusconi 's continuing success at the ripe old age of 76 .", "summary": " scandal-plagued three time ex-premier silvio berlusconi finished second in italy 's election .   italians and non-italians have very different views of berlusconi , argues journalist bill emmott .   for all his faults , emmott says berlusconi did better than most at listening to his voters .
