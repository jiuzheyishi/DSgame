{"text": "is a chronic disease for which there will be no remission or survival . many of us do n't realize that 20 % to 30 % of all breast cancer cases will become metastatic . i know this personally because i experienced it with my mom , elizabeth , when she was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer in 2007 . my mother was warm , funny and smart . in her response to living with advanced breast cancer , her most striking quality was her extraordinary strength . when she was first diagnosed with early stage breast cancer in 2004 , she had hope and determination that we would fight the cancer and win . and we did , for a short time , at least . when it returned as metastatic disease during the start of the 2008 presidential campaign , our family felt disappointment and shock , but my mom 's hope remained intact . even though she knew the disease was not cureable , she was inspired to make sure her remaining time on earth had meaning . she relished making each and every day count for herself and for the people she loved . one of her goals , and mine , was that her positive days would outnumber the negative ones . and we certainly accomplished that goal . living with hope , however , requires a great deal of effort for those who are confronted with this disease . advanced breast cancer is different than early stage breast cancer because the treatment path is much more winding . with early stage breast cancer , we knew that there was a treatment path and only one objective -- we wanted the cancer gone . we could set our lives aside briefly and threw everything we had at the disease . my mom was invested in the best treatment , no matter how aggressive ; and as her daughter , i was invested in her survival regardless of the short-term cost to us . advanced breast cancer was a very different experience . this time my mom 's treatment path seemed more daunting and there was no clear timeline to guide us ; the cancer would be with us for the remainder of her life . unlike with early stage breast cancer , we needed to make peace with that fact . instead of putting life off , my mom did the opposite . she lived with purpose and created meaningful moments , not knowing how many days we would have left . time is actually a bit of a paradox for people living with advanced cancer and for those who support them . on the one hand , we are grateful for time and want nothing but more of it . on the other hand , that very uncertainty about how much time is left can leave patients and their loved ones reeling with anxiety . for example , if my mom had a headache or back pain , our imaginations could run wild .  was this the sign of a tumor progression ?   did this mean our time was drawing near ?  this would remain an underlying fear until her next scan , when -lrb- as my mom would say -rrb- , we hoped she did n't  light up like a christmas tree .  but despite this reality of advanced breast cancer , or perhaps because of it , we embraced each day we had together . the value of that embrace , even if it was just being there , together , was one of the most important lessons i learned from advanced breast cancer . i was n't living in the same state with my mom during her years with advanced breast cancer , but we talked often by phone and she always knew i was there for her . and she was there for me too , always telling me ,  do n't forget about yourself .  she recognized the support i was giving her . but as my mother , she also wanted to continue giving me love and support and encouragement to keep following my dreams . as her daughter , at times as her caregiver , i never felt like there was quite enough i could do . but for both of us , the simple act of being together was what mattered . though my mom passed away nearly three years ago , i am still a part of a very important community . today , i want to raise awareness about the unique challenges that face those living with advanced breast cancer . and i do mean living . many of these women are caring for small children , still working and planning for future life events like weddings and grandchildren . their focus , like my mom 's , is making each day count . that is why advanced breast cancer needs not only dollars to help fuel research advances , but solid support from all of us -- family , friends , co-workers or anyone touched by the disease . and that is why i 've joined the count us , know us , join us program to help amplify the voice for the advanced breast cancer community . i 'm asking everyone to join in with me and support a community that so desperately needs a voice . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of cate edwards .", "summary": " october is breast cancer awareness month ; nearly 300,000 women will be diagnosed .   cate edwards : 20 to 30 % of all breast cancer cases will become metastatic .   she says her mother , who died from breast cancer , lived bravely while fighting cancer .   edwards : i ask all of you to join me in an effort to support those living with breast cancer .
