{"text": "every sport has its gods . in boxing it 's muhammad ali , in soccer it 's brazil 's pele and in basketball it 's michael jordan , but this week india , already a country with no shortage of deities , paid homage to cricket legend sachin tendulkar . the 40-year-old 's final bow as a professional cricketer came saturday as india completed an innings and 186 run victory over the west indies on his home wankhede stadium in mumbai . tendulkar 's part in the proceedings on the final day amounted to a couple of overs of bowling , cheered to the rafters by a packed stadium , which could have sold out 10 times over . after the final west indies wicket fell , a tearful tendulkar held court with an emotional speech in which he thanked everyone who had supported him , particularly his father , who passed away in 1999 .  without his guidance i do n't think i would be standing in front of you ,  he said . tributes also followed for his mother , his wife anjali and their two children before he turned his attention to his fanatical following in india .  i know there are so many guys who 've fasted for me , prayed for me , done all sorts of things for me . without all that life would n't have been like this for me ,  he said .  i want to thank you from the bottom of my heart and say that time has gone by rather quickly , but the memories that you 've left with me will always be with me forever and ever .  many in the crowd were left in tears and they roared out his name in approval , grateful for his incredible career which saw him become the first man to score 100 international centuries . a further century proved out of tendulkar 's reach in his final test , dismissed for 74 friday as india took command of a match they wrapped up the next day to win the series 2-0 . our god . but his fans will forgive him this relative  failure  because tendulkar is not just a sports star , but also an icon in a country of more than 1.2 billion people . his fans often wave placards at matches that read ,  cricket is my religion and sachin is my god .  himself a devout hindu , the diminutive 5-feet 5-inch all-rounder was well-known throughout his career as a modest superstar who never lost his cool either at the batting crease or in front of the cameras and fans . former india captain rahul dravid told cnn that tendulkar would be remembered as  the benchmark  against which all the nation 's cricketers measured themselves . in a game where 100 runs -- or a century -- is regarded as the high-water mark of batting achievement in any match at any level , tendulkar last year reached 100 hundreds at international level and now holds almost all coveted batting records except for cricket legend don bradman 's career average of 99.94 runs . even  the don  as he is known in australia -- the cricketing prodigy of the 1930s and '40s who was still alive when tendulkar made his test debut in 1989 -- once remarked on the little master 's prodigious talent .  i saw him playing on the television and i was very , very struck by his technique . i asked my wife to come and have a look at him . because , i said , i never saw myself play , but i feel that this feller is playing much the same as i used to play ... it was just his compactness , his stroke production , his technique , it all seemed to gel as far as i was concerned ,  bradman told reporters . completing his stellar career , tendulkar scored 15,921 runs in 200 test matches at an average of 53.78 each innings , and 18,426 runs in 463 one-day international matches at 44.83 each time at bat . shane warne -- the famous australian leg spin bowler and another of bradman 's favorite contemporary cricketers -- rated him the greatest player of the modern game .  sachin tendulkar is , in my time , the best player without a doubt -- daylight second , brian lara third ,  said warne , who said of the indian that it was  a pleasure bowling to him .  true sportsman . australian cricket commentator gideon haigh said tendulkar was well-known for his grace under pressure in a sport better known in modern times for its towering egos .  certainly , he has left a strong imprint on his cricket contemporaries ,  haigh wrote in the australian newspaper .  they knew him , for example , for never throwing his bat after a dismissal ; he would sit down in the dressing room , reflect , but never brood .  in india , his popularity has reached beyond cricket 's stadiums and -- with a career unsullied by controversy or scandal -- he has become a marketer 's dream . with a net worth of about $ 160 million from endorsements , property and cricket earnings , according to singapore-based wealth x , tendulkar is cricket 's richest player and the country 's biggest icon . walk into any shopping mall in india , and there 's a good chance you will see tendulkar on a poster or a billboard . he endorses 17 products including canon , visa and adidas . canon has spent $ 50 million on advertising over the past five years -- and half of that on tendulkar alone .  it has worked phenomenally ,  canon india 's senior vice president alok bharadwaj told cnn .  we notice that the awareness of our brand is improving and since people respect him a lot there 's almost a subtle admission that if sachin is saying it , then it has to be true .  tendulkar is known to be choosey about what he endorses and will not , for instance , put his name to alcohol , despite large offers from corporations . despite his commercial success , the  little master  says it 's always been about the cricket .  the fact was that it was all happening because of cricket and my focus always stayed on cricket , the rest of these things happened around cricket and even today cricket is the focal point , cricket is the ultimate thing for me ... it 's that simple ,  he told cnn in an interview in 2008 . cnn 's gary morley also contributed to this report .", "summary": " new : sachin tendulkar makes tearful farewell to cricket saturday .   the legendary indian batsman is one of the greatest cricketers of all time .   an icon in india , his net worth is estimated to be in the region of $ 160 million .   tendulkar was playing his 200th test match as india beat west indies .
