{"text": "victims of last year 's military coup in egypt have accused tony blair and his former spin doctor alastair campbell of assisting a brutal regime responsible for mass killings , torture and the jailing of thousands of innocent people . as the coup leader -- a former army spy chief -- was crowned president in a controversial election last week , they condemned the pair for helping a military strongman trying to win international approval after overthrowing an elected government . ` i still have a bullet in my chest , ' said mohamed tareq , a biology lecturer shot three times while helping victims of a massacre that killed hundreds of protesters . ` is this the democracy these people are promoting to the west ? ' former spin doctor alistair campbell apparently visited egypt for lengthy talks with senior aides and politicians on how to defend the coup and its bloody aftermath , pictured above , in the international media . their anger came as new evidence emerged of campbell 's reported role offering advice to the regime of egypt 's ruler abdel fattah al-sisi . the mail on sunday revealed last week how campbell , forced to resign from downing street in 2003 after his role in the iraq war ` dodgy dossier ' scandal , had visited the country for talks with sisi 's team . campbell refused to say if he was being paid . in february , he spoke at a conference in the united arab emirates , one of the gulf states providing financial support to egypt since the coup . however , this newspaper can reveal new details of campbell 's secretive cairo mission to discuss ` spinning ' the sisi regime to the rest of the world . diplomatic sources in cairo say campbell had lengthy talks with senior aides and politicians on how to defend the coup and its bloody aftermath in the international media . ` they have been very bad at getting their message across , ' said one source . in recent weeks , sisi advisers have visited the us and brussels to push the line that a shattered egypt needs stability to survive and seek foreign investment . insiders say the aim is to play down ` regrettable ' outrages of the post-coup regime and play up abuses by mohamed morsi 's deposed muslim brotherhood government , while defending press curbs and clampdowns on protests as politically necessary . mr campbell , left , and former prime minister tony blair , right , pictured in 2001 , are accused by victims of last year 's military coup of offering advice to the regime of egypt 's ruler , abdel fattah al-sisi . rasha gafaar , a freelance journalist accused of sending footage to arab television station al-jazeera , yesterday became the latest reporter seized for supposedly aiding the banned muslim brotherhood . one ex-bbc journalist is among those on trial accused of similar collusion . former journalist campbell has admitted discussing ` perceptions in the international media about egypt ' -- and one senior official who met him complained the west did not understand events in his nation . ` our political discourse is not very strong and we are not trained to speak to the western mentality , ' said the official . ` democracy is an issue that is relative . ' supporters say new president abdel fattah al-sisi , who mounted his coup in july last year , will provide stability . on thursday , sisi won a landslide victory ; his only rival came third behind spoiled ballots . apathy and boycotts led to school and shopping mall closures , a hasty public holiday and polling extended a day to boost turnout . his triumph -- still with far fewer votes than he had demanded -- was greeted with fireworks and flag-waving in cairo 's tahrir square , scene of the arab spring protests three years ago that ousted the corrupt dictator hosni mubarak . but the square was far from filled ; street vendors selling t-shirts with sisi 's image on them told me trade was terrible . sisi mounted his military coup last july after massive street protests against morsi . since then , an estimated 1,600 dissidents have been killed , 16,000 stuffed into overcrowded jails and up to 40,000 arrested . despite this , blair praised the army intervention for the ` rescue ' of egypt , saying it was the ` will of the people ... to take the country to the next stage of its development , which should be democratic ' . amr moussa , an adviser to sisi , said they welcomed the help of anyone who understood the deep challenges facing egyptians . ` tony is an intelligent man , ' he said . ` he has been here several times . he knows what is needed . ' most of the mubarak old guard and business elite back the new regime . days after morsi 's fall last july , the telecoms billionaire naguib sawiris hosted blair on his new super-yacht in st tropez , where they discussed the restoration of order in egypt . sisi 's supporters argue morsi lost legitimacy by turning most of the country against him with his incompetence and sectarianism . ` why should we have to suffer for another three years to have the trimmings of democracy in order to please the west ? ' asked mohamed salmawy , a celebrated author who helped create a new constitution and has met with cathy ashton , eu foreign affairs chief . a soldier and voters pictured last week . mr blair praised the army intervention for ` rescuing ' egypt , saying it was in line with the ` will of the people ' , who wanted the country to be taken into democracy . ` if the army had not responded , there would have been civil war . ' but human rights groups , journalists and activists allege that repression is now the worst in recent egyptian history . ` this is worse than mubarak , ' said a human rights watch spokesman . ` the scale of mass protester killings is unprecedented . ' the most savage massacre was last august , when almost 1,000 people were slaughtered and many more injured . soldiers -- who claim to have come under fire first -- surrounded a cairo protest camp in support of morsi , then fired into it for several hours . lecturer tareq , 34 , was among those caught in the carnage , shot three times . tareq was sacked by his university and still remains in severe pain -- but he believes he escaped lightly compared to those he saw with faces blown apart and innards spilling out . ` it felt like we were watching genocide , ' he said . haitham ghonim , a call centre training supervisor set off to buy a new car earlier this year . arriving at the area where drivers come to sell their cars , he passed an anti-coup protest of 150 people . then , as he looked at the vehicles , armoured cars blocked off the street at either end and security forces began blasting away with birdshot . gas canisters were also fired and , amid the chaos , an officer was heard telling his troops to fire live rounds , but they refused . the car owners , desperate to protect their vehicles , hurled back stones , prompting the officer himself to start shooting . ` there were two men in front of me , ' said haitham , 29 . ` one was shot in the leg , then a second man was hit in the abdomen and while we tried to help he was dying in front of us . i could not believe it -- these guys were just selling cars . ' haitham was picked up by police , kicked and beaten with a rifle butt , then thrown in a military bus . inside was an injured young man slipping out of consciousness . ` i begged them to open the door to let in air for this man . but they just kept telling us we were not human beings , we were sheep , that we must die . ' the brutal assaults continued as they were taken to a police station and questioned over links to the muslim brotherhood . haitham had not voted for morsi , yet was singled out for the most vicious abuse since he shared his last name with a prominent figure in the original pro-democracy protests . ` officers came and told me that if i was his brother they would rape me , then kill me . ' eventually this bruised and battered man was thrown in a tiny , stinking cell crammed with 70 other people . he was held for 26 days without trial . so what did haitham think of prominent figures telling the world egypt was on the path to progress ? ` these people should come and live with us if they think this is democracy , ' he said . ` they are helping destroy our revolution . ` those who are promoting a regime that is killing , torturing and locking up so many egyptians have blood on their hands also .
