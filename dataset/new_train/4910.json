{"text": "take a look at ingredients for some varieties of subway 's bread and you 'll find a chemical that may seem unfamiliar and hard to pronounce : azodicarbonamide . to say this word , you would emphasize the syllable  bon  -- but the attention the chemical has been getting has not been good . besides bread , the chemical is also found in yoga mats and shoe soles to add elasticity . but it 's not long for bread at subway : the company says it 's coming out .  even though this ingredient is safe , we are removing it from subway bread . this process began last year and is nearly completed -- we have already developed an improved bread formula , conducted extensive performance and consumer testing on it , and pending final government approvals we should complete the entire conversion process within the coming weeks ,  subway said in a statement . subway said azodicarbonamide is  an extremely common bread ingredient that is fully approved and recognized as safe by the fda .  the controversial chemical has been used by commercial bakers for the purpose of strengthening dough but has been poorly tested , according to the center for science in the public interest . one of the breakdown products , derived from the original substance , is called urethane , a recognized carcinogen , the organization says . using azodicarbonamide at maximum allowable levels results in higher levels of urethane in bread  that pose a small risk to humans ,  cspi said . another breakdown product is semicarbazide , which poses  a negligible risk to humans  but was found to cause cancers of the lung and blood vessels in mice , cspi said . cspi advocates for reducing the amount of the chemical that is allowed to be used .  we urge the food and drug administration to consider whether the delaney amendment , which bars the use of food additives that cause cancer in humans or animals , requires the agency to bar its use ,  cspi said . the fda has said that the additive can not exceed 0.0045 % by weight of the flour when used in as a  dough conditioner .  the american bakers association told cnn :  past fda sampling results have indicated appropriate low level use in products . as a dough conditioner it has a volume/texture effect on the finished loaf . it is a functional ingredient that improves the quality of bread and any substitutes are likely not to work as well as ada -lrb- azodicarbonamide -rrb- .  food blogger vani hari , of the popular food blog food babe , originally drew public attention to this issue , cspi said . she has written about subway ingredients several times since 2012 , this week she launched a petition urging subway to stop using azodicarbonamide . more than 67,000 people signed . grocery store breads and restaurant breads also contain this chemical . other major fast food chains have products with the ingredient too , including mcdonald 's , starbucks and arby 's . mcdonald 's has also responded to concerns about the chemical with regard to its mcrib sandwich buns , but continues to use the chemical in that product . mcdonald 's notes on its website that a  variation of azodicarbonamide has commercial uses and is used in the production of some foamed plastics , like exercise mats . but this should n't be confused with the food-grade variation of this ingredient .  azodicarbonamide is not legally allowed to be used as a dough improver in the european union , according to the european food safety authority . it is also banned in australia . a 1999 report from an international group of health experts , published by the world health organization , says some studies suggest that the chemical can induce asthma , based on evidence from people with symptoms and employees of facilities where the chemical is manufactured or used . but use of the chemical in the workplace is very different , and carries much greater exposure than eating a tiny amount in bread . the report notes that the concentration required to produce asthmatic reactions is unknown .  the level of risk is uncertain ; hence , exposure levels should be reduced as much as possible ,  who said .", "summary": " azodicarbonamide is a chemical found in yoga mats and shoe soles .   the chemical has been used for the purpose of strengthening dough .   announcing its removal , subway notes chemical has usda and fda approval .   ` food babe ' blogger drew attention to the issue .
