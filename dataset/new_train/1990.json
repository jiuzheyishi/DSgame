{"text": "acute pain : sarah bignell contracted lyme disease whilst on a walking holiday in the scottish highlands . when sarah bignell developed pain in her hands and wrists in autumn 2011 , she thought she might be developing arthritis that was being aggravated by the cold . in fact , sarah , 37 , who is a vet , was displaying the first signs of a disease picked up on her summer holidays - in the uk - and her case was so severe that she ended up in a wheelchair , unable to work . ` the stabbing , burning pain became excruciating quite quickly , spreading to my toes , knees , back , jaw , neck and shoulders and then shooting down my limbs , ' recalls sarah . ` it was intermittent , but the worst pain i 've ever experienced - there were occasions when i thought i 'd black out . ' she also suffered tingling and loss of sensation . sarah , who describes herself as a ` healthy , outdoorsy type ' , was so debilitated that her gp referred her to a neurologist . after an mri scan and various tests ruled out conditions such as multiple sclerosis , sarah was finally diagnosed with unexplained neuralgia , or nerve pain , four months after her symptoms first began . by now she could n't operate at the animal hospital where she practises without plunging her arms into buckets of ice afterwards to ease the pain . then a colleague mentioned that his sister who 'd had similar symptoms had been diagnosed with lyme disease . ` i 'd been on a walking holiday in the scottish highlands about a month before the symptoms appeared and remembered seeing leaflets about lyme in the cabin i stayed in , ' says sarah , who lives in ashford , kent . ` but i had n't paid much attention - i knew it was passed on by ticks and , as a vet , i remove them from animals all the time . i felt my training would have alerted me if they carried a real risk for humans . ' but lyme disease is a risk , affecting increasing numbers as milder winters and damper summers provide perfect conditions for ticks to thrive , according to the charity lyme disease action . official figures suggest 3,000 people a year in britain are affected by the disease , although with symptoms similar to so many other conditions , such as fibromyalgia - a long-term condition causing pain all over the body - multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue syndrome , the charity estimates many people may have been misdiagnosed . the disease begins with a bite from an infected tick . the insect injects an anaesthetic , so the bite ca n't be felt , as well as the borrelia burgdorferi bacteria into the blood . in two-thirds of cases , this causes a distinctive bullseye-shaped red rash that spreads outwards , usually from the site of the bite . but it does n't hurt and may go unnoticed - ticks can be as small as poppy seeds , and often climb up into the groin , armpit or scalp , where any redness may also go unnoticed . the victim may not even be particularly ill or may have only minor , flu-like symptoms that soon pass . however in some cases - particularly if they 're not promptly diagnosed and treated - the disease can . sarah then went to see a private specialist in lyme disease , who recommended doxycycline antibiotics . rash produced from deer tick bite leading to lyme disease : the illness is affecting increasing numbers of people in the uk . ' i responded beautifully , ' she says . ` within three weeks the pain had gone and i was back operating on sick animals . life returned to normal - i even fell in love . ' however , sarah relapsed last summer . ' i did n't think it possible , but the pain was 100 times worse , ' she says . ' i could n't brush my hair or lift a kettle . i was so weak . ` nick , my boyfriend of just three months at that point , had to feed me and dress me . and the one time i did manage to make it downstairs from my sick bed , i could n't get back upstairs again . ' sarah was signed off from work and had to use a wheelchair . ` my job is my vocation so it was just awful , ' she says . ` there was a general fatigue and brain fog so dense i could n't even remember the names of those closest to me . i was in such agony i wanted to die . ' dr tim brooks , a consultant microbiologist who works with public health england testing for lyme disease , explains : ` if the lyme organism is n't defeated by the immune system in the early stages , it can spread to other sites - particularly the nervous system and joint tissue , including the brain , causing inflammation that can lead to tingling , bell 's palsy -lrb- partial facial paralysis -rrb- or even , possibly , low-grade meningitis . ` if the disease is treated at this stage , the patient will usually make a quick recovery , although damage caused by the infection , such as tissue scarring or deterioration of nerve function , can take time to resolve . ' this can take from six weeks to six months , and occasionally even longer . dr brooks is sceptical about patients relapsing , however , saying some take a long time to recover or get re-infected . ` the key is to get it early , ' he advises . ` so our job is to increase awareness , among gps as well as the public , to ensure patients with lyme are recognised , diagnosed and treated as soon as possible . ' but clearly prevention is also key . an estimated 10 per cent of ticks are thought to carry the lyme bacteria . they are usually found living in long grass or undergrowth and are therefore common in woods , moors , parks and even gardens where there is also wildlife to feed on , explains stella huyshe-shires , chair of lyme disease action . ` they attach themselves to passing animals such as sheep , rabbits , mice , cats , dogs and even birds , ' she adds . ` in humans , they can grab on to the outside of clothing and find their way onto skin under a waistband or up a sleeve and tend to keep going until they find somewhere moist and warm . ' this means it 's important to keep covered outdoors in areas of vegetation where there is also wildlife . ` and not just in the countryside , ' stella warns . ` hedgehogs , badgers and foxes are common in urban areas and there are deer in increasing numbers in some public parks . ' she recommends checking yourself , and children , for the tiny black specks , including around the hairline , then carefully detaching any found with a cotton thread wound around the tick close to the skin and pulled upwards , or a special tick remover available from vets or the lyme disease action website . ` it 's vital to avoid leaving behind the head , which can still then infect , ' she says . if infection has occurred , symptoms typically take from a couple of days to a month to manifest . ` flu-like symptoms developing after you 've been in a potentially tick-infested environment should flash warning signs - particularly in summer and definitely if accompanied by a red rash , ' says stella . the test for lyme involves a blood test to screen for antibodies and usually another to confirm the results . results may come back negative , as antibodies can take weeks to develop , so the test may need to be repeated . treatment is with antibiotics , which may also need to be repeated . after seeking help from specialists in the u.s. - where lyme disease is more common - and persuading her gp to follow their advice on medication , sarah began a second course of antibiotics last december which has reduced her pain by three-quarters . she is still on medication , but has less need for her wheelchair . ` it takes two days in bed to get my energy back after having a bath , ' she says . ` but i feel much better and hope i will soon be back at work .
