{"text": "the show  archer  has decided to use some levity to deal with a name that is far from funny these days . the adult animated fx series focuses on operative sterling malory archer -lrb- voiced by actor h. jon benjamin -rrb- , who works for the new york-based international secret intelligence service , or isis . given the negative connotation now attached to the name , the daily beast reports that it will be phased out when the show returns in january . creator adam reed said he and the executive producers casey willis and matt thompson decided that the name will go away in the first show of season 6 . reed said he suspected it might become an issue as the terrorist group the islamic state of iraq and syria began to make headlines .  back in season 5 , fx said , ` this might be a thing , ' and i thought , ` maybe it wo n't be ? maybe it 'll be the mole that i 'm gon na ignore and nothing will happen , '  he told the daily beast .  we got sort of lucky and could organically make a merger with the cia , so we went back and retroactively painted out the isis logos in parts of the show , and we just do n't talk about it in dialogue .  fans will see two movers pushing out the large circular blue isis sign while spy malory archer -lrb- voiced by veteran actress jessica walter -rrb- explains to her son that they now work for the cia .  it 's just the most awful thing , and we did n't want to have anything to do with it ,  thompson said .  there were people online saying that we should address it and say , ` oh , i ca n't believe these guys have co-opted our name . ' that 's the way ` south park ' would do it , coming after them and saying , ` these a ** holes stole our name , ' but that 's not the way the archer universe works , where it 's all our own creations . in our universe , they do n't exist .  see more comedy content at cnn comedy .", "summary": " isis is the name of archer 's employer on the show .   it will be changed for season 6 .   producer called it  the most awful thing  "}
