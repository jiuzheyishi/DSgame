{"text": "the 50-foot christmas tree decorating downtown reading , pennsylvania , was supposed to spread holiday cheer , but instead it made some residents unhappy .  it looks sad ,  city council president francis acosta told cnn affiliate wfmz last week .  everybody 's calling it a charlie brown tree .  a group called christmas for downtown reading raised $ 1,000 from business and community donations toward purchasing a replacement tree , but a last minute change of heart means the original tree that was denigrated far and wide on the web will stay in place . acosta had earlier vowed to replace the tree that observers called  pathetic ,   ugly  and an  embarrassment .  the puny norwood spruce had already lost many of its branches , even though it 's not yet december , and it was sparsely decorated with a simple string of lights .  if there was a squirrel looking for a place to live in the winter , it would n't even go into the tree ,  remarked one passerbut acosta granted the tree a last-minute reprieve , according to wfmz , saying he now wants to leave the tree that has gained so much notoriety in place as a draw for visitors to the downtown area .  we will keep this thing here and we will call it the ` ugly tree ' that everyone and national television is calling it , and we 're going to see it as an opportunity to bring people to downtown reading ,  said acosta . he told wfmz that letting the old tree stay put would free up municipal workers to prepare the city for a coming snowstorm . acosta is soliciting more donations to help decorate the tree better . the new tree is still being delivered and will be on display elsewhere in the city , say officials . the debate over whether to replace the tree is annoying some residents even more than the  ugly  tree did .  it 's frustrating that they ca n't make a decision on their own and go with it ,  reading resident zachary lee told the local news station .  we ca n't afford to just be sending these -lsb- public works -rsb- guys here . there 's a lot of other stuff these guys need to be doing , and we want to complain about this tree when there 's other parts of the city that are nowhere near as pretty as this tree , that people do n't find any beauty in .
