{"text": "doctors have admitted they are doling out antidepressants too freely as figures show a huge variation in prescription rates across the country . overall the numbers of prescribed pills have more than trebled since 1998 -- from 15million to 50million . but this varies in different areas , ranging from 71 items per 1,000 patients in brent , north london , to 331 per 1,000 in blackpool . overall the numbers of prescribed pills have more than trebled since 1998 Â¿ from 15million to 50million - and now a top gp has said the trend must stop . dr des spence , a senior gp who writes for the british medical journal , said : ` we do over-prescribe . ` there needs to be a recognition among doctors that this is a problem because there is a lot of denial . ` we 've got into this mindset that depression is a chemical imbalance and that giving a tablet is going to make it better . ' although dr spence practises in glasgow , he said the issue was a ` huge problem ' in england . he blamed drug firms for pushing their products on gps , saying : ` the pharma companies have had a very negative impact and are a major force on the prescribing . ' the figures , which emerged in a report from the nuffield trust think-tank , also showed prescriptions for antidepressants increased at the fastest rate during the economic downturn between 2008 and 2012 . over this four-year period they rose by an average of 8.5 per cent annually , compared to 6.7 per cent between 1998 and 2008 . soaring numbers of antidepressants were dished out as the financial crisis took hold , with blackpool , east anglia and the north of england suffering the most . experts claim this is because higher numbers of patients are diagnosed with depression after traumatic events such as losing their jobs or running up debts . but the number of prescriptions has risen at a much faster pace than the number of patients being diagnosed with the condition -- implying pills could be being handed out too freely . between 2008 and 2012 , while antidepressant prescriptions rose by 8.5 per cent , cases of depression increased by only 3.8 per cent . prescription rates were highest among young female family doctors , the report found . professor nick barber , director of research at the health foundation , which was also involved in the study , said : ` the report clearly shows a significant increase in antidepressant prescriptions . ` a crucial finding for doctors and patients to consider is that there is real variation in prescription rates across gp practices . ` these differences imply that certain practices have a propensity to over - or under-prescribe . this could suggest that not enough attention has been given to individual patients ' needs , including the need to avoid possible side effects of these medicines . ' isabella goldie , of the mental health foundation , said : ` in the brief time that is allocated for -lsb- gp -rsb- appointments , medication can seem like the only realistic option . ` although we are very supportive of the progress made to increase access to psychological therapies , for those patients who are living increasingly difficult lives , it can be challenging to find the energy to engage with a programme of therapy . ' the most commonly-used antidepressants are prozac and seroxat , which work by changing the levels of certain chemicals in the brain . possible side effects can include anxiousness , nausea , dizziness and headaches , although these are less common in newer types of medication .", "summary": " prominent gp des spence said : ` we do over-prescribe '   pill prescriptions have more than trebled since 1998 .   he said the issue was a ` huge problem ' in england .
