{"text": "with social media increasingly pervading our everyday lives , it 's hardly surprising that couples are going to great lengths to make sure it does n't ruin their relationships . a particularly popular new trend is the ` social media prenup ' - a contract stipulating that couples can not share incriminating photos or posts about one another , at the risk of having to fork out thousands of dollars . ` it 's a huge issue because we all know . this stuff , once it 's out there , you ca n't shake it , ' new york-based attorney ann-margaret carrozza told abc news . ` it . can be humiliating . it can be painful . it 's really no joke . ' take no risks : there 's currently a rising trend in the ` social media prenup ' - a contract stipulating that couples can not share incriminating photos or posts about one another , at the risk of having to pay money . the most common clause , according to ms carrozza , states that couples ca n't post nude or embarrassing photos that might harm their significant other 's reputation - whether it be on facebook , instagram or any other website . the penalty is usually monetary , with well-to-do couples in new york typically paying up to $ 50,000 each time they break the clause . while it may seem extreme to have a written contract rather than just a conversation about privacy , many couples say it makes it easier to deal with tricky situations in the future . that 's exactly why los angeles-based relationship therapist sheri meyers decided to draw up a social media prenup between her and her boyfriend jonathon aslay , who works as a relationship coach . ` for me , it was about privacy , what is for us and what is for the world , so we needed that discussion , ' explained dr meyers . ` what jonathon and i do is he 'll say ,  this is an smp -lsb- social media prenup -rsb- moment . is this ok -lsb- to post -rsb- ? is this crossing the line ?  it 's two sentences , versus a paragraph or an hour -lsb- discussion -rsb- . it 's not a big deal , anymore . ' she added that it 's not about a lack of trust between couples ; it 's about keeping things simple and clear-cut from the very beginning . the risk that an angry ex might resort to the disturbing phenomenon of ` revenge porn ' is also a motivator for signing this type of prenup , says dr meyers . ` it 's so easy , especially in anger , in  ex anger ,  to post things on social media to get even ' ` in this day and age , it 's really important , almost mandatory , to not assume and to lay it out , ' she explained . ` it 's one thing when you 're all lovely dovely . it 's another thing when you 're breaking up ... it 's so easy , especially in anger , in  ex anger ,  to post things to get even . ' indeed , according to the american academy of matrimonial lawyers , more than 80per cent of u.s. divorce attorneys say that issues involving social networking are on the rise in divorce proceedings . atlanta-based divorce attorney randy kessler says that social media clauses may not totally rectify the problem , but they do encourage couples to modify their behavior , especially after a break-up . ' i do n't think they hurt , but what 's interesting is they are untested . -lsb- but -rsb- it makes you not want to take the risk , ' he said .", "summary": " the typical social media clause states that couples ca n't post nude or embarrassing photos that might harm their significant other 's reputation .   the penalty is usually monetary , with well-to-do couples in new york typically paying up to $ 50,000 each time they break the clause .
