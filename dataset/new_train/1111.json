' the medill innocence project , led by former northwestern university journalism professor david protess , confronted simon at his home claiming that the mother of one of the two victims of the 1982 shooting had placed him at the scene . days later , private investigator paul ciclino and another man returned with flashing guns and police badges and urged him to confess if he wanted to avoid the death penalty . he denied any involved but the group persisted , promising him a light sentence and royalties from a book they were writing on the crime . they also showed him video of his ex-wife and another man who later turned out to be actor claiming they witnessed simon commit the murder . ` they did everything that 's forbidden by the law enforcement community , ' simon said . ` these people went to great lengths to do what they did to me , and i never did anything to anyone .
