{"text": "the seven-hour flight from the netherlands to michigan had been uneventful . passengers bided time watching movies or trying to catch shut eye . but as northwest flight 253 made its final approach to detroit on christmas , the actions of one man put at risk the lives of nearly 300 passengers on the jetliner -- and the quick thinking of another helped prevent disaster . jasper schuringa , a dutch filmmaker , appeared on cnn 's  larry king live  for a second time tuesday night , recounting how he and others subdued an al qaeda-linked suspect from detonating explosives that the man had attached to his underwear . that suspect , umar farouk abdulmutallab , is now charged with attempting to destroy an aircraft in a plot that the militant group , al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , has claimed responsibility for . a senior administration official said late tuesday that new information suggests the 23-year-old nigerian man 's plot may indeed have had ties to the group .  first , i thought it just might be a crazy guy to actually carry a firecracker onto the airplane ,  schuringa said tuesday night .  it came as quite a shock when i heard he had ties to al qaeda .  from detroit , schuringa had a connecting flight before his final destination : a vacation with friends in miami , florida . as the plane neared detroit , schuringa said , he heard what sounded like a firecracker going off .  first , it was just ` bang , '  he said .  and you 're trying to look around , like where 's this bang coming from .  immediately afterward , someone screamed  fire !  schuringa said he noticed a man on the left side of the aisle , sitting still while on fire .  a normal person would stand up , and he was n't standing up ,  he said .  so then i knew , this guy is trying to do something .  schuringa said he jumped over the passenger next to him , reached across the aisle and lunged for the suspect , now identified as abdulmutallab . view timeline of bombing suspect .  he was getting on fire . and he was still holding the device , the bomb ,  schuringa said .  and he was still holding it in his hands . and i had to , like , rip the bomb out of his hands .  schuringa said the man just stared at him , but did not let go of whatever he was holding onto . in an earlier appearance on  larry king live ,  schuringa described how he yanked the object from the man , stamped out the fire with his hands and tossed it . with the help of crew members and other passengers , the man was then taken to the front of the plane , handcuffed and stripped to make sure he was n't carrying anything else . through it all , the man appeared dazed .  he was staring into nothing ,  schuringa said . investigators now say abdulmutallab was allegedly carrying petn , or pentaerythritol tetranitrate -- enough of it to blow a hole in the aircraft . but the device he used failed to detonate fully , instead setting off the fire , authorities said . part of the explosive device was sewn into the suspect 's underwear . fbi agents recovered what appear to be the remnants of a syringe near the seat . because the syringe was destroyed , investigators are having trouble determining the accelerant the suspect tried to use to light the explosive .  when i was interrogated by the fbi , i was trying to think what i was actually holding , because it was very thick ,  schuringa said .  it 's just like everything just happened in the blink of an eye . but it 's quite scary to hold a bomb in your hands . not something you do every day .  among the passengers on the friday flight were wisconsin native richelle keepman and her family . they were returning from ethiopia with two children they had adopted . on  larry king live  on tuesday , she called schuringa a hero .  we 're just so thankful that you did what you did and the other passengers who helped , because your bravery saved us ,  she said . schuringa said his action was just a knee-jerk reaction .  there 's so much going on in your mind , you 're not afraid ,  he said .  you just do n't think and just jump .  keepman said the security at amsterdam 's schiphol airport was nothing like what she is used to in the united states .  we walked through and did not have to take our shoes off ,  she said .  also , my mother had a water bottle in her bag that she 'd completely forgotten about . and it went right through and we did n't realize it until we were on the plane .  keepman said she has n't had time to relive the experience as she introduces the adopted children to life in america .  with the children being home and they 're seeing snow for the first time and just so many new things , our focus right now is just on the fact that we 're here and we 're able to live these moments with them ,  she said . however , she remembers one odd detail . amid the commotion , a man about 10 seats in front of keepman was capturing it all with a camcorder .  it was definitely a little out of the ordinary ,  she said .  i mean , i do n't know why he was standing up and we were supposed to be seated and he was filming it .  a person familiar with the investigation told cnn that investigators have pored through tapes that several people shot during the incident . but none has provided anything useful to the investigation , because each was captured after the fire began or has an obstructed view . schuringa said he too tries not to think too much about the day .  like richelle , i think we 're all happy we 're still alive and living for another day ,  he said .  of course , for everybody it 's quite a big shock that a person like that can try to take out our lives . and that 's just unimaginable .
