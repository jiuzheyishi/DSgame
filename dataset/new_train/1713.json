{"text": "a cup of camomile tea could help ward off cancer , researchers say . the tea contains a chemical , apigenin , which takes away some of the ` superpowers ' of cancer cells . scientists at ohio state university found apigenin can block the ability of breast cancer cells to live far longer than normal cells , halting their spread and making them more sensitive to drug therapy . camomile tea , parsley and celery are the most abundant sources of apigenin but it is also found in many fruit and vegetables common in a mediterranean diet . researchers have found that camomile tea contains a chemical , apigenin , which takes away some of the ` superpowers ' of cancer cells . the chemical , which has also been shown to act as an anti-inflammatory , works in a way that suggests other nutrients could have similar effects in warding off cancer . it helps proteins correct the abnormalities in rna -- molecules carrying genetic information -- that are responsible for about 80 per cent of cancers . molecular geneticist professor andrea doseff , of ohio state university , said : ` we know we need to eat healthfully , but in most cases we do not know the actual mechanistic reasons for why we need to do that . ` we see here the beneficial effect on health is attributed to this dietary nutrient affecting many proteins . ` in its relationship with a set of specific proteins , apigenin re-establishes the normal profile in cancer cells . we think this can have great value clinically as a potential cancer-prevention strategy . ' cancer cells thrive by inhibiting a process that would cause them to die on a regular cycle subject to strict programming . the researchers found apigenin could stop breast cancer cells from inhibiting their own death . apigenin - found in the tea - can block the ability of breast cancer cells to live far longer than normal cells , halting their spread . much of what is known about the health benefits of nutrients is based on epidemiological studies that show strong positive relationships between eating specific foods and better health outcomes , especially reduced heart disease . but how the actual molecules within these healthy foods work in the body is still a mystery in many cases , and especially with those linked to lower risk for cancer . the researchers also showed apigenin binds with an estimated 160 proteins in the human body , suggesting other nutrients linked to health benefits called ` nutraceuticals ' might have similar far reaching effects . in contrast , most pharmaceutical drugs target a single molecule . the researchers , whose findings are published online in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences , likened their technique to ` fishing ' for the human proteins in cells that interact with small molecules available in the diet . prof doseff said : ` you can imagine all the potentially affected proteins as tiny fishes in a big bowl . ` we introduce this molecule to the bowl and effectively lure only the truly affected proteins based on structural characteristics that form an attraction . ` we know this is a real partnership because we can see that the proteins and apigenin bind to each other . ' experiments established apigenin had relationships with proteins that have three specific functions . among the most important was one known as hnrnpa2 which influences tiny bits of dna called mrna containing the instructions needed to produce a specific protein . abnormalities in these are responsible for about 80 percent of all cancers . the researchers observed apigenin 's connection to the hnrnpa2 protein restored the function of mrna to breast cancer cells , suggesting when they are normal cells die in a programmed way , or become more sensitive to chemotherapeutic drugs . added prof doseff : ` so by applying this nutrient , we can activate that killing machinery . ' the beneficial effects of nutraceuticals are not limited to cancer , as the investigators previously showed that apigenin has anti-inflammatory activities . the scientists noted that with its multiple cellular targets , apigenin potentially offers a variety of additional benefits that may even occur over time . the researchers are now testing whether food modified to contain proper doses of the nutrient can prevent cancer in mice .", "summary": " tea contains a chemical , apigenin , which can halt the spread of cancer cells .   camomile tea , parsley and celery are the most abundant sources of apigenin .   it is also found in many fruit and vegetables common in a mediterranean diet .
