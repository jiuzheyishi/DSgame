{"text": "before ebola , there was the flu -- the spanish flu of 1918 , which burned rapidly through army barracks , refugee camps , troop ships , all the crowded high-risk zones that world war i created . some people think it came out of kansas . the first american cases developed there . soldiers from army camps like fort riley , in eastern kansas , carried the virus to other camps around the u.s. , and over the sea to france . the flu of 1918-1919 came toward the end of the first world war -- which began a century ago this year -- and it killed more people than died in that conflict , more people than the black death , back in the 14th century . in fact , nobody knows exactly how many people died around the world ; the estimates go all the way up to 100 million , which would have been 5 % of the world 's population . opinion : how a century-old war affects you . if you lost a son in uniform in 1918 , you were equally likely to lose him to the flu as to enemy bullets ; half of the american servicemen who died were killed by the flu . after the virus started spreading in europe , infecting and killing people in a number of countries , it was thoroughly described in the spanish press -- because the king of spain got sick , and because spain was not in the war , and therefore not censoring news , while the french , british , and german papers were suppressing anything which might have an effect on wartime morale or suggest vulnerability . and thus , as a prize of peace , spain became forever connected to the most deadly pandemic of all time . opinion : the promise world war i could n't keep . influenza is a seasonal illness . every year an influenza virus emerges , generally originating somewhere in asia , and moves through the world , causing fever and chills , muscle pain and headache , cough and runny nose , and a certain number of deaths . that 's why you need to get a flu shot every fall -- it 's available now and you should make sure that you get it , and doubly sure that your children do -- because the flu virus is a particularly changeable microbe , and every year the virus is a slightly different genetic mix , and the vaccine has to be tailored to protect you . most years , most strains , influenza is especially deadly to the very young and the very old . in my pediatric clinic , we vaccinate every child starting at 6 months of age , but we take special trouble to make sure that the kids with medical problems , from asthma to congenital heart disease , get flu vaccine every year . the 1918 flu virus was different . it was deadly to young adults . the elderly , who are often the victims in flu season , did relatively well , perhaps because they had lived through a related strain of flu 30 years earlier , and therefore had some protective immunity . but people in their 20s and 30s , healthy young people , got sick in record numbers -- and many of them did not recover . opinion : the mighty women of world war i . that same 1918 flu was unusually virulent , so a very high percentage of the people who got sick went on to die . they died because their lungs filled with fluid . they drowned , it was sometimes said , inside their own useless lungs . there are stories about how fast this influenza killed ; people got sick and died within 12 hours . but the spanish flu also looked more like a hemorrhagic fever -- that is , people died because the infection affected their ability to form blood clots and stop bleeding -- so there were people coughing up blood , or bleeding from their noses or their eyes . some victims ' feet turned black from internal bleeding . opinion : war : what is it good for ? art ! in other words , the 1918 virus behaved a little like the ebola virus , a hemorrhagic fever virus much in the news right now . this flu raced through classrooms and schools and theaters -- and cities . in philadelphia in october 1918 , every hospital bed was filled , and hundreds of people were dying every day . the city ran out of coffins .  the most terrifying aspect of the epidemic was the piling up of bodies ,  john barry writes in his book ,  the great influenza .   undertakers , themselves sick , were overwhelmed . they had no place to put bodies . gravediggers either were sick or refused to bury influenza victims .  opinion : should nations pay the price for their leaders ' misdeeds ? all kinds of public health measures and quarantines were tried , as the epidemic raged . campaigns promoted face masks and targeted spitting in public with misdemeanor ordinances and fines . st. louis closed its schools , theaters , pool halls , churches and bars , in a strategy called  social distancing .  new york city required businesses to stagger their hours , so that people would n't be squeezed together in rush hour commutes . when the boston schools were closed , teachers were recruited as nurses . some towns attempted to keep the virus out altogether ; barry tells the story of gunnison , colorado , which blocked all incoming roads and warned railway passengers that if they stepped off the train onto the platform , they would be arrested . opinion : how world war i gave us ` cooties ' cities also built their public health infrastructures ; they opened emergency clinics , they strengthened reporting networks that tracked infectious diseases . in fact , the story of the 1918 influenza can be read -- by those who have eyes to see -- as the admittedly bloody beginning of the triumph of modern medicine , public health and scientific microbiology . but none of that is what saved us , not the development of a vaccine . we were saved because , as it does every year , the flu epidemic receded . maybe that intensely virulent strain of influenza virus was replaced , over time , by a less virulent strain . and the annual influenza story became a largely pro forma public health story : viral strain identified , vaccine manufactured , full speed ahead ! get your flu shots ! opinion : the ` bionic men ' of world war i . in 1918 , a virus that was unusually devastating to the young and healthy came into a world which , paradoxically , had marshaled many of its young healthy citizens for military purposes . so the first world war shaped the epidemic , and the epidemic , in turn , affected the war . most famously , u.s. president woodrow wilson came down with influenza while attending the paris peace conference and had to miss days of the negotiations that ultimately resulted in the treaty of versailles . every epidemic is a product of microbiology and sociology ; we look at ebola now and worry about an epidemic which can spread by mass air travel in an interconnected world , which circumvents some of our modern medical precautions . opinion : how world war i gave us drones . but the important lessons from the 1918 epidemic are probably not specific to the virus -- or rather , they would argue for looking closely at any contagious illness and thinking carefully about true risk and true benefit . how is the virus actually transmitted , when does it make sense to practice social distancing , to institute quarantines , to close the schools and the pool halls and the churches ? we have microbiological knowledge that the good people of 1918 did not possess ; we have antiviral drugs and disposable personal protective equipment to be put on by everyone working with patients at risk . that should make us at once more fearful -- because yes , indeed , the world as we know it may end because of new and terrifying infectious agents -- and more sanguine -- because yes , we live in a world of microbes . they live on us , and in us , and sometimes we travel together into darkness . opinion : when chemical weapons killed 90,000 . nothing will ever take away the threat of a new and virulent microbe . but we have learned a lot about building institutions to help us protect ourselves and the people we love , about public health and common sense . in other words , stop worrying about ebola , think about 1918 , wash your hands and go get that flu shot . photo blog : wwi : the golden age of postcards .", "summary": " perri klass : before ebola , there was spanish flu , world war i-era pandemic .   it killed tens of millions , more than died in war ; mainly young adults ; was similar to ebola .   one result : cities modernized medical infrastructure , strategies to stop spread , she says .   klass : it taught us realities of stemming contagion : wash hands , get your flu shot !
