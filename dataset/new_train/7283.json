{"text": "dungarees are , according to the fashion pages , back in fashion . not only have style icons such as alexa chung and heidi klum been spotted out and about in them , but they 've also been all over the catwalks . and while it might not be a surprise to see them championed by designers who target the youth market , such as house of holland and moschino cheap & chic , grown-up labels , including stella mccartney and margaret howell , have come up with their versions , too . their chic designs prompted me to wonder if i , a grandmother in her early 70s , could carry off such a look . the last time i stepped out in dungarees was in the late eighties . made from thick , brushed cotton with a fake fur trim , they were bottle green and even had a matching jacket . back in fashion : trendsetters alexa chung , left and keira knightley have been pictured in dungarees recently but could grandmother sandra howard pull them off ? scroll down to find out ... i 'd picked them up at a british designer sale and though i ca n't recall how much i paid for them , i clearly remember wearing them around folkestone , my husband michael howard 's then constituency . some people say you should never wear a trend if you can remember its previous incarnation , but i 've always had a soft spot for dungarees , so i was delighted to try the new versions . here 's how they shaped up ... sandra wears : floral dungarees , # 29.99 , quizclothing.co.uk . white sleeveless top , # 85 , reiss.com . red patent heels , # 165 , lucychoilondon.com . floral dungarees , # 29.99 , quizclothing.co.uk . when i saw these on the hanger , they had instant appeal . they really stood out against some of the other more subdued designs . and there 's no doubt that they would look incredibly cute on someone younger - and not just my toddling grandchildren . but sadly , i felt like an old sheep in them . dungarees have always had slightly child-like connotations - maybe it 's because we dress babies in them or that they used to be almost uniform for children 's tv presenters - either way , these felt as if they lived down to that stereotype . i 've usually got no problem wearing clothes designed for any age . in the past , i 've swapped clothes with my daughter , larissa , who 's in her 30s , so that 's not a problem for me . i do n't think any of my children would be shocked to see me in what might be considered a young trend . but these just looked a little bit off . teamed with a pair of brightly coloured heels , i felt like mutton dressed as lamb . made me feel like a farmhand : denim dungarees , # 40 , missselfridge.com . t-shirt , # 39 , reiss.com . denim dungarees , # 40 , missselfridge.com . keira knightley looked great when she was pictured in denim dungarees , but i 'm afraid these made me look as if i should be up a ladder with a paintbrush in my hand . i did once own a pair like these , but they were strictly for gardening . i felt self-conscious in these as the cut requires rather more up top than i possess . women with big busts might shy away from dungarees , but they 'd be wrong . for me , the heavier fabric made them less forgiving , they did n't drape nicely and they added inches to my hips . they made me feel like a farmhand and got me to wondering if the name dungarees had come about because this was the sort of thing you 'd wear to shift dung . sadly , it 's a little more prosaic - garments like this were made from a coarse fabric from a region of mumbai known as dongri . elegant : check dungarees , # 55 , topshop.com . cream blouse , # 28 , next.co.uk . nude sandals , # 39.99 , zara.com . check dungarees , # 55 , topshop.com . while this checked design was elegant , i thought they were perhaps too much for day and not enough for evening . maybe with some brighter accessories they might have made more of an impact , but these seemed to struggle to find their identity . though they would n't be my first choice for gallivanting around town , this experiment has inspired me to give dungarees another go . i think many women my age would shy away from them , perhaps thinking they would n't be flattering or that they could look foolish . but if you like trouser suits , you can wear dungarees . just pick the right pair , team them with a nice pair of heels and they wo n't look remotely as if you 're a child or a decorator . honestly ! chic : pewter sequin top , # 85 , dkny at fenwick , 020 7629 916 . slingbacks , # 39.99 , zara.com . black dungarees , # 45 , asos.com . what a revelation ! they looked like nothing on the hanger , but once on , i was impressed by how elegant they were . these are so chic i could wear them to a glamorous evening function . the silk fabric seemed to hang in a flattering way , and though i worried they might bulge in all the wrong places , in fact they 're kind to a pear shape . short sleeves made my arms feel exposed , so i 'd probably wear a longer sleeved top , maybe in white for contrast . these dungarees could take the place of a trouser suit . i always think a little cross-dressing - such as a tuxedo - is rather fun and can look striking . forgiving : polka dot dungarees , # 40 , riverisland.com . white blazer , # 345 , theory at fenwick , 020 7629 9161 . white top , # 29.99 , zara.com . black slingbacks , # 39.99 , zara.com . polka dot dungarees , # 40 , riverisland.com . i did n't buy into onesies - they were reminiscent of those awful bodies we wore in the nineties that you had to do up under your crotch . dungarees are more wear-able , but you have to pay a bit of attention when you go to the loo that the straps do n't disappear into the pan . these spotty ones were easy to slip on and off , as you have to undo only one strap . i can see these working as a lunch outfit or even as office wear . dungarees are far more forgiving than trousers . my best feature is my waist and they defined that without hugging my bottom . you do n't quite know what 's going on inside , so they do a good job of hiding things . i do n't think that my husband michael would object to them , though he might just think i was wearing trousers and a top . sandra howard 's latest book ex-wives published by simon & schuster , is available in paperback and on kindle . styling : eliza scarborough interview : claire coleman pictures : l+r hair and make-up : nina pach using bare minerals and kerastase / fashion .", "summary": " alexa chung and keira knightley seen in dungarees .   designer versions are on sale .   sandra howard tried some on with surprising results .
