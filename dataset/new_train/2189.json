{"text": "playing professional sport is many people 's idea of the perfect job , but that does n't mean sportsmen are immune to feeling the strain of working life . just ask cricketer jonathan trott , who has pulled out of england 's tour of australia because of a stress-related illness . england lost the first ashes test against australia -- one of sport 's great rivalries -- with batsman trott scoring 19 runs in two innings when he struggled against mitchell johnson 's fast bowling .  i do n't feel it 's right that i 'm playing knowing that i 'm not 100 % and i can not currently operate at the level i have done in the past ,  said the 32-year-old trott .  my priority now is to take a break from cricket so that i can focus on my recovery . i want to wish my teammates all the very best for the remainder of the tour .  england were beaten heavily in the first test -- the tourists suffered a 381-run defeat in brisbane -- and australian batsman david warner labeled their batting  poor and weak .  warner also claimed england 's batsmen had  scared eyes .  ashes series are traditionally characterized by gamesmanship and competitive verbal jousting -- known as  sledging  -- between the two sets of players .  on the pitch it 's pretty much a war , is n't it ?  said england captain alastair cook after his side 's comprehensive defeat .  there are always going to be a few battles and a few words , but on the pitch is fine .  there were a lot of things said that we think have been disrespectful , but you have to give the aussies credit for how they played .  at one point in the match when james anderson faced johnson television stump microphones picked up australian captain michael clarke telling the england bowler to  get ready for a broken f ****** arm .  but clarke defended the hostile verbal atmosphere that often goes on in a game .  i 'm not going to go into what 's been said on the field - i think that 's part and parcel of the game ,  said the australian captain .  i 've heard a lot worse said on the cricket field than anything the australian players or the england players have said throughout this test match .  both teams want to win so badly . we all respect the traditions of the game - there is a line , and both teams should not overstep that line .  i 'm sure there 's plenty of things that are said on the field that you wo n't overhear on the stump microphone . there is certainly no single england player that we have any vendetta against .  trott is not the first england cricketer to pull out of a tour with a stress-related illness . batsman marcus trescothick left the 2005-06 india tour and the 2006-07 ashes tour of australia , while bowler michael yardy came home from the 2011 world cup .  jonathan trott is an incredibly talented cricketer who has proven himself time and again for england ,  said managing director england cricket hugh morris .  the cricket side of things is unimportant now , all that matters is that jonathan is given the time , support and space he needs to recover .  we fully support his decision to leave the tour and the ecb will provide all the assistance we can to help jonathan and his family through this period .  jonathan has asked for privacy while he recovers and i would urge everyone to respect that .  many past and present sports stars were quick to rally round trott .  feeling for jonathan trott ,  tweeted former australian bowler shane warne .  i hope he and his family are left alone by all media & he 's able to recover quickly & return to the eng team !  former manchester united defender gary neville tweeted :  hope trott is ok and back soon . test cricket is tough and we are going to see a major ashes battle in the next few months .
