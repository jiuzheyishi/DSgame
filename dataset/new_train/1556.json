{"text": "shortage : the price of olive oil has soared by 30 per cent since last month following a poor harvest over the summer which has led to production shortfalls . the price of olive oil has soared by a third in just one month after poor harvests in europe caused by the hot summer decimated production , according to a new report . drastic shortfalls in production have led to a leading supplier of olive oil describing this year as ` the most difficult i have ever seen ' after the price of oil rose by 30 per cent . the latest research shows that prices of extra virgin italian and spanish oil have been rising throughout the year , but new data from commodity analysts mintec revealed a 30 per cent month-on-month surge in recent weeks . trade magazine the grocer said the situation was not getting any better . italy is currently the largest exporter of olive oil while spain is the largest producer . the latest report suggests that the key problem with this year 's crops was the above-average dry and warm weather throughout the mediterranean olive growing belt in may and june . this affected the olive trees during the blooming period when moisture is vital to ensure olive growth and the eventual oil yield . however , the problem was compounded in spain as trees were already under stress as a result of record output of production last year . in addition , trees in italy continue to suffer from an olive fruit fly that lays its eggs in the olive and feeds on the fruit . the olive fruit fly or bactrocera oleae , lays its egg in a hollow in the olive and when hatched the larvae tunnels its way out gnawing at the flesh destroying the fruit . only those larger farms with technical prowess to treat their trees with pesticides manage to reduce their losses . walter zanre , managing director of filippo berio -- one of the leading brands of olive oil - told the grocer : ` poor crops in italy and spain combined with the virtual absence of carryover stock in the mediterranean make this the most difficult year i have ever seen for olive oil . ' mintec said that spain 's 2014/15 production is forecast to be down 50 per cent year-on-year at 875,000 tonnes while italian olive oil production is expected to be down 35 per cent year-on-year to 302,000 tonnes . early estimates of global production are down 19 per cent year-on-year and , despite last year 's record-breaking production , demand is forecast to outstrip supply in 2014/15 . new data from analysts mintec shows how the price of spanish olive oil -lrb- indicated in red -rrb- and italian olive oil -lrb- shown in green -rrb- has risen since 2013 . the price of italian oil has now risen beyond the five euro per kg mark . bad crop : trees in italy continue to suffer from an olive fruit fly that lays its eggs in the olive and feeds on the fruit . when hatched , the larvae tunnels its way out , gnawing at the flesh ultimately destroying the fruit . loraine hudson , an analyst at mintec , said there had been some resistance to the hikes by buyers . she told the grocer : ` producers are refraining from buying at present . ' a drop in demand could cause prices to fall , however it is expected they will remain high due to poor crop production and quality . ' last month , it emerged that the price of olive oil was expected to soar beyond # 2 . silvio bandinelli , of the tuscan olive growers coop , said : ` the new oil will cost 2-3 euro more per litre compared to last year , or an average of 10 euro a litre . '", "summary": " spain 's production of olive oil forecast to be down 50 % to 875,000 tonnes .   italy exports expected to be down 35 % year-on-year to just 302,000 tonnes .   price has risen by 30 per cent month-on-month due to production shortage .   managing director of brand filippo berio said it was ` the most difficult year ' "}
