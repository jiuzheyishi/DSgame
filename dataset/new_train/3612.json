{"text": "never mind long ball united , now it 's long face united . louis van gaal 's stars have failed to live up to expectations and do n't even look as though they are enjoying their football under the dutchman . that 's the damning assessment from preston 's veteran striker kevin davies who has vowed to target manchester united 's soft centre in defence when the two clubs meet in the fa cup fifth round at deepdale on monday night . van gaal warned his players after wednesday night 's unimpressive premier league win over burnley that united will go out of the cup if they play as badly again against their league one opponents . kevin davies does not believe all is well under louis van gaal at manchester united . davies trains with preston north end team-mates ahead of their fa cup clash with united . the former bolton striker claims that united 's star players do not look like they are enjoying their football . and davies , who faced united in their pomp on numerous occasions for bolton , believes they are still way short of their best despite investing more than # 150million on new players last summer . united fans are growing increasingly critical of the style of play under van gaal , and davies detects that the players are less than happy with the new regime as well . he said : ` just looking at one or two of the players . van persie scoring last night , there was no real smile and he did n't look particularly happy . wayne rooney playing a bit deeper , it 's probably different to what those players are used to . ` players do n't particularly like change anyway , but a new manager comes in with new ways and are they enjoying it as much as they used to ? i do n't get that impression from the players that they are . ` when you lose someone like sir alex ferguson it 's always going to take time . players have to adjust to a different regime . you are doing double sessions when you maybe are not used to doing that kind of thing . is the training more tactical ? is it more five-a-sides ? these things can take an effect . paul gallagher -lrb- centre -rrb- controls the ball during a training session at springfields training centre . scott laird -lrb- centre -rrb- dribbles the ball as the league one side look to pull off a massive fa cup upset . louis van gaal 's expensively assembled side have failed to live up to expectations . ` burnley caused them no end of problems . on paper , the squad they have and the money they 've spent , they are fantastic players but i do n't think they 're quite living up to those expectations . ` the fans are a bit frustrated with the style of play . they 're not exciting as they used to be but the club has had big change . ` they 're dividing opinion . i 've got quite a few friends who were at the game last night and are pleased to be back in among the champions league places but there are a few boos about long balls and the style of play has not been great . ` this year they have got a bit of resilience about them . not playing and winning games , you have to have . i think he -lrb- van gaal -rrb- has not quite had the settled side . there are always injuries and a couple limped out last night . i do n't think he 's quite found the right system . ' davies , 37 , claimed that united 's main weakness lies in central defence and believes that van gaal 's side would not be in third were it not for goalkeeper david de gea . despite a 3-1 victory , united were tested by struggling burnley in their last premier league game . manchester united players can appear unfamiliar with what van gaal requires of them . ` you have to identify that as their weakness , ' he added . ` that 's what i certainly feel . when you consider that david de gea has been their best player this season -- something i do n't think anyone can argue with -- he 's not been that well protected and without him they would n't be in those top-four positions , i do n't think there is any question about that . ` and that suggests they have not had a settled back-three or back-five at times because of injuries . whether he would have picked the same team anyway what with squad rotation you do n't know . ` but i think defence is an area they will need to improve if they get back into the champions league and start challenging again for the premier league title . ` with chelsea being so strong and manchester city also being ahead of them , that is an area of the pitch that they need to improve in the summer i think . i really think the squad needs an overhaul and he has started to do that . ` but he is not going to be able to do it in one or two windows . it will take three or four . i think he will get it right . we will see manchester united over the next six or 12 months get better and better and play a better style of football . ' davies has faced manchester united on numerous occasions during his time in the premier league . preston manager simon grayson -lrb- centre -rrb- speaks to his players during the training session . davies -lrb- left -rrb- and gallagher are put through their paces ahead of their fa cup clash on monday . davies claims that preston will be looking to exploit manchester united 's weaknesses in defence . asked about the claims by his old bolton boss sam allardyce that united had played long-ball football against west ham last week , and van gaal 's bizarre response in producing statistical evidence to the contrary , davies could n't help but smile . ` sam was obviously having a little sly dig , ' he said . ` that 's sam . he did it to jose mourinho last year and got the better of him as well . ` i think the response from van gaal surprised a few . we 'll be looking to defend the ` long sideways passes ' a bit better , so we 've been working on that ! ' davies blames united 's withdrawal from the fa cup in 1999 for helping to dent the attraction of the old competition in the eyes of some people , but insists that it still remains the most important trophy for him . goalkeeper david de gea has been united 's stand-out performer this season . radamel falcao is reportedly unhappy at not playing full games under van gaal . west ham manager sam allardyce has criticised united for using long-ball tactics . it is also van gaal 's best hope of silverware in his first season in english football , and davies -- who reached the final with southampton and semis with chesterfield and bolton -- has promised to give the dutchman a run for his money on monday . ` the cup has had a lot of criticism in recent years , ' he said . ` probably since manchester united did n't enter the competition it 's gone down in the pecking order . ` but , for me , i 'd rather win that over the champions league any day . i 'm an englishman and my memories growing up watching those finals and playing professionally and getting close . we go into this game looking to cause an upset . ` van gaal says himself they are one of the favourites now for this trophy and we 've got to make it as hard as possible for them . they would obviously like to get their hands on the fa cup but hopefully we will have a say in that . ` we saw how much trouble burnley gave them the other night and we are capable of doing that . we can look back at their games against yeovil and cambridge and take note . it 's another tricky game for them . ` we can hurt them going forward and we have got defenders who are willing to defend hard and put their bodies on the line . falcao , rooney , van persie , di maria , mata , there are so many players and it 's exciting to come up against them and test ourselves .
