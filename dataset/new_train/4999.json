{"text": "the contents of your pocket gleam up at you from the newport , rhode island sidewalk like a sarcastic wink . you sit on the curb , surrounded by police cars , cuffs slicing your wrists , passersby whispering . you 've told the cops you 're an fbi agent . you 'd been debriefing your supervising officer two states away at the time they allege you committed the crime . they check your id what seems like a hundred times . they even look at it upside-down . yet here you are , still waiting on them to finish checking out your story . you are , of course , black . you 've heard folks say ,  if black folks would just take responsibility , stop blaming slavery , maybe they would n't be getting arrested and killed in the numbers they are .  but how much more personal responsibility can you take ? you grew up without a dad and still became an undercover fbi agent . after the above incident , m. quentin williams , author of the upcoming  a survival guide : how not to get killed by the police ,  went on to become a federal prosecutor , then in-house counsel for the nfl and nba . how much more responsibility could professor henry louis gates , jr. have taken -- beyond becoming one of the world 's pre-eminent intellectuals -- that would have stopped officers arresting him at his own front door ? how much more responsibility could president barack obama have taken -- beyond making history and achieving policy goals unrealized by his white predecessors -- that would stop some people from portraying him with a bone through his nose and calling him a terrorist ? where was st. louis county prosecutor bob mcculloch 's personal responsibility to say ,  call a prosecutor from the other side of the state to build the case against a local officer ?  where was the personal responsibility of officer daniel pantaleo to stop choking eric garner when he kept saying he could n't breathe ? why did he arrest him for the finable offense of selling loose cigarettes , or  loosies ?  it 's racism , whether we want to admit it as a society or not , that says :  it 's legal to kill unarmed black men .  the people marching are n't making it up . this is real . i know because i 'm married to a black man . a man , who numerous times , has had an officer 's gun on him , though he attended harvard and has never been accused of committing a crime . the impunity with which officers -lrb- and even members of the neighborhood watch -rrb- can brutalize and kill black people reeks of the past . i ca n't sleep thinking my mixed-race girls will grow up in a society that values their lives less than mine . still , i have friends and family who are officers . i see what they sacrifice to serve . i respect them and i need their protection . we have nowhere to go if each side paints the other with a broad and tainted brush . dialogue is the only way forward . so i spoke to williams , as well as to a white officer , graham campbell , a high school classmate of mine who became an nypd officer in harlem . campbell vouches convincingly for the vast majority of officers :  in the academy , my lieutenant said to us : ` ten percent of you are born to be officers . for 80 % , this is a job . ten percent of you are criminals . '  quentin williams corroborates this :  ninety-nine-point-nine percent of cops are good .  he adds a caveat :  but there are bad cops , like in any other profession . you should be able to indict a bad officer . with video evidence , you -lrb- should -rrb- get an indictment probably 100 % of the time .   i do n't think he meant to kill eric garner ,  campbell says .  guys say they ca n't breathe all the time , especially if there 's a crowd . it 's a tactic .  this difference in perception makes me curious : is there racial tension within the police force itself ? campbell states ,  there 's no silent war between races on the job .  williams parses the matter : a few minority officers  might put their heads in the sand , but from my experience , a vast majority understand the issues very well  and they 're very concerned . but minority officers have to approach these issues with  some sensitivity  for fear of being  accused of using the ` race card , '  he said . campbell admits that occasionally , he would hear casual use of the word  animals .  he elaborates :  no matter where you work , you 're going to end up resenting that community because you play referee far more often than you end up playing police officer .  he adds :  there are criminal cops . i would n't hesitate to report them : cops who abuse , cops who steal and do drugs . but a cop who ends up spinning scenes up ? i might not want him at my crime scene ... but i 'm not going to ask him to be indicted .  but is n't it criminal to lose control to the point of killing an unarmed citizen ? not indicting officers who kill the civilians they 've vowed to protect sends a message that they 're above the law they 've sworn to enforce . to make matters worse , when black people protest injustice , they 're further vilified . the night of mcculloch 's announcement of the grand jury decision , campbell posted on facebook that ferguson dispatch said a white male with a flag bandana had set fire to a police car . meanwhile , on the news , all i saw were images of black kids walking up to convenience stores with uncertain intent . campbell acknowledges that the white male could have set fires to frame black protestors . we 'll never know . the point is , white people overwhelmingly get the benefit of the doubt from our society , while black people 's benefit to society gets doubted . when pressed if he thinks profiling exists , campbell replies ,  if anything , it looks like white folks get the benefit of much more discretion . if you got locked up , you could have your parents call a high-powered attorney to get you out . ... whereas if you 're locked up in the bullpen with a public defender ,  it 's a diferent story . a racial double standard exists in policing practices . according to propublica , black men are 21 times more likely to be killed by police than white men . white america must face how its own prejudices inform whom they perceive as criminals and whom as victims . campbell nails the heart of where white and black america diverge :  in these discussions we do n't have : ` if i stop a black guy on a drug block because i think he 's buying , and he was n't doing anything , it wounds his soul . ' this is me doing my job . i do n't think about the impact because it 's not an impact i have to live with .  williams admits that a certain amount of profiling is part of any police work , but holds firm that law enforcement leadership must do more to create an environment of sensitivity to -- and accountability for -- injustice . meanwhile , the wound to the man 's soul , we ignore at our peril . it has a history . it has a future . african-american culture disproportionately constitutes the soul of america . in wounding the souls of black folk , we wound our own . if we do n't acknowledge those wounds , and officially atone for the crimes that caused them , we 'll keep killing for loosies and putting the victims on trial . note : an earlier version of this article gave an incorrect location for the incident described in the first paragraph . join us on facebook.com / cnnopinion .", "summary": " lucia brawley : the responsibility for ending killings by police is shared by many .   she says black males , even fbi agents , are often the target of unfair police actions .   law enforcement must do more to remedy inequities and injustice , she says .
