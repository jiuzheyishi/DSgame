{"text": "after years of defiantly denying that it was aware of any links between football and brain injuries , the nfl reached a surprising settlement with 4,500 former players who sued the organization over concussion-related issues to the tune of $ 765 million . if this settlement is approved as is , the nfl will have  no admissions of liability or weakness claims .  i recall that former chicago bears defensive back -lrb- and my former colleague at voice america sports -rrb- david duerson 's last text message to his family , asking to have his brain examined right before killing himself with a shotgun to the chest . i also remember philadelphia eagles safety andre waters asking me ,  how do i feel ?  in a conversation we had , when i mentioned i based my playing style on his . years later , waters committed suicide with a gunshot to the head . they did n't get any help . the good news is that this settlement will put most of the $ 675 million in the hands of my nfl brethren and their families who need it the most . this would include $ 4 million for those diagnosed after their deaths with a brain condition called chronic traumatic encephalopathy , $ 5 million for men diagnosed with alzheimer 's disease and $ 3 million for players diagnosed with dementia . the nfl will also pay up to $ 75 million to fund baseline medical exams for the players and will spend $ 10 million on new research into concussion care . half of the $ 765 million will be paid in the first three years . the second half will be paid out over 17 years . this is in part what players wanted -- to financially provide for the worst-off diagnosed players named in the lawsuit as well as providing for all current retired players , regardless of whether they joined the lawsuit or not . i always believed that the lawsuit would eventually end in a settlement . but in light of last year 's revenue for the nfl -- $ 9.5 billion -- i 'm concerned about the other terms of the settlement . the core of the concussion lawsuit contends that the  the nfl was aware of the evidence and risks associated with traumatic brain injuries for many decades , but deliberately ignored and actively concealed the information from players .  i believe the nfl more than likely would not have settled with the admission of any liability . by not going to trial , the league does not have to face the discovery and deposition process and therefore leaves many questions unanswered . if this had gone to trial , the nfl would have opened itself up to an extended run of bad pr , potentially billions of dollars in damages , and would have been forced to hand over sensitive internal archives . the nfl could have been required to produce documents , such as e-mails . e-mails are currently at the center of another lawsuit in which a group of former college players led by adrian arrington is seeking class action status , challenging the ncaa 's handling of head injuries . the ncaa has until september 13 to respond to the motion to certify the case . however , this lawsuit may also be headed toward a settlement . just ten days before the nfl settlement was announced , the ncaa agreed to mediation . all this leaves the important questions unanswered : how dangerous is football ? how serious are the head injuries ? since the initial filing of the concussion lawsuits , the nfl has funded over $ 100 million on numerous outreach and safety programs . yet it 's ironic that the final settlement only sets $ 10 million aside for  concussion research .  we will never learn what exactly the nfl had learned about football-related brain injuries and when they knew it . this information could be extremely valuable in future decisions and research on how to treat or prevent concussions . moreover , this is information parents of our future football players can use to make informed health decisions . in 1994 , then-nfl commissioner paul tagliabue initiated the mild traumatic brain injury -lrb- mtbi -rrb- committee , which was led by dr. elliot pellman . he was also the team doctor for the new york jets at the time . pellman once cleared wide receiver wayne chrebet to play after he was knocked unconscious . in 2003 , pellman was the lead author for nine of 16 studies that minimized the significance of concussions . in 2009 , the nfl disbanded the mtbi committee after a series of congressional hearings . while pellman and the nfl may never have to turn over what they knew , the proposed settlement is still pending with an opt-out option for the players , some of whom will appeal and object to the settlement . if this happens , the judge will have to seriously consider that four former players have recently sued the nfl and its helmet maker , riddell . riddell , which is a defendant in the nfl concussion lawsuit , is not part of the proposed settlement , so that part of the litigation continues . it is unclear how the nfl settlement will affect future lawsuits due to the current collective bargaining agreement -lrb- cba -rrb- . in 2011 , the nfl added safety rules -lrb- like no helmet-to-helmet contact -rrb- to the cba , which make it extremely difficult for players to file lawsuits in the future for injuries they have n't sustained yet because players are now made aware of the risks . before approving this settlement , the judge will need to take a serious look at the objections made by many players to the agreement , particularly because they will never know what the nfl knew about concussions . i 've already heard from many players who plan to opt out of the current settlement . on october 8 , the pbs  frontline  documentary ,  league of denial : the nfl 's concussion crisis ,  will air and hopefully shed some light on what the nfl still has n't revealed . hopefully , we will figure out if the settlement is enough . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of lamar c. campbell .", "summary": " the nfl and former players reached a $ 765 million settlement over concussion issues .   lamar campbell : i believe the nfl would not have settled with the admission of any liability .   he says by not going to trial , the nfl does not have to have answer many critical questions .   campbell : the current settlement has flaws ; we need to ask nfl to reveal more information .
