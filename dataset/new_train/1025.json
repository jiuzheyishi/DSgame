{"text": "queen of the tardis : helen mirren has be rumoured to be up for the role of a lifetime . the actress said she would like the part of the time lord : ' i do n't just want to be his sidekick ' television 's best-loved hero has survived volcanoes , nuclear blasts , black holes and his own death -- ten times -- in his struggle against cosmic evil . but after matt smith announced he intends to quit doctor who at christmas , the character faces his greatest ever threat . it comes not from the daleks or sinister weeping angels , but from the man entrusted with the show 's future . steven moffat , the show 's 51-year-old chief writer and executive producer , is threatening to fulfil an ambition that began as a joke more than a decade ago -- and regenerate the doctor as a woman . actresses linked to the role include helen mirren , who has admitted she would leap at the chance . ` i would like to play the new female doctor who . ' i do n't just want to be his sidekick , ' she has said . other names put forward are olivia colman , who scored a double bafta success last month following her sensational performance in crime thriller broadchurch , and comedienne miranda hart . the notion of miranda galumphing around the tardis is enough to dismay any whovian -- as fans call themselves . other female whos in the frame are thought to include ruth jones , star and co-writer of gavin and stacey , and the doctor 's former companion billie piper . she hinted heavily , after leaving in 2006 , that she would love to return in the title role . her character , rose , is expected to feature in the 50th anniversary special scheduled for november . great british bake-off host sue perkins said she was ` beyond flattered ' earlier this year when a sci-fi website proposed her as a future doctor . but a woman doctor would be more than a disappointment to the show 's legion of fans -- it would betray a british tradition . the character has been a role model for three generations of boys . unlike conventional muscle-bound superheroes , the doctor relies on intellect and ingenuity to triumph over violence . there is no one else quite like him on television . he 's proof that the sonic screwdriver is mightier than the sword . and in a britain bristling with casual violence , that example is desperately needed . why must the doctor fall victim to a politically correct trend for ` gender neutral ' childhoods ? it may come as a surprise to many in these liberated times , but most little boys still grow up wanting to be men . and what finer example of a man -- brave , reflective , with a keen sense of heroic duty -- is there than doctor who ? departing : matt smith -lrb- pictured -rrb- is leaving the show after three series . he has been critically acclaimed for his portrayal of the doctor and is the first actor to be nominated for a bafta for the role . tipped for the role : great british bake off presenter sue perkins -lrb- left -rrb- writer and actress ruth jones -lrb- right -rrb- are both believed to be in line to be an unconventional doctor . potential doctors : actress of the moment , olivia colman -lrb- left -rrb- has been mentioned as a good fit for the role , while miranda hart -lrb- right -rrb- would give the part a comedic edge . lady who : former companion billie piper -lrb- left -rrb- has hinted that she would love to return in the title role after she left the hit show in 2006 . actress joanna lumley -lrb- right -rrb- starred as the doctor in a comic relief skit . stephen moffat , a childhood fan of the show , has done much that is praiseworthy since he took it over in 2009 . he has brought it new emotional depth and given the doctor a love interest for the first time . moffat has revived a franchise that some had complained had grown too clever for its own good , others that it had become bogged down and boring . but now he seems intent on destroying all he has achieved . last year , moffat told an audience at the edinburgh television festival that he had slipped a clue into an episode 12 months ago , an offhand line revealing that when a time lord regenerates , he could be reborn as a woman -- a time lady . ` it can happen , ' moffat insisted . ` the more often it is talked about , the more likely it is to happen some day . ' warming to his theme , he asked for a show of hands at one convention in cardiff to see how many would accept a woman doctor . about a quarter said they would stop watching , but moffat was undeterred . in fact , moffat has already attempted it once , in a spoof starring rowan atkinson and joanna lumley , for the bbc 's comic relief night in 2009 . broadcast in four five-minute episodes throughout the charity telethon , ` the curse of fatal death ' was a send-up that paid homage to the show . when the doctor is killed by daleks , he regenerates as a string of a-listers -- richard e. grant , then jim broadbent , then hugh grant , before finally appearing as lumley in a low-cut tunic and greatcoat . doctor lumley exits with her arch-enemy -- played by jonathan pryce -- on her arm . companions : the show has gone through its fair share of female side kicks . the current companion is played by jenna-louise coleman -lrb- left -rrb- who has signed up for the next series in 2014 . actress karen gillian -lrb- right -rrb- also starred alongside matt smith . it was a marvellous joke . but to take . it any further would be to swindle countless fans . the essence of the . character -- as an archetypal hero , not heroine -- would be lost . the . doctor 's strength is that he always wins through by thinking rather . than fighting -- an antidote to mainstream comic book and action movie . heroes batman , spiderman , conan the barbarian , tarzan , rambo and . wolverine . the doctor was specifically created to counter that trend . in . 1963 , post-war britain was outstripped by technological advances in . germany , japan and america . the country was experiencing a ` brain drain ' as our most brilliant scientists and researchers emigrated to find . better paid work . so the bbc set out to invent a hero who could make the scientific seem heroic . the first doctor who team working under then director-general hugh carleton greene succeeded far beyond their hopes . as the doctor saved the galaxy , science became as cool as the beatles . greene urged his team to focus on thought-provoking story-lines with lots of history , chemistry and physics lessons woven into the scripts . favourites : david tennant 's time in the role , alongside companion billie piper is favoured by many of the show 's loyal fans . classic : jon pertwee 's boundless energy as the doctor has left a lasting impression on many viewers . for a generation of boys , this was eye-opening . they had a new figure to emulate : not just brave , but brainy . using . only his brilliant scientific mind and his encyclopaedic knowledge , he . tackled aliens armed with death-rays , and came out on top . the . first doctor , played by william hartnell , was irritable and impossible -- . softened only by his affection for his grand-daughter susan , the . earliest of his intergalactic companions . the second , portrayed by patrick troughton , was a superman striving alone to hold back vast tides of evil . but jon pertwee personifies the doctor for me . with his silver curls and ruffs , he exuded a boundless energy . for many , though , it was tom baker 's . fourth doctor who perfected the character with his charisma , . eccentricities , humour , brilliance and lurking ruthlessness . his performance strongly influenced david tennant as the tenth doctor . after . five decades , the doctor remains unique in the pantheon of boys ' own . heroes . there are other intellectuals , of course , but in the sports-mad . hurly-burly of the schoolyard , they offer little to emulate . hercule poirot is a pompous dandy . sherlock holmes is a drug-abusing loner . with boys lagging ever further behind girls in school league tables and as the pressure intensifies on young males to reject education , we need the time lord as never before . the greatest detective in victorian london is sherlock , not shirley . generations of grubby schoolboys have found much to admire in just william , not just wilhemina . agent 007 is james , not jemima bond . why ca n't steven moffat see this distinction ? when i was six years old , peeping around the sofa at the doctor outwitting cardboard monsters on a black-and-white tv , i was in awe of this towering hero and his adventures . the doctor taught me some of the most valuable lessons of my childhood . years later , it has been a joy to share his adventures with my own son . these tales enthral and educate , passing on crucial lessons about morality and the importance of learning . they will continue to do so for generations unless the bbc kills off the doctor by casting a woman in the role and depriving small boys of his example for ever .", "summary": " current doctor who matt smith to quit role this christmas after three series .   was youngest doctor who so far , taking role aged 26 .   producer steven moffat said to be open to casting a woman , despite fans ' disapproval .
