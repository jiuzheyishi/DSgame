{"text": "corking ! the stopper and bottle in action . if your enjoyment of a good shiraz or chardonnay has ever been delayed by having to hunt through the kitchen drawers for a corkscrew , help is at hand . a new invention combines the tradition of a cork stopper with the convenience of a screw cap , meaning summer picnics and romantic dinners could be just a little bit simpler from now on . the helix is an old-fashioned cork stopper -- but it has a screw thread that drinkers can twist in and out of the neck of the bottle . it comes with a bottle which has a matching thread , so it can be tightly resealed to keep the contents fresh . the innovative design is the result of a joint effort by amorim , the world 's largest wine cork manufacturer , and o-i , the biggest global maker of glass containers . they are optimistic that it could be seen on shelves soon . the companies claim wine stored in the helix tastes no different to a classic bottle -- and important markers used by critics to judge wine , such as colour and smell , are also unaffected . they say wine from the bottles has gone down well with tasters in the uk , us , australia and china . a spokesman said : ` it offers all of the ease of opening -- and closing -- that screw caps offer , but with totally natural eco-friendly materials . it also has the maturing benefits that natural cork brings to wine . ' she added : ` it can be quickly and easily implemented by wineries with only a minor adjustment to the existing filling lines . ' unlike other devices designed to keep wine fresh once it has been opened , the helix cork can also be used for champagne , resealing it so well that a partially empty bottle will still produce a satisfying pop when it is opened . fresh and fine : the cork and bottle have a thread finish to allow drinkers to twist the stopper open and closed again , creating an airtight barrier . antonio amorim , chairman of amorim , said : ` helix meets consumers ' growing desire for sustainability and quality . ` we are delighted to offer not only a 100 per cent renewable , modern product , but also a solution that enhances the wine drinking experience . ' his family firm is more than 140 years old and supplies traditional corks to 82 countries . based in portugal , it makes use of the country 's huge areas of cork oak forest . in recent years , manufacturers have increasingly turned to cheap and easy-to-use screw caps , particularly for lower priced wines . but if the helix proves successful , it could make a traditional cork -- which some experts say improves the wine 's flavour -- just as convenient as a metal cap .", "summary": " new twisty cork and bottle to keep wine fresh to hit markets .   has a screw thread that drinkers can twist in and out of the bottle .   producers say the helix is soon to hit the shelves on the uk market .
