{"text": "ontario 's top court has legalized brothels , saying canadian prostitution laws unfairly discriminate against prostitutes and their ability to work in safe environments . a panel of five judges wrote that the law banning common bawdy houses  is grossly disproportionate  if all it aims to do is keep public order in a neighborhood and maintain public health standards .  the record is clear that the safest way to sell sex is for a prostitute to work indoors , in a location under her control ,  the judges wrote in a much anticipated ruling .  the impact on those put at risk by the legislation is extreme ,  the judges added . however , the court stopped short of allowing prostitutes to openly solicit customers on the streets . the court ruled that prohibiting solicitation remains a  a reasonable limit on the right to freedom of expression .   it is so nice to see that we are now brought out into society . i feel a debutante at a ball . we 're almost full citizens , so this is wonderful ,  said valerie scott , a former prostitute . supporters of the ruling said the laws governing prostitution in canada would now have to change .  any form of criminalization pushes the industry underground and gives opportunities to predators . you can see it through the world ,  said nikki thomas , executive director of sex professionals of canada . the judicial panel ruled that the changes should not take affect for at least one year , allowing the government to amend its criminal code . any of those changes would apply to the entire country , not just the province of ontario . but the canadian government released a statement saying it was now weighing its legal options .  as the prime minister -lrb- stephen harper -rrb- has said , prostitution is bad for society and harmful to communities , women and vulnerable persons ,  rob nicholson , canada 's justice minister , said in a statement released by his office . the government indicated it would review the decision , but an appeal to canada 's supreme court is also a possibility .", "summary": " ontario court rules federal prostitution laws unfairly discriminate against prostitutes .   a prostitute should be able  to work indoors , in a location under her control ,  the judges write .   the ruling does not allow prostitutes to solicit customers on the streets .   supporters of the ruling say federal laws will now have to change .
