{"text": "brussels , belgium as little ella-louise faded away , her tiny , frail body wracked with pain , her heartbroken mother was left to look on , feeling powerless . linda van roy says she could do nothing to help her terminally ill baby in the last hours of her life .  in that period , they tell you it 's best not to give any fluids , because babies survive on little drops of liquid ,  she said .  so we stopped feeding her . in the end , it was bones and skin and no more baby left .  ten-month-old ella-louise died two years ago with krabbe disease , a rare and terminal genetic mutation that damages the nervous system . in the final days of ella-louise 's life , when she was being given palliative sedation , van roy , of schilde , belgium , says she could still see the agony on her daughter 's face .  she died on tuesday ; on monday , we saw on her face that she was still in pain . and then you start to get angry , because you know that there is no medication left to give her to take away that pain .  she wishes she could have administered a fatal dose of medication to make the end of her daughter 's short life come more quickly . unbearable suffering . belgium legalized euthanasia in 2002 for those in  constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that can not be alleviated .  minors were included in the original proposals but were left out of the final legislation for political reasons . now , the country 's lawmakers are debating a bill which would extend the  right to die  to those under the age of 18 who are terminally ill and in intolerable physical pain . the bill cleared a senate committee vote on wednesday ; it must clear several other hurdles before becoming law . since ella-louise was only a baby , her case would never have qualified for euthanasia . under the current rules , the patient must be able to make a repeated request for euthanasia themselves while experiencing unbearable suffering of which there is no prospect for improvement . but van roy believes that children , and parents of sick babies , should have more options , including the right to choose when to die .  we want those children to be able to talk about euthanasia , and if they really want to say : ` stop , this is it . i do n't want it anymore , ' we want people to have a choice ,  she said . polls show the majority of belgians agree with the principle of offering euthanasia to children . the current debate is less about whether or not to extend the legislation and more about what conditions to apply to the law : from what age euthanasia should be available and whether that should be with or without parental consent . parental consent . this month , 16 pediatricians wrote an open letter in two national newspapers demanding an extension of the practice . gerlant van berlaer from the free university brussels was one of them .  doctors do terminate the lives of children as well as adults , but today it 's done in a gray zone or in the dark because it 's illegal ,  he said .  this means that there 's a lot of room to do things the wrong way .  van berlaer stresses that only a tiny number of children would ever choose to end their lives this way : children with cancer , for example , who are still in charge of their cognitive faculties but in terrible pain . kenneth chambaere is a researcher at the free university brussels focusing on end-of-life care and euthanasia . he has compared end of life practice in flanders before and after euthanasia was legalized in 2002 , to gauge whether there has been a slippery slope . he says his research shows that although the number of euthanasia requests has gone up , from 1.1 % before 2002 to 1.9 % by 2008 , the number of instances in which doctors have hastened the end of life without patient consent has gone down considerably . and he says minors are only a very small fraction of those deaths in any case .  people dying underage mostly die of accidents or trauma , so very sudden deaths where no end-of-life decision making is possible ,  he said .  and a euthanasia request is very rare in those patients .  chambaere argues that the debate in belgium is more one of principle than anything else ; only very few children would ever choose euthanasia but that the law now discriminates against them . palliative care . experiences in the netherlands , where patients older than 12 are allowed to request euthanasia with their parents ' consent , would seem to support this : only five children have chosen to die by euthanasia since the law was introduced in 2002 . but critics say children can not reasonably decide whether to end their own lives . palliative nurse sonja develter , who specializes in end-of-life care for children , says that among the 200 children she 's nursed to their deaths , she 's never met a child who asked for death to come early .  the main concern for children is always for the family ,  she said .  it 's difficult for a child , because he feels he 's slipping away , but he can not tell his parents as that 's not what they want to hear .  children say to me , ` it 's not difficult to die , but please look after my parents . '  develter worries that giving children a choice would mean they made decisions based on what they thought their families wanted to hear , and that this would be a terrible strain for children who may already feel they are a burden to their caregivers . one of sonja 's patients is izabela sacewicz , who has huntington 's disease , a neurological disease that drastically reduces life expectancy in children . eight years ago , she was a bubbling , active child -- top of her class , according to her mother , iwona . now , having just turned 18 , she ca n't eat or walk without help . she finds it difficult to speak , but her mind is still her own . in a painful exchange , her mother explains to her what euthanasia is , using the simplest terms she can think of .  euthanasia means if you are unwell , you are so unhappy that you do n't want to stay here , you want to leave , to go high up to god ,  she said .  but if you leave , you leave forever .  izabela listens , the strain showing on her face .  do you think it 's good or not good ?  her mother asks .  it 's not good .  the words are barely audible . euthanasia : be glad you have a choice . euthanasia : we can live without it ... cnn 's bryony jones contributed to this report .", "summary": " belgian mps are debating extending the law on euthanasia to terminally ill children .   linda van roy , whose baby daughter died of degenerative condition , wants law changed .   supporters say euthanasia would only be chosen by very small number of minors .   euthanasia opponents want more of a focus on palliative care and pain relief .
