' he also revealed that his commuting arrangement with mrs brooks ` stopped when she became chief executive of news international ' in 2009 . both mrs brooks and her husband , the racehorse owner charlie , were charged with four others , on tuesday with conspiracy to pervert the course of justice over the scotland yard investigation into phone hacking . mr straw , one of the few mps to attend the brooks ' wedding , told the inquiry that although he had decided his approach to the media was ` do n't have favourites ' , the blair government had had ` incestuous ' relations with some figures . and he came closer than other witnesses to saying rupert murdoch had influenced policy . ` -lsb- mr murdoch -rsb- reckoned his political influence would be greater if , as it were , his support was available in return for what he thought he could get out of it , ' mr straw said . ` i do n't mean a deal ... but he thought there was something in it . ' the meetings petered out after mrs brooks - who was yesterday charged with perverting the course of justice in relation to the phone-hacking scandal - was made news international chief executive in 2009 . the disclosure offers yet more evidence of mrs brooks ' extensive contacts with major political players . last week she told the inquiry that david cameron regularly signed off text messages with ` lol ' for ` lots of love ' . commuter route : jack straw and rebekah brooks travelled to london together from charlbury station often , he told the leveson inquiry today . mr straw also admitted that labour 's links with journalists were ` sometimes incestuous ' in opposition ' . he said rupert murdoch believed the power wielded by his newspapers benefited his wider commercial interests . mr straw said the media mogul , 81 , liked his publications to keep their options open on which party to support because it could ` open more doors ' when it came to issues such as regulation and licences . power man : rupert murdoch , pictured with his wife wendi , liked his publications to keep their options open on which party to support because it could ` open more doors ' , mr straw claimed . he admitted that tony blair 's government had been too cosy with the press , blaming the fact that in opposition , links with journalists had become ` very , very close , sometimes incestuous ' . he said : ` one of the reasons why the blair government was too close to people in the press was because we had not stopped that sort of contact but allowed it to continue to operate in that way in government . ' mr straw said the culture of spin developed within labour because they were determined to cling on to power after the papers turned against them in the 1980s and the 1992 election . he said downing street became ` too close ' to certain journalists under tony blair . mr straw added : ` what i saw was that generally some newspapers and some journalists with newspapers were being favoured by downing street and some ministers . ` they had these little groups - it was very incestuous . ` it suited no 10 and it suited those journalists at the time as they were getting stories that others in their newsrooms were n't . ' i think it was a bad idea and i did n't like it . i tried to get on and do things in a different way . ' favoured journalists : no 10 became ` too close ' to the media under tony blair 's government , jack straw told the leveson inquiry today . asked about mr murdoch 's impact on politicians , mr straw insisted he had ` power ' . while stressing he had only had a ` paragraph ' of conversation with the owner of the sun and the times , and no direct information , he said : ` he reckoned his political influence would be greater if , as it were , his support was available in return for what he thought he could get out of it . ' i do n't mean a deal , because i have seen no evidence of a deal . but he thought there was something in it . ' he went on : ' i think that the perception i have got is that mr murdoch is enjoying the fact that he has been willing to play with political leaders in the way that the senior executives of the other papers have not . ` he is very interested in power for its own sake , because you do not get to that position running a huge international media empire without being interested in power . ' pressed on what mr murdoch might have thought he would get from his influence over politicians , mr straw suggested he wanted to ` consolidate his non-newspaper interests in this country ' . mr murdoch believed remaining available could ` open more doors in government when it came to things like media regulation , licences , regulation of football and so on ' . the labour mp rejected as ` disingenuous ' james murdoch 's efforts to play down the importance of news international 's publications to the wider news corporation empire . although they only constituted two per cent of the group 's financial interests , they were far more significant to the business in other ways , he said . asked whether mr murdoch wielded ` power ' or ` influence ' , mr straw replied : ` certainly , to those on the receiving end it felt like power . ' earlier mr straw said that he had always kept a ` respectful acquaintanceship ' with journalists as it was his instinct not to get to close .", "summary": " mr straw would talk politics with mrs brooks as they travelled to london .   rupert murdoch would offer political support to parties to win him favours while in government , he suggests .   mr straw tells leveson there is no evidence mr murdoch had ever done a deal with government .   labour 's links with journalists were ` sometimes incestuous ' in opposition , he says .
