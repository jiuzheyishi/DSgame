{"text": "as a campaign for saudi women to defy the driving ban in their country heats up , one of the country 's leading female bloggers was detained in riyadh on thursday after a woman she was with did just that . eman al-nafjan , who tweets as saudiwoman and has been one of the leading voices urging saudi women to get behind the wheel on october 26 , was in a car that was stopped by police in riyadh , the capital , as she filmed another woman driving . al-nafjan , who has been calling on saudi women to upload videos of themselves driving in different parts of the kingdom , spoke exclusively with cnn on friday about what happened .  yesterday , i kept getting called by women i know who wanted me to film them driving ,  she said , explaining how she spent most of the day filming and uploading information about those excursions online .  when i was live tweeting , some people took it into their heads that we had to be stopped ,  said al-nafjan ,  and then called the police .  she was live tweeting as they were pulled over , posting a picture of the police car that had pulled alongside them , accompanied by the message ,  police stopped us .  that tweet set off a flurry of concern and supportive messages from twitter users throughout saudi arabia . al-nafjan initially felt queasy about being stopped , but her unease and worry quickly dissipated when she saw that  police were smiling and easygoing , and their attitude was very positive . the police were really nice to us .  they were taken to the olaya police station , where she and azza , the woman who had driven her , waited .  the vibe i got was that they did n't know what to do with us . we could see the police going around , calling , waiting ,  explained al-nafjan , who says she believes this is a sign that the driving campaign has gained momentum and that many in saudi arabia , including officials , think the time has come to allow women to drive . october 26 campaign . women who want saudi arabia to lift a de facto ban on their driving have launched an online campaign urging saudi women to stage a demonstration by driving cars on october 26 .  there is no justification for the saudi government to prohibit adult women citizens who are capable of driving cars from doing so ,  reads part of an online petition on the oct26driving.com website . even though the website was reportedly blocked in saudi arabia shortly after its creation in late september , the petition has so far garnered more than 14,000 signatures . no traffic law specifically prohibits women from driving in saudi arabia , but religious edicts there are often interpreted to mean women are not allowed to operate a vehicle . cnn was unable to reach saudi arabia 's interior and justice ministries for comment on the issue . just a day before being stopped by police , al-nafjan posted online another video she filmed of a woman driving for two hours throughout riyadh . they were not stopped , and the video shows male drivers waving to the women and supporting them with the thumbs-up sign . that video quickly went viral , eliciting numerous comments . while most were supportive , there was also a negative reaction -- at one point , a hashtag was created calling for al-nafjan 's arrest . al-nafjan says her husband was also made to come to the police station thursday . when al-nafjan was finally told to come inside , she was asked if she knew that what she did was wrong .  i said it 's not wrong ,  said al-nafjan , who was then told to sign two documents : one stating that she would no longer get into a car with a woman driving , and another that she would no longer film women driving . when asked if she would adhere to those agreements , al-nafjan said that  it does n't matter whether or not i go out . this is n't about me . this is a people 's movement . this is not about me . this is about many women .  al-nafjan , who was in extremely high spirits while speaking via phone with cnn , said the experience with police ultimately bolstered her confidence in the movement she is helping spearhead . she said the lack of her arrest and her and azza 's quick release show that this campaign is making a difference and things are beginning to change . other challenges to driving ban . the issue of women driving in the conservative kingdom has long been contentious . and while such demonstrations are extremely rare , they have been staged at least twice before . in may 2011 , prominent saudi women 's rights activist manal al-sharif was arrested after uploading a video to youtube that showed her driving in saudi arabia . she spent more than a week in jail and quickly became a hero to numerous women in her country and across the middle east . in a sign of just how influential she had grown , on june 17 , 2011 , dozens of women across saudi arabia , emboldened and inspired by al-sharif 's ordeal , participated in the  women2drive  campaign by getting behind the wheel , defying the ban and driving throughout the streets of their cities . in 1991 , a group of 47 women protested the prohibition by driving through riyadh . after being arrested , many were further punished by being banned from travel and suspended from their workplaces . recently , a leading saudi cleric made headlines when giving an interview in which he warned saudi women that driving could cause damage to their ovaries -- a comment that was widely interpreted to be a reaction against the october 26 driving campaign and how popular it had grown . in addition to prohibiting driving , the country 's strict and compulsory guardianship system also prevents women from opening bank accounts , working , traveling and going to school without the express permission of a male guardian . saudi arabia has been moving toward change under its current ruler , king abdullah , who is considered a cautious reformer and proponent of women 's rights . in january , he appointed 30 women to the shura council , the first time women had been chosen for the country 's top consultative body . in 2011 , he announced that women could run for office and vote in local elections in 2015 . and in 2009 , he appointed saudi arabia 's first female deputy minister .", "summary": " blogger eman al-nafjan tweets about filming a female driver , talks about their detention .   after she and the driver were
