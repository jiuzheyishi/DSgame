' the planning application states that the plant pots will be made from dark grey polished concrete and that they will be ` robust ' and expected to ` deter security threats whilst enhancing the visual amenity of the building and local area ' . how it would look : their planning application uses this image to show how the flower beds would be pleasant to see and be the first line of defence in a bomb attack . the application continues : ` due to the nature and scale of the proposed security planters , it is considered they will have a positive impact on the surrounding area . ` the proposals adhere to the policy aspirations for the site as they protect and enhance the home office 's existing operations on the site . ' the ukba says it is acting on home office guidance regarding security measures at the building . a spokesman for the home office , which runs the ukba , said today : ` we do n't comment on the measures we take for security reasons so that people who might wish to do us harm are not aware of why we are taking steps to secure buildings . ' busy : lunar house is visited by thousands of asylum seekers a year who are applying to stay in britain . croydon resident sam harris , 41 , said : ` lunar house is unsightly as it is and i do n't see how sticking a few flowers around it is going to help . ` the cost must be in the tens of thousands to get 27 of these things in , and if someone really wants to bomb the place i do n't think a few plants will stop them . ' planning chiefs at croydon council are set to make a decision on the giant plants pots in february .", "summary": " giant flower beds will look nice and protect lunar house from terrorists , home office says .   croydon council to consider planning application for 27 pots surrounding the building .
