{"text": "when maria sharapova underwent shoulder surgery five years ago , many thought her tennis career would n't last . but there is now a good chance the four-time grand slam winner will play into her 30s before fully turning her attention to her numerous business interests .  i think she 's going to play another four to five years and through the rio olympics -lrb- in 2016 -rrb- if she stays healthy and hungry ,  her long-time agent and close friend max eisenbud told cnn 's open court . sharapova 's motivation has never been an issue in the past , and the russian -- who turned 26 last week -- is now fully fit . that , however , was n't the case in 2008 , when the shoulder injury ruled her out for nine months and cast doubt on sharapova 's professional career , which began on the day she turned 14 . she had been experiencing discomfort in her right -- and serving -- shoulder , with initial tests leading doctors to believe inflammation was the cause . when the pain intensified after a win at a tournament in montreal in july 2008 , she underwent an mri that revealed two small tears in the tendon of her shoulder . so began the long process of rehabilitation , surgery , another stint of rehab and dealing with another injury , a bone bruise . it was a difficult time for sharapova .  the shoulder , it 's a huge part of the tennis game ,  she told open court .  the serve is huge and my game is all about being aggressive and powerful strokes , so when you 're out of the game nine months , when you do n't have too many examples of athletes coming back after such an injury , of course you have doubters .  sharapova never lost faith that she would recover , but she would have to wait another three years before reaching another grand slam final , losing at wimbledon in 2011 . thankfully for sharapova , no such serious injuries have reoccurred , although she was troubled by an ankle problem later that year .  i had to work through a lot of things , and more mentally as well because i always thought that during those months that i was away , everyone was working and everyone was training and everyone was playing so it kind of felt like i was left behind a little bit ,  she said . eisenbud 's pronouncement about sharapova 's future comes as a boost to the women 's tennis tour due to sharapova 's enormous star power and fan base , which increased when she won the french open last june to cap her comeback and become just the 10th woman to capture all four majors . forbes lists . sharapova was last year named by forbes as the world 's 71st most powerful celebrity . she was the highest-ranked female athlete on the list , ahead of serena williams , despite the american now owning 11 more grand slam titles . sharapova is , according to forbes , the world 's highest-paid female athlete , pulling in almost $ 28 million -- more than her career prize money -- over a 12-month period that ended last july . sponsors including samsung , evian , nike , tiffany & co. , head , cole haan and , most recently , porsche help pad sharapova 's wallet . the florida-based russian has also launched sugarpova , her own premium candy line , in the u.s. and plans on expanding to china , japan , india and england . but sharapova remains adamant that success on the court is her first priority . the rest will follow .  do i want my candy to sell ? do i want my partnership to continue for many years ? of course i do ,  sharapova said .  that 's a no-brainer . but at the end of the day all the things that have come to me , that i 've been able to be a part of , is because i 'm a tennis player , not because i 'm a model or because of acting . the core of what i have is my tennis .  her results in 2013 confirm sharapova 's drive . known as one of tennis ' toughest competitors and hardest workers , she has showed no signs of slowing down . the power baseliner has reached at least the semifinals in all four of her tournaments and almost completed a rare double at the bnp paribas open in indian wells and miami 's sony open . she won the title in california in march but was defeated by williams in the finale in florida two weeks later . her poor record against williams might add to her hunger . williams beat sharapova for the 11th straight time , although sharapova won a set off the world no. 1 for the first time in five years . missing gold . sharapova lacks an olympic gold medal , too , having been crushed by williams in the gold medal match at london 2012 and missing 2008 in beijing with the shoulder injury .  i always feel like i can be better and when i do step on the court , i feel a certain power with what i 'm doing ,  sharapova said .  i feel strong and i feel like i 'm good at what i do .  i want to keep working , and i want to keep getting better because you ca n't stand still . everyone 's working . i 'm sure everyone 's getting stronger and getting faster and hitting the ball harder . you have to do it as well .  sharapova begins her clay-court swing as defending champion in stuttgart this week before competing at the madrid open and italian open in rome ahead of her title defense at roland garros , which starts may 26 . her titles in stuttgart and rome in 2012 served as the springboard to her success in paris , where sharapova downed italian sara errani in the final . having come back from the abyss that her career-threatening injury presented , sharapova savored the success -- especially after being written off by many critics while she was rebuilding her career , suffering some morale-sapping defeats .  losing is never easy , especially when you 've achieved so much great success and having lifted beautiful trophies ,  she said .  and especially when you hear it from people that , you know , they sit there and comment on what you 're doing and they do n't comment on the work that you put in before something like that , before getting to the stage of a match in front of thousands of people .  but it makes you so much stronger , and i 've looked back and , you know , the people i felt had that connection with me , i 've certainly spoken with them about it and especially had a few words with them after the french open .  but it 's sport . it 's normal . i think the world revolves around comments and opinions , and i have absolutely nothing against it .
