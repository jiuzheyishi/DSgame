{"text": "the biggest near-term unintended consequence of the obama democrats ' decision to destroy the senate filibuster will be the repeal of obamacare . under the old senate rules , a minority could use the filibuster to block undesired change . it required 60 votes to run over a determined minority . even if the republicans have a good outcome in 2014 and 2016 , there is a pretty good chance they will not win the 15 seats -lrb- one third of their current total membership -rrb- that would have been required to make major changes under the old senate rules . winning even 14 seats in the next two elections would have left them one short of a filibuster proof majority -lrb- and that assumes all the republicans would agree on repeal -rrb- . now , with one clever move , the obama democrats have lowered the bar from 60 votes to 51 . the odds of gaining six seats from the current 45 are dramatically better than trying to pick up 15 seats . for my entire career in the house , including when i was speaker , we were told again and again of the things we could n't pass because they would n't get through a senate filibuster . now that inhibition is gone . the democrats will try to say they have only eliminated the filibuster for certain cases involving presidential appointees , not legislation . but what they have really eliminated is a longstanding principle of the senate . with a simple majority , republicans could soon push through dramatic changes like the replacement of obamacare because a liberal minority would have no tools to stop it . in 2016 , every republican candidate for house , senate , and president will be asked if he or she is committed to replacing obamacare in the first 100 days . virtually all of them will pledge to do so . the opportunity for a breakout from the entire obsolete bureaucratic structure is now enormous . this makes the 2014 and 2016 elections among the highest stakes of any in recent memory . when obamacare disappears with a simple majority vote in the senate , thank president obama and senator reid for the new senate rules which made it possible . it all started this week . it will end around march 1 , 2017 . the die has been cast . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of newt gingrich .", "summary": " newt gingrich : unintended effect of senate filibuster change will be obamacare repeal .   dems ditching 60-vote rule means only 51 in gop needed to push through changes , he says .   he says gop 's 2016 candidates will be asked to commit to repealing law .   gingrich : possibility of undoing law raises stakes of next two elections .
