{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- from denali to mount rainier to mount washington , the u.s. is full of majestic , towering peaks that have long challenged people to climb them . this story is not about those . this story is about humbler summits -- some of them are n't even hills -- that beckon hikers in largely flat , low-lying parts of the country . they have modest names like charles mound and hoosier hill , and you can climb some of them in your slippers without breaking a sweat . why would you ? well , these summits are all notable for one thing : they 're the highest points in their states . and a certain variety of mountaineer -- peak baggers , they 're called -- will seek them out just for that reason .  if you 're a true peak bagger ... if that 's your mindset , then getting a state high point is a worthy goal ,  said greg slayden , who runs peakbagger.com , a mountaineering site .  whether it 's denali -lrb- the alaska peak known officially as mount mckinley -rrb- or the florida high point , they all count equally the same .  well , maybe not exactly . denali is 20,320 feet high and requires weeks of planning to summit . britton hill , in florida 's panhandle , is a short stroll from your car . but if you want to climb all 50 state high points , as slayden has done , you need to bag the baby peaks along with the big ones . consider driskill mountain -- a misnomer for sure -- a wooded bump in northern louisiana that 's a short scramble from a church parking lot . or iowa 's hawkeye point , which sits on the flatlands of a former farm that is barely higher than the surrounding prairie . mount hood it ai n't .  there are a lot of states where the actual high point is less than a 10-minute walk from your car ,  slayden said . perhaps the least rugged of them all is 442-foot high ebright azimuth , basically just a monument sign beside a road in suburban wilmington , delaware . a woman lives in a house across the street and sometimes greets visiting  hikers .  slayden , whose website keeps records of this stuff , estimates that fewer than 300 people have summited all 50 u.s. high points . but while all the highest and most challenging peaks are in western states , slayden has a soft spot for many of the little ones in the midwest and coastal states of the south .  if you 're into travel and exploring nooks and crannies of the country , it 's always fun to go to places you 've never been before ,  he said .  sure , there may not be a lot to the actual hike . but the overall experience is definitely worthwhile .
