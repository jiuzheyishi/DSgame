{"text": "just over 12 per cent of the teenagers interviewed as part of the study had thought about suicide -lrb- file picture -rrb- . roughly one in 25 teenagers in the u.s. has attempted suicide , while one in eight has thought about it , according to a national study based on interviews with thousands of teens . researchers said the numbers were similar to the prevalence of lifetime suicidal thinking and attempts reported by adults , suggesting the teenage years are an especially vulnerable time . the results are based on face-to-face interviews of close to 6,500 teens in the united states , along with questionnaires filled out by their parents . along with asking the youths about their suicidal thinking , plans and attempts , interviewers also determined which teens fit the bill for a range of mental disorders . matthew nock , a psychologist who worked on the study at harvard university , said : ` what adults say is , the highest risk time for first starting to think about suicide is in adolescence . ' the findings , which appeared in the journal jama psychiatry , suggest just over 12 per cent of the youths had thought about suicide , while four per cent had made a suicide plan and four per cent had attempted suicide . nock and his colleagues found almost all teens who thought about or attempted suicide had a mental disorder , including depression , bipolar disorder , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder -lrb- adhd -rrb- or problems with drug or alcohol abuse . more than half of the youths were already in treatment when they reported suicidal behavior , which nock said was both encouraging and disturbing . he said : ` we know that a lot of the kids who are at risk and thinking about suicide are getting -lrb- treatment -rrb- . ' but he warned : ` we do n't know how to stop them - we do n't have any evidence-based treatments for suicidal behavior . ' the findings leave many questions unanswered . because most youths who think about suicide never go on to make an actual plan or attempt it , doctors need to get better at figuring out which ones are most at risk of putting themselves in danger , according to nock . more than half of the youths were already in treatment when they reported suicidal behavior , which researchers say is both encouraging and disturbing -lrb- file picture -rrb- . once those youths are identified , researchers will also have to determine the best way to treat them , since it 's clear a lot of current methods are n't preventing suicidal behavior , he said . according to the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention , suicide is the third leading cause of death for people between the ages of ten and 24 . although girls are more likely to attempt suicide - a pattern confirmed by nock 's study - boys have higher rates of death by suicide .", "summary": " just over 12 per cent of teens had thought about suicide , researchers say .   harvard university study interviewed close to 6,500 youngsters .   almost all teens who attempted suicide had a mental disorder , study finds .
