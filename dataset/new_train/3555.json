{"text": "coffee chain caffe nero is to remove a poster from its branches that shows three men leering at a woman 's behind after customers complained it was sexist . the large illustration depicts two of the men lifting their sunglasses to peer at the backside of a lone woman as she walks but they now concede it may cause offence , and say it will be removed from all stores as soon as possible . caffe nero plans to remove dozens of these ` sexist ' posters , which show three men ogling a woman in the street . a caffe nero branch . chiefs say they have removed the offending poster after complaints it was sexist . teacher laura palmer , 32 , was visiting caffe nero in ashford , kent , with a group of new mothers when she spotted the print . she said : ` i think it 's a really inappropriate image , which in my view promotes sexual discrimination and the sexualisation of women . it has undertones which are almost creepy -- three guys standing by the side of the road in a pack with their eyes obviously drawn to the woman 's behind . i decided to complain . foaming with anger : it had been claimed the poster portrayed everyday italian life - instead it was accused of ` everyday sexism ' ` i was extremely shocked to be faced with such blatant leering at women . it just is n't the sort of image nero should be promoting . ' writer laura bates , founder of the online everyday sexism project which records women 's real-life brushes with sexism , said it was only right that the chain was taking the matter seriously . she said : ` some people will dismiss this as being a very minor issue , but behaviour like this is something that impacts on the lives of thousands of women and girls up and down the country . being harassed in the street is n't a harmless compliment -- it can be scary , uncomfortable and have a real impact on women 's lives . ' however , tory mp alec shelbrooke said he could not really understand what all the fuss was about . he said : ` i have never had anyone come to me with an issue like this -- and i have to admit that i do n't think the general public care that much . ' in an email response to ms palmer 's complaint , a customer service worker for caffe nero said : ` this is one of 1,000 images we use in our stores , designed to portray italian culture . but i can see how this might cause offence , which was never intended . ' caffe nero spokeswoman ceri aiken said : ` we have stopped actively using this image , meaning it is no longer used in new stores , or existing stores given a refresh . we are also in the process of removing the image from stores where it is displayed .
