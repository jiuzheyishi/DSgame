{"text": "two o'clock in the morning and i 'm sitting on the side of the bed , drenched in sweat . it 's minus five outside , yet the skylight window is wide open and a fan is whirring by my side . the damp bed is so uncomfortable that i have to change the sheets and pillowcases before i can go back to sleep - even though i need to be up in four hours ' time . when it 's at its worst - at least once a month - i sleep in the spare bedroom . peter , my other half , has been incredibly supportive , even though he 's been as sleep-deprived as me over the years . i 'd love to pause the ` change ' - my menopause is a ` waking nightmare ' , says barbara metcalfe . this waking nightmare is my menopause - my so-called ` change ' . it 's four years since it started , i have no idea when it will end and it 's causing my life to disintegrate around me . i hate and resent it , and can not understand why any woman would relish it . but apparently some do . indeed , in last week 's femail , jenni murray , the esteemed broadcaster and journalist , offered the somewhat controversial view that the menopause ` ushers in the best years of a woman 's life ' . she was writing in response to research which claims women will eventually evolve out of the menopause , as we continue to have children later and later . i 'm afraid i can not meet it with ` courage and adventure ' as jenni suggests . any sense of adventure i might have had has been long lost in the myriad of ailments and conditions i am grappling with . since the onset of menopause i have not been able to wear shoes indoors , as my feet are so hot . even on the coldest day i sit in meetings , colleagues in fur-lined boots staring bemused at my bare toes . i wear thin linen clothing throughout the year and even then i find being in most buildings impossible . a trip to the local supermarket is like an invitation to a sauna . you 'll always find me in chilled foods . there really is nothing like a hot flush . if you 've never had one , you may think it 's just like going red with embarrassment . but it 's so much worse . it starts from within - like molten lava - and slowly takes you over . controversial : jenni murray believes that menopause ` ushers in the best years of a woman 's life ' it stops me mid-task and i am overwhelmed by the heat . it makes my ears ring and i feel sick and forget what i am doing or what i am saying . sometimes the side-effects are so debilitating and distressing that it 's tempting not to leave home.when i did make it to work - until last year i was a producer at the bbc - i would find myself erupting into huge rages over the office heating . ` if it 's 25 degrees you should be on a beach in a bikini , ' i would shout , and ram the thermostat down to 16c . i once actually snarled : ' i am the producer , i will decide what temperature to have . ' to get out of bed in the morning is a relief from the night sweats , but then begins a day marred by terrible tiredness , hot flushes and confusion . i constantly write lists so i do n't forget things . on bad days i feel as if i 'm losing my mind , just clinging on to reality . so much for a sense of adventure ! my menopause started when i was 50 and had a total hysterectomy . abnormal cells were found in my womb , which if left could have led to cancer , so i had my womb and ovaries removed . with my ovaries went my supply of the female hormone oestrogen . instead of having the slow dwindle of fertility that nature intends , i had what 's called a surgical menopause , when everything happens at once . i was still hooked up to a drip the day after surgery when the first sweats arrived . there was very little discussion in hospital about what i was to expect , as if the surgery and the after-effects were completely unrelated . i left hospital with nothing more than the internet to guide me . i found myself reading about all kinds of cures , from the conventional -lrb- hormone replacement therapy -rrb- to herbal remedies -lrb- black cohosh and red clover -rrb- and the utterly bizarre medication which is oestrogen extracted from the urine of pregnant mares . i went down the conventional route , and , full of hope , began a course of hrt . within days , my breasts felt painful and engorged . i became depressed and confused and - worse - the sweats and flushes did n't even abate . ` oh , did i mention the mood swings ? i . did n't just snarl about the air conditioning , one minute i was ranting . at the poor dog for getting under my feet , the next i was in floods of . tears when i 'd accidentally broken a glass in the kitchen . ' i gave it some time for the tablets to kick in - during which my already huge bosom went up a full cupsize - but i only became more bloated , itchy and frankly miserable . so , about six months later i came off it . i tried red clover and other natural remedies but quickly realised nothing was going to work . so i took nothing . i sometimes think i genuinely do have dementia , such is my lack of recall at times . my children laugh at me kindly , because i use the wrong words and forget key names and dates . i once told them an elderly neighbour had to be taken to prison , which had them flabbergasted . eventually they discovered i meant hospital . after my operation , my once impressive memory was shot to pieces . suddenly i could n't remember the names of colleagues i 'd worked with for years . one reporter was called hilary so often she started answering to it -- even though she 's really called naomi . i finally left my job at the bbc , which was in part down to the menopause . the building was incredibly hot and i found i was so exhausted when i got home . oh , did i mention the mood swings ? i did n't just snarl about the air conditioning , one minute i was ranting at the poor dog for getting under my feet , the next i was in floods of tears when i 'd accidentally broken a glass in the kitchen . and if my mind was breaking down , my body felt like an alien being , too . the lack of oestrogen has left the skin on my arms and legs dehydrated and itchy , which drives me to despair . sometimes i scratch until i bleed , even though there is no rash to be seen . my hair is turning into a brillo pad - i resemble hagrid , the robbie coltrane character in harry potter.i feel as if i have taken the express route to old age . the menopause is still thought of as something women just have to get on with , and this means , on top of all my symptoms , i feel like a failure because i struggle to cope . when my grandmother was going through the change , there was no discussion about it at all . likewise my mum , a district nurse , had to get on her bike and visit her patients as if she had n't a care in the world . it 's getting hot in here : for those with the menopause , hot flushes can be deeply debilitating . it was a personal battle women kept to themselves . my friend 's mum would vacuum in her bra and skirt because of her hot flushes . yet nothing was ever said , and no one ever questioned her . that was 30 years ago and it appears nothing much has changed . like generations of women before me , i have to get on with it . i have two young daughters , a partner and a dog , and an exciting job as a freelance tv producer , writer and lecturer . the alarm goes off daily at 6am and there is no going back to bed . yet some of the effects of the menopause are illnesses in themselves . just imagine a man or young woman waking repeatedly in the night , clothes soaked through and having to change the bed . would they just get up in the morning and go to work ? more than likely they would ring in sick and get a sympathetic hearing . but i wonder how many older women would do that . ring in and talk menopause with their bosses ? no thanks . recently , a friend had to take some time off work to recover from the fallout of her menopause . on her return , she was interviewed by two young male managers about her leave . she tried to explain her problems , but they stopped her mid-flow . either they could n't cope with ` women 's problems ' or they just did n't want to know . luckily for me , my doctor told me about clinical trials of specific anti-depressants , which had shown promising results controlling night sweats and flushes in menopausal women . so far they are helping me , but they 're all i have . because there is just no cure for this force of nature . if there was , i am sure i would be first in a very long line of women wanting it .", "summary": " barbara 's menopause started when she had a total hysterectomy .   since then , the ` change ' has been ' a waking nightmare '   barbara left her job at the bbc in part because of her menopause .
