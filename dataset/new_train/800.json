{"text": "health secretary jeremy hunt , pictured with his family , has caused tension in the tory party after saying he believes the abortion limit should be halved to 12 weeks . health secretary jeremy hunt was embroiled in a major row last night after controversially backing a reduction in the abortion time limit from 24 weeks to just 12 weeks . the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists -lrb- rcog -rrb- described hunt 's comments as ` insulting to women ' and said such a policy would cause serious harm . the prime minister and the department of health were forced to distance themselves from mr hunt 's views -- aired just weeks after his appointment in the cabinet reshuffle -- and insisted that there were no plans to change the current policy on abortion . however , david cameron indicated that he supported a ` modest reduction ' in the current limit and home secretary theresa may also revealed her support for the limit to be reduced to 20 weeks . but last night mr cameron said he did not agree with mr hunt . ` he is a member of parliament , he is absolutely entitled to hold an individual view , a view of conscience and on this issue all members of parliament -- prime ministers , health secretaries , everybody -- has to vote according to their consciences , ' he said . ` but people need to know the government has got no plans to bring forward any legislation in this area and any vote that does happen will be a free vote . ' mr cameron added : ` i personally have voted for a modest reduction from the current limit of 24 weeks because i think there are some medical arguments for that . ' mr hunt was forced to clarify his views yesterday after failing to acknowledge medical abortions , when women choose to end a pregnancy after discovering severe foetal abnormalities . various medical conditions are often picked up only at the 12-week or 20-week scans and mr hunt 's failure to recognise this led to accusations that he was ` out of touch ' with women 's health issues . but a spokeswoman for the health secretary said : ` he is in favour of abortions for medical reasons . so the accusation that a 12-week limit would curtail testing for conditions like down 's syndrome is simply not true . ` he is talking about abortions for social reasons after 12 weeks . ' prime minister david cameron , pictured two years ago with his wife samantha and their newborn baby daughter florence , says there are no plans to change the law on abortion . mr hunt made his comments in his first major interview since accepting the health brief in july . he originally voted in favour of halving the termination limit during a commons vote in 2008 as a member of the shadow cabinet . ` everyone looks at the evidence and comes to a view about when they think that moment is , and my own view is that 12 weeks is the right point for it , ' he said . ` it 's just my view about that incredibly difficult question about the moment that we should deem life to start . i do n't think the reason i have that view is for religious reasons . ' home secretary theresa may has also revealed her support to modestly reduce the abortion limit from 24 to 20 weeks . mr hunt 's comments were widely condemned . yvette cooper , shadow home secretary and minister for women & equalities , said : ` everyone has personal views but as health secretary , jeremy hunt has a responsibility to lead government policy on women 's health . ` perhaps the most chilling part of his interview is the claim that 12 weeks is based on evidence when it undoubtedly is not . david cameron needs to make sure his health secretary does n't distort medical evidence and does not impose his own view on women about their health . ' diane abbott , labour 's shadow public health minister , accused ministers of ` playing politics with people 's lives ' and insisted there was no justification for a reduction in the present limit . meanwhile , tory mp dr sarah woollaston tweeted : ` profoundly disagree with hunt on lowering abortion limit ; would restrict access to safe abortion for most vulnerable who present late . ' rcog spokeswoman dr kate guthrie said : ` the comments made by jeremy hunt politicise the debate around the abortion time limit and do not put women at the centre of their care . reducing the time limit to 12 weeks would severely limit women 's choice at an extremely difficult time in their life . ' according to official figures , there were 189,931 abortions in 2011 , only a slight increase since 2010 . more than 90 per cent took place before 13 weeks and just eight per cent were carried out between 12 weeks and 24 weeks . of those , 2,307 were carried out because of a risk the child would be born disabled . those who argue for a reduction in the limit say there is evidence that a child born at 20 weeks could survive in hospital .", "summary": " health secretary 's view described as ` insulting ' by the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists .   david cameron said hunt is entitled to his own opinion .   but adds there are no plans to change the law regarding the abortion limit .   pm said he supports a ` modest ' reduction in the 24-week current limit .
