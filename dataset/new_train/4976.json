{"text": "another common household object is getting  smart  and hopping online . this time it 's your smoke detector . nest is releasing a new smoke and carbon monoxide detector called nest protect that will send a message to your mobile device when the alarm is triggered or when the battery is low , so you can be alerted to an emergency at home even while you are away . in addition to the usual loud beeping alarm sound , the nest protect has added a recording of a human voice that will describe the problem . this is the first entirely new product tche silicon valley company has introduced since its flagship nest thermostat . nest was started by ex-apple designer tony fadell in 2010 . fadell said he was looking for a better way to make his tahoe home more energy efficient . the nest thermostat learns your patterns over time and automatically controls a home 's heating and cooling systems for maximum efficiency . old thermostats were wasteful , but what did nest think was wrong with the traditional smoke and carbon monoxide detectors ? annoyance seemed to be first on the list . when the battery is low in a smoke alarm , the small white discs emit a low beep until the battery is replaced . annoyance can be a safety issue . when a sensitive alarm is set off by everyday occurrences like burnt waffles , some people remove the batteries from their alarm to shut it up and are left unprotected . nest protect eases you into an emergency instead of immediately blaring every time kitchen experiment goes awry . when it first detects smoke or carbon monoxide , the device will turn yellow and the human voice will say where the smoke or carbon monoxide levels are high . since most alarms are affixed to the ceiling , getting to them to turn off an alarm requires a tall person or a chair . nest has added a sensor that lets you wave at the device to reset it or to get more information about an alarm . one of the selling points of smart objects is that they can talk to each other . the nest protect can connect with the nest thermostat so that when carbon monoxide is detected , the thermostat can power down the gas furnace to be safe . it also connects with other nest protect devices and can communicate which location is detecting a problem . this is not the first connected smoke alarm . some existing  smart home  systems already include support for traditional fire and carbon monoxide alarms . you can connect a smoke alarm to a system like smartthings or lowe 's iris and set it up so that you get a text , phone call or e-mail notification on a phone or tablet when an alarm goes off . those alarms are just connected versions of traditional devices and do not have features like human voices or wave controls . connected home devices are a growing market , and most systems are focused on creating vast networks of inexpensive connected objects , like front door locks , motion sensors , power switches and thermostats . nest 's approach is different . it is investing money and time into completely redesigning the objects themselves instead of just creating a system for connecting inexpensive objects to a larger network . the result might be a better experience , but the cost for each device is much higher . the nest protect is $ 129 , a first alert smoke and carbon monoxide detector that can connect to lowe 's iris system costs $ 40 .", "summary": " nest protect is a new  smart  smoke and carbon monoxide detector .   it sends alerts to phones , turns off with a wave and includes a human voice recording .   the $ 129 device will be available in november online and in best buy stores .
