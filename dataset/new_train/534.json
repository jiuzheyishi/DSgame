{"text": "amish children raised on rural farms in northern indiana suffer from asthma and allergies less often even than swiss farm kids , a group known to be relatively free from allergies , according to a new study . ` the rates are very , very low , ' said dr. mark holbreich , . the study 's lead author . ` so there 's something that we feel is even . more protective in the amish ' than in european farming communities . healthy : a study compared amish children in indiana to children on farms in switzerland , where most of the amish originated . what it is about growing up on farms -- and amish farms in particular -- that seems to prevent allergies remains unclear . researchers have long observed the so-called ` farm effect ' -- the low allergy and asthma rates . found among kids raised on farms -- in central europe , but less is . known about the influence of growing up on north american farms . holbreich , an allergist in indianapolis , has been . treating amish communities in indiana for two decades , but he noticed . that very few amish actually had any allergies . as studies on the farm effect in europe began to emerge . several years ago , holbreich wondered if the same phenomenon might be . found in the united states . he teamed up with european colleagues to compare swiss farming children and non-farming children to amish kids in indiana . just five percent of amish children had allergies , compared to 11.2 percent of all swiss children . amish families , who can trace their roots back to . switzerland , typically farm using methods from the 1800s and they do n't . own cars or televisions . the researchers surveyed 157 amish families , about . 3,000 swiss farming families , and close to 11,000 swiss families who did . not live on a farm -- all with children between the ages of six and 12 . they found that just five percent of amish kids had . been diagnosed with asthma , compared to 6.8 percent of swiss farm kids . and 11.2 percent of the other swiss children . similarly , among 138 amish kids given a skin-prick test . to determine whether they were predisposed to having allergies , only 10 . kids -- or seven percent -- had a positive response . in comparison , 25 percent of the farm-raised swiss kids . and 44 percent of the other swiss children had a positive test , the . researchers report in the journal of allergy and clinical immunology . the study did not determine why the kids who grew up on . farms were less likely to develop asthma and allergies , but other . research has pointed to exposure to microbes and contact with cows , in . particular , to partially explain the farm effect . drinking raw cow 's milk also seems to be involved , holbreich said . the going theory is this early exposure to the diverse . potential allergens and pathogens on a farm trains the immune system to . recognize them , but not overreact to the harmless ones . as for why the amish kids have even lower allergy and . asthma rates than the other farming kids , ` that piece of the puzzle we . really have n't explained , ' holbreich told reuters health . he speculated that it could be at least partly a result of the amish having larger families or spending even more time outside or in barns than people on more modern working farms . dr corinna bowser , an allergist in cherry hill , new . jersey , said there 's also a possibility that inherited factors could . play a role . ` the amish are still of a limited genetic pool , i would . assume , because they 're much more segregated than the swiss kids are , ' she told reuters health . holbreich said upcoming studies will further . investigate the differences between the farming groups , with an eye . toward designing possible interventions . for instance , pregnant mothers or young children could . be exposed to the mysterious factors that seem to protect farm kids as a . preventive treatment , he explained . ` the goal is to try to find a way to prevent this . allergy and asthma epidemic that western populations are facing , ' holbreich said .", "summary": " study compared children on amish farms in indiana to children in switzerland , where most amish originate .   amish children have 5 percent allergy rate , compared to 11.2 percent among swiss kids .
