' i was scared he 'd died and went straight down there . when we got to alvaston park he was lying on the floor and looked quite a mess . ` in the ambulance , his eyes started rolling back in his head . he was fighting and kicking . it was horrible . he kept trying to get up and get the collar off his neck .
