{"text": "dressed in police and army uniforms , the suicide bombers placed themselves among the security officials lined up to cast their ballots . the soldiers and police were waiting to vote early , ahead of wednesday 's parliamentary elections -- iraq 's first nationwide polls since the withdrawal of u.s. forces at the end of 2011 . but the men , charged with protecting polling stations and voters on election day , came under attack themselves as the militants detonated explosives , killing and injuring dozens of people across the country . in an apparent attempt to derail the balloting process and discourage the rest of iraq 's 21.5 million registered voters from going to the polls , suicide bombers struck several polling stations as well as other locations in a wave of attacks in baghdad and northern iraq on monday and tuesday . with a surge in car bombings , assassinations and suicide attacks , the vote -- the fourth national election since the fall of longtime leader saddam hussein in 2003 -- is being held amid rapidly growing violence reaching levels not seen in more than five years . across villages and cities in the shattered nation , the echoing deep boom of explosions has become all too familiar for iraqis .  we depend on god each time we leave the house , because you do n't know what fate holds for you ,  one man said . wave of attacks . shootings and explosions across the country on monday killed 53 people and wounded more than 100 others . in addition to the targeted polling stations , a suicide attacker killed at least 18 people and wounded 33 others at a kurdish political gathering in the town of khanaqin , 160 kilometers -lrb- 100 miles -rrb- northeast of baghdad . the gathering was in celebration of iraqi president jalal talabani , who appeared on television casting his vote in germany where he has been getting medical treatment . on tuesday , at least 12 people were killed when twin roadside bombs exploded in a busy outdoor market in al-saadiya , about 120 kilometers northeast of baghdad . another 18 were wounded , police officials told cnn . iraq has tightened security measures ahead of the elections , banning vehicles from the streets on tuesday night and closing roads in and out of the capital . but on the eve of the polls , the country is fast returning to the horrors of its recent past . prime minister nuri al-maliki is battling for a third term in office but faces fierce opposition from political opponents , with sectarian violence at its most intense in more than five years . deadly year . iraq has been beset with political and sectarian violence for months , often pitting sunnis -- a minority in iraq -- against shiite muslims , who came to dominate the government after saddam hussein was overthrown in 2003 . the united nations said 2013 was the deadliest year in iraq since 2008 , with more than 8,800 people killed , most of them civilians . tensions continue to be fueled by widespread discontent among the sunnis , who say they are marginalized by the shiite-led government and unfairly targeted by heavy-handed security tactics . sunni anger has made it easier for al qaeda-linked militants to recruit and operate while eroding the public 's cooperation with security forces . violence flared just a few months ago because of the arrest of a sunni lawmaker in anbar 's capital , ramadi , and the dismantling of protest sites by the army in falluja and ramadi . iraq 's security forces , trained by the united states at a cost of billions of dollars , have been unable to dislodge the militants and instead are fighting pitched battles . other endemic problems gripping the country include high unemployment levels , dilapidated infrastructure and services , and chronic corruption . oil revenues have failed to improve the lives of most iraqis . the vote . the dire security situation in which the elections are going ahead is reminiscent of the country 's first post-hussein elections in 2005 , when threats from al qaeda insurgents led to minimal turnouts in most sunni provinces . al-maliki , whose state of law alliance is seen as a front-runner , on tuesday called on iraqis to take part in the vote .  your presence and your insistence to exercise your legitimate national and historical right represents a real response to the terrorists and sectarianism and those who stand behind them ,  he said in a statement . some 277 political entities across iraq will compete for 328 seats of the iraqi council of representatives , the country 's parliament . there are 9,032 candidates . the voting has been canceled in parts of anbar province , controlled by jihadists and tribesmen .  it does n't bode well for stability if the electoral results do not reflect an accurate representation of the political realities on the ground ,  ramzy mardini , nonresident fellow at the atlantic council , told cnn .  what 's more worrisome is , what happens next ? will the government double down on a military offensive in anbar ? does fighting intensify between sunni tribes ? does maliki take advantage to exploit the divisions ? does the violence eventually spill over into baghdad ? will anbar be neglected , whereby it converges closer to the adjacent insurgency inside syria ? as is always the case with iraq , nothing is inevitable , anything is possible .  observing from outside . following the last parliamentary election in 2010 , it took nearly eight months of intense backdoor negotiations for iraq 's bickering politicians to finally form a government . this time , though , there are no u.s. forces on the ground , and washington will be watching from afar .  the united states is facing a dire situation in iraq , whereby both instability in the political and security realms are converging ,  mardini said .  if there is no resolution in the upcoming post-election saga in forming a government , iraq 's security situation is expected to worsen . unlike past electoral cycles , the united states lacks the influence to bring about a resolution , and without its military presence , the psychological effect that helped pacify political behavior is no longer there as a coolant .  iraq 's neighbors will also be keeping an eye out for any serious implications in a region that is still coming to terms with the geopolitical effects of the arab spring . for iran , the unity of the shiite political class is a core interest , because it determines the depth and scope of its influence in iraq , mardini said .  a new emerging interest for tehran could be the maintenance of the status quo in baghdad ,  he said .  the ousting of maliki could symbolically undermine tehran 's efforts in safeguarding the survival of the syrian regime in damascus .  editors ' note : this article has been edited to remove plagiarized content after cnn discovered multiple instances of plagiarism by marie-louise gumuchian , a former cnn news editor .", "summary": " iraq holds nationwide vote on wednesday , first since u.s. troop withdrawal in 2011 .   runup to polls has been violent , with election centers attacked this week .   iraq has been beset with political and sectarian violence for months .   prime minister nuri al-maliki is battling for a third term in office .
