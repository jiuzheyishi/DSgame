{"text": "rain has played havoc with the u.s. open in new york in recent years but two new retractable roofs mean the weather-related woes will soon be a thing of the past . the united states tennis association said thursday at a news conference in new york that tennis ' largest stadium would benefit from a retractable roof as early as 2016 , bringing the event in line with two other majors that already have cover -- the australian open and wimbledon . a more realistic forecast for that roof is 2017 , though , the usta said . the usta added that the tournament 's secondary show court , louis armstrong stadium , would have its own retractable roof by 2018 and has n't ruled out the possibility of covering a third arena at a later stage . the overall cost of the wide ranging project -- which will also include building a new and bigger louis armstrong stadium and grandstand court -- is expected to hit $ 550 million , the usta said . both of those stadiums are roughly 50 years old . the retractable roof over arthur ashe alone is expected to cost in excess of $ 100 million . the men 's governing body in the u.s. will  self-finance  the project through a combination of bonds and  usta revenue generation ,  it said in a statement .  we have been working toward a viable design for a roof on arthur ashe stadium for more than a decade ,  usta chairman and president dave haggerty said in the statement .  through a long and arduous process , we feel that we now have a design that meets the criteria of being architecturally sound , aesthetically pleasing , reasonably affordable and buildable .  players including women 's no. 1 serena williams welcomed the news , which likely will mean the tournament wo n't enter a 15th day . the previous five editions have seen monday men 's finals because of rain , in some cases leading to an unfair advantage for one of the participants in the finale . in 2008 , while roger federer was already through to the final after completing his semifinal on a saturday , andy murray had to finish his semifinal a day later due to bad weather before contesting the final on the monday .  obviously it 's going to be great ,  williams told reporters in cincinnati , where she is competing at the western & southern open .  it 's good to know they 're going for it .  when i first started playing the open back in the '90s , it did n't rain and now it rains only on the final weekend . last four u.s. opens i 've played , they 've had to change completely the schedule .  you just got to keep moving with the times ,  said williams , who missed the 2010 u.s. open due to a foot injury . murray , however , said having a roof was n't without its negatives .  i do n't necessarily miss being rained off , but rain delays used to be part of -lrb- grand slams -rrb- ,  murray told reporters in cincinnati .  that 's kind of going away gradually .  i do n't particularly like going from indoors to outdoors . it 's also so tough . but it 's good for tv .  the usta has indeed for years looked into having a retractable roof at arthur ashe stadium -- which seats 22,500 fans -- but it was thought the extra weight could n't be supported . technological and engineering advances have now made the work possible . by the time all the enhancements are completed , it 's anticipated that an extra 10,000 fans per day will be able watch the tennis on site . tennis ' other major , the french open , is hoping to have a roof in place for 2018 although that is not guaranteed . tsonga pulls out of new york . jo-wilfried tsonga , meanwhile , is skipping this year 's u.s. open because of the knee injury that forced him to retire at wimbledon , he told his website . the entertaining frenchman was forced to stop against ernests gulbis in the second round at the all england club in june and has n't played since .  it would be stupid to go there knowing full well that i have no chance because i 'm not prepared enough ,  the world no. 8 said . although he has yet to win a grand slam -- the french men 's drought in singles extends to 30 years -- tsonga had reached the quarterfinals or better in four of his five majors prior to wimbledon . he 's optimistic of returning in time for an indoor tournament in france in mid-september . this season 's u.s. open begins august 26th .", "summary": " the u.s. open will have a retractable roof over arthur ashe stadium as early as 2016 .   the tournament has been affected by rain since 2008 , leading to monday finals .   new and bigger second and third show courts will also be constructed on site .   this year 's tournament will be without jo-wilfried tsonga , who pulled out injured .
