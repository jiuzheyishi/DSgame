{"text": "scientists at university college london have hacked a pair of sandals which they claim will allow people to ` hear themselves happy ' forget meditation and self-help books , the key to a happy life could be down to the sounds you hear . scientists in london have hacked a pair of sandals which they claim will allow people to ` hear themselves happy ' . the sandals link to headphones which change the sound of each footstep to gradually make a person feel lighter . volunteers who wore the sandals said they felt slimmer , with longer legs and looser knees . they also reported feeling happier and more energised . the shoes were created by ana tajadura-jiminez at university college london 's hearing body project . ` it would give the same benefits as the sandals when walking or running , perhaps in the gym to feel lighter and more motivated , ' ms tajadura-jiminez said in an interview with new scientist . ` we are finding that sound is affecting not just the perception of our body shape but our physical capabilities . understand these sounds and we could change our feelings in a positive way . ' the sandals exploit a phenomenon called ` predictive coding ' in which the brain makes decisions based on past experience . ms tajadura-jiminez explained that if the sensory feedback you get is not what you were expecting you update your predictions . technology such as this could help people with as body dysmorphia , where a mental illness makes them unable to see themselves correctly . scroll down to watch the video and try the experiment yourself . during the test , a participant was asked to run her finger across a strip of smooth plastic -lrb- pictured -rrb- . as she moved her hand , headphones played the sound of a finger moving across different surfaces . experts believe that auditory changes confuse and disrupt the brain , and this creates a mismatch between the senses . ` something that enhances runner 's perception would be very popular , ' sports engineer steve haake at sheffield hallam university told the telegraph . in a separate experiment in particular , ms tajadura-jiminez proved that sounds can trick the brain into thinking they 're touching a variety of different surfaces . during the test , reported in new scientist , a participant was asked to run her finger across a strip of smooth plastic . as she moved her hand , headphones played the sound of a finger moving across paper , sandpaper and velvet . when the sound of a finger moving across sandpaper -lrb- stock image left -rrb- and velvet -lrb- right -rrb- were played , the participant reported noticeable changes in how the plastic felt beneath her finger . researchers want to study how sounds can be manipulated to affect a person 's mood and perception . the participant reported noticeable changes in how the plastic felt beneath her finger after each sound . dr anatajadura-jiménez believes that auditory changes confuse and disrupt the brain , and creates a mismatch between the senses . this is a similar experience people get when viewing optical illusions . in the case of optical illusions , colour , light and patterns are used to create images that deceive or mislead the brain . the information collected by the eye is processed by the brain . in the process of converting what it sees , the brain tries to make sense of the different colours and patterns . this creates a perception that does n't match the image , and confuses the brain . similarly , in terms of audio changes , the information collected by the ear is processed by the brain , which then tries to make sense of the differences . as the brain tries to account for discrepancies , it produces a variety of sensations . as part of the project , dr tajadura-jimenez also studies how auditory information generated by the human body affects how that person comes across , and how people see them . ` this mental representation we have of our bodies is essential for successful interaction with the environment , ' explained dr tajadura-jimenez . previous studies have highlighted the role that sight , touch and a person 's own perception - known as proprioception - play in representation . but , the effect sounds have on these senses and experiences have n't been investigated in depth . ` interestingly , the sounds that accompany almost every bodily movement are highly rich in information about the body and the space immediately surrounding it , ' continued dr tajadura-jimenez . she used the example that the sounds produced when tapping on a surface tells people about the length and strength of their arm . dr tajadura-jiménez believes that auditory changes confuse and disrupt the brain , and creates a mismatch between the senses . this is similar to the experience people have when viewing optical illusions . in the case of optical illusions , colour , light and patterns are used to create images that deceive or mislead the brain . the information collected by the eye is processed by the brain . in the process of converting what it sees , the brain tries to make sense of the different colours and patterns . this creates a perception that does n't match the image , and confuses the brain . similarly , in terms of audio changes , the information collected by the ear is processed by the brain , which then tries to make sense of the differences . as the brain tries to account for discrepancies , it produces a variety of sensations . the sensations are similar to those experience when people watch optical illusions -lrb- pictured -rrb- . in the case of optical illusions , colour , light and patterns are used to create images that deceive or mislead the brain . the information collected by the senses processed by the brain , which then tries to make sense of it . in another experiment , the pitch created by a person 's footsteps was made higher or lower . when lower , the footsteps produced a sound that suggested the person was heavier than they were . this caused participants to report that their legs felt heavier and the steps felt laboured . higher pitches made people feel lighter .", "summary": " scientists at university college london linked sandals to headphones .   they changed sound of each footstep to make a person feel lighter .   volunteers who wore sandals said they felt happy and more energetic .   as part of same study , a participant ran her finger across smooth plastic .   headphones played sound of finger across paper , sandpaper and velvet .   the participant reported noticeable changes in how the plastic felt .   the tests were devised by dr ana tajadura-jimenez for her hearing body project at the university of college london .
