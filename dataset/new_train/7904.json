{"text": "little ground breaker : heath kidd is the first baby to be born using a new ivf treatment . he 's only seven weeks old , but little heath kidd is already a pioneer . his birth -- the result of a groundbreaking technique dubbed ` the natural ivf ' -- could offer hope to thousands of women who are currently unable to have children . while conventional ivf involves the mother being injected with artificial hormones , baby heath was conceived with a new method that uses a naturally occurring hormone , kisspeptin . this helps produce eggs in a safer way for the mother and avoids some of the risks associated with traditional ivf . heath 's mother suzannah said she was thrilled with her ` groundbreaker ' baby , who was born in april weighing 7.5 lb after a ` normal , healthy pregnancy ' . and while mrs kidd is the first to give birth , ten more women are expecting babies following the breakthrough study at hammersmith hospital 's ivf unit in west london , conducted with imperial college , london . experts hope the treatment could be widely available in as little as two years . ` we are over-the-moon to have heath , ' mrs kidd said . ` we feel so lucky to have him . ` it shows it does work and to know that we have helped move ivf treatment on is great . ' mrs kidd , 34 , had tried for years to get pregnant after marrying husband calum , 31 , a project manager for a construction firm in 2008 , but with no success . after being diagnosed with ` unexplained ' fertility problems and referred for conventional ivf on the nhs at hammersmith hospital , mrs kidd , who works as a credit manager , became pregnant with son lochlann , now two , in march 2011 . although they longed for another baby they were not entitled to any further rounds of ivf on the nhs . bundle of joy : heath , seven weeks , with his parents , suzannah and calum kidd and older brother lochlann . new technique : compared to traditional ivf treatment , where artificial hormones are used , which the kidds underwent with two year old lochlann , heath was conceived using natural hormones . the pair were attempting to save the # 6,000 required to pay for the treatment privately when mrs kidd spotted a poster advertising the new kisspeptin ivf trial at hammersmith hospital and phoned straight away to see if she was eligible . conventional ivf uses injections of high levels of ovary-stimulating drugs to mature eggs faster for collection . but there are well-recognised risks to the mother if the ovaries are over-stimulated , known as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome . this can endanger her life by leaking excess fluid into other parts of the body , leading to blood clots . the risks are particularly serious for women with polycystic ovaries . kisspeptin is a naturally occurring hormone that researchers suspected could be successfully used as a safer way to induce a woman 's eggs to mature and become ripe for fertilisation . in normal pregnancies the body produces a surge of luteinizing hormone -lrb- lh -rrb- , which supports egg maturation and triggers ovulation . in traditional ivf an injection of human chorionic gonadotropin -lrb- hcg -rrb- mimics this . however , it can overstimulate the ovaries in women at high risk , especially those with polycystic ovaries . the kisspeptin , which has been produced in a synthetic form by the researchers , acts on the pituitary gland and sets off this lh surge . she began to receive the trial treatment in july last year . ' i did n't notice any difference at all from when i had the conventional ivf with lochlann , ' she said . a fertilised embryo was implanted within days of the final injection and mrs kidd discovered she was pregnant just three weeks later . the study looked at the effectiveness of using kisspeptin to induce egg development in place of conventional hormone injections . in regular ivf , the hormone injections that are used for egg development can trigger a serious condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome -lrb- ohss -rrb- . this results in over-stimulation of the ovaries -- causing too many eggs to be released . in some rare cases , this condition can even lead to death . those most at risk are women who can not have children because they have polycystic ovary syndrome -lrb- pcos -rrb- . as many as one in 12 women has pcos , in which the polycystic ovary has tiny cysts around the outside , thought to be follicles that have failed to develop properly to release an egg . for those women , this safer treatment is a major breakthrough . professor waljit dhillo , of imperial college , said : ` the results of the study are very encouraging and whilst we are primarily looking at women most at risk of developing ohss , there is the potential kisspeptin could be used across all ivf treatments as a more natural alternative .
