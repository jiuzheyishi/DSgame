{"text": "stay optimistic : david cameron will be told to resist copying ukip , in light of a conservative triumph in the newark by-election . david cameron will today be told to stick to an ` optimistic ' message and resist becoming ` ukip-lite ' after his party successfully defended a by-election seat for the first time in 25 years . conservative candidate robert jenrick held off the threat of a ukip ` earthquake ' , winning newark with a reduced majority of 7,403 . it was the first time the tories have successfully defended a seat in a by-election since william hague won in richmond , yorkshire , in 1989 . ukip 's candidate roger helmer surged from a distant fourth in 2010 to second , but with 25 per cent of the vote he failed in his party 's aim of reaching 30 per cent . mr helmer admitted yesterday that the failure of ` box office ' party leader nigel farage to campaign hard in the nottinghamshire constituency may have impacted on the result -- less than a fortnight after ukip topped the european elections poll . today a senior tory minister will claim the campaign tactic of concentrating on the ` long-term economic plan ' had been the right one . in a speech entitled reasons to be cheerful , home office minister damian green will say : ` what newark tells us is that the temptation to become ukip-lite should be firmly resisted . ` the political battle of our times is between optimists and pessimists . conservatives should be optimists believing that free markets and a strong society are the basis for a successful country in this century . ' ukip 's rise in support pushed labour into third place , while lib dem support was obliterated -- leaving their candidate trailing in sixth place . ed miliband 's party saw its vote share fall -- a disappointing result less than a year from a general election in a constituency the party won during tony blair 's first landslide in 1997 . in a sign of the depth of concern in the tory camp over the possibility of losing , the prime minister hit the campaign trail in newark four times . victory : robert jenrick , centre , was elected mp for newark in nottinghamshire , beating ukip 's roger helmer , left . mr farage accused the tories of running a ` nasty ' campaign , but insisted his party had still achieved one of its best by-election results . nigel farage 's lack of appeal to female voters helped the tories win in newark , a survey found . a . poll before the election showed the parties neck-and-neck among men . while nearly three times as many women would vote tory compared to ukip . it found 36.8 per cent of men planned to vote for ukip 's roger helmer , with 36.2 per cent backing tory robert jenrick . but only 16.8 per cent of women backed ukip , against 47.6 per cent intending to vote tory . ` i think there 'll be an awful lot of conservatives with a majority of less than 10,000 who will look upon this result in sheer horror , ' he said . ` for ukip , it 's still a good night 's work . ' experts said that newark -- together with the recent local and european elections -- provided no evidence that labour was on track to win an overall majority next may . john curtice , professor of politics at strathclyde university , said : ` labour do not have the enthusiasm and depth of support in the electorate that make them look like an alternative government . ` it is not the sign of a party making progress , but a party which seems to be in retreat , and now retreating so far that if it goes any further there will be question marks about its ability to win the next election . ' nick clegg 's lib dems garnered just 1,004 votes and 2.6 per cent of the vote -- bad enough for it to lose its deposit for the ninth by-election since joining the coalition . mr cameron said : ` we need to work between now and the election to say very clearly we have got a long-term plan , we are getting britain back to work , we are cutting people 's taxes , we are helping hard-working people . the job is n't finished yet but we are on the right track , let 's stick at it . ' ps . as his party suffered in newark , mr clegg looked like he had n't a care in the world as he fooled around for the cameras at a book launch for lord ashdown . goofy : nick clegg leaves paddy ashdown 's book launch in piccadilly , central london .", "summary": " speech by tory minister today will support strategy of focusing on economy .   conservative robert jenrick won newark seat with a majority of 7,403 .   he saw off ukip candidate roger helmer , who came second .
