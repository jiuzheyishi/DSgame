{"text": "there are houses for cold climates , designed to keep in the heat , and there are homes for hot climates , built to allow air to sweep through and keep its owners cool - but never did the two meet , until now . a pair of london architects has designed an incredible ` folding ' house that shapeshifts into eight different configurations and automatically adapts to the changing seasons . called d * dynamic , the structure was inspired by the work of an early 20th century mathematician who discovered a way to dissect a square and rearrange its parts into an equilateral triangle . scroll down for video . called d * dynamic , the structure -lrb- pictured -rrb- was inspired by the work of an early 20th century mathematician who discovered a way to dissect a square and rearrange its parts into an equilateral triangle . the ` folding ' house shapeshifts into eight different configurations that automatically adapt to the changing seasons . for example , in the summer , bedroom one faces east and tracks the sunrise using a series of sensors . as the owner wakes up , the house automatically rotates to ensure they are constantly bathed in sunlight , while the house generates energy through its solar panels . in winter , the house is in a square formation , with small windows and high thermal mass , which the designers describe as ` literally hugging itself . ' as the seasons change and climate warms , the house opens up , ` like a flower ' to allow light and air to penetrate the inside of the building creating panoramic views of the surroundings . the house is the brainchild of architects david grunberg and daniel woolfson , who launched the d * haus company to develop the concept . the architects said the house will cost # 2 million -lrb- $ 3.1 million -rrb- , but if they are able to produce in in bulk , this could drop the price to # 800,000 -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- . 'd * dynamic literally unfolds itself , ' said the designers . ` the internal walls become external walls , doors become windows and windows become doors . ' a house like this has never been done before in the history of architecture and we believe that creating buildings that can adapt and change is a much more sustainable way of living . ' as the owner wakes up , the house automatically rotates to make sure they are constantly in sunlight , while the house generates energy through its solar panels . during winter , the house is in a square formation , with small windows and high thermal mass , which the designers describe as ` literally hugging itself ' . swipe the yellow bar above to see the house transform . the layout consists of two bedrooms , an open-plan living room and a bathroom , but it can be adapted to suit the needs of different living situations . aside from moving to provide more light , or expand the view , the house is also designed to save money on heating , and prevent energy waste . the largest part of the house would remain stationary with solid foundations , and this is the plumbing , electrics and services would be built . each of the component parts of house would be sealed from the elements to keep the internal spaces weatherproof , and when the modules link together a sealed connection similar to a car door would allow transition from one space to another . mr woolfson told maiionline the team is currently working on a design for the first d * haus in cambridgeshire , and is hoping to submit planning permission early next year . the layout consists of two bedrooms , an open-plan living room and a bathroom , but it can be adapted to suit the needs of different living situations . aside from moving to provide more light , or expand the view , the house is also designed to save money on heating , and prevent energy waste . as the designers explained : ` solar radiation from the sun can have a significant impact on a buildings performance . ` whilst often a source of overheating due to inadequate controls , with thoughtful design it can provide a cheap and abundant source of energy in your building . the design of the moving house was inspired by the work of english mathematician henry dudeney . in 1908 , mr dudeney worked out how to turn a square into an equilateral triangle . called the haberdasher 's puzzle , each of the pieces are hinged and form a chain that can be transformed into the square , or the original triangle -lrb- gif pictured right -rrb- . mr dudeney specialised in logic puzzles and mathematical games , and regularly submitted puzzles to newspaper and magazines under the pseudonym ` sphinx ' . dudeney revealed a model of the solution , made of mahogany with brass hinges , at a meeting of the royal society on may 17 , 1905 . he also published the first known crossnumber puzzle in 1926 and has been credited with inventing verbal arithmetic and discovering new applications of digital roots . the designers said : ' -lsb- the haberdasher 's puzzle concept -rsb- alone is fascinating and the possibilities are endless when applying the formula to world of architecture and design . ' based on this design , in the summer , bedroom one of the d * dynamic house faces east and watches the sun rise as its owner wakes up . it can then rotate so that the user is constantly in sunlight , while the house generates energy through its solar panels . during winter , the house is in a square formation , with small windows and high thermal mass , which the designers describe as ` literally hugging itself . ' as the seasons change and climate warms , the house opens up , ` like a flower opens up ' to allow light and air to penetrate the inside of the building creating panoramic views of the surroundings . the internal walls become external walls , doors become windows and windows become doors . ` this energy can be utilised to heat spaces in winter , provide hot water , and even generate ventilation for cooling in summer . ' ` conceived for the harsh , climatic extremes from ` lapland to cape horn and aleutians to auckland ' the d * haus concept can respond dynamically to its environment by controlled adaptation to seasonal , meteorological and astronomical conditions , ' continued mr grunberg and mr woolfson . ` the flexibility of the d * haus allows adaptation from winter to summer , and day to night by literally moving inside itself . ` the thick heavy external walls unfold into internal walls allowing glass internal walls to become facades . doors become windows and vice versa . ' the shape-shifting home was first conceived as part of mr grunberg 's graduation project , for which he designed a house that could withstand the extreme sub-arctic temperatures in lap land . the pair 's design is based on the work of english author and mathematician henry dudeney , a leading puzzle creator . in 1903 dudeney invented a way to cut an equilateral triangle into four pieces that could be rearranged into a square , a conundrum he dubbed the haberdasher 's puzzle . the architects said the house -lrb- pictured -rrb- will cost # 2 million -lrb- $ 3.1 million -rrb- , but if they are able to produce in in bulk , this could drop the price to # 800,000 -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- . they said : ' a house like this has never been done before in the history of architecture and we believe that creating buildings that can adapt and change is a much more sustainable way of living ' in the puzzle , each of the pieces are hinged and form a chain that can be transformed into the square , or the original triangle . mr dudeney specialised in logic puzzles and mathematical games , and regularly submitted puzzles to newspaper and magazines under the pseudonym ` sphinx ' . in a release , d * haus described their house concept , as ' a product of an applied mathematical realisation ' . ` the d * haus company is set to cause a revolution in architecture and design by transforming dudeney 's idea from the conceptual , to the physical , ' the release adds . ` inspired by dudeney 's logic puzzle , each d * haus dwelling is capable of adapting to changing patterns of living in the future . 'd * haus is continuing the journey that dudeney began by breathing new life into a century-old concept ; not only to define a space , but a lifestyle . '", "summary": " the d * haus architect concept ` metamorphosizes ' into eight different configurations based around a series of hinges .   it responds to seasonal conditions automatically , or can be moved using hydraulics and rails controlled by a handle .   the shapeshiting design is based on the haberdasher 's puzzle , designed by mathematician henry dudeney in 1908 .   called d * dynamic , throughout the year internal walls become external , and doors become windows .   architects said the house will cost # 2 million , but if they are able to produce it in bulk , this will drop to # 800,000 .   mr woolfson told maiionline the team is currently working on a design for the first d * haus in cambridgeshire .   the designers are hoping to submit planning permission for the building early next year .
