{"text": "david beckham stressed his desire to launch a new major league soccer franchise on wednesday , as the former england captain revealed his passion about becoming a future club owner . the former l. a. galaxy star 's potential interest in miami was leaked on tuesday , but the footballer-turned-global-icon refused to confirm or deny the reports when speaking at a launch for his new book .  i 'm passionate about staying in football and being an owner of a team is something i 'm passionate about ,  the 38-year-old said on a show broadcast live on facebook to his 30 million followers .  miami is one of the places we looked at , and we 've looked at others too .  included in the ground-breaking contract he signed with galaxy in 2007 was the option to create a new mls team for $ 25 million , a right that the former manchester united , real madrid and milan star is now aiming to exercise .  when i signed my contract six , seven years ago , my manager simon fuller actually got a clause in the contract that enabled me to have a franchise at the end of my playing career and obviously now i 've stopped playing ,  beckham added . full details have yet to emerge of how the expansion and its funding may come about in a city whose only previous mls team -- miami fusion -- was closed in 2002 , after just four years in the league . yet there is renewed belief that miami , with many local football fans and a handful of suitable stadiums , could be ready for a new team . indeed , italian financier alessandro butini is behind a potential rival bid , having created a website -- mia4mls.com -- earlier this year to drum up support and suggest designs for a new stadium . major league soccer currently has 19 teams , and a 20th club -- new york city fc -- is set to launch in 2015 .  it 's going to get better and bigger ,  said beckham .  since i moved there , 11 to 12 teams have come into the league . i have seen the excitement of the people talking about soccer or football .  ferguson row . despite being slammed for a preoccupation with fame by alex ferguson in his recent autobiography , beckham refused to slate the former manchester united manager as he conducted an innovative digital book-signing session . instead , he seemed to be half-joking and half-serious when he said he had been hoping to lure the retiree back into the dug-out .  i 'm not going to sit here and be negative about a man who gave me a chance to play for my boyhood team , who i always dreamed of playing for ,  said beckham , who won six premier league titles and one uefa champions league under ferguson .  he believed in me and believed in the rest of the young lads who came through this with us .  the funny thing was i 'm involved in the mls and bringing my own franchise into the league and actually he was one of the first in my phone book to contact as the manager !  beckham conceded that such a prospect was no longer likely and further increased the odds when praising roy keane , who was once ferguson 's right-hand man on the pitch but who has since been engaged in a lengthy feud with the 71-year-old .  for me , roy keane is the best captain i 've ever played under ,  said beckham .  he had two career threatening injuries and he set the example for us young kids . he was the most dedicated and driven player .  keane has since stepped into the world of football management , with limited success , but beckham is adamant he will not be following what is a well-trodden path for many former footballers .  you should never say never , because something may happen in 10 years ' time which may make me think i should be a manager but i do n't think so ,  he explained .  it 's not something i 'm really passionate about . to do something well you have to be passionate about it . i love coaching kids -- my own kids and other kids too -- but management is something that does not float my boat .  during his playing career in the united states , beckham won two mls titles with galaxy , prior to joining french side paris saint-germain in january this year . he played his final game as a professional in may and conceded that his retirement in a match against brest did not finish in the way he had hoped , as emotion got the better of him .  as soon as i announced my retirement , i knew the day was going to be tough -- but i did n't think it would be as difficult as it was ,  he revealed on wednesday .  i spoke to -lrb- coach -rrb- carlo -lrb- ancelotti -rrb- before , who told me he would bring me off about 80 minutes . 65 minutes came and all of a sudden i could n't breathe .  i got short of breath and i had a real struggle controlling my emotions . i broke down . it was not something i wanted to do , but i could n't control it .  images of his final game form part of beckham 's new book , one that takes a pictorial journey through his two decades in the game - even if a whole new chapter looks set to be needed soon .", "summary": " beckham says he is ` passionate ' about being a club owner as he admits interest in mls franchise .   former l.a. galaxy star says he had contemplated asking alex ferguson to manage the side .   onetime england captain was speaking at launch of pictorial book covering his playing career .
