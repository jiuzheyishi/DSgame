{"text": "threesome : graham allen robertson admitted downloading indecent images of his ex-girlfriend onto cds and putting them in envelopes addressed to her family and colleagues but denied mailing them . a 62-year-old male witch has avoided jail after photos of him having a threesome with his 30-year-old girlfriend and an unnamed man were mailed to her mother and work colleagues . graham allen robertson was devastated at the end of his brief relationship with the woman after she began an affair with a separate man . in what was described as a cathartic ritual , he downloaded 51 of the indecent images onto 13 separate dvds and labelled them with her name and the words ` the shetland dogger ' . the discs were then sent to addresses in her home town of lerwick , including the shetland islands town hall where she worked , numerous pubs and hotels , a taxi firm , hairdressers and the local boating club . but despite mr robertson admitting he had carefully packaged the discs in envelopes , he said he had never intended to send them and they were posted by a friend who had found them in his home in glastonbury , somerset . mr robertson , who describes himself as ' a witch ' , had several sexual encounters with the 30-year-old when she visited glastonbury for a family holiday in october 2011 , somerset magistrates heard . prosecutor simon cooper said : ` they arranged to meet again and it was agreed robertson would bring along a male friend to take part in consensual sexual activity with the woman and himself . ` while that was taking place , photographs of a sexually explicit nature were taken and she was aware of this . ' following the holiday she returned home and continued to contact mr robertson by phone and text messages . after another visit to somerset six weeks later , he sent her a number of christmas presents to her home , along with gifts for members of her family . robertson then discovered she had started a relationship with another man from the glastonbury area and as a result their relationship came to an end . he asked her to return the gifts he had sent her which she did apart from one , and it was after then that he downloaded 51 of the photographs onto discs . one by one the discs started to be received by businesses and individuals on the shetland islands , including the victim 's own mother . mr cooper said : ` several of the individuals contacted the police and when police searched robertson 's home address he handed over four similar discs with the same labelling . significant : mr robertson describes himself as ' a witch ' and said he chose to prepare 13 discs as the number has a special significance for him - but he maintains they were posted by a friend who found them in his hall . ` when he was interviewed he said he had become obsessed with the woman and the breakdown in their relationship had affected him very badly . ' however , mr robertson told the court that despite previously saying that he had sent the discs , he had lied during his police interview to protect his new partner . he said he had suspected she sent them as he claimed she hated the victim after seeing the emotional breakdown he had suffered following their split . it was not until the autumn of 2012 that another woman , julie raybould , confessed that she had bought stamps and posted them on his behalf after finding them in the hallway of his home , saying she assumed he had intended to send them . mr robertson said he had prepared 13 discs and the number 13 was of great significance to him . ' i am a witch and i do things completely differently , ' he said . ` they were not for sending but it was a symbolic thing i was doing . not guilty : mr robertson was cleared by the court of sending offensive communications because the prosecution could not prove he posted the discs . ' i had a complete breakdown after the relationship ended and lost three stone in weight and was feeling very stressed . ` downloading the photos onto discs was my way of dealing with this and i did a lot of research on the internet and found names and addresses of individuals and businesses and put the discs into envelopes but then put them away . ' i put all my frustrations and anger into it and that was my way of dealing with it , but they were never ever meant to be sent . ' mr robertson 's friend ms raybould , also from glastonbury , said that she had found a large number of envelopes in robertson 's hallway and had taken them to a post office where she weighed them , bought stamps and then posted them to the various addresses not realising what they contained . in a written statement the victim explained that mr robertson had discovered her affair with the other man after she was tricked into accepting a friend request he had sent to her on facebook while posing as a female . the police in lerwick then contacted her saying that various people and businesses had started receiving the discs containing the explicit images . she said : ` he was bitter about me breaking contact with him and when i learned about the images he had sent i was shocked and felt physically sick . ' mr robertson , of manor close , glastonbury , denied 11 counts of sending a communication of an indecent or offensive nature between march 1 , 2012 and march 31 , 2012 when he appeared before somerset magistrates sitting at yeovil on tuesday . he was found not guilty after chairman of the bench christopher thomas-peter said it had not been proved beyond all reasonable doubt that mr robertson was the person who had sent the discs .", "summary": " graham allen robertson prepared cds of illicit images after break-up .   but court heard they were posted by a friend who found them in his house .   male witch said he only made cds as ` cathartic ritual ' and did not send them .
