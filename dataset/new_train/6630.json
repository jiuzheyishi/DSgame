' ` we 've got a pretty handy record at eden park but it 's something we do n't often talk about . it seems to be a bit of a fortress for us and hopefully that can continue . ' cruden has taken over the no 10 jersey in place of new zealand icon dan carter , who is playing no part in the three-test series following a sabbatical . the 25-year-old will line up against freddie burns and , while team-mate brodie retallick was unable to name one england player earlier in the week , cruden has clearly been doing some homework on his opposite number . ` freddie made his debut against us a couple of years ago and i 've watched a bit of his footage , ' said cruden . ` he 's a good player ; he 's got a sound right-footed kicking game and he 's a really good organiser . we 've got to be aware of the threat that he poses and try to shut him down as much as we can . important cog in the machine : cruden should prove to be integral for new zealand at the weekend . england roar : chris ashton celebrates scoring a try during the 38-21 win two years ago . eyes on the prize : cruden will operate at fly half for the all blacks in the place of dan carter at eden park . know all about him : the hosts kept a close eye on danny cipriani while he was with the melbourne rebels . ` we saw danny cipriani a little bit with his time at the melbourne rebels , but we do n't get to see as much of freddie playing back in the uk . we just have to do our preparation and make sure we 're ready for whatever they throw at us . ' england coach stuart lancaster has had to turn to fringe players such as burns , rob webber , james haskell and kyle eastmond in the absence of regular starters from saracens and northampton . they will all be hoping to make their mark and , similarly , cruden also sees saturday 's test as an opportunity to put up his hand for a run of games in the starting jersey . the 25-year-old edged out beauden barrett in selection and his long-term target is to challenge carter to be first choice at next year 's rugby world cup . ` you always want to be in that starting xv and i 'm really excited and grateful to get the start this weekend , ' said cruden . ` for me it 's a case of understanding my role within the team and , whether i 'm starting or on the bench , i just have to put my best foot forward and push my claim to get that starting jersey . ` i looked up to dan growing up a youngster and now to be able to rub shoulders , pick his brain and ask questions can only be beneficial for my game . the healthy competition that we have within the squad now really encourages you to keep getting better every day .
