{"text": "i pump the gas to the crest of the muddy hill , engine roaring . a sharp hairpin bend immediately requires a swift swing of the wheel , but the tires keep their grip and i bump my way down a steep incline of mud , rocks and tree roots . at the bottom i 'm greeted with a deep flooded section of track and as the vehicle plows through , a colossal splash of muddy water swamps the hood . through the swampy greenery of reeds and ferns , i feel , for a moment , like a khaki-clad explorer of the empire , navigating the jungles of british east india . in fact i 'm cruising in a brand new land rover discovery , from london to eastnor castle in the malvern hills , on day two of land rover 's  best of british  tour , having kicked off in style with a night of world class luxury at the legendary savoy hotel . my mission is to become even more british than i already am , delving into my own culture with abandon , discovering the land and its history , in order that one day i might be able to order a  gee 'n' tee ,  play a game of croquet and use the word  chap  in a dozen different ways without sounding like a charlatan . if my lunch stop is anything to go by , it wo n't be long before i 'm ordering that quintessential brit drink from a butler too -- after a pass of windsor castle and the chiltern hills we pull up at the gilded gates of blenheim palace . 5 must-play golf courses in the canadian rockies . blenheim palace .  welcome to the birthplace of winston churchill and residence of the duke and duchess of marlborough ,  announces our host in a cut-glass accent . this 18th century baroque masterpiece is a unesco world heritage site and despite a recent land-selling controversy , it remains a day trip destination that 'll tire the kids out nicely , with an adventure playground , maze and mini-train just some of the attractions besides the house tour and grounds . quickly , we 're whisked off for our victuals in the indian room , its colonial furniture and tropical decor harking back to a time when britain really did rule the waves . a retired army colonel gazes at the exotic milieu ,  ah , could be bombay 1895 ,  he muses wistfully . the days of the raj live on in this corner of england . strolling around the gardens , i do a mental check of my kit list for the next few days . green wellies -- yep . barbour jacket -- yep . trusty hound and a tweed deerstalker cap ? er ... well , maybe that would be taking this whole aristocracy fantasy a bit far but it 's easy to get carried away on this trip . this is the england of downton abbey and gosford park -- an exclusive tour through our green and pleasant land , staying in historic palaces , ancient manor houses and chocolate box villages along the route . traditional country pursuits are all part of the fun too , although nothing as contentious as fox hunting . and though i 'm doing this tour in that icon of british motoring , the land rover , it of course does n't take a 4wd vehicle to negotiate the tarmac roads of southern england . which is why we are heading for eastnor castle , land rover 's training and testing ground since 1962 . the sumptuous castle will be our home for the next two days and when we 're not bouncing around on our antique four-poster beds or rubbing shoulders with suits of armor we 'll be out in the 5,000-acre estate , putting our off-road driving skills to the test on a private network of forest tracks , steep hills , deep water and of course , this being england , plenty of mud . having  done the practical ,  later we 'll find out how this car favored by england 's land-owning elite is actually put together too . driving and discovery . the barbour jacket and green wellies come into their own the following day as we stride out across the castle 's grounds , shotguns over our shoulders for our own version of the legendary hunting parties of the victorian and edwardian age when shooting skills were considered the mark of a man , alongside horsemanship and a stiff upper lip . while no feathered friends are bagged -lrb- just pigeons of the clay variety -rrb- , we do get to hang with some top birds -- falcons .  now , this is real hunting ,  says the falconer with pride .  people have been hunting with birds of prey in england for 1,200 years , since the saxon times .  never mind the history ; seeing these predators in action gives you a sense of the wild like few other things and its popularity is booming in the country . but we must n't dither , for after heading across country , stopping for a proper english cream tea and a night in the honey-stone village of lower slaughter -lrb- it really deserves a nicer name -rrb- we arrive in gaydon , the home of land rover . this is where we get our petrol head on for the engineering tour of the plant plus a chance to drive some of the vintage vehicles , harking back to a time when men were men and land rovers were workhorses . we 'd already run these machines through their paces at eastnor , careering through flooded fields and up and down muddy hillocks on the test track -- and now we got to see how all that engineering was put together . from what was simply a riveted steel utility vehicle to today 's air-conditioned dream machine with computerized terrain response , the land rover really has come a long way since the first series 1 model rolled off the production line back in 1948 . take it from me -- the men on the trip found it fascinating . shaking it all off . of course , this being the best of british tour means it can end only one way -- with shakey . we 're off to stratford-upon-avon to experience the genius of the bard at the royal shakespeare company with the added bonus of dinner on the theater 's rooftop restaurant and champagne and petit-fours during the interval . and did i mention that we have the best seats in the house ? a final day in the luxurious surroundings of the william cecil hotel on the burghley estate sees some of the group attend the famous burghley horse trials . but for me , the fantasy is over . the last six days have been an immersion in elegance , excellence and impeccable good taste -- and a unique window into the grandeur of britain 's past . i hand over the keys to my land rover with a farewell pat , as i know it is unlikely we 'll ever be reacquainted , and make my way back to real life . now . where can one find a decent  gee 'n' tee  ?
