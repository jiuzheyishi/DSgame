{"text": "follow @@ matt_barlow_dm . raheem sterling has played for only 38 minutes in three warm-up games but his thrilling displays in training are fuelling the idea that the teenage winger can give england an added dimension at the world cup . liverpool team-mate glen johnson is among those who believe sterling might be a secret weapon , having been under wraps , due to the red card soon after he came on against ecuador and which banned him from the 0-0 draw against honduras . ` that would be ideal , if people do n't know what he 's capable of and underestimate him a bit , ' said johnson . secret weapon : glen johnson believes raheem sterling -lrb- right -rrb- can spring a surprise at the world cup . ` that would definitely work in our favour . hopefully people will underestimate him and then he can prove them wrong . ` he was on fire in training on friday and he looks like he has been around the squad for years . when he gets on the ball you can see he has learnt the game quickly and he can hurt teams . he 's probably the quickest in the squad over 10 yards . ` he has looked good all year . he 's a young kid who is willing to learn about the game and he should just get better . ' sterling may yet be an asset weapon best used from the bench against teams drained by the heat anticipated in some parts of brazil , including manaus where england open the group d fixtures against italy on saturday . with alex oxlade-chamberlain still an injury doubt for the tournament , sterling is expected to feature at some point in the group games . in action : johnson reckons sterling is one of the quickest players in the squad and looks like he has been part of the england set-up for ` years ' like sterling , the ox was also at the sun life stadium to watch the honduras game . he has been able to walk around at times this weekend without a protective knee brace , but it was strapped on last night as the squad left the arena for the airport . roy hodgson has until friday to decide if oxlade-chamberlain , ruled out for an estimated two weeks after straining ligaments against ecuador on wednesday , will stay in brazil for the tournament or be replaced . if the initial diagnosis proves accurate he could be fit for the final group game against costa rica on june 24 , but if it takes a little longer , hodgson may yet choose to replace him . he will be closely monitored and his team-mates are trying to keep his spirits up . knock : alex oxlade-chamberlain injured his knee ligaments during england 's draw against ecuador . ` he is well in with the squad , well in with the lads and we try and keep him as happy as possible , ' said johnson , one of the team 's elders , winning his 52nd cap against honduras . ` he is just as involved as he was apart from the training sessions . there are still a few question marks around how bad it is and how quickly he can recover . ` he will be gutted and we are gutted for him because you do n't want to be picking up injuries now . i am sure he will be mentally strong and we will be by his side . he was great the other night and you do n't want to lose any player especially with the quality he has got . ' hope : despite the injury england medical staff remain hopeful about oxlade-chamberlain 's chances . the emergence of fresh young players like the ox and sterling have encouraged johnson to believe england can impress at the world cup , with more attacking threat than at euro 2012 , when they lost to italy on penalties in a quarter final . ` we had a good team when we played italy last time , but now we have more players who can hurt them , ' said the liverpool full-back . ` we have a bit more pace in the squad as well so hopefully we will get further on . ' i do n't think italy will have met an england team like this before . the team we had before was a good side but maybe it was slightly defensive . if we can defend well now and use some of the pace and ability we have going forward we can cause problems .
