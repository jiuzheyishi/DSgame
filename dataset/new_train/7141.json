{"text": "a father-of-one who has survived cancer three times has described himself as the ` luckiest , unlucky ' person alive . john willis , 37 , has battled testicular , stomach and lymph node cancers all in just three years . miraculously , he has survived each one . john willis -lrb- pictured with his wife angela -rrb- has had testicular , stomach and lymph node cancers . incredibly , the stomach cancer was not related to the lymph node and testicular cancers , meaning that he developed two completely unconnected cancers . professor karol sikora , a world renown oncologist , told mailonline that the chances of being diagnosed with two different forms of cancer in a year is one in a million . leading oncologist professor karol sikora told mailonline that the chance of getting two different cancers in a year was one in a million . he said testicular cancer is rare - only about 2,000 men in the uk are diagnosed with it each year - and that stomach cancer is very unusual in people as young as mr willis . therefore , he explained that mr willis has been exceptionally unlucky , particularly as there is no link between testicular cancer and stomach cancer - and neither is hereditary . however , professor sikora added that the cancer is most likely to reoccur within the first few years meaning that if mr willis is still cancer-free at 40 , his prognosis will be very good . he said : ` it does happen but it is very unusual . only about 2,000 men in the uk get testicular cancer every year . stomach cancer is a bit more common but to get both , and at such a young age , is one in a million . ' he added : ' i do n't know of any association between these cancers and neither is hereditary so it seems he has been extremely unlucky . ' however , the professor went on to explain that if mr willis is still clear of the cancer by the time he is 40 then he will have a normal life expectancy as it is most likely to reoccur within the first few years . mr willis , from portchester , hampshire , said : ` i remember being on holiday in spain in june and i sat down awkwardly , which caused me a pain in my testicle . ` it really hurt , and the pain was still there two months later . ` i knew i needed to visit my doctor , and after i 'd been to see him , he sent me off for a screening . ` a week later i was told they had found a tumour in my testicle . ` i always had a feeling there was something wrong , so i was n't too surprised when i was told the news . i got treated straight away . ' mr willis was treated for all three cancers at queen alexandra hospital in portsmouth . surgeons removed mr willis 's left testicle within three weeks of the diagnosis in august 2010 . he was told that the cancer was a seminoma - one of the most treatable forms of testicular cancer - and he underwent a course of chemotherapy . mr willis , who has daughter maisie , 14 , with wife angela , 38 , set up a website blogging about his experience and urged men to check for cancer . however , more bad news was on its way - doctors found a tumour in his stomach during a routine scan at queen alexandra hospital , portsmouth , hampshire , in october 2011 . mr willis describes himself as the ` luckiest , unlucky ' person alive . mr willis said : ` i went in for a ct scan and doctors found a tumour the size of a snooker ball in my stomach . ` i had n't felt any pain , or had any idea it was there . ' surgeons removed the tumour - which was unrelated to the testicular cancer - in november 2011 and mr willis thought that his ordeal was over . however , in november 2012 , following a third trip for a check-up , he was dealt yet another devastating blow . mr willis said : ` i got a phone call from my consultant to say one of my lymph glands was bigger than it should be . ` i could n't believe it . it was the third time in two-and-a-half years that i 'd been diagnosed with cancer . ' on this occasion , his testicular cancer had returned , but in his lymph nodes . in january this year , he began a nine week course of chemotherapy . mr willis said : ` it takes it out of me . i feel like i 'm the luckiest , unlucky person . ` i ca n't seem to get to a year without doctors finding something else . ` my family have been brilliant throughout . all this has given me a different outlook on life , and made me less miserable . ' mr willis has now been clear of the stomach cancer for 18 months and recent scans have shown that his lymph nodes are no longer affected either . he is hoping to return to work next month . julia frater , cancer research uk 's senior information nurse , said : ` the chances of developing two different types of cancer that are unrelated to each other at the age of 37 is about one in 1.5 million , so it 's very unusual indeed . ` in this kind of scenario treatment will be tailored to the individual , with cancer specialists taking into account the patient 's full medical history . ` cancer research uk 's helpline nurses are pleased to respond to any questions about cancer and can be contacted on freephone 0808 800 4040 .
