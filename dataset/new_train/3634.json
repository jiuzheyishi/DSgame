{"text": "president barack obama fired a double-barreled volley at republicans on wednesday , saying that the gop is ` hating ' him by pursuing a federal lawsuit over changes to the obamacare health insurance law . the lawsuit received a go-ahead hours later by a 225-201 vote , passing the house of representatives along largely party lines with five republicans voting ` no . ' every democrat opposed the legislation authorizing the lawsuit . ` there 's a bunch of stuff that needs to get done , ' obama told a cheering , partisan audience in kansas city , missouri just hours earlier . ` unfortunately , i think the main vote ... that they 've scheduled for today is whether or not they decide to sue me for doing my job . ' ` and , by the way , ' he added , ` i 've told them -- i said , i 'd be happy to do it . with you . so the only reason i 'm doing it on my own is because you . do n't do anything . ' in an off-the-cuff speech filled with rabble-rousing language , obama blamed republicans in the house of representatives for blocking his agenda on make-work infrastructure jobs , illegal immigration and a minimum wage hike . but he reserved his biggest applause lines for an attack on the idea of facing a federal judge over questions of executive overreach . ` stop just hating ' : obama singled out congressional republicans for scorn on wednesday in kansas city , mocking efforts to sue him for overextending his authority with changes to the obamacare law . campaign-style love fest : president obama -lrb- bottom , white shirt -rrb- greeted a partisan crowd after speaking about the economy . ` some of the things we 're doing without congress are making a difference , but we could do so much more if congress would just come on and help out a little bit , ' he said to applause . ` just come on . come on and help out a little bit . stop being mad all the time . stop just hating all the time . come on . let 's get some work done together . ' the lawsuit that faces the obama administration is focused on unilateral changes the white house made to the affordable care act , a sweeping health insurance overhaul passed by democrats without any republican votes . on july 11 house speaker john boehner announced that his lawsuit would go ahead . obama , he said , ` changed the health care law without a vote of congress ' in 2013 , ` effectively creating his own law by literally waiving the employer mandate and the penalties for failing to comply with it . ' the president , he carped , ` believes he has the power to make his own laws . ` the obama administration has taken several actions that republicans say twisted the plain meaning of the obamacare law 's black-letter text , ignoring dates that the law set in stone -- for both practical and political reasons . ' the administration has twice pushed back the law 's requirement that large employers provide health insurance to their workers , even though the law reads that it ` shall apply to months beginning after december 31 , 2013 . ' companies with between 50 and 99 employees now can flout the law until 2016 without paying tax penalties . larger employers have until 2015 . in a twist of irony , republicans themselves sought similar delays in 2013 when america 's two major political parties came to loggerheads during a budget battle , forcing a temporary , partial government shutdown . obama 's changes , however , came without consulting congress : by the time the treasury department put them in place , the house was in republican hands and no longer in the mood to tinker with america 's gargantuan medical insurance market . on wednesday , the president was in full combat mode again . house rules committee chairman rep. pete sessions carried the ball for republicans on wednesday in a hearing to finalize the terms of a lawsuit against the obama administration . ` look , we 've got just today and tomorrow until congress leaves town for a month , ' he said , ` and we 've still got some serious work to do . ' ' i mean , everybody recognizes this is a political stunt , ' he said of the lawsuit , ` but it 's worse than that , because every vote they 're taking like that means a vote they 're not taking to actually help you . ... and , by the way , you know who is paying for this suit they 're going to file ? you . ' speaker of the house john boehner has insisted that his lawsuit wo n't be a prelude to impeachment , but only an action to force the president to uphold his duties under the constitution . obama also claimed that if boehner 's legal action were to go to trial , ' i would have already left office ' by the time it was resolved . ` so it 's not a productive thing to do . ' on monday boehner penned an op-ed in usa today , arguing that suing the president is ` not about me vs. president obama . this is about future congresses and future presidents . ' ` there is a conflict between the executive branch and the legislative branch of our government . it is the judiciary branch 's role to help resolve it . i believe this path is the right one to defend our institution and preserve the constitution . ' on july 24 the house rules committee green-lighted suing the president in a preliminary vote that fell along partisan lines . as the committee met wednesday to finalize the language and move for a debaet on the house floor , warring sides heard from constitutional lawyers and picked fights with each other over whether obama has abused his power . ` this is not a political issue . this is not an issue that should pit republicans against democrats , ' said texas republican rep. pete sessions , who chairs the committee . ` any person interested in our constitution and our brilliant system of separation of powers should be worried about what is currently happening in our country . ' florida democrat alcee hastings disagreed , calling the lawsuit ` frivolous on steroids . it 's absolutely insane what you all are doing . ' ` this is a partisan political stunt timed to peak in the house of representatives in november , right as the midterm elections are happening , ' added new york democratic rep. louisie slaughter . ` the house majority is suing the president simply for doing his job . ' hastings was a federal judge until 1989 , when he was impeached and removed from office , one of only eight federal officials in u.s. history to wear that professional stain . in that case , both houses of congress were controlled by democrats . his impeachment was carried out on charges of bribery and perjury . the house of representatives , to which he now belongs , condemned him by a vote of 413-3 . hypocrite : new york democratic rep. louise slaughter opposed the lawsuit on wednesday but once joined in a similar legal action against president george w. bush . florida democratic rep. alcee hastings slammed the planned lawsuit as a partisan witch-hunt formulated for political advantage in november 's midterm elections ; he has been on the receiving end of ethics proceedings before , as the only member of congress to have been impeached and removed from the bench as a federal judge . slaughter joined in a 2006 lawsuit against president george w. bush over that year 's federal budget bill . george washington university law professor jonathan turley told the rules committee that ` it is not a political question when this body goes to court and says the president has exceeded his authority . ' if congress fails to hold the white house to its constitutional responsibilities , he said , ' i think this system is going to change in a very significant and in my view a dangerous way . ' attorney walter dellinger , a former clinton administration official , said in his testimony that asking a federal judge to settle disputes when the president does n't administer a law the way the house wants ` would be an unprecedented aggrandizement of the political power of the judiciary . ' ` such a radical liberalization of the role of unelected judges in matters previously entrusted to the elected branches of government should be rejected , ' he said . the u.s. constitution requires the president to ` take care that the laws be faithfully executed . ' florida international university law professor elizabeth price foley told the panel on wednesday that republicans have ` an excellent chance ' of winning a lawsuit if it focuses on the meaning of that line in america 's founding document . in a sparsely attended press conference following the vote to sue the president , house minority leader nancy pelosi blamed republicans for frittering away money on a lawsuit that ` should not be a priority . ' ` we do n't have money to have early childhood education for children , they have rejected the president 's universal pre-k , but they do have money to sue the president , ' pelosi said . ` how much money is that ? nobody knows . ' she also insisted the congress ` lacks standing ' to sue . ` they certainly do not have standing to sue the president of the united states . ' ` this is about the road to impeachment , ' she claimed , although boehner said this week that impeachment is off the table . house minority whip steny hoyer accused republicans of wasting time and americans ' money in search of ` partisan political confrontations . ' ` this lawsuit will go nowhere , ' he predicted .", "summary": " house vote wednesday afternoon confirmed that congress will sue obama .   president told kansas city audience that he has taken more than 40 executive actions this year because congress is n't doing its job .   house speaker john boehner spearheaded the federal lawsuit over unilateral changes the white house made to the obamacare law .   congress was n't consulted about the changes , which made it more politically palatable by pushing back specific deadlines written into the law .   if boehner 's lawsuit were to go to trial and see a verdict , obama said , ' i would have already left office '   boehner wrote on monday that ` there is a conflict between the executive branch and the legislative branch of our government . it is the judiciary branch 's role to help resolve it ' "}
