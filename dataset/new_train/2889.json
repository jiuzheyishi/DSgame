{"text": "it is the place where the  air ball  chant was invented . it is or has been home to crazy towel guy , viking guy and bunch of guys . a man once distracted an opponent 's free-throw shooter by rising from his seat and dancing while wearing a dark blue speedo and nothing else . that guy became a pastor . the college basketball fans at cameron indoor stadium , where there are just 9,314 seats , are not only known for being loud , they take pride in getting into opponents ' heads . they are a coordinated cacophony that gives the duke blue devils a home-court advantage only a handful of teams have . duke university has won nearly 84 % of its games in cameron since 1940 . the cameron crazies are so famous , they were even in a coke commercial . but recently , the young fans have been the subject of scorn from former crazies , other basketball fans , the media and even duke 's legendary coach , mike krzyzewski . they have n't been their old selves , and they have n't been filling the undergraduate students section , not even to cheer on a top-10 team . duke has 1,000 spots for undergrads but has sold up to 400 of those seats to other duke fans this year . as duke enters the heart of conference play , student attendance has picked up recently , senior ellie garrett , one of two student ticket line monitors , said in an e-mail . the smaller undergrad crowds is not a new trend ; there have been fewer of them in section 17 for the past few seasons . but this season , the lack of passion has been noticeable . coach k had these words after a january victory at maryland , according to the chronicle :  this team is trying to develop and do n't just watch them , be with them . they need your support . this saturday let 's be out there at noon -lsb- they won against st. john 's -rsb- and be the cameron crazies . if you do n't want to do it , then do n't , but it will be a mistake . i think sometimes you just take things for granted .  the students responded to the coach 's call ; garrett said section 17 was over capacity . longtime duke fan julian king says there are several reasons cameron is a different place these days . king -- who grew up in durham , has seen hundreds of games in cameron and runs the message board forum duke basketball report -- points a finger at a tech-rich culture , a student body more focused on academics , conference expansion and the team 's  ridiculous success .  no question duke is one of the most beloved teams and one of the most hated -- in large part because it wins so much . with four national titles and fourth place on the all-time victories list , the blue devils are on tv and the front pages of newspapers and sports websites constantly .  people get spoiled ; they get used to -lrb- winning -rrb- ,  king said .  but the secret of cameron , and people who have n't been around a while do n't realize , but cameron really became a great place out of frustration .  he explained that in the 1970s , other teams came in with their stars -- david thompson of north carolina state , john lucas of maryland and phil ford of north carolina -- and whipped duke 's butt . since there was no beating them on the court , duke fans turned to making fun of them , king said . and those fans , including the most raucous ones known as bunch of guys , were often hilarious and often downright offensive . caulton tudor , columnist for the news & observer in raleigh , said the fans sometimes crossed the line , but they were spontaneous .  they 've turned into the mormon tabernacle choir ,  he said .  they are orchestrated . everybody knows exactly what 's next .  at duke , students will work on a cheer sheet and hand them out to those who attend games . some students have complained that new cheers are needed . they also say there needs to be better coordination . there are other factors at play , king and tudor said , and these could affect all schools . in the early 1980s , when coach k was new to duke and the devils were beginning to win consistently again , there were no fans texting on cellphones or updating facebook pages , tudor said . sure , some brought books so they could study during breaks , but their attention spans were longer and more focused on basketball . these days , not so much . there also were no huge tvs in the dorms , where students do n't have to wait for hours in cold lines to get into the arena , where they might stand -lrb- or jump up and down -rrb- in closer-than-close quarters for three-plus hours . today 's students can also watch anywhere on campus on computers or smartphones . and there are now 12 teams in the atlantic coast conference -lrb- two more schools join the league next season -rrb- , and old school rivalries have been diminished as a result , said tudor , who has seen more than 300 games in cameron since 1957 . like many superconferences , the acc has grown so big that schools sometimes play conference opponents only once a year instead of twice . for duke , it means people do n't care about some games as much anymore , king said . it 's hard to get worked up about a revenge game if a year separates a loss and the next contest . things will get better , jeff kovacs , a former crazy known as mullet man , wrote in a letter to blue devil fans on duke basketball report .  you may think that the crazies are n't up to the standards of the past , but maybe this current crop is merely going through its own growing pains ,  he wrote .  maybe they are n't spoiled and complacent . maybe they are learning on the job .  garrett wrote that students were anxious to be part of the tradition .  people are painting up , making signs , and counting down the minutes until the doors to cameron open ,  she said . a betting man would probably wager that section 17 will be full on saturday when duke is host to maryland , which fancies itself one of duke 's rivals -lrb- duke fans feel a little differently -rrb- . coming off a miraculous comeback win against the no. 5 north carolina tar heels , duke and its crazies have to have their swagger back . if the spontaneity and enthusiasm return with it , the terrapins might just want to invest in some earplugs . and the tar heels , when they come march 3 , well , it 'll be as crazy that day as ever in cameron .", "summary": " there are 1,000 seats for undergraduate students at duke basketball games .   many of those seats have been sold to non-student blue devil fans .   success , conference dilution and technology have role in downtown , fan says .   cameron crazies need the spontaneity back , says veteran sports columnist .
