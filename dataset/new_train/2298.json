{"text": "the northeast region of the united states got pummeled with snow . it was bad , really bad . according to the national weather service , nearly 2 feet of snow fell north of boston while other parts of the northeast received as much as 18 inches . that was good enough to shut down schools , cancel flights in the region and declare snow emergencies . for my city , valdez , alaska , 18 inches of snow is just another day ; schools operate , companies stay open and people go about their daily routines . the prince william sound community , where the trans alaska pipeline and the richardson highway end , tops the list as the snowiest city in united states , according to the weather channel . it averages 326.3 inches of snow each year and has gotten as much as 556.7 inches in one season . yet the city manager has said that declaring a snow emergency would be  humiliating .  how does a town with a population of nearly 4,000 cope with all that snow ? the plows go out in the early mornings trying to clear the snow before locals head to work and school . it 's not smart to be driving during snow removal . sometimes you can drive head-on into the path of a snowplow . then there are the berms , that barrier of unplowed snow in the middle of the road . unless you have an suv or a truck that 's high off the ground , making that left turn is n't advised . those two obstacles can turn your drive down the street into an adventure . during this time , locals are asked not to park in the streets , at risk of getting a ticket . where is all that snow stored ? the city uses its local parks as snow dumps . they 're green during the summer and white by winter . barney meyring park is by far the biggest park strip in town . there are playgrounds , basketball courts and a large open space for dogs to run around in the park . the south end was used as a temporary football field last season . all those assets are hidden beneath several feet of snow during the winter . next to city hall is another snow storage site , a parking lot that is turned into a two-story high snowcone every winter . those are just the public and commercial places . during that quick trip to the store , now a little longer because you 're dodging berms and snowplows , you will notice people with snowblowers in the driveways and on the roofs . some residents have their own snowplows . most just push the snow to the sidewalks and let the city crews do the rest . for me , valdez was a shock . i grew up in mississippi : if 2 inches of snow hit the ground -lrb- stick or melt -rrb- , there was no school for that day . i got my first taste of a real winter when i ventured off to college in nebraska . i remember sitting in the dorm and watching tv when the first snowstorm of the school year came . i thought for sure classes would be canceled . every educational institution in the area canceled classes , except mine . still in shock from not seeing my college 's name scroll across the bottom of the screen , i bundled up and headed to class . when i moved to alaska , i had the same thoughts about the last frontier as everyone else : it 's cold , with igloos and polar bears . i thought my midwest experience had prepared me for the elements of alaska . my first winter in the state was in wrangell , a town of more than 2,300 people in southeast alaska . as in the rest of the region , it rains much of the time . i saw plenty of snow during my two-year stint there , but it was nothing compared to valdez . people warned me , but i did n't listen . i thought i was good with a nice coat , gloves and a decent pair of boots . it has been three years since i 've moved here and i still have a sort of love-hate relationship with the snow . one thing is clear : it takes a lot of snow for the city to shut schools and businesses . that happened during the 2011-12 winter . after a slow start , alaska 's south central region was pummeled from december through february . it got really bad for valdez 's regional counterpart , cordova . with the snow dumps full , that city declared a state of emergency and called in the alaska national guard to clear out most of the snow . valdez officials came close to going in that direction after schools and businesses were closed because of excessive snow loads on roofs . valdez city manager john hozey said it best during rounds of meetings with the public and other leaders :  valdez prides itself on being the snow capital in the world . and for us to declare a state of emergency would be humiliating .  officials in valdez did n't call in the national guard , but relied on outside help with snow removal . it brought in workers from other parts of the state to help cut blocks of snow off the roofs of schools and businesses . a shovel that season was the most valuable tool in town . that winter saw seasonal records broken throughout the state . anchorage bragged about breaking its seasonal record with 134.5 inches . valdez 's response :  good for you .  it received 152.2 inches in the month of december and closed out with 438.3 inches for the season . -lrb- valdez 's record for snowfall in a season was set during the 1989-90 winter with 556.7 inches . -rrb- . i 've had plenty of days where my sense of accomplishment from digging out my car from a previous snowfall is taken away minutes later by the next . digging out my radio station 's satellite dishes has become a regular winter chore . i can get by without studs on my tires , but they sure would make driving easier in those slippery areas . one of these days , i 'll get used to the all the snow here in valdez . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of tony gorman .", "summary": " ex-mississippian tony gorman now lives in the snow capital of the u.s.   valdez , alaska , has gotten as much as 550 inches of snow in one season .   he says schools remain open , businesses operate after big snowfalls .   gorman : biggest problems are disposing of snow and lightening the load of snow on roofs .
