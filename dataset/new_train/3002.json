{"text": "on their way ? new arrivals in the french port of calais . the uk has abandoned identity checks on illegal immigrants trying to sneak into the country from calais . in a huge security downgrade , border force officials no longer photograph or fingerprint immigrants found stowing away in lorries at the channel ferry port . instead , they are handed to french police , who free them , enabling them to try again and again until they succeed . the scrapping of fingerprinting means that if the migrants reach britain and apply for asylum under a false identity , claiming to be refugees , immigration officers have no way of identifying them as having previously tried to enter britain illegally . as a result , they can not expose their new identity as fake . economic migrants , criminals and terrorists can now slip much more easily through the net . this contrasts with the increasingly strict checks on holiday-makers , who have to hand over their passport which contains biometric information to confirm their identities . tory mp peter bone last night called for the ` extraordinary ' and ` disturbing ' loophole to be closed . the scandal , which makes a mockery of government promises of tougher immigration controls , has been going on for more than three years . it came to light during an official inspection , which published its report two weeks ago . the security gap also means migrants ' details can not be checked against prints and photos taken in the eu country where they first enter europe -- often italy , greece or malta . under the rules , migrants are meant to live in the eu country where they arrived while their asylum claim is processed there . but many immediately head straight for britain because the benefits system is more generous . once in the uk , they can avoid being sent back to the original country of entry by lying about their identity . terrorists and foreign criminals can create horror stories about their past lives and pretend to be refugees . economic migrants seeking a ` better life ' are also able to fabricate tales of needing urgent asylum , claiming they come from war-torn countries . this creates havoc in the uk 's overburdened asylum system as officials try to sort out who is a genuine refugee . the border force claims it catches 8,000 would-be illegal migrants in lorries in northern france each year . but this official tally is now in doubt because a migrant whose identity goes unchecked in calais can make multiple attempts as a stowaway to get to britain while being counted again and again as a new ` catch ' . john vine , independent chief inspector of borders and immigration , who wrote the report , said : ` it seems odd that ordinary travellers are subject to 100 per cent checks when those travelling illegally are not subject to this regime . people attempting to enter the uk concealed in freight vehicles , who are discovered by border force , are no longer fingerprinted at calais . ' loophole : the change in policy was revealed in a highly-critical , independent review of britain 's border controls . british border officials stopped processing ` clandestines discovered in freight vehicles ' at the port in january 2010 . they blamed the lack of available ` detention ' facilities . however , the chief inspector has called for the home office to ` reconsider ' identity checks to protect uk borders . mr bone said last night : ` it is very disturbing that the border agency is not doing the basics when it catches illegal immigrants . by definition illegal immigration is a crime and it is very hard to see why it should be treated any differently from any other crime . ` if we stopped fingerprinting burglars because we lacked detention facilities there would be uproar . ministers will now have to explain why this offence should be treated differently . the government needs to take urgent action to correct this extraordinary situation . ' charlie elphicke , tory mp for dover , said he had been assured that the home office would review the situation . he added : ` it is clearly important that we have the tightest possible border security . the report is clear these people should be fingerprinted and it is right that the home office is going to review it . ' last night the home office said scrapping checks freed up the border force to concentrate on searching vehicles for stowaways and was decided by the last labour government . a spokesman added : ` would-be illegal immigrants found by border force in freight vehicles are handed to the french authorities for processing , including fingerprinting where appropriate . ' however , during a daily mail investigation , migrants caught on the lorries said they had not been fingerprinted or photographed by either the british or french authorities . syrian rami kazaz , 35 , told the mail : ` the british officials hand us over to the french police who let us go . ` i do n't know of anyone found on a lorry who has had their fingerprints checked . this encourages us to try again . ' fawzi aloui , a 29-year-old tunisian , said he was fingerprinted and photographed in lampedusa , italy , after fleeing there by boat from the north african coast three years ago . ` they checked my identity thoroughly . i have tried to get through to britain on a lorry every night for three months in calais . each time i am caught , the british take no details of who i am or ask which country i came from . i have not been fingerprinted by the french either . ' people-trafficking gangs smuggle at least 30 migrants every day to this country from calais .", "summary": " huge security downgrade gives illegal immigrants endless chances .   french police free them allowing them to try to enter britain again and again .   critics describe loophole as ` disturbing ' and call for it to be closed .
