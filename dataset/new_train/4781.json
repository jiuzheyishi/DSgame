{"text": "washington republican presidential hopeful mike huckabee refused to retract a statement he made in 1992 calling for the isolation of aids patients . responding to an associated press questionnaire , huckabee said steps should be taken to  isolate the carriers of this plague  during his failed run for a u.s. senate seat from arkansas 15 years ago . he said he probably would not make the same statement today because of what is known about how hiv , the virus that causes aids , is transmitted .  i had simply made the point -- and i still believe this today -- that in the late '80s and early '90s , when we did n't know as much as we do now about aids , we were acting more out of political correctness than we were about the normal public health protocols that we would have acted ,  huckabee told fox news on sunday . the centers for disease control and prevention concluded in 1985 that aids was not transmitted by casual contact . but huckabee said at the time ,  there were other concerns being voiced by public health officials .  he disputed the characterization that he was calling for individuals infected with hiv to be quarantined .  now , would i say things a little differently in 2007 ? probably so ,  huckabee told fox news .  but i 'm not going to recant or retract from the statement that i did make because , again , the point was not saying we ought to lock people up who have hiv/aids .  huckabee did not explain how individuals with hiv would have been isolated . during his senate run , huckabee also told the ap in the questionnaire that he found homosexuality to be  an aberrant , unnatural and sinful lifestyle .  speaking monday in miami , florida , huckabee said he still stands by his earlier remarks on homosexuality . watch huckabee 's comments about homosexuals   let 's understand what sin means ,  huckabee said .  sin means missing the mark . missing the mark could mean missing the mark in any area . we 've all missed the mark .  the former baptist minister said the  proper relationship  is one between a married man and woman having children .  if we did n't have that as the ideal , we would n't have a civilization that was able to perpetuate ,  he said .  so , rather than read into something incredibly out of line , just read into the fact that i believe that the ideal relationship is one-man , one-woman , pro-life .  the former arkansas governor has come under increased scrutiny since his rapid rise in the polls , particularly in iowa , where a mcclatchy-msnbc poll conducted december 3-6 has him leading the gop field with the support of 32 percent of likely caucus-goers . former massachusetts gov. mitt romney , who had been leading in iowa for months , was the second closest rival for the gop presidential nomination , at 20 percent . the poll 's margin of error was plus or minus 5 percentage points . huckabee also has come under scrutiny for his role in the parole of a convicted rapist who later went on to rape and kill another woman . as arkansas governor , huckabee supported the parole of wayne dumond , who was convicted and sentenced to a life term for raping a 17-year-old girl . after dumond 's parole in 1999 , he killed a woman in kansas city , missouri , in 2003 . dumond died in prison two years later . huckabee wrote a 1996 letter to dumond supporting his release from prison , but the candidate said the decision was made by a parole board dominated by appointees of his predecessors , jim guy tucker and bill clinton . former members of the arkansas parole board at the time also said that huckabee pressured them to approve dumond 's parole , though huckabee denies doing so . last week , the mother of the woman dumond killed in 2003 said she would actively campaign against huckabee . in an interview with cnn , huckabee called it  heartbreaking  that the rape victims ' deaths had become politicized .  there are families who are truly , understandably and reasonably , grief-stricken ,  huckabee said .  and for people to now politicize these deaths and to try to make a political case out of it rather than to simply understand that a system failed and that we ought to extend our grief and heartfelt sorrow to these families , i just regret politics is reduced to that .  e-mail to a friend . cnn 's dana bash and evan glass contributed to this report .", "summary": " new : mike huckabee stands by '92 remarks on homosexuality as  sinful lifestyle    huckabee also called for isolation of aids patients in earlier questionnaire .   gop candidate says he would n't say same thing about aids patients today .   but huckabee says he wo n't retract his earlier comments on aids .
