{"text": "one of the most prominent characters on the campaign trial in the wake of the first presidential debate was big bird , the sesame street puppet beloved by millions but targeted by republican nominee mitt romney . after the former massachusetts governor took aim at pbs - and , as a result , big bird - during the debate , it was one of president obama 's top advisers who turned that comment into a major talking point . a profile in the new york times details how stephanie cutter , one of the president 's deputy campaign managers , turned the television puppet into a manifestation of mitt romney 's vision . scroll down for video . attack woman : stephanie cutter frequently appears both in obama campaign videos or on news shows in support of the president 's re-election campaign . ` she spotted right away that this was something that was trending out there and that was making an impact , ' chief obama strategist david axelrod said . two days after the debate , ms cutter posted a photo to twitter of a person dressed as big bird at a romney rally , with the caption ` looks like somebody showed up in -lrb- virginia -rrb- to ruffle @mittromney 's feathers ' . making the point even more clear , she included the hashtag #protectsesamestreetnotwallstreet . from there , the big bird argument picked up steam and the campaign went on to create a 30-second advertisement that jokingly compared notorious banking scammers like bernie madoff to the sesame street character who was described as ` big , yellow , a menace to our economy ' . picking a fight : two days after the debate , cutter used her twitter feed to stoke the fire . big bird : she tweeted this photo -lrb- left -rrb- and then the campaign created a similar television ad -lrb- right -rrb- . though ms cutter , 43 , was not directly involved in the creation of the ad , the premise that she established in her original tweet was very clearly the inspiration behind it . ms cutter has long been a prominent operative for democratic candidates , but she has begun to step in front of the camera more frequently during this election as a result of the prominent role she holds and the degree to which she has made herself an integral part of the obama administration . a close confidante to the late senator ted kennedy , ms cutter first became involved with the obamas when she helped arrange for former first daughter caroline kennedy 's endorsement of the then-senator from illinois . when it came time for obama to take the realm , she had already gone through her own battles within the party as she was given much of the blame for john kerry 's failed presidential bid in 2004 , even though mr kerry defended her in saying that it was not her fault . with the boss : cutter -lrb- left -rrb- is seen here in a situation room meeting with the president and then-chief of staff bill daley in july 2011 . predecessor : she worked closely with john kerry when he ran for president in 2004 against george w. bush . the new york times explains that following that fall from grace , she took what many viewed as a demotion by working with politicians seemingly in crisis mode : treasury secretary timothy geithner after the tarp bailout , and first lady michelle obama after she made the gaffe in saying that her husband 's nomination was the first time she was proud of her country . friends say that it is ms cutter 's exacting nature that has helped her handle even the most tricky of trouble spots , justifying why she was given the delicate assignment of telling then-supreme court nominee sonia sotomayor to tone down her earring selections in order to pass through her confirmation hearings . ` she has an attention to detail that builds huge confidence on the part of the people she works for and , i say this parenthetically , especially women , ' anita dunn , former obama white house communications director told the times .", "summary": " stephanie cutter is a deputy campaign manager for president obama .
