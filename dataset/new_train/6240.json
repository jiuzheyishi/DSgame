{"text": "an artist has fashioned an elaborate wedding gown using nothing but 11 rolls of toilet paper , 100 ft of tape and a hefty quantity of glue . olivia mears , an art student based in asheville , north carolina , built her creation for the annual cheap chic toilet paper wedding dress contest , sponsored , naturally , by charmin . ' i learned about the contest with only a few weeks to prepare the dress ' , she tells mailonline , estimating that she probably spent around 20 hours working on it . elaborate : artist olivia mears -lrb- pictured in her design -rrb- created this wedding gown using only 11 rolls of charmin toilet paper , 100 ft of tape , and some glue . ms mears , who says she creates a lot of victorian and fantasy inspired pieces as part of her artworks , wanted to incorporate the same magical theme into the dress . ` based on victorian ball gowns i decided on a tiered train , embroidered corset style bodice , and the layers of roses and ruffles ' , she explains . ` but to make it more contemporary i dropped the sleeves , let the bottom drape down naturally , and opened the front of the dress . ruffles : ms mears entered the dress into last year 's annual cheap chic toilet paper wedding dress contest , sponsored by charmin , and says it took around 20 hours of work to create . intricate : it looks incredibly ornate , but this gold trimming is just tape , and the amount of toilet paper used amounts to less than six dollars worth . the resulting gown is certainly a spectacle to behold ; an eruption of frothy frills , built around a sturdy bodice and finished with intricate weavings of gold tape . fragile as it may appear , ms mears says that the inside of the dress was reinforced with packaging tape , so it was n't too much at risk of ripping , although it did require ' a lot of wiggling ' to get into it for the photographs . her sharp-clawed feline friend , on the other hand , posed obvious risks . ' i sacrificed a roll of toilet paper to my cat before starting on the dress , and he took another while i was n't looking . he was occupied with that for a while ' , she says . hazard : this looks like a dress-shredding disaster waiting to happen , but ms mears cunningly supplied her cat with a decoy roll of toilet paper to keep his claws otherwise occupied -lrb- pictured -rrb- . detail : ms mears hopes one day to be a professional costume designer in los angeles , but for now she refers to her unusual work as simply a ` hobby ' the dress did n't win last year 's charmin contest but it came 15th out of more than 1,400 entries , and ms mears plans to re-enter this year , with a lot more preparation time to play with . currently , she is a student at western carolina university for art education and considers fashion and design as more of a ` hobby ' for now . ` at the moment , i 'm just enjoying teaching art to young students and inspiring them to create their own unique pieces after seeing what i do ' , she states . still , she dreams of one day going to los angeles to become a costume designer , and making a career out of her nifty skills . one she 'd be do very well in , if her unique take on a chic cheap wedding dress is anything to go by .", "summary": " olivia mears used only 11 rolls of charmin toilet paper , 100 ft of tape and some glue .
