{"text": "jose antonio vargas trumpeted that he was an undocumented immigrant for years . but authorities never apprehended him . until now . on tuesday , u.s. border patrol agents detained the pulitzer prize-winning journalist-turned-activist in mcallen , texas , after he told them he was in the country illegally , officials said . he was released on his own recognizance with a notice to appear before an immigration judge , the department of homeland security said in a statement . vargas was detained tuesday morning at the mcallen airport while trying to pass through security en route to los angeles , said ryan eller , campaign director for define american , a group vargas founded in 2011 . vargas became an outspoken advocate pushing for an overhaul of the nation 's immigration laws in 2011 , when he revealed he was undocumented in a column for the new york times magazine . recently , he detailed his life story in  documented ,  a film about the u.s. immigration debate that he wrote and directed . cnn aired it on june 29 . vargas said in a statement released by a spokesperson tuesday evening that he had been released .  i want to thank everyone who stands by me and the undocumented immigrants of south texas and across the country ,  he said .  our daily lives are filled with fear in simple acts such as getting on an airplane to go home to our family .  even with his high profile and frequent speaking events about his immigration status , vargas had n't found himself in the cross hairs of authorities until his trip this month to the border region to support unaccompanied minors coming from central america .  mr. vargas has not previously been arrested by -lrb- immigrations and customs enforcement -rrb- nor has the agency ever issued a detainer on him or encountered him ,  the department of homeland security said tuesday .  ice is focused on smart , effective immigration enforcement that prioritizes the agency 's resources to promote border security and to identify and remove criminal individuals who pose a threat to public safety and national security .  tania chavez , an undocumented youth leader who met with vargas recently and has accompanied him around the mcallen area , told cnn that he was detained because he did not have proper documentation . it was a possibility vargas feared after he arrived in the region .  because i do n't have any id besides my filipino passport , it 's going to be hard for me to actually get out of here at some point when i decide to get out of here in the next couple of days ,  he told cnn on sunday . early tuesday , vargas tweeted that he was about to go through security at mcallen-miller international airport . since outing himself as an undocumented immigrant three years ago , he says he has traveled extensively , visiting 40 states .  i do n't know what 's going to happen ,  he tweeted , directing his followers to the twitter handles for define american and the university of texas-pan american 's minority affairs council . within minutes , the latter retweeted a photo of vargas in handcuffs with the caption :  here 's a photo of -lrb- vargas -rrb- in handcuffs , because the border patrol has nothing more pressing to do apparently .  in politico last week , vargas wrote a piece headlined  trapped on the border .  the story documents how he went to mcallen to visit a shelter where undocumented immigrant children were being held . he also wanted to share his  story of coming to the united states as an unaccompanied minor from the philippines ,  he wrote for politico . once in mcallen , he spoke to chavez , who expressed concern that he might not make it through the u.s. customs and border protection checkpoints about 45 minutes outside mcallen .  even if you tell them you 're a u.s. citizen , they will ask you follow-up questions if they do n't believe you ,  chavez told him , according to the politico piece .  in the last 24 hours i realize that , for an undocumented immigrant like me , getting out of a border town in texas -- by plane or by land -- wo n't be easy . it might , in fact , be impossible ,  he wrote friday . vargas , define american and other groups traveled to mcallen to  stand in solidarity with and humanize the stories of the children and families fleeing the most dangerous regions of central america ,  eller told reporters tuesday . vargas told cnn on sunday that he traveled to mcallen to document the plight of refugees . before he went to bed monday , vargas told eller ,  our america is better than this . we 're more humane . we 're more compassionate . and we 're fighting for a better america , a country we love but has yet to recognize us ,  the define american campaign director recalled tuesday . at 12 , vargas came to the united states from the philippines in 1993 with a man he 'd never met but whom his aunt and a family friend introduced as his uncle , wrote in his 2011 new york times magazine column . once in the states , he lived with his grandfather , a security guard , and grandmother , a food server . both were naturalized american citizens who had been supporting vargas and his mother since vargas was 3 . he 'd later learn that his grandfather had paid $ 4,500 for this purported uncle -- who was a coyote , or people smuggler -- to bring vargas to the united states under a fake passport and name .  after i arrived in mountain view , california , in the san francisco bay area , i entered sixth grade and quickly grew to love my new home , family and culture . i discovered a passion for language , though it was hard to learn the difference between formal english and american slang ,  vargas wrote for the magazine . one of his earliest memories , he wrote , was a schoolmate asking him ,  what 's up ?  he replied ,  the sky .  vargas says he did n't know he was in the country illegally until he was 16 , when he applied for a driver 's license and was told his green card was bogus . he went home and asked his grandfather whether that was true , according to the magazine story .  lolo was a proud man , and i saw the shame on his face as he told me he purchased the card , along with other fake documents , for me . ` do n't show it to other people , ' he warned ,  vargas wrote . vargas has written for numerous publications as a journalist , including the new yorker . he interned for the seattle times and worked for the huffington post , the san francisco chronicle and the philadelphia daily news . in 2008 , he was part of the washington post team that won the pulitzer prize for its breaking news coverage of the previous year 's shooting rampage at virginia tech . vargas got bylines on two of the nine stories the pulitzer board cited .  over the past 14 years , i 've graduated from high school and college and built a career as a journalist , interviewing some of the most famous people in the country ,  he wrote in his 2011 magazine piece .  on the surface , i 've created a good life . i 've lived the american dream . but i am still an undocumented immigrant .  vargas : undocumented and hiding in plain sight . share your immigration story .",
