{"text": "east cleveland , ohio near the areas where the decomposing bodies of three young women were found wrapped in plastic last weekend , angry and frightened residents gather to rally and pray .  our women do not feel safe !  one community leader yells .  we will protect our families !  yells another . the community here has been badly shaken recently . in the past several years , cleveland 's metropolitan area has been the center of a series of grisly discoveries of missing , murdered , kidnapped , raped and mutilated women . the start of this week brought grim news to three families in east cleveland , as each learned their beloved daughter or mother had been identified as a victim of the city 's latest accused serial killer , michael madison . with the discovery of the three missing women 's remains , the question is being asked often here : what 's happening to women in cleveland ? more questions than answers in cleveland .  we need for the president of the united states of america to bring in the national guard to find these women ,  said kathy wray coleman , leader of a group called the imperial women .  we ca n't do it alone . we need them to come in and find these women .  coleman 's group was created and named after the discovery of the victims of anthony sowell , the so-called  cleveland strangler  who was convicted of kidnapping , raping , and murdering 11 african-american women . sowell buried his victims ' battered bodies in and around his home , located on imperial avenue . sowell 's victims were discovered in 2009 , though many had been missing for months , or even years . he is now on death row . madison is a registered sex offender who has now been charged with murder in the deaths of the three women , all found near his apartment last weekend in east cleveland . madison , 35 , is currently being held in jail , with his bond set at $ 6 million . the investigation continues into whether there are more victims connected to him . this past may , cleveland was also in the spotlight when three women missing for a decade were able to escape years of brutal bondage and rape in the home of ariel castro , who accepted a plea deal under which he will avoid the death penalty , but spend the rest of his life in prison . fast facts : cleveland kidnappings . officially , 54 women currently are missing within cleveland 's city limits , according to the city 's police department . that compares with four missing women in cincinnati , an ohio city of similar size . many of cleveland 's community activists who work to fight crime in their neighborhoods say the number of missing is much higher than the police website says .  i would predict that 500 women are missing in the city of cleveland and east cleveland ,  said art mckoy , leader of a group called black on black crime . cleveland police say they are doing the best they can and acknowledge their list of missing people is incomplete and difficult to keep accurate . the list does not include missing women from neighboring east cleveland , which has a separate police department . all across both cities , posters of the missing women can be seen , especially in impoverished neighborhoods . minerva tripp is one of those missing women . she vanished without a trace last august . the single mother was raising a 10-year old daughter . minerva 's two older sisters have endured months of heartache and worry , spending endless hours searching for her .  not knowing where she is -- it 's a pain i ca n't even describe ,  said marcellette love , minerva 's older sister .  for months i would dream of her , seeing her in the mud , in trash bags , soaked in the rain . ... i just want to have her back . i just want to see her .  love said she thinks the police have not done nearly enough to help them find minerva .  on a scale of 1 to 10 , i would give them a zero ,  she said .  they have not followed leads and have not done nearly enough .  the family of charlene price agrees . price , who went missing in 1997 , would now be 55 years old .  we will not give up , we want to find her and bring her home ,  said howard jackson iii . gallery : the faces of some of america 's missing . cleveland and east cleveland 's officials and police defend their work over the years , but acknowledge the problem is very serious .  in the cities combined , there are far too many people missing ,  said gary norton , mayor of east cleveland . many here believe the ever-growing number of missing and murdered women is tied to the recent economic crisis . across cuyahoga county , home to the cleveland metro area , about 76,000 residences are vacant , according to census bureau figures -- the wreckage left from the loss of jobs , and the foreclosure crisis .  i hate to say this , but in a sense , to a large degree , we have an underclass in the city of cleveland of those that truly are disconnected from the social fabric , from the mainstream economy and society ,  said ronnie dunn , an urban studies professor at cleveland state university .  they 're left without anything to grasp onto .  once a hub of the nation 's industrial might -- shipping out seemingly endless streams of iron , steel , machinery and automobiles from its perch on lake erie -- the city that once housed nearly a million people now has barely a third of that population . the crisis has gotten so serious that civilians are now doing things that are normally left to the authorities . on wednesday , groups of local residents went into wooded areas and several abandoned homes in east cleveland , looking for bodies or signs of missing women who might have been kidnapped or assaulted . mckoy of black on black crime helped lead the search .  the real heart of our city is our women , and if you ca n't protect our women , it 's not a city ,  he said . why are women disappearing in cleveland ? all over the cleveland area , fliers were posted for a missing 18-year-old named shirellda helen terry , a regular at bible study , who went missing just this month after leaving her summer job at an elementary school . on wednesday afternoon , members of shirellda 's family stood on roads , as they do nearly every day , handing out fliers and missing posters , calling out  help us find shirellda !  that afternoon , the family learned shirellda was no longer missing . she was dead , positively identified as one of the three women found in east cleveland . hours later , family , friends and supporters gathered for a vigil at the same place where they had been searching for the young woman .  my baby is gone ,  said her father , van terry , as he was consoled by friends .  that 's the reality of it all . now , when i cry tonight , i 'm not crying hoping i find her . i know where she 's at . i 'm crying because i miss her , and now she 's gone on .  cnn 's michael pearson contributed to this report . got a story idea or tip for cnn 's investigations team ?
