{"text": "the gettysburg address was a quick-hitting speech that was built to last . length : a little over two minutes . message : stay the course of a difficult war . if democracy wo n't work here , it wo n't work anywhere . short enough to comfortably fit into a social media status box , and shared in its entirety hundreds of times every day , according to recent data from facebook . memorable phrases are quoted even more often . it has been 150 years since president abraham lincoln got up in front of thousands of people in gettysburg , pennsylvania , to dedicate the soldiers ' national cemetery at a turning point in the civil war . his words are some of the most memorable in american history , forever stamping our collective minds with  four score and seven years ago ,  and  all men are created equal ,  and of course a  government of the people , by the people , for the people .  some of this was n't really his coinage , but we 'll get into that later . politicians portrayed themselves differently in lincoln 's day , seeking to give a more powerful kind of impression , said dennis baron , a professor of english and linguistics at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign .  if you did that today , people would think of you as somehow flowery and old-fashioned and ... why are you doing that ?  the modern trend is for leaders to  play the folksy card ,  baron said , portraying themselves as ordinary joes and janes who are exactly like you in every way -- except for the fact that they are hoping to achieve a position of immense power . baron said the last president with an  oratorial  style -- on the whole -- was probably john f. kennedy , who was assassinated 100 years and three days after the delivery of the gettysburg address . we still remember kennedy 's delivery of lines like ,  ask not what your country can do for you ; ask what you can do for your country .  lincoln was able to get straight to the point and deliver a punchy speech in part because he came after edward everett 's marathon presentation about the war , explains james cornelius , curator of the lincoln collection in the abraham lincoln presidential library and museum . lincoln had no speechwriter . today , most politicians have at least some help preparing their words . everett had been the main attraction , but lincoln 's speech started picking up steam afterward and seemed to  go viral  in the manner of its day . newspapers wrote about the speech . in some cities , people could buy commemorative event pamphlets that contained the speech , and key phrases were incorporated into lincoln 's 1864 election posters and memorials after his death . newspaper retracts editorial panning gettysburg address . sound familiar ? cornelius said overall , civil war-era america was a consumer-driven society that had a few things in common with our internet-saturated world . one can only imagine the tweets that would have been written about such a speech in modern times .  omg . lincoln just said in two minutes what everett tried to say in two hours . #nailedit #boom  today , children learn the address in school , especially in northern cities , and documentary guru ken burns is asking people to record themselves saying the speech from memory . ken burns : learn the gettysburg address by heart . people also share the quotations on social media . certain phrases seem to stick out , and facebook numbers show which ones we like to share . we found that people in some states , like delaware , were particularly fond of quoting the address and that different parts of the speech were more popular in some states than others . here is a nonexhaustive rundown of some of the most popular phrases in the speech , in order of appearance . ` four score and seven years ago ' pretty much everyone knows this part of the gettysburg address , even if they think a score is just something from sports . but no , in this case a score is 20 of something . here , a span of 20 years . this line is a bit of an inside remark shared with the audience , believed by most historians to be a reference to psalm 90:10 , which most people of the day would know is an allusion to the human lifespan .  the days of our years are threescore years and 10 ,  says the psalm .  and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years , yet is their strength labor and sorrow ; for it is soon cut off , and we fly away .  cornelius said lincoln used such phrasing as a subtle reminder that the nation was only a youthful 87 years old . lincoln felt the united states was setting an example for the world , and he did n't want the experiment in democracy to fail .  he 's a little bit worried that the nation might die at about the average lifespan that a human would ,  cornelius said .  he 's putting forth straightforward political terms in a poetic way .  that , and people tend to remember the beginnings of speeches , cornelius said . ` all men are created equal ' more clever wordplay is at work in this famous quotation .  in his call for democracy and equality , -lrb- lincoln -rrb- does n't mention slavery , but everyone knew that was what he was talking about ,  cornelius said . see what he did there ? this phrase can be interpreted as both an allusion to the principles of the declaration of independence and also as a not-so-subtle jab at the institution of slavery . little doubt exists that lincoln opposed slavery , and in fact loathed it , cornelius said . slavery was at the heart of the war . lincoln struggled with how to go about eliminating it , and had to be convinced by legal thinkers and abolitionists that he had the governmental power to tackle it . ` these dead shall not have died in vain ' something about this part of the speech may be touching a nerve somewhere . this part was the second-most-mentioned phrase in the entire speech , rivaling  four score and seven years ago  in popularity , despite the fact that it 's not a particularly well-known part of the gettysburg address . but lincoln ca n't take full credit for this phrase , cornelius said , because it was a fairly common expression used in the parlance of war . it speaks to a need for soldiers ' deaths to mean something , if they must occur -- a timeless desire we echo today . how tech preserves the gettysburg address .  this is always a problem in warfare . why should any other people die ? there is always a percentage of the population that will make that argument at a certain point . lincoln 's contrary point was that they died defending you . they felt so strongly about the right of the cause . they felt so strongly about preserving the union and ending slavery that you should not let their efforts carry into the wind . you should continue on and further this effort .  ` this nation , under god , shall have a new birth of freedom ' this phrase was mentioned by many readers who commented on this story . for some , it has become a point of political contention due to the presence of the words  under god .  there are five versions of the speech , and one of them omits those two words . obama stands out from the gettysburg crowd . another slightly earlier portion of the speech was also frequently cited :  it is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us .  the takeaway there is persistence in the face of adversity . ` government of the people , by the people , for the people ' this famous phrase , as well as the few words immediately before and after it , got lots of mentions on facebook . baron pointed out that anything at the end or beginning of a speech is probably automatically more memorable . it does n't hurt if a speech is structured to enhance this effect , either . it 's such a beloved word grouping that numerous people have borrowed it , massaged it and restated it with a slightly different twist , like a game of telephone in an era without telephones . cornelius said historians trace this part back to daniel webster , a senator and u.s. secretary of state before the civil war . webster 's words were ,  the people 's government , made for the people , made by the people and answerable to the people .  it was later repurposed by the abolitionist minister theodore parker , who talked about a  government of all the people , by all the people , for all the people .  even lincoln himself is said to have used a version of the phrase in a letter 20 years before the address , cornelius said . cornelius said the key to the power of this phrase is in its skillful use of repetition . the point of  people  is driven straight into your mind by its frequent mention . that 's why so many people have recycled it over the years . fast-forward to today , and we 're still sharing all the phrases above . cornelius said one can see the endurance of lincoln 's speaking legacy by taking a stroll into the lincoln library 's gift shop , where you can pick up your very own t-shirt with a lincoln quotation on it . one recently released item has the whole text printed on it . lincoln 's speech endures like few others , especially in our everyman-politician era . maybe that 's why people ca n't help but post the speech on social media , 150 years after the fact . why do you think the gettysburg address endures today , and why do some lines seem to resonate more with different places and groups in the united states ?
