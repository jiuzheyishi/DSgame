{"text": "maybe it is the year of the fox , but as better homes & gardens executive editor oma ford said , that 's not stopping all the other forest critters -- and their habitat -- from showing up in christmas decor .  the fox is having this huge moment . in the past it 's been the squirrel and the owls and deer always have their place in fall and into winter ,  she said .  it 's part of this much larger theme , a full-on woodland sensibility .  from big box stores to craft stores , department stores to chic boutiques , all manner of christmas ornaments and decor items are surrounded by bits of nature-inspired elements , she said .  i do n't think woodland is going away ,  she said . what is  woodland ?  it 's a decor trend that brings the woods indoors . think about what kinds of things you would find in a forest , ford said . everything from pine cones , acorns , tree bark , mushrooms and moss to all styles of furry and feathered creatures . in fact , home decor blogger emily a. clark routinely ventures to her north carolina back yard for a touch of woodland to augment her christmas tree and the rest of her house during the holidays .  if you expand on nature , you really ca n't go wrong ,  she said . clark finds the texture of just-clipped holly , bare sticks and conifer branches to be the perfect starting point when decorating for christmas . that does n't mean that every corner of her house looks like some kind of enchanted forest .  i do n't think you have to stick with one theme for your entire house . i think each room can feel a little different when you 're decorating for chrismas ,  she said , but what ties them together is a wintery inspiration . there is plenty of room for cherished family ornaments , playful , childlike decor and sophisticated decor that adults appreciate , she said .  while it may seem as if the theme has been in the marketplace for a while now ,  said stephen cardino , vice president and fashion director for the home store at macy 's ,  -lrb- woodland decor -rrb- has evolved .  what he 's noticed in the christmas ornaments and decor items offered at macy 's is a saturation and refinement of colors , a new and healthy dose of sparkle and an increase in the kinds of materials used to make them . and when it comes to decorating the tree , cardino points out that there is no one rule of thumb .  some decorate by theme , some by color and some prefer an eclectic theme with each ornament having special meaning ,  he said . and when he buys ornaments for the department store , he keeps in mind that very few people go out and buy all their christmas tree ornaments at once .  customers are looking for holiday decorations that support their existing room decor ,  he said .  the nature-based items we offer are elevated and refined .  many homes may already have some of these woodland decor elements displayed , ford said . faux taxidermy , antlers , moss and pine cones have become everyday decor .  -lrb- the woodland theme -rrb- is huge in nursery decor as well as christmas decor , i mean , it 's enormous ,  she said . when those elements are blended with holiday decor , instead of covered up ,  it feels like an extension of what you 're already doing ,  she said . designer rina norwood works with colors she already has in her home , like blues and greens , when she decorates for christmas . southern cypress and pine provide the perfect texture to balance out the smooth , shiny ornaments and twinkling lights of either modern or traditional decor she said , and their rich green tones make an appearance in her holiday decor . the formality of peacocks , however , is her secret to really bringing color to her christmas decorations .  i think the peacock brings colors than we typically see with -lrb- other -rrb- critters ,  she said . woodland decor can range from whimsical to high style , ford said , and had truly taken hold in the decor world during the last decade . one of ford 's favorite examples of the woodland style comes from a recent find : birch bark made into a paper chain for a christmas tree garland .  it just takes the literal natural element and brings it to a very traditional christmas decorating idea ,  she said . clark ascribes to some classic woodland decor tricks that ford described : bare twigs tucked into christmas trees and very au curant pine cones , birch bark and shed deer antlers . with a decorator for a mom , clark 's five children have learned to expect different looking christmas decor each year .  this year i went for a less-is-more approach ,  she said . the simplicity of a plain , natural pine swag across her mantel , a color scheme of green , white and gold and even some paper snowflakes set the mood clark hoped for . but what if there are some woodland elements that kind of creep you out ? clark remembers the mounted deer head that played a central part in her grandmother 's holiday decor .  that is a vivid memory for me  she said .  they put a rudolph nose on it and tinsel on the antlers . it always really disturbed me .  norwood knows what she means .  if you happen to have a moose above the mantle , which i have seen ,  she said ,  some people go beyond leaving them as they are .  some wives , she said , might compromise with their husbands over a taxidermied woodland decor element . perhaps , she said , the solution could be ,  ok , let 's keep the moose head , but let 's paint it white to bring in that modern element .   it 's just how you approach it ,  she said .  we can definitely work around something as long as it 's done with tasteful grace .  all that hunting trophy really needs for christmas , norwood said , is a natural garland around its neck . do you use the woodland trend in your holiday decor ?
