{"text": "dorian johnson , who was walking with michael brown before officer darren wilson fatally shot brown in august , told remarkably similar stories in an interview with county and federal authorities in august and in testimony to the grand jury in september . the first interview , conducted by an fbi agent and a st. louis county crimes-against-persons detective , was part of a friday document dump by the prosecutor who presented the case to the grand jury . prosecuting attorney robert mcculloch initially released grand jury documents in late november , but did n't include johnson 's august interview . that was a mistake , he said in a letter accompanying friday 's documents .  it was brought to my attention that i omitted the fbi interview of dorian johnson . upon review of the files , i discovered that i had inadvertently omitted a number of witness interviews and a few other documents which had been presented to the grand jury ,  he wrote .  it should be noted that the sworn testimony of these witnesses , including johnson , was released on november 24 , 2014 .  one challenge for ferguson grand jury : some witnesses ' credibility . the prosecutor apologized for any confusion and said he now believes he has released all evidence presented to the grand jury that declined to indict wilson last month . if he finds anything else he unintentionally omitted , he will release it promptly after it 's discovered , he said . that does n't include autopsy photographs , photographs of brown at the scene and any material that might identify any of the witnesses . according to an examination of the transcripts of johnson 's two accounts -- delivered 28 days apart -- brown 's friend had roughly the same recollection of what he saw on the afternoon of august 9 . he was consistent on many of the broader points : . • the two went to the store to buy cigarillos so they could smoke marijuana . at the store , brown nonchalantly stole several cigarillos and left the store . • johnson was worried about the police after the theft , but brown did n't seem fazed , even when wilson pulled up to them several blocks from the store and told them to  get the f *** on the sidewalk .  wilson pulled off but quickly reversed and tried to exit his car , but the car door bounced off of brown and johnson . • wilson grabbed brown by the neck , and the two engaged in a sort of tug of war before wilson twice threatened to shoot and fired , hitting brown , before finishing the second threat . brown and johnson took off running and wilson did n't immediately pursue them . • johnson hid by a vehicle as wilson exited his vehicle , pursued brown and fired once , prompting brown to turn around with his hands up in surrender . wilson then fired a volley of shots . brown hit the ground . the discrepancies in johnson 's stories were minor and perhaps a product of the questions he was asked . for instance , in one account , he said he and brown had spoken to construction workers about getting high on marijuana . in another account , he said a construction worker told him and brown that he smoked only  wax ,  a form of hashish . another example is johnson 's assertion to the grand jury that before he and brown went to the store for cigarillos , he originally intended to purchase them from someone living in the apartment complex . there is no mention of this in the account johnson provided the fbi and county detective . his recollection of what brown said to wilson about being unarmed differs slightly as well . johnson at first said brown told wilson he was n't armed as they tussled at the car and again before the fatal volley of shots . in his account to the grand jury , he said brown said it only after being shot . johnson may have changed one aspect of his story after his interviewers pointed out he was relaying an assumption rather than an actual eyewitness account . while speaking to the fbi and county , johnson said wilson definitely shot brown in the back as he fled .  as he 's runnin ' passed the third car , the officer behind him pointed his weapon with his weapon drawn and he fired a second that did strike my friend big mike in his back 'cause that 's when he stopped runnin ' ,  he said . later in the interview , he reiterated this claim , saying ,  that 's why i know he was hit because he stopped runnin ' .  and on a third occasion , he told the interviewers ,  it definitely struck him in his back . i do n't know verbatim where at .  when the interviewers press johnson -- did he actually see wilson shoot brown in the back , or was he just speculating based on what he saw ? -- johnson conceded ,  ok , so for the purposes , no . i did not see a hole in his shirt rip while i 'm in shock .  about a month later , before the grand jury , johnson made it clear he saw wilson fire at brown as he fled , but he was n't sure if the bullet hit his friend .  the second time he shot , i did n't know if it hit him or not , but he kind of jerked and that 's when he stopped running . he just kind of stopped and turned around at the officer ,  johnson said . portions of johnson 's account are not supported by other witness statements , and there are myriad inconsistencies in the witness testimony . wilson 's statement also does n't jibe with johnson 's . among the discrepancies : wilson and some witnesses said brown attacked the officer , prompting wilson to fire twice from his police vehicle ; wilson and some witnesses said brown fled at first but then charged him ; and witnesses varied on whether brown had his hands up when the fatal shots were fired .", "summary": " in interviews 28 days apart , johnson told similar stories about michael brown 's death .   johnson 's interview with fbi , county detective released friday in latest document dump in case .   many inconsistencies minor , possibly the result of different questions .   many witness accounts do n't jibe , including those of johnson and officer darren wilson .
