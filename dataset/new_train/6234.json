{"text": "they have taken very different routes to get there but ernests gulbis and novak djokovic will meet in the semi-finals of the french open . gulbis followed up his victory over roger federer by thumping sixth seed tomas berdych 6-3 6-2 6-4 while djokovic saw off milos raonic 7-5 7-6 -lrb- 7/5 -rrb- 6-4 . the pair have known each other for more than a decade dating back to their days at niki pilic 's academy in munich . meeting : ernests gulbis will meet novak djokovic in the semi-finals of the french open . defeat : gulbis beat sixth seed tomas berdych 6-3 6-2 6-4 . both had obvious talent but , while this will be djokovic 's 15th semi-final from the last 16 grand slams , gulbis will be playing in his first . had the 25-year-old latvian followed his friend 's advice , it might have been a very different story . ` he was really professional already at that time , ' gulbis recalled of their time together in germany . ' i remember we had a friend , a croatian guy , who was all about the girls at that age already . he was dressing up . he was looking good , putting on perfume , sunglasses , going to talk to the girls . ' i see novak , he 's going to stretch . and novak told me that , ` yeah , you can have anybody , you can have all the girls in the world . but to be really successful in tennis , you need to -lrb- be professional -rrb- ' . ' i remember it still . that 's a kid who is 15 years old . i did n't forget . but i did n't listen . ' memories : novak djokovic remembers gulbis fondly from their time at niki pilic 's academy in munich . djokovic grinned as he remembered gulbis as a teenager . he said : ` he was always somebody that was very enthusiastic about everything in life and you could see he wanted to enjoy it with open arms , if i can say that -lrb- being -rrb- politically correct . ` he was always very talented . i remember he came out in the practices swinging fully through the ball . he did n't really care too much . he respected his coach . he respected the players that he liked . ` the others , he just crushed on the court in practice and the tournaments as well . he always had this confidence about him that you could say that , even though he was 14 , 15 at the time , he was going to become something big . ' gulbis made the quarter-finals of the french open in 2008 as a teenager and was already ranked in the top 100 . but until this tournament he had made it past the second round at a grand slam just once since and in 2012 he dropped back out of the top 100 . exit ; djokovic beat canadian milos raonic 7-5 7-6 6-4 . that was the nadir and over the past 18 months he has climbed rapidly , reaching a career-high of 17th in the rankings , which could well become single figures after this tournament . gulbis ' resurgence has come under austrian coach gunter bresnik , who also looks after 20-year-old rising star dominic thiem . gulbis said of bresnik : ` he did n't deal with those kind of problems which my other coaches were dealing with three or four years ago . ' i missed a practice once with gunter because i had a long night . i called him at 7am , and i said ,  gun , i can not come to practice  . he understood it . it was once . ` with other coaches , the first time when hernan gumy came to latvia to prepare for davis cup ; eight days of preparation , i missed five days of practice . ` and then you evolve , you start to understand , okay , first , make one step . do n't miss five days of practice . just miss three days of practice and then two days and then one and then nothing . it 's a process . ' impressive : no 18 seed gulbis has already beaten roger federer and will be looking for another big scalp . many players have a let down after a big win such as the federer one , but gulbis came out and played even better against berdych . he said : ` today everything was good . i felt physically so good . i felt that i can run forever . i felt that he can not make a winner . if i feel so confident from the baseline , then everything just comes together . ' djokovic had a tougher time against raonic , who took a set off him in rome last month , and was delighted to complete the victory in straight sets . ` it 's never smooth against milos or against any server of his calibre ,  he said .  there are few guys that are serving this well . ` when he 's on , it 's very difficult to do anything except be mentally strong and consistent and try to wait for the opportunities . when they are presented , you better use them .
