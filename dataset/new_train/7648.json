{"text": "scientists have unlocked the mystery of how a man with uncrossed optic nerves is still able to see thanks to the incredible adaptability of the human brain . in most people the optic nerves have a crossroads - known as an optic chiasm - which diverts sense data so that each half of their brains processes information from either side of their visual field . but the 28-year-old subject , known only as gb , was born without this crossover , meaning each half of his brain is forced to process information from his whole visual field . uncrossed : these fmri scans of gb and a . control show how he lacks the optic chiasm which normally diverts sense data so that each half of the brain only processes information . from one side of the visual field . the condition , called achiasma , means . all the signals from his left eye end up in his left visual cortex and . all the signals from his right eye end up in his right visual cortex . given the disorder , canadian neurologist jodie davies-thompson , of the university of british columbia , and colleagues wondered how his brain made sense of it . normally the left visual cortex deals only with the left side of visual space , while the right visual cortex deals with the right side , explained discover magazine 's neuroskeptic blog . but in gb 's brain each half must cope with the entire visual field , twice as much space . in a paper published in the journal neuropsychologia , dr thompson and her colleagues reported that gb 's brain has adapted by overlapping the two halves of space in gb 's visual cortex . in the fmri scans of gb 's brain published in their study , four colours are used to represent the four quarters of his visual field and the parts of his brain that light up in response to them . the bottom and top of his visual field remain separately represented , as they would be in a normal person 's brain . but there is a complete overlap between areas responding to bottom-left and bottom-right , as well as top-left and top-right . the adaptable brain : to deal with the information there is a complete overlap between areas of gb 's brain responding to bottom-left and bottom-right of his visual field , as well as top-left and top-right . the incredible adaptability of the human brain is further revealed by gb 's 20/80 score in an eye test - one quarter as good as a typical person , despite his congenital disorder . neuroskeptic remarks on the study : ` this is a fascinating case report , and vision neuroscientists will find much to ponder here . ` still , what i 'd love to know is how does it feel to have overlapping representations of the two sides of space ? ` does everything seem to be mirrored vertically ? does gb find it easier to tell objects apart when they 're above and below the other , compared to side-to-side ? '", "summary": " patient known only as gb was born with no crossover in his optic nerves , a rare congenital condition known as achiasma .   scientists using fmri scans found gb 's brain has simply adapted by dealing with both sides of the visual field in the same part of the brain .
