{"text": "london , england eurostar canceled all service this weekend after severe wintry weather in northern france caused the breakdown of an  unprecedented  six trains , stranding thousands of passengers on both sides of the english channel on the weekend before christmas . five trains with about 2,000 passengers stopped running friday night inside the channel tunnel , also called the chunnel , which runs between britain and france . a sixth train broke down saturday after eurostar tried to run four trains from london to the continental mainland in order to prepare for the resumption of normal service . about 700 people were aboard when that train stopped in the ebbsfleet area of kent . in a statement on its web site saturday , eurostar said it will conduct a series of test trains sunday  to better understand the problems that have been occurring .   we are committed to restoring our services as soon as possible but our key priority is the safety and comfort of our customers ,  the statement said . those passengers affected by the breakdowns are being offered a full refund , another return ticket , and 150 pounds in compensation . about 25,000 people should have been traveling on saturday , eurostar said .  we strongly recommend that travelers whose journeys are not essential change their tickets for travel on a later date or have their tickets refunded ,  eurostar said on its web site . the trains became stuck in the tunnel because the air inside was much warmer than the air outside the tunnel entrance in france , eurostar spokeswoman amelle mouhaddib told cnn .  it 's a bit like taking a bottle of beer out of the fridge into a warm room -- within minutes it 's covered in condensation ,  said eurostar ceo richard brown .  we think that was the principle cause of the electrical failures on the trains .  he called the number of breakdowns  completely unprecedented .  eurotunnel , which operates the channel tunnel , said it evacuated all 1,364 eurostar passengers who were stuck friday after the trains  lost traction ,  but one of the five trains remained in the tunnel and was blocking part of it , according to a eurotunnel spokeswoman who asked not to be named , in keeping with policy . the train that broke down saturday was being towed back to the tunnel entry so passengers could be removed and transferred , eurostar said . passengers evacuated friday night described how a trip that was supposed to take around two hours lasted more than 14 , factoring in the one-hour time difference between london and paris .  i left at 6:30 from paris and we just arrived at 8 o'clock ,  passenger robert ricine told sky news after arriving at london 's st. pancras station , a eurostar hub . he and other passengers complained they were given no food or water and little information during the ordeal .  it was a very upsetting experience for those passengers traveling , and we 're very sorry for what happened to them ,  brown said .  we will be taking a very close look at what happened -lsb- and -rsb- what lessons can be learned principally to actually understand why it was that we had five trains breaking down .  the problems started after 9 p.m. -lrb- 4 p.m. et -rrb- friday , when the first of the five eurostar trains became stuck . it was helped out of the tunnel by a eurotunnel locomotive , which took it all the way to london with passengers still on board , the eurotunnel spokeswoman said . passengers on the second and third trains to fail were evacuated via the service tunnel to a eurotunnel train , which brought them to the exit , she said . one of the failed trains was pulled out of the tunnel , but authorities were having difficulty removing the other , she said . the fourth and fifth trains were running close together when they failed , so eurotunnel locomotives coupled them and either pushed or pulled them to the english side of the tunnel , the spokeswoman said . passengers from the fifth train boarded the one in front , and eurotunnel locomotives then towed that train to london , she said . the chunnel is actually two tunnels separated by a third and smaller service tunnel , so the train that remained stuck inside did not mean the entire tunnel was blocked , the eurotunnel spokeswoman said . the chunnel is 50.5 kilometers -lrb- 31.4 miles -rrb- long , 38 kilometers -lrb- 23 miles -rrb- of which are underwater . brown said keeping passengers on the trains is the quickest and safest evacuation method .  because there were five trains , it took us ... longer than we would wish to get those trains out and those passengers on their way home ,  he said . despite the stoppage of service saturday , noncommercial vehicles , including cars , motorbikes and camper vans , were still able to travel through the tunnel . french authorities told all trucks to get off the highways on the french side of the channel because of the hazardous conditions , eurotunnel spokesman john keefe told cnn . no trucks were entering the tunnel from the french side , and trucks were unable to enter on the english side because they would n't be allowed to drive upon reaching france . the trouble resulted in a backup of freight traffic on either side of the tunnel , keefe said . on the british side , kent police early saturday implemented operation stack , which goes into effect any time there is a problem affecting freight traffic in the tunnel . the operation lets police manage the backlog of trucks that builds up whenever the tunnel is closed . a kent police spokesman could not estimate how many trucks were waiting saturday morning but said operation stack allows police to manage as many as 2,300 trucks . the poor weather in france also created problems for boats intending to sail across the channel from england . the port of dover , a major exit point to france , was operating restricted services saturday because of weather problems in calais , france , according to the port 's web site .  the french authorities prohibited traffic from leaving the port of calais owing to the treacherous road conditions , which curtailed all services to calais ,  the port said .  tourist traffic is now being permitted to use the port and ships are sailing to calais .  it was not immediately clear whether freight traffic had resumed between dover and calais . cnn 's melissa gray contributed to this report .", "summary": " new : eurostar cancels all weekend service due to weather-induced problems .   new : a sixth train broke down saturday after eurostar tried to run four
