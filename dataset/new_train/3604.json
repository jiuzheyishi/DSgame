{"text": "as if the warming is ` hiding ' underwater . easterly trade winds of the pacific ocean have increased significantly over the past two decades and as a result are blowing higher volumes of warm surface sea water to deeper depths . stronger trade winds blowing from south america to australia have had the net effect of cooling surface temperatures by a global average of between 0.1 °c and 0.2 °c , . this would be enough to account for the apparent hiatus in global average temperatures over the past 15 years . the warm water wo n't hide below the surface forever : scientists believe that it may re-emerge later or affect other climate indicators , such as sea level or ocean circulation . but most climate projections do not factor in volcanic eruptions because they are so hard to predict . however , large ones like the 1991 mount pinatubo eruption in the philippines , which emitted some 44 billion lbs -lrb- 20 million metric tons -rrb- of sulphur , are believed to have impacted global climate . david ridley , an atmospheric scientist at mit in cambridge , felt that a piece of the climate puzzle was missing . according to the study , he located it in the intersection of the stratosphere and the troposphere - the bottom layer of the atmosphere - where all weather takes place . the two layers meet between six to nine miles -lrb- 10 and 15km -rrb- above the earth , and are below the reach of most satellites . ` the satellite data does a great job of monitoring the particles above nine miles -lrb- 15km -rrb- , which is fine in the tropics , ' professor ridley said . ` however , towards the poles we are missing more and more of the particles residing in the lower stratosphere that can reach down to six miles -lrb- 10km -rrb- . ' the study combined observations from ground , air and space-based instruments to better observe aerosols in the lower portion of the stratosphere , and found that there are more aerosols that previously thought . experts say future climate models need to incorporate better aerosol data , which can only be obtained with a more robust monitoring system for stratospheric aerosols . the latest findings , by researchers at massachusetts institute of technology , show that small volcanic eruptions have deflected almost twice the amount of solar radiation previously estimated . pictured the tavurvur volcano at papua new guinea .", "summary": " small volcanoes are spewing sulphur aerosols into upper atmosphere .   these aerosols reflect huge amounts of sunlight away from the earth .   this may be responsible for decreasing temperatures by 0.05 to 0.12 °c .   data could explain why global warming has slowed over past 15 years .   study combined observations from ground , air and space-based instruments to better see aerosols in lower part of the stratosphere .
