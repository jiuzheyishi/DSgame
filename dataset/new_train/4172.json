{"text": " do you want to hit this ?  a man asked president barack obama in a bar in denver tuesday night . the president laughed but did n't indulge . it was n't the only time obama was offered weed on his night out . that 's apparently what happens in colorado , which recently legalized recreational marijuana . the man posted the exchange on instagram for the world to see . obama has admitted to smoking pot as a young man . he was an active member of the  choom gang  in high school , which perfected all sorts of techniques for getting high . the president has since spoken about those times in more serious settings , saying as recently as this year that he made  bad choices  without considering  the harm it could do .  earlier in the evening , the presidential motorcade passed a bearded man holding a sign :  free weed 4 obama .  a sign outside a marijuana dispensary offered the same thing . the motorcade did n't stop . and obama waving off the offers did n't seem to ruin the fun . his boys ' night out with colorado gov. john hickenlooper at the bar the governor used to own consisted of , well , things that take place in bars .  did you see how many balls he still has on the table ?  the president joked after a game of pool . hickenlooper had five , while the president sunk the 8-ball . a patron offered to buy the president a beer .  it 's too late , man . i just got one ,  obama said . while obama the bear was loose , the entire night was not all jovial . a woman stopped the president , telling him that her brother died in afghanistan four years ago . obama gave kalynne may arrick , from tyler , texas , a challenge coin usually reserved for veterans , who collect them . her brother , marine sgt. kenneth may , was killed in afghanistan in 2010 .  i 'm so sorry ,  he told arrick , hugging her . presidential meet-and-greets rarely veer so far off script . by the time obama sat down at a pizza joint with people who had written him letters , the president had loosened his blue tie and rolled up his sleeves . a teacher , a couple who own a small business , a college student , and a furniture store worker sat obama down at the head of a table crowded with plates and pizza trays .  where do you all want me ?  asked the president .  right at the head of the table .   oh my goodness , that 's so formal .  later , he walked down the streets of downtown denver , giving fist bumps , shaking hands and slapping high fives . he refused a selfie and resisted holding a cute ba one onlooker wore a large horse head ,  the pool report on the visit said ,  but it 's unclear what message he hoped to convey .  obama also stopped to talk with a father and son . the boy said he was a skateboarder .  i see you got a little scab here ,  the president told him .  you got scuffed up a little bit . that 's alright . if you 're 10 and you do n't have a scab you 're not having fun .  the president ended the night with a picture and a fist bump with a gorilla statue and was back at his hotel by 9 p.m. tuesday was just the first night of a three-day road trip . obama is holding a fundraiser for sen. mark udall wednesday and will give a speech focused on the economy to promote his policies to help workers . then he 'll head to texas , which has been the center of a political sparring match between he and gov. rick perry over the deluge of immigrant children crossing the border . what can the lone star state possibly do to top one night in denver ? immigration reform probably is n't going to do it . opinion : obama has n't hit rock bottom yet .", "summary": " the president gets multiple offers of free pot .   there 's brew and billiards with the colorado governor .   he gets to fist bump with a gorilla .   and there 's a guy wearing a horse head mask .
