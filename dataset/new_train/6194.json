{"text": "` not what was intended ' : labour 's justice spokesman sadqid khan , said the european courts were having too much influence in the uk . labour finally admitted yesterday that its controversial human rights act has left britain 's courts ` dancing to the tune of strasbourg ' . after years of doggedly defending the legislation , shadow justice secretary sadiq khan admitted the need for significant changes . in future , he said , britain 's own supreme court should normally be given the final say in appeals instead of the remote european court of human rights . mr khan added that british judges would no longer have to obey every edict although they would still have to consider rulings by the court in strasbourg . the intervention was seen as a blatant attempt to snatch votes from the conservatives , who are poised to unveil long-awaited reforms to human rights laws . tory mps said mr khan 's comments amounted to the first admission by labour that the act had caused mayhem . dominic raab , who has campaigned for reform , said : ` after years of denial , labour admit their human rights act has skewed our justice system . ` frankly , they should be on their knees apologising to the british public for the damage done . ' labour was in power in 1998 when the hra was passed , enshrining the european convention on human rights into british law . since then , the measure has been blamed for blocking the deportation of countless illegal immigrants and foreign criminals as judges have slavishly adhered to strasbourg case law . mr khan said this had not been the original intention . he pledged that a future labour government would issue new guidance to stop ` the sovereignty of our courts and the will of parliament ' being called into question . ` i want british courts to be clear that they do n't have to dance to the tune of strasbourg , ' he said . ` that 's not what was intended when the legislation was drafted and debated in parliament in 1998 . ` it 's not good for our own domestic system of justice to be totally bound by what goes on at the european court of human rights . too often , rather than  taking into account  strasbourg rulings and finding their own way , our courts have acted as if these rulings were binding on their decisions . ' under . the plan , people would still be able to take their appeal cases to . strasbourg but british courts would be able to disagree with what the . echr said . labour admit its action would do nothing to resolve the thorny issue of strasbourg 's ruling that prisoners should have the vote . officials said the case , which dates back to 2005 , is ` too far down the line ' . mr khan insisted that the party 's plans did not alter ` labour 's unswerving support for the human rights act ' . justice secretary chris grayling said : ` this is just gesture politics and will do nothing to deliver the real change this country needs . ' before mr khan 's admission in an article in the daily telegraph , shadow ministers had repeatedly defended the legislation . in 2011 , mr khan said : ` the act is the most significant defence for ordinary people against state power ever passed into law . ` when tory ministers blame the act , it 's usually an excuse not to sort out the problem or a cover for their own failing policies . ' as justice secretary in 2008 , jack straw said he could understand public concerns but blamed a few ` nervous ' judges . yesterday , the mail reported the latest controversial judgment made under the act 's article 8 , the right to a family life . judges ruled a nurse from ghana who force-fed her baby to death can not be deported after serving her three-year sentence . ministers have vowed to appeal . review : harriet harman suggested that licence fee alternatives should be looked at . alternatives to the licence fee should be examined when the bbc 's charter is renewed in 2016 , said harriet harman yesterday . the comments of labour 's deputy leader are the first sign of possible cross-party support for an end to the # 145.50 annual charge . miss harman , who is also shadow culture secretary , said : ` the licence fee is a means to an end , it 's not an end to itself . ` it 's not easy to see what would be better but that does n't mean it should n't be looked at . ` what we are not up for is a kind of ideological attack on the bbc because it is a public sector broadcaster . ' in an interview with total politics magazine , she also urged culture secretary sajid javid to appoint a bbc trust chairman to replace lord patten on an impartial basis . earlier , writer armando iannucci suggested the bbc could become a subscription tv service like sky .", "summary": " justice spokesman sadiq khan said britain should have final say in appeals .   comes after years of doggedly defending the legislation .   mr khan said british judges should not longer have to obey every ruling .   though he said the courts should still ` take into account ' eu law .
