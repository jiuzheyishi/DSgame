{"text": "pet hate : radio 2 presenter sir terry wogan bemoans his lack of ability to open a tin of sardines on bbc1 's room 101 . his wry observations on the absurdities and dilemmas encountered in life helped to turn sir terry wogan into a household name . now the 74 year old broadcaster has turned his attention to the daily battle his generation faces with difficult packaging . from the sardine tin that wo n't open to the toothpaste enclosed in fortress-like plastic , sir terry does not hold back from voicing his frustration in the new series of bbc1 's room 101 . discussing his pet hates with host frank skinner , sir terry said : ` it 's food packaging in particular -- with sardines or pilchards in a tin you put your finger in the ring thing , dislocate your finger and break your nails . ` then the damn thing comes away and you 've got to get a tin opener anyway , all for a sardine . ` then there are those bottles where you have to press down the top before you can open them ... ' and the kitchen is n't the only place in the house sir terry faces the perils of packaging . he continued : ` taking things further it becomes very difficult to open things when you get to my distinguished age . ` has anyone tried to break into a toothbrush lately ? ` you 're in the bathroom and you think , ` i 'll restore my dentures to their pristine glory ' . i 've got a new toothbrush here but can i open it ? ' during the programme , which will be broadcast later this month -lrb- jan 11 -rrb- , mr skinner is far from sympathetic to sir terry 's plight , telling him : ` it 's made me realise why old people get up so early . ' with a career spanning five decades in showbusiness , sir terry has no designs to settle into retirement . earlier this year he presented seven hours of live tv for the bbc 's annual children in need appeal and still has his own radio 2 show weekend wogan . bugbear : one of sir terry 's pet hates is opening a tin of sardines . sir terry , who was knighted by the queen in 2005 , has been married to his ex-model wife , helen for 47 years and they have two sons and a daughter : alan , 45 , mark 42 , and katherine , 40 . his rant on packaging comes just weeks after he urged diners to protest at the food provided by some five star establishments . long-running show : bbc1 's room 101 host frank skinner listened to sir terry wogan 's pet hates . recalling a recent lord 's taverners lunch at grosvenor house , he described the turkey as ` an indefinable lump of rolled white meat that could have been anything ' . ` it was , ' he tells me , ` served with sprouts like bullets , soggy potatoes and a bread sauce that would have been at home on a plasterer 's tray . ' and the irish-born broadcaster did n't spare other multi-starred establishments . ` i went to a saints and sinners lunch at the savoy recently and the turkey was unbelievable , ' ` they churn out this stuff at christmas and nobody ever complains . ` they are afraid to make a scene . ` nobody ever thinks :  we 'd better improve our standards .  according to the latest research , more rubbish goes to landfill in britain than in any other european country . with items such as shrink-wrapped coconuts and single bananas sold in plastic trays . the law on excess packaging was introduced in 1999 and appears to offer a simple route to outlawing waste . it says packaging should be limited to ` the minimum adequate amount ' to ensure safety and hygiene . however , just a handful of companies have been prosecuted , while the maximum fine is just # 5,000 .", "summary": " sir terry wogan , 74 , discusses his pet hates on bbc1 show room 101 .   he tells host frank skinner that he struggles with modern packaging .
