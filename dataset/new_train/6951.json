{"text": "researchers have solved the mystery of how massive lakes in the western united states were formed . lakes were able to grow large -- rivaling the great lakes -- during the peak of the last ice age 21,000 years ago , a period known as the ` last glacial maximum , ' the key , researchers discovered , was that evaporation rates were significantly lower than today . during the last glacial maximum , large lakes -lrb- light blue -rrb- covered many of the now dry desert basins of nevada , oregon and california . at the height of the lgm , lake surprise had a surface area of about 390 square miles , roughly the size of san francisco bay . during the last glacial maximum -lrb- lgm -rrb- , giant lakes covered large sections of california , nevada , oregon and utah , including where salt lake city is today . scientists have long been puzzled by how these ancient lakes , now completely dry , grew so large . the prevailing theory was there was more rain and snowfall during this time period . but recent evidence from paleoecology and climate model simulations indicates that precipitation rates were actually relatively low compared to later periods . ` it was previously thought that the lakes grew because there was more rain and snowfall during this period of the earth 's history , ' said daniel ibarra , a graduate student in stanford 's department of environmental earth system science and the first author of the study . during the last glacial maximum -lrb- lgm -rrb- , giant lakes covered large sections of california , nevada , oregon and utah , including where salt lake city is today . earth scientists have long been puzzled by how these ancient lakes , now completely dry , grew so large . the prevailing theory was there was more rain and snowfall during this time period . but recent evidence from paleoecology and climate model simulations indicates that precipitation rates were actually relatively low compared to later periods . to resolve the discrepancy between computer models and the interpretation of geologic evidence , ibarra collected more than 80 samples of tufa -- a limestone created by the evaporation of mineralized water -- from different locations around the edges of lake surprise , a moderate-sized fossil lake in surprise valley , california . the layered shorelines of california 's lake surprise date back to the peak of the last ice age and provide a record of lake level changes over thousands of years . the layered shorelines of california 's lake surprise date back to the peak of the last ice age and provide a record of lake level changes over thousands of years . their findings showed that at the height of the lgm , lake surprise had a surface area of about 390 square miles , roughly the size of san francisco bay . their analyses revealed that 21,000 years ago , the evaporation rate at lake surprise was nearly 40 percent lower than today , with precipitation rates similar to the modern era . more quantitative studies of past climate could help refine the computer models used by the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- to simulate earth 's atmospheric conditions under changing atmospheric conditions , said kate maher , assistant professor of geological and environmental sciences , who headed the project . ` the ipcc uses climate models to simulate past and future climate , so knowing that some of the models do a better job of simulating past changes gives us more confidence that we understand the physics involved , ' maher said . ` that can give us more confidence in the models we use to simulate future climate change .
