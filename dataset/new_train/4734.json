{"text": " uncle  hammad , a local bedouin camel farmer is staring at me as though i 've offended him . i 'm midway through a luxurious sand safari exploring the deserts of dubai , and hammad has been chatting to me over a traditional emirati breakfast of cardamom-scented crepes slathered in date honey . i 've asked him how he 's been affected by dubai 's transformation from desert outpost to international city in the space of 25 years , and now i 'm bracing myself for a lecture on the blight of modernity and how materialists like me are tainting his land .  my grandfather had a tent and a camel ...  he pauses and raises his graying eyebrows at me , then his face crinkles into a sun-beaten smile .  and i have a five-bedroom villa with ac , and a race horse ! do you think i do n't like that ?  turns out he 's a happy man . dubai 's bedouin are no longer dusty nomads searching for a home -- they 're now a part of the emirate 's modern landscape of glamorous golf estates , tall towers , shopping malls and theme parks . despite appearances , their history and natural culture can still be explored , as i discovered a day earlier when i joined the platinum heritage safari team at the edge of the dubai conservation reserve . pristine desert . the platinum part of this safari refers to the reserve , dubai 's most pristine desert , but could also refer to the five-star treatment we receive while exploring it . the heritage ? open-top land rovers from the 1950s , bumblebee yellow or racing green , older than the unified country they 're driving across , wheels like concrete , sounding like lawn mowers . before we set off , sharaf , our egyptian mirror aviator-shaded driver , brought out some black and white keffiye headscarves . as we wrapped ourselves under instruction , i cringed on the inside -- who does n't feel like a charlatan in another culture 's national dress ? -- but soon found out how necessary they were . when the cars pick up speed they throw up sand and the tail of the headscarf can be pulled over to give faces protection from the grit . there was to be no  dune bashing  on this trip , explained sharaf . apart from the obvious incompatibility with these classic cars , it can be devastating to the desert eco-system . it kills off sensitive environments for animals living under ground , which make up 95 % of the land fauna found in the natural areas of dubai . we weaved gently over dunes and stopped at various points for photographs . in some , the sands were golden , bare and desolate , scattered with the bones of petrified trees , disappearing in waves to the horizon . in other areas sands were tawny , shaded by giant ghaf trees and arabian gums , with scrub protecting the tiny animals dwelling there . aerial acrobatics . at one meager watering hole , delicate gazelles and lumbering oryx waited on the perimeter . they were n't camera shy , but they would n't return until we left . later we were driven to a higher point where carpets were arranged on the sand before a natural amphitheater . falcons waited on a roost , hooded but untethered . dewa the peregrine -lrb- named after the local power company whose lines this lazy bird likes to sit on -rrb- and wasp , a barbary falcon , put on a show with their trainer as the sun disappeared over the city lights of distant dubai . the birds never touched us , but beat our heads with bursts of air as they swooped close enough to make us squeal . at dusk we entered our camp for the night -- a stone-ringed compound established by sheikh butti al maktoum , and provided to platinum heritage on the proviso that they provide a genuine insight to emirati culture . we talked with the few other passengers and drivers over dates and gahwa -lrb- arabic coffee -rrb- , before the ouzi -lrb- spiced , whole roasted lamb -rrb- was brought from its charcoal pit . in desert silence we ate traditional food , delicious and exotic -- even to me , a longtime resident of dubai . as lgeimats -lrb- addictive little emirati donuts -rrb- were brought out , we were entertained with traditional khaleeji dances in which women sway their long , black hair , and yolas , in which men tap rhythms with camel canes . we smoked shisha seated on rugs around a bonfire until the desert chill sent us to bed in our camelhair tent nearthe platinum heritage experience is different from many desert safaris on offer . the others range in the details and intensity , but the formula is usually the same -- pickup in a white land cruiser , travel in convoy to the edge of the desert where tires are deflated for traction in the sand . drivers proceed to scare the wits out of tourists by throwing the cars over dunes in a way i 'm sure toyota would revoke their warranties for . i once took a gopro camera on one of these drives . all the footage i got was sand and sky , glimpses of the interior of the car and howls of a freaked out scotswoman in the back seat , a broken record of  no , no , no , no , no , no , nooooooo !  punctuated by an occasional squeak or the sound of someone gagging . some of these safaris then round off the terror with disappointment -- an evening in a fenced compound filled with camels and quad bikes , a low quality buffet , beers and a belly dancer from russia . i 've been on too many of these , not realizing what i was really missing out on until now . the morning brings both sunshine and a clear head . the cold breeze of the night has cleaned the sands , leaving only the prints of mystery desert fauna . hammad laughs and chatters as if we 're family , welcoming us into a culture that remains hidden for so many visitors to the uae . he shows us that it 's there for anyone to find , they just need to know where to look . how to explore the sands . platinum heritage offers a range of safari options , including the vintage land rover tours , private night safaris , dinner safaris , camel safaris , wildlife drives and bedouin breakfasts and falconry experiences . if dune bashing and belly dancing are more your thing , arabian adventures is the largest operator . there are others . those who prefer to do the driving themselves should get in touch with off road zone , which runs half-day desert driving courses . al maha resort offers the nature without the adventure , but with a whole lot of luxury . the resort is connected to the dubai conservation reserve and has gazelles and oryx wandering free within its grounds . prices start at about 6,000 aed -lrb- $ 1,600 -rrb- per room per night .", "summary": " vintage land rover safaris explore the delicate sand dunes of dubai .   platinum heritage organizes luxury excursions into the traditional world of the emirate 's bedouin .   retro safaris offer a gentler way of experiencing the area 's wildlife that so-called  dune bashing  excursions .
