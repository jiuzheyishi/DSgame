{"text": "penn state university will be hit with fines in excess of $ 30 million as part of  significant , unprecedented penalties  expected to be announced monday by the national collegiate athletic association , a source familiar with the case told cnn on sunday . while the school 's football program will not face the so-called  death penalty  that would have prevented the team from playing in the fall , the school might have preferred a one-year suspension because of the severity of the scholarship losses , postseason sanctions and other penalties , the source said .  if i were penn state or any other school and were given both options , i 'd pick the death penalty ,  the source said , adding the range of sanctions  is well beyond what has been done in the past  and  far worse than closing the program for a year .  the expected punishment is part of the continued fallout from the child sex abuse scandal involving former assistant football coach jerry sandusky , who was convicted in late june of 45 of the 48 counts he faced involving 10 young victims . the news came the same day the statue of penn state 's iconic head football coach joe paterno was removed from outside the campus stadium . ireporter : this is an end of an era . the ncaa 's punishments follow an independent investigation led by former fbi director louis freeh , whose report held four top penn state officials , including paterno , responsible for failing to stop the abuse . everything the ncaa  needed to know was detailed in the freeh report ,  according to the source . monday in indianapolis , the ncaa plans a press conference  to announce ncaa corrective and punitive measures for the pennsylvania state university ,  it said in a statement . the ncaa last imposed the so-called  death penalty  to a football team in 1987 against southern methodist university 's program in the wake of a payments-to-athletes scandal . the source says the sanctions  will really paint a picture that essentially says that leadership failure and systemic failures ca n't be tolerated .  ncaa president mark emmert wrote a letter to penn state president rodney erickson in november that included four questions he wanted the university to answer . according to the source , the ncaa felt the questions were answered by the freeh report and therefore it could act before the university responded . the source was n't sure if the university has been made aware of the penalties yet but says the university was not involved in the decision . it was  not a negotiated process ,  the source said . while not divulging specifics , the source said ,  the penalties go well beyond the loss of a scholarship or not being able to go to a bowl game .  the source also said the plan includes provisions to provide  leeway  and  minimize the impact  on current players who had nothing to do with the sandusky scandal . photos : final tributes , paterno statue removed . also sunday , in state college , pennsylvania , the 900-pound bronze statue of paterno was removed . penn state president rodney erickson said in a statement the statue is being stored in a  secure location .  the statue was removed exactly six months after paterno , the winningest coach in division i football history , died of lung cancer . paterno had coached at penn state for 61 years , 15 of them as an assistant . he died less than three months after he coached his last game , an october 29 victory over illinois that gave him a record 409 wins . under paterno 's 46-season tenure as head coach , the nittany lions won two national championships , went undefeated five times , and finished in the top 25 national rankings 35 times . the tribute to the coach , who died in january , had become an object of contention after the child rape scandal involving sandusky . however , paterno 's family said they believe taking down the statue serves no purpose .  tearing down the statue of joe paterno does not serve the victims of jerry sandusky 's horrible crimes or help heal the penn state community . we believe the only way to help the victims is to uncover the full truth ,  the family said in a statement .  it is not the university 's responsibility to defend or protect joe paterno . but they at least should have acknowledged that important legal cases are still pending and that the record on joe paterno , the board and other key players is far from complete ,  it added . dan vecellio , a staff writer for the blog black shoe diaries , said there were about 100 people who watched the statue taken down , put on a forklift and driven into the stadium through a loading-dock door . penn state board member resigns over sandusky scandal . the freeh report found several penn state officials concealed evidence that sandusky had sexually abused minors . freeh concluded that paterno could have prevented further sexual abuse had he taken action .  i now believe that , contrary to its original intention , coach paterno 's statue has become a source of division and an obstacle to healing in our university and beyond ,  erickson said .  i believe that , were it to remain , the statue will be a recurring wound to the multitude of individuals across the nation and beyond who have been the victims of child abuse ,  he added . sunday , penn state employees began placing fencing around the statue , as well as a tarp . local and university police were at the scene , and some students gathered near the football field , beaver stadium . airborne banner : take down paterno statue . another tribute to paterno -- the university library that bears his name -- will remain as it is , erickson said .  the library remains a tribute to joe and sue paterno 's commitment to penn state 's student body and academic success , and it highlights the positive impacts coach paterno had on the university ,  he wrote . the survivors network of those abused by priests -lrb- snap -rrb- called paterno  a powerful man who acted selfishly  who  deserves no public honors whatsoever .   we 're glad the statue is gone but that 's just a tiny step forward ,  snap spokesman david clohessy said in a statement .  we as a society must learn that a good way to deter child sex cover-ups is to punish , not praise , those who instigate such cover-ups .  ncaa not ruling out tough sanctions on penn state football . sandusky is expected to be sentenced in september . his legal team has said it will appeal the convictions . two former university administrators are awaiting trial for their role in the scandal , and more charges are possible as the state 's attorney general investigates what penn state may have known about sandusky 's behavior . opinion : why the paterno statue needs to stay . sculptor of joe paterno
