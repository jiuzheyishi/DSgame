{"text": "scientists have created the most detailed computer simulation of the history of the universe . this new virtual cosmos , designed by u.s. , german and british researchers , comes complete with twisting galaxies , exploding gas clouds and mysterious black . holes . called illustris , the numerical-based model covers the 13 . billion-year evolution of the universe beginning just 12 million years after . the big bang . scroll down for video ... scientists have created the most detailed computer simulation of the history of the universe . . pictured is the cosmic web from 1 to 4 billion years after the big bang . the simulation , which accurately depicts the distribution . and composition of various types of galaxies , was developed by a team led it covers cosmic evolution in a cube with a side length 350 million light-years with unprecedented resolution . ` until now , no single simulation was able to reproduce the . universe on both large and small scales simultaneously , ' said professor . vogelsberger . previous attempts to simulate the universe were hampered by . lack of computing power and the complexities of the underlying physics . the model recreates structures like galaxy clusters and the bubbles and voids of the cosmic web . shown here the varying gas temperatures of the universe as it evolves . this image shows dark matter density , left , transitioning to gas density , right , in a simulation of the evolution of the universe since the big bang . the new computer simulation has reproduced features such as galaxy distribution and composition more accurately than previous models . the simulation covers cosmic evolution in a cube with a side length 350 million light-years with unprecedented resolution . this animation reveals the galaxies dark matter and gas temperature within this cube . illustris was developed by a team led by astrophysicist mark vogelsberger of massachusetts institute of technology . the numerical model covers the 13-billion-year evolution of the universe beginning just 12-million years after the big bang . the illustris creators say it represents ' a significant step forward in modelling galaxy formation . ' they attribute its success to advanced computer power . the team dedicated five years to developing the illustris . program . the actual calculations took 3 months of ` run time , ' using a total of . 8,000 computer processing units running in parallel . as a result those programs either were limited in . resolution , or forced to focus on a small portion of the universe . earlier simulations also had trouble modelling complex . feedback from star formation , supernova explosions , and supermassive black . holes . the team dedicated five years to developing the illustris . program . the actual calculations took 3 months of ` run time , ' using a total of . 8,000 computer processing units running in parallel . if they had used an average desktop computer , the . calculations would have taken more than 2,000 years to complete . the computer simulation began a mere 12 million years after . the big bang . when it reached the present day , astronomers counted more than . 41,000 galaxies in the cube of simulated space . importantly , illustris yielded a realistic mix of spiral . galaxies like the milky way and football-shaped elliptical galaxies . it also recreated large-scale structures like galaxy . clusters and the bubbles and voids of the cosmic web . on the small scale , it . accurately recreated the chemistries of individual galaxies . since light travels at a fixed speed , the farther away . astronomers look , the farther back in time they can see . a galaxy one billion light-years away is seen as it was a . billion years ago . telescopes like hubble can give us views of the early . universe by looking to greater distances . however , astronomers ca n't use hubble . to follow the evolution of a single galaxy over time . ` illustris is like a time machine . we can go forward and . backward in time , ' said co-author shy genel . ` we can pause the simulation and zoom into a single galaxy . or galaxy cluster to see what 's really going on . ' the numerical model covers the 13-billion-year evolution of the universe beginning just 12-million years after the big bang . in this image , dark matter density is overlaid with the gas velocity field in a simulation of the evolution of the universe . the team dedicated five years to developing the illustris program . the actual calculations took 3 months of ` run time ' using a total of 8,000 computer processing units running in parallel . this image shows light distribution of a massive cluster of galaxies . pictured are a cluster of galaxies . previous attempts have broadly reproduced the web of galaxies , but failed to create mixed populations of galaxies or predict gas and metal content .", "summary": " illustris was developed over 5 years by a team led by mark vogelsberger of massachusetts institute of technology .   the numerical-based model covers the evolution of the universe beginning just 12 million years after the big bang .   it recreates galaxy .   clusters , bubbles and voids of the cosmic web . on the small scale , it can recreate galaxies .   the calculations took 3 months of ` run time , ' using a total of .   8,000 computer processing units running in parallel .
