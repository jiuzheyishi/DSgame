{"text": "sorry , america : support for emergency care patients barely receives a passing grade and needs extra help , according to a new report . the american college of emergency physicians , a national medical specialty society , issued a  report card  assessing the country 's emergency medical services . as a whole , the united states got a measly d-plus .  this report card is saying : the nation 's policies are failing to support emergency patients ,  alexander rosenau , president of the american college of emergency physicians , said thursday . the report does not single out any physicians or hospitals but shows how well states and the federal government are doing in terms of supporting emergency care , said dr. jon mark hirshon , an emergency physician at the university of maryland and board member of the american college of emergency physicians . categories included access to care and disaster preparedness , among others . the country 's emergency care environment has actually worsened since 2009 , the last time the organization graded the united states on support for emergency care . five years ago , the nation received a c-minus . the american college of emergency physicians used 136 measures for grading the states . the report card rated some categories in 2014 as better than others , nationwide . quality and patient safety environment got a c ; so did public health and injury prevention , and disaster preparedness . the medical liability environment got a c-minus . but access to emergency care scored a dismal d-minus .  if i 'm in a car crash and they bring me to hospital that 's not ready for me , my chances of survival are less ,  hirshon said .  so you want a state that has that type of trauma system . and when you look at patient safety , that 's one of the components of patient safety .  medical liability environment affects your ability to access a specialist in an emergency , hirshon said . appropriate physicians may not be available because they are afraid of being on call for patients they do n't know for liability reasons , he said . there have also been trends of physicians migrating from states with high-liability insurance premiums to others where it is not such an issue , such as texas , rosenau said . winners and losers by state . in a state-by-state breakdown , grading the 50 states and the district of columbia on these parameters , the report card found that the district of columbia leads in emergency care support , with a grade of b-minus . massachusetts , maine and nebraska ranked second , third and fourth , respectively , also getting b-minus . colorado squeezed into fifth place with a c-plus . at the bottom of the list : wyoming got an outright f. arkansas got a d-minus ; new mexico , montana and kentucky came out with ds . access to emergency care was particularly lacking across many states , the report card said . in this category , 21 states received an f . at the front of the class in this category , with as and bs , were the district of columbia , pennsylvania , ohio , massachusetts and maine .  you can have the best medicine in the world , but it wo n't matter if people ca n't get to it ,  hirshon said . medical liability was good enough in colorado , idaho , kansas and texas to score those states as , but 10 states got fs . three states got as for policies that support patient safety : maryland , pennsylvania , utah and north carolina . but 10 states got fs in this category . for public health and injury prevention , hawaii , massachusetts , maine , minnesota , oregon , utah and washington got as . but 28 states got ds or fs . disaster preparedness was also a big problem , with nearly half of all states receiving ds or fs . on the flip side , the district of columbia and north dakota aced this category . supply is down , demand is up . the report also highlighted that there were 130 million emergency department visits , or 247 visits per minute , in 2010 , and there were 37.9 million visits related to injury , according to the cdc 's national hospital ambulatory medical care survey : 2010 emergency department summary -lrb- pdf -rrb- . from 1995 to 2010 , there was a 34 % increase in emergency department visits , according to cdc 's data . during this same time period , the supply of emergency departments went down by 11 % . the number of patients visiting emergency departments is likely to increase as baby boomers age and develop more medical problems . and the report projects that with the affordable care act going into effect , millions of people who ca n't find physicians who accept their insurance , and who were added to medicaid , will also seek emergency care . a recent study in science suggested that medicaid increases the use of emergency departments .  we 'll be asked to do more with less resources , which has the potential to impact emergency patients ,  hirshon said . the report card did not include free-standing emergency departments , as they are new entities and need to be better understood , hirshon said . what can be done ? the affordable care act calls for a work force commission to examine shortages of physicians and nurses , and the american college of emergency physicians wants to see that funded . graduate medical education funding should also be expanded , hirshon said . the physicians group would also like to see enhancements of the emergency care coordination center in washington to help with disaster response . improvements have been made since the 2009 report card ; one state started a new trauma system , while another enhanced medical liability laws .  we know that in every single category , there was one state that was able to garner an a on this report card ,  rosenau said . those are examples for other states unhappy with their grade , he said .", "summary": " the american college of emergency physicians graded states .   the u.s. 's previous grade was a c-minus in 2009 .   report says district of columbia leads in emergency care environment . "}
