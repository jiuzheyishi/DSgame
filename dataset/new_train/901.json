{"text": "ministers issued a dramatic confession yesterday that prisoners were tortured and sexually abused under british colonial rule in kenya . it is believed to be the first time the government has made such a public declaration that atrocities were carried out ` at the hands of the colonial administration ' . the admission came via a whitehall lawyer addressing three elderly kenyans who had gone to the high court in london to demand damages and an apology . our ordeal in detention camps : three mau mau survivors tell their horrific stories . now in their 80s , one of them told the court how he had been brutally castrated in a british detention camp during the mau mau rebellion -- britain 's bloodiest colonial war . if the trio win their case , it would open the door to up to 20,000 kenyan survivors of the mau mau purge to sue britain for millions of pounds , using no-win , no-fee lawyers . the foreign office is contesting the case because it officially denies liability and maintains the kenyans have left it too late to make claims . yesterday , each of the three claimants walked slowly to the witness stand to deliver their graphic testimony . but before guy mansfield , the foreign office 's qc , cross-examined them , he said : ` i wish to make it clear that the british government does not dispute that each of you suffered torture and other ill-treatment at the hands of the colonial administration . ' seeking damages : four mau mau survivors who are suing the british government over allegations they were tortured during uprisings in kenya in the 1950s and 1960s . turning to paulo nzili , 85 , who was castrated with a pair of pliers , he said : ` i do not dispute with mr nzili that terrible things happened to him . ' last night martyn day , senior partner at leigh day & co , said : ` our clients are very pleased that the government has accepted that they were tortured . ' the mau mau uprising began in 1952 to end british colonial rule . britain initially dismissed reports of unrest , but later declared a state of emergency -- introducing the death penalty for mau mau members . the violence ended in 1956 , but the state of emergency was only revoked in 1960 . the then colonial secretary , alan lennox-boyd , offered to resign over british troops ' actions during the rebellion . he was persuaded to stay in office by harold macmillan . atrocities : a british guard in a mau mau camp in 1953 . one survivor has told how he was brutally castrated in a detention camp during the rebellion . in july 1959 , enoch powell attacked government policy over the mau mau . speaking about the hola camp , where 11 mau mau were killed after refusing to work , mr powell noted that some mps had described the 11 as ` sub-human ' . he told mps : ` i would say that it is a fearful doctrine , to stand in judgment on a fellow human being and to say ,  because he was such-and-such , therefore the consequences which would otherwise flow from his death shall not flow  . ' a year ago , the three kenyans were told by mr justice mccombe that they had ` arguable cases in law ' . he will now decide if a fair trial is possible . the government says it is not . mr mansfield said the foreign office faced ` irredeemable difficulties ' defending itself because key witnesses had died . in a written submission , the fo declared : ` after so long , it is simply impossible . ' last night a fo spokesman said : ` we understand the pain and grievance felt by those on all sides in the bloody events of the kenya emergency period in kenya . '", "summary": " thought to be first public declaration by government that brutality occurred .   admission comes as three elderly kenyans seeks damages in the high court .   could open floodgates for thousands of survivors to sue britain for millions .
