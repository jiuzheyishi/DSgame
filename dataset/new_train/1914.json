{"text": "a wartime codebreaker has revealed she and her co-workers at bletchley park dried their bras and knickers on hitler 's enigma machine during night shifts at the cypher school . elizabeth ` betty ' balfour , 88 , joined the wrens when she was 17 and was handpicked to work on the top secret team under code genius alan turing . she said women at the chilly school would dry their damp underpants on the huge computers linked to the seized enigma machine as they were the only source of heat at night . her saucy secret comes days before the november 14 general release of the imitation game film , which stars benedict cumberbatch as turing . left , elizabeth ` betty ' balfour pictured as a 17-year-old when she started work codebreaking at bletchley park , and right , as a 88-year-old . she has now revealed some of the secrets on the wrens . mrs balfour said : ` one thing i remember was that during night shifts the enigma machine was the only warm thing about , so we used to wash our smalls and hang them around it to dry . ` it used to be festooned with bras and pants all through our night duty . back then it must have looked a real sight . ' her father had to give his permission for her join the wrens in 1944 because she was under 18 . she spent six weeks training in london before being assigned to ` special duties x ' and posted to the secret facility near milton keynes , buckinghamshire . she spent up to 10 hours a day sifting through reams of code and said they were never told where their work had actually succeeded . the women were even forbidden from talking to each other about their individuals parts of the puzzle . here mrs balfour is pictured with a group of friends at bletchley park , where she and her fellow wrens would laugh when they spotted alan turing walking across the grounds backwards while reading books . mrs balfour , pictured left and right in 1944 while she was based at bletchley park at a 17-year-old , signed up for the wrens in the hope of finding adventure . mrs balfour said : ` we were given long strips of paper tape made by the enigma machine and told to divide everything into fives . ` we used to get codes for the day , one i can remember is yo-se-ro , a japanese code for man . there were so many of them i ca n't remember , but i 've always remembered that one . ` none of us knew everything that we were working on . we each knew a bit , our own part of the puzzle , so if you were caught , you could n't tell them everything , even if they tortured you . ` we were told never to discuss with anyone else what we were doing . ` we never knew anything . we never knew what we had done , or if we had helped to actually crack the codes . ' i never even told my parents because we signed the official secrets act , so they died without ever finding out what i was doing . ' mrs balfour -lrb- pictured -rrb- said alan turing should be formally recognised for his code breaking work . here she is pictured with awards she received thanking her for her service . earlier this year mrs balfour returned to visit bletchley park as an 88-year-old -lrb- pictured -rrb- . she spent 18 months at the grounds breaking codes during the second world war . mrs balfour , from helensburgh , scotland , said she and her fellow wrens would see turing walking about the grounds - often backwards as he read a book . she said : ` we used to see alan turing from time to time , and back then we used to giggle and laugh . ` we used to watch him walk backwards sometimes while reading a book , and we could n't help but giggle at him for how he acted . she explained they all though he was strange - but a genius . ' i feel the government should formally recognise him for his work during the war . he did so much and his name has not yet appeared anywhere really . it 's too late for him now , but people should know what he did . ` he was pushed into the background , but all these people with these brilliant minds were a bit different in their own way . ' mathematical genius alan turing 's invention helped save countless allied lives . the enigma was a machine developed by the germans which enabled them to send official military and strategic communications in scrambled code . using a complicated system of rotors , the machine would encode messages before sending them via morse code to another machine . if the receiving machine had been programmed with the same settings - one of 158 million million million combinations - the message would be deciphered . however the team of cryptologists , linguists , scientists and data analysts at bletchley , in buckinghamshire , led by londoner turing , were able to break it . it was thwarted in part thanks to alan turing 's ` bombe ' device , which was able to speed up the code-breaking process immeasurably . turing based his invention on a polish device , the ` bomba ' , which was handed over to britain just weeks before poland was invaded in 1939 . as winston churchill himself made clear , the accurate information which flowed from bletchley park every day , at a rate which sometimes reached 6,000 messages a day , saved lives and gave britain a crucial edge in battle .", "summary": " elizabeth ` betty ' balfour said bletchley park was freezing cold at night .   the women in the team resorted to drying their bras and pants on enigma .   she said it was ` festooned with bras and pants all through our night duty '   mrs balfour worked in bletchley park with alan turing .   she said he was often spotted walked backwards while reading a book .   movie based on alan turing and the codebreakers to be released friday .
