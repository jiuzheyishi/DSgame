{"text": "polar ice sheets are now melting three times faster than they did in the 1990s , a ` definitive ' study of satellite data has found . the amount of ice lost from greenland and antarctica is enough to raise world sea levels by almost one millimetre a year . since 1992 , it has added more than 1cm to global sea levels - contributing around a fifth of the total rise . about two thirds of the ice loss was from greenland and the remainder from antarctica , said scientists . scroll down for video . slippery slope : the image , taken in july , shows melt water rushing along the surface of the greenland ice sheet . a 60-foot-deep canyon has been carved out of this greenland glacier over the course of several years by turbulent water overflow from a large melt lake . until now , there has been confusion over what is happening to the ice sheets in a warming world . estimates have differed greatly , with some studies even suggesting gains rather than losses . the new survey is said to be the most accurate assessment to date , ending 20 years of uncertainty.it confirms that , with the exception of east antarctica , both land masses are losing ice . but big differences in the pace of change were seen at each pole . the new research concludes that . antarctica is melting , but points to the smaller ice sheet in greenland , . which covers most of the island , as the bigger and more pressing issue . its melt rate has grown from about 55 billion tons a year in the 1990s . to almost 290 billion tons a year recently , according to the study . ` greenland is really taking off , ' said national snow and ice data center scientist ted scambos , a . co-author of the paper released thursday by the journal science . one of the biggest wild cards in . climate change has been figuring out how much the melting of the massive . sheets of ice at the two poles would add to the seas . study leader professor andrew shepherd , from the university of leeds , said : ` the success of this venture is due to the co-operation of the international scientific community , and due to the provision of precise satellite sensors by our space agencies . an iceberg in or just outside the ilulissat fjord , that likely broke off from jakobshavn isbrae , the fastest glacier in west greenland . ` without these efforts , we would not be in a position to tell people with confidence how the earth 's ice sheets have changed , and to end the uncertainty that has existed for many years . ' scientists blame man-made global . warming for the melting . burning fossil fuels , such as coal and oil , . emits carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that trap heat , warming . the atmosphere and oceans . bit-by-bit , that erodes the ice sheets from . above and below . snowfall replenishes the ice sheets , but has n't kept . pace with the rate of melting . because the world 's oceans are so . big , it takes a lot of ice melting - about 10 trillion tons - to raise . sea levels 1 inch -lrb- 2.5 centimeters -rrb- . since 1992 , ice sheets at the poles . have lost nearly 5 trillion tons of ice , the study says , raising sea . levels by about a half inch . that seemingly tiny extra bit . probably worsened the flooding from an already devastating superstorm . sandy last month , said nasa ice scientist erik ivins , another co-author . of the study . he said the extra weight gives each wave a little more . energy . ` the more energy there is in a wave , the further the water can get inland , ' ivins said . globally , the world 's oceans rose about half a foot -lrb- 15 centimeters -rrb- on average in the 20th century . melting ice sheets accounts for about . one-fifth of sea level rise . warmer water expands , contributing to the . rise along with water from melting glaciers outside the polar regions . the scientists matched results from 10 satellite observations employing three separate techniques to spot changes on the earth . the aim was to reconcile differences between earlier studies . care was taken to compare similar geographical regions , time periods , and models of ice sheet behaviour . back in july this composite was released of nasa images showing the extent of surface melt on greenland 's ice sheet on july 8 -lrb- left -rrb- and july 12 -lrb- right -rrb- . rates of ice loss were calculated for greenland , east antarctica , west antarctica and the antarctic peninsula . although east antarctica showed a net increase in ice mass , this was not enough to compensate for larger losses elsewhere . the research is published today in the journal science . commenting on the findings , professor richard alley , a us climate scientist at pennsylvania state university , said : ` this project is a spectacular achievement . the data will support essential testing of predictive models , and will lead to a better understanding of how sea-level change may depend on the human decisions that influence global temperatures . ' the vast polar ice sheets lock up unimaginable amounts of water . the antarctic ice sheet contains 30 million cubic kilometres of ice and holds around 90 % of all the fresh water on the surface of the earth . if the whole antarctic ice sheet melted , sea levels would rise by more than 60 metres . the greenland ice sheet is much smaller , but would add seven metres to sea levels if it all melted away . just how much ice is melting at the two poles has been difficult for scientists to answer . in 2007 , the intergovernmental panel on climate change did not include ice sheet melt in its calculations of future sea level rise because numbers were so uncertain . nasa chief scientist waleed abdalati , one of the few top ice researchers who was n't part of the study , praised the work . ` understanding how and why the ice sheets are changing today better equips us for understanding and predicting how much and in what ways they will change in the future , ' he said .", "summary": " the amount of ice now lost from greenland and antarctica is enough to raise world sea levels by almost 1mm every year .
