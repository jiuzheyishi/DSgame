{"text": "atlanta , georgia a passenger on the air canada flight in which a young asian man boarded disguised as an elderly man says she tried to warn the crew about the mask but was rebuffed . nuray kurtur-balas said she approached three flight attendants before take-off from hong kong , but nothing was done .  i thought he was going to harm the plane ,  kurtur-balas , 35 , told cnn .  i kept my iphone in my pocket to call my family if something happened .  officials said the man apparently boarded the plane wearing the mask and removed the disguise during a trip to the plane 's restroom while it was in flight . in a statement e-mailed to cnn , air canada spokesman peter fitzgerald said ,  our crew took the necessary measures in-flight to ensure that cbsa -lrb- canada border services agency -rrb- authorities met the aircraft at the gate upon landing .  kurtur-balas , a clothing retail production manager , contacted cnn after reading an article about the incident and provided a copy of her boarding pass to confirm she was on the flight . the incident was so bizarre that when she returned home and told her husband what happened , he did n't believe her .  he said , ` you are watching too much ` csi ' and ` criminal minds , '  she said . the incident happened on october 29 , which coincidentally , was her 35th birthday . the asian man in his early 20s boarded the air canada flight from hong kong wearing an elaborate silicone mask of an elderly man , according to an alert from the canada border services agency . after the plane landed in vancouver , he was questioned by officers from the agency . the man requested refugee protection and admitted that he boarded the flight in the disguise . chuck strahl , the canadian minister of transport , infrastructure and communities , said both canadian authorities and air canada are conducting investigations into the incident .  obviously , we are very concerned about what happened and will be taking whatever steps are necessary to make sure it does n't happen again ,  strahl said . kurtur-balas said she was returning from a business trip in hong kong and first noticed the man when she was walking to the restroom before the flight took off . she said she was 10 rows in front of him . he was sitting in a middle seat near one of the restrooms , she said , and the crew was trying to get him to stand up so another passenger could get to her window seat .  the lady was trying to get to her window seat , but he would n't move ,  kurtur-balas told cnn .  he would n't move or understand what people were saying . two flight attendants were trying to talk to him . i was standing there trying to go to the restroom . finally , he stood up , and he came towards me and i just showed him with my finger where he was supposed to sit .  when she left the restroom , she said , she noticed that he was wearing a mask and that his hands appeared much younger .  it was n't a real person 's skin . it looked plastic ,  she told cnn . i said to the flight attendant , ` did you check out that person 's hands ? they seem like they belong to a 20-year-old kid . there are no wrinkles . ' she said ` good observation . '  after not getting a response , she said she spoke to a second flight attendant .  did you check it out ? i 'm feeling nervous going on this flight ,  she said she told the attendant .  he said ` we 'll look into it , ' then again nobody said anything .  finally , she said , she spoke to a third flight attendant before the plane departed hong kong . the attendant told her the man had not done anything wrong and explained he may have a medical condition .  i was thinking the whole time he was wearing a mask ,  kurtur-balas said .  why would somebody wear a mask if they have a medical issue ?   i was thinking he was going to blow the plane up . i know it sounds crazy , but that 's what i thought ,  she said .  i would n't feel nervous if he was just a guy trying to go to canada and file to become a refugee .  kutur-balas said she kept looking back at the man during the flight , but after several hours , she said his seat was empty and she did n't see him . about half way through the flight , she said attendants seated a young asian man in the empty seat next to her . she said the man was wearing a striped blue shirt . photos of the asian man with and without the disguise were contained in the alert from the canada border services agency about the incident . she said she could not be sure , but it could have been the same man who was moved next to her during the flight .  the flight attendant said this guy 's seat was not working so they sat him right next to me in the middle seat ,  she said . after the plane landed , she did not see the man again . last week , when she was downloading the cnn app for iphone , she read the article about the disguised man .  i said , ` oh my god , this is the guy i saw on the plane . ' my husband said , ` are you serious ? ' i said , ' i told you i was n't crazy .
