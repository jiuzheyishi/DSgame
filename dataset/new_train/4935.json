{"text": "carlos enrique londo単o laughs at the ku klux klan recruitment flier recently left on the driveway of his suburban new york home . it 's unlikely the group would accept him .  i 'm colombian and dark-skinned ,  said londo単o , a painter and construction worker who has lived in hampton bays on long island for 30 years . the flier was tucked into a plastic bag along with a membership application , the address for the kkk national office in north carolina , a list of beliefs and three jolly rancher candies . the packages appear to be part of a wider recruitment effort by the klan across the country , ryan lenz , senior writer for the southern poverty law center , told cnn on saturday . similar fliers have turned up in dozens of u.s. cities over the past six months , lenz said . the splc was founded by civil rights lawyers , and is known for tracking and exposing the activities of such groups . the splc says the ku klux klan is the most infamous and oldest of american hate groups . african-americans have been the main target of the historically violent group , but the klan also has targeted jews , immigrants , gays , lesbians and catholics . the center estimates that there are between 5,000 and 8,000 klan members nationwide , divided among dozens of divergent and warring groups .  since the 1970s the klan has been greatly weakened by internal conflicts , court cases , a seemingly endless series of splits and government infiltration ,  the splc says on its website . the klan 's loyal white knights , the same group touted on the applications sprinkled on front lawns in hampton bays , has started major recruitment efforts , according to lenz . renewed efforts after ferguson shooting , unrest ? lenz suspects the klan may be seizing on a moment when the issues of race and immigration are dominant in the national debate . the group may be seeking to capitalize on growing racial tension to garner support , he said . some klan members even vowed to head to ferguson , missouri , to stand in the solidarity with a white police officer who shot an unarmed black teenager on august 9 , lenz said . the shooting death drew international attention as the st. louis suburb erupted with sometimes violent protests and a heavy-handed police response . calls seeking comment from klan headquarters in pelham , north carolina , were not returned saturday . in new york , the southampton town police said it had contacted the suffolk county police department 's hate crimes unit about the fliers . londo単o said the klan appeared eager to send a message in the predominantly white town .  it seems they want the white community to know that latinos are moving in ,  he said .  people are coming here for the work and that does not sit well with them and they feel intimidated .  hampton bays resident karen fritsch said the fliers included faded-ink  crude -lrb- and -rrb- ridiculous  caricatures that appeared aimed at blacks , latinos and jewish people .  it says , beware , we want your jobs , we want your home and we want your country ,  fritsch said of the message . fritsch said she was shocked when her husband found the small package on her front lawn last week .  it 's terrible that my neighbors had to receive something like that ,  frisch said of the londo単os .  i really want no part of that . why would anyone want to be part of a hate group ?  fliers part of a ` national night ride ' the klan has targeted other cities . in orange , california , just south of angel stadium , residents last month received fliers in sealed plastic bags , according to cnn affiliate ktla . the message on the fliers was  save our land , join the klan  and included a phone number and website in pelham , ktla reported . the group said it was focused on illegal immigration from mexico . the voicemail on the hotline associated with the flier closes with the message :  always remember : if it ai n't white , it ai n't right . white power .  in seneca , south carolina , some residents last month received bags with fliers and candy , cnn affiliate whns reported . the packages directed people to a  klan hotline  number that ended with the same recorded  white power  message , the station reported . robert jones , the  imperial klaliff  of the loyal white knights sect , told whns that the effort was part of the klan 's  national night ride  -- a recruitment event that happens three times a year . jones said recruitment efforts were not aimed at specific people and that residents  should n't be fearful unless they 're doing something that the klan considers morally wrong ,  according to whns . in katy , texas , residents early last month received fliers inviting them to  join the fight to protect u.s. borders ,  according to cnn affiliate kprc . damian neveaux , who is african-american , found a flier and called the number because he , too , was concerned about border security , kprc reported . he reached a klan representative who told him he would not be allowed to join .  ` the only way you can become a member is if you 're 100 percent caucasian ,  neveaux recalled the klan member telling him , according to kprc .  this flier was n't meant for you . '  store defends flag likened to ku klux klan outfit . can this kkk leader rebrand ?", "summary": " ku klux klan recruitment fliers are turning up on driveways across the country .   fliers , usually left with candies , appear to be part of a wider recruitment effort .   the klan may be seizing on a time when race and immigration are dominant issues , some say .
