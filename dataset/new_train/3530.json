' mr starmer accepted thomas 's tweet was ` homophobic ' but said it had been a misguided attempt at humour . the message was also not intended to go beyond his twitter followers , who were mainly friends and family . and he said the message was quickly taken down and the footballer had apologised . prosecutors contacted the two divers and both said they did not want a prosecution . mr starmer said : ` this was , in essence , a one-off offensive twitter message , intended for family and friends , which made its way into the public domain . ` it was not intended to reach mr daley or mr waterfield , it was not part of a campaign , it was not intended to incite others and mr thomas removed it reasonably swiftly and has expressed remorse . ` before reaching a final decision in this case , mr daley and mr waterfield were consulted by the cps and both indicated that they did not think this case needed a prosecution . ' on the same day thomas posted his message , daley was also the subject of trolling by a 17-year-old boy who posted abusive and threatening messages on twitter . teenager reece messer , from weymouth , dorset , was arrested after he tweeted : ` you let your dad down . i hope you know that . ' daley 's father , rob , died of a brain tumour last year . daley , who went on to win bronze in the individual 10m diving competition , retweeted the message to his followers on the site with the comment : ` after giving it my all . . . you get idiots sending me this . ' messer also threatened to ` drown ' the diver but apologised when his messages provoked a storm of outrage . he was later given a police caution for harassment . chief constable andy trotter , of the association of chief police officers , said the new guidance would help police to focus on the most serious online abuse .", "summary": " director of public prosecutions : online trolls who post one-off offensive comments wo n't face charges .   court action will only be taken in cases representing a ` sustained campaign of harassment ' or direct threat .   follows announcement that troll behind homophobic tweet about diver tom daley will escape charges .
