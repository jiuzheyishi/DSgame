{"text": "controversial : brilliant historian gitta sereny 's 1972 book tried to argue that society was to blame for mary bell ¿ s crimes . in sereny ¿ s opinion , the killer was simply the victim of her childhood . four years after 11-year-old mary bell was convicted of killing two small boys -lrb- aged three and four -rrb- , i interviewed her mother betty for bbc tv 's midweek programme in a shabby hotel room in newcastle . she had been persuaded by writer gitta sereny to help promote her book about the killer schoolgirl which was called the case of mary bell . in a hesitant performance , bell 's mother admitted that , as a child , her daughter had witnessed her own sordid lifestyle , which included drug-taking . sereny believed that those awful experiences had contributed to mary 's pathological behaviour . sereny , who has just died at the age of 91 , was understandably pleased with her scoop . the mary bell story had gripped britain in 1968 . during her trial , experts testified that she had shown no remorse or anxiety and shed no tears for her crimes . her lack of emotion and evidence of her previous violence towards babies and animals had staggered the court . it was no surprise that people wanted an explanation as to why a young girl could behave in such a depraved way . step forward the brilliant historian gitta sereny , whose 1972 book tried to argue that society was to blame for mary bell 's crimes . in sereny 's opinion , the killer was simply the victim of her childhood . she recounted bell 's uncorroborated claims that she had been sexually abused by her prostitute mother and her mother 's clients . this led sereny to contend this abuse was irrefutably the cause of bell 's murderous behaviour . such analysis was typical of the growing cult of victimhood , which saw criminals as prisoners of their upbringing who were therefore incapable of making moral judgments . the ` unfortunate ' mary bell had become a monster because of her allegedly terrible childhood . mary bell , pictured , was convicted of horrific child murders . bell 's mother betty admitted that , as a child , her daughter had witnessed her own sordid lifestyle , which included drug-taking . to blame were her teachers , the police , social workers and even her neighbours . according to sereny , everyone bore responsibility except the killer herself . at the time , this view was embraced unquestionably by britain 's increasingly liberal ruling elite . sereny had managed to humanise a monster . this was helped by the confessions of mary bell 's mother and sereny 's description of a rigid legal system and an uncomprehending judge who -- when sentencing bell to ` life in detention ' -- said she was ` dangerous and remained a grave risk to other children ' . later , it was revealed bell had been paid # 50,000 for her collaboration -- bringing a storm of new criticism down on sereny 's head . undaunted , she remained in touch with mary bell throughout her 12 years in prison and at the secret address where -- hiding behind a new identity -- the killer subsequently enjoyed her freedom . sereny 's remarkable skills and her ` pursuit of the truth ' led her to write several other studies of evil . these included gripping biographies of two of hitler 's henchmen , albert speer and franz stangl . as with mary bell , she endeavoured to explain away their monstrous behaviour as the result of circumstances beyond their control . new theory : albert speer , right , was convicted at nuremberg for war crimes . sereny claimed in a novel that his monstrous behaviour was a result of circumstances beyond his control . sereny 's credibility was boosted by the fact she was brought up in vienna and her heavily accented english reminded many of sigmund freud , the father of psychoanalysis . in 1938 , soon after hitler 's occupation of austria , sereny 's family fled to paris . unlike most jewish survivors of the holocaust , she was fascinated by the perpetrators of mass murder . one intriguing aspect of sereny was the way she denied her jewish roots . when she returned to europe from the u.s. after the war in 1945 , she claimed she was a catholic . she angrily denied she was jewish -- a key reason why she had been forced to leave vienna in the first place . the truth is that on the morning of march 16 , 1938 -- alongside my own mother -- she had been physically kicked out of reinhardt 's school by fellow students wearing swastika armbands . sereny was a brave woman but the denial of her jewish past put a question mark over her illustrious career as she sought to understand the state of the minds of the murderers who persecuted her people . similar : sereny ¿ s credibility was boosted by the fact she was brought up in vienna and her heavily accented english reminded many of sigmund freud , the father of psychoanalysis . inspired by a description of adolf eichmann 's trial in jerusalem in 1961 , in which one of an architects of the final solution was described as the embodiment of ` the banality of evil ' , sereny attended the trial in dusseldorf of franz stangl , the commander of two extermination camps -- sobibor and treblinka -- where he organised the murder of 1,250,000 jews . like many nazi murderers , stangl escaped after the war to south america , where he lived until he was exposed . extradited to germany , he was jailed for life . sereny persuaded him to give her a series of interviews for a biography . the fascinating result showed how an intelligent but unremarkable austrian policeman had been inducted into the nazi murder machine . stangl 's inhumanity was encapsulated in his admission that he regarded the hapless people who arrived daily at the death camps by train as ` cargo ' . his horrifying insensitivity and lack of conscience was justified by a monstrous lie : ` it was a matter of my survival . ` what i had to do to get out . ' inspired by the trial of nazi adolf eichmann , pictured , sereny attended the trial in dusseldorf of franz stangl , the commander of two extermination camps . sereny was accused of being more sympathetic to the villain than to his victims -- a criticism that would return years later with her depiction of mary bell . murderers , she argued , were the products of their environment and therefore not totally responsible for their crimes . like mary bell , stangl had lacked the ` freedom to grow : within family , within human society as a whole . ' stangl 's father was a ` dragoner ' -- one of the imperial elite regiments of the german army . he told sereny : ` our lives were run on regimental lines . i was scared to death of him . ' to her credit , she recorded stangl 's post-war confession : ` everything i did out of my own free will . ' but , then , she cast doubt on his self-awareness . she concluded that he was not a perpetrator of evil but a victim of his childhood . ` a moral monster , ' she wrote , ` is not born but is produced by interference with this growth . ' both mary bell and stangl were therefore victims of ` a climate of life ' . this misguided obsession with the denial of personal responsibility reached a climax in her biography -- critics would say hagiography -- of hitler 's favourite architect albert speer . it even led to accusations that she was a nazi sympathiser . speer was the nazi minister of armaments . it was he who presented the fuhrer with a grandiose vision for rebuilding berlin as a city befitting a conqueror 's thousand year reich . he dramatically increased the manufacture of weapons . this was achieved as a result of speer 's use of prisoners of war and 7.5 million slave labourers . misguided : sereny defended hitler henchman albert speer . this even led to accusations that she was a nazi sympathiser . he was also responsible for the eviction of up to 70,000 jews from their homes in berlin from where they were taken to ghettoes and execution camps . prosecuted at nuremberg with other . nazi leaders , speer brilliantly set himself apart by playing the . middle-class apologist who was ignorant of hitler 's genocide plans . after . 20 years in prison , speer produced a manuscript -- inside the third . reich -- in which he outrageously painted himself as a conscious-stricken . bystander to nazi crimes unaware of the final solution . pandering . to that cynical distortion of the truth , sereny gained access to him . and produced a biography sub-titled his battle with truth . shockingly , she depicted the thug as ` unique among hitler 's men in the integrity of his battle of conscience ' . here was another killer whose crimes , for sereny , could be explained and occasionally even excused . in her world of rampant psycho-babble , she claimed speer 's abusive parents had prompted his search for a father figure which , in turn , fatally led him to hitler . portraying him as a beguiled innocent , sereny wrote about speer 's ` aesthetic perception ' , ` inner awareness ' and ` moral guilt ' but never his calculated participation in killing . in humanising monsters , sereny was a major force in creating a very modern and corrosive ideology that architects of evil should not be punished but understood and even rewarded to help them atone for their sins . their victims are forgotten . worse still , we are left with a society more likely -- not less -- to breed such monsters in the future .", "summary": " gitta sereny tried to claim society was to blame for child murderer mary bell 's crimes .   credibility boosted by the .   fact she was brought up in vienna and her heavily accented english .   brave woman but denial of jewish past put question mark over her career .
