{"text": "on a frozen windswept hill on the outskirts of kabul , half a dozen pashtun men broke the icy ground with pick axes . nearby , the body of eighteen-month-old saiyma gadazai lay wrapped in a plain blanket , her pale face glowing in the gold winter sun . all morning her mother and aunts had washed her remains and prayed over her , in keeping with muslim tradition . now the men and boys took responsibility for her final journey . heartbreaking : the tiny body of eighteen-month-old saiyma gadazai is carried to her final resting place after she froze to death in a refugee camp in kabul . killed by the cold floor : saiyma 's father , safarali , tried to wake his daughter , but she was not breathing . he said he was not able to afford a decent stove or the fuel . saiyma 's father , safarali gadzai , crouched nearin between the sobbing and tears , he said : ` yesterday she was ok . she had a little cough and i took her to the doctor . he gave us medicine . ` she even spoke children 's words to him . when she went to sleep she was fine . this morning , i went to check on her , she was under her blanket by the wood burner . ' i went to shake her awake and she was not breathing . i could not afford a decent wood stove or the fuel . the floor was too cold and this is what killed my daughter . she has taken her path and left us alone . ' this is the nearest cemetery to the sprawling characumba refugee camp and this routine is sadly common during the coldest months . as the hole nears completion , a tribal elder draws my attention to a fresh grave next to it . inside lay a three-year-old boy called janaan . also from the camp , he like saiyma , died in his sleep from exposure . last goodbyes : saiyma is tenderly wrapped in cloths and blankets ready for burial at a makeshift cemetery . sombre : pashtun men and women gather by the burial ground , the nearest cemetery to the sprawling characumba refugee camp , where around 90 per cent of residents have fled from the fighting in helmand . as the men completed the digging , two . dozen more gathered in lines to say prayers for the little girl before . gently lowering her into her tomb . a large piece of slate was placed over her shrouded remains before the . dirt and pebbles were returned to the earth . finally the mound had two . upright stones placed at either end . a . cloth was tied between them to discourage birds from landing on the . grave . animals are not welcome in the resting places of such deeply . superstitious people . we . gave safarali and his brother a lift back to the camp . upon arrival , we . navigated the narrow passageways in between the huts to reach the . mosque . the recent snow . had melted quite suddenly turning the streets into sludge . barely . distinguishable from the network of open sewers , that ran through their . centre . temporary undertakers : around half a dozen men used pick axes to dig the grave out of the icy groind on a frozen windswept hill just outside kabul . regrettable ritual : as the men completed the digging , two dozen more gathered in lines to say prayers for the little girl before gently lowering her into her tomb . the mud brick buildings of the camp have multiplied year after year since the first tents were pitched eight years ago . at present the aschianna ngo estimates that over 1,000 families reside here . local . people in kabul treat them with suspicion . unlike other internally . displaced afghans , the people of characumba are brought here directly by . the war rather than the more common land disputes . ninety . percent of the residents come from helmand province . the rest , from . kandahar . hailing from the sun burnt fields of the south these people . fair particularly badly in the bitter kabul winter . as . we strode towards the heart of the camp , burka-clad women passed by us . usually they would be out of sight hidden from view by deep-set . traditions . but today . ashianna were operating their tent health clinic so sick children were . being brought there in their droves by anxious mothers . the . queue for the facility stretched back into the twisting lanes of the . city of mud . other children congregated near two larger tents . too common a sight : this routine is sadly a regular occurrence during the coldest months . fleeing violence : those attending the funeral live at the sprawling characumba refugee camp , which currently accommodates around 1,000 families . there are around 460,000 displaced people in afghanistan , according to the save the children charity . in kabul alone , there are 55 informal camps , home to more than 30,000 people , including 5,208 families . an estimated 70 per cent of the afghan population live in poverty . the camps in kabul sprung up spontaneously when displaced people arrived in the capital looking for help , and are not formally run by any agency , although charities like save the children provide assistance . children under five are most vulnerable to the cold , especially if they are already weakened by malnutrition and poor health . last year , more than 40 children died from the cold in one month alone . earlier they had attended lessons in two makeshift schools housed in marquees another service provided by aschianna . the boys and girls of the camp get a basic education in strict segregation from each other . more composed now , safarali poured us tea at the entrance to the mosque . he was in his late 20s but looked much older . when . asked how his family came to be in kabul , he replied : ` we are not here . for sightseeing . we left helmand because of the fighting , also there was . no work and we have no land . ` if you carry an id card and the taliban stop you , they will claim that you are a spy for the government . ` if . the police find you without one , they will arrest you on suspicion of . being taliban or al-qaeda . i do n't care who is in charge whether the . government or the taliban as long as we have peace . ' asked if he would return if the fighting ceased following the withdrawal of foreign troops in 2014 , his answer was surprising . ` there . is no point in going back there , ' he said . ` there is no work except . smuggling , or selling drugs , i can not do this . even the work here is . better . ' displaced : unlike other internally displaced afghans , the people of characumba are brought here directly by the war rather than the more common land disputes . superstition : finally the mound had two upright stones placed at either end with a cloth tied between them to discourage birds from landing on the grave . like most men from the displacement camps he relied on casual labouring work from the market places around kabul , though work was rare and poorly paid . he said : ` each morning i get up early and go to hodkhail -lrb- a local labour market -rrb- , if i find work , then i can earn around 200 afghanis -lrb- $ 4 -rrb- . ` it costs me one hundred to travel there and back so i am left with just one hundred to support my family . from this i must buy food , firewood , tea and medicine . ' to add to the desperation of safarali and other men in his position , much of the work would dry up when the snow arrived in the coming weeks . building sites can not operate when the roads are impassable , so their meagre income would wither just as the weather was at its cruellest . he concluded with a plea to the government : ` we have lived in this poverty now for five years . ` these living conditions are not suitable for animals . we are tired of moving around we demand and end to the war and a permanent place to live . ` they should be like our parents , instead they neglect us . ' his brother snorted and added : ` they think we are stupid . we know that other countries are sending us money for the things we need . but they are stealing it from us . that is why my niece is dead .
