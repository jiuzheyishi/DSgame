{"text": "updated : . 06:25 est , 19 december 2011 . a father-of-two will celebrate his first christmas since 1994 after a brain injury wiped out 17 years of memories . gary rogers , 43 , did not even recognise his own daughters after suffering a heart attack and being left in a coma while on holiday . the cardiac arrest left him with memory loss , caused by a lack of oxygen to the brain . christmas to remember : gary rogers , right , will celebrate december 25 with his wife linda and daughters lilly , 15 , far left , and olivia , 18 , centre right , at their home in basildon , essex . now , after months of hard work trying to re-build his life , he is preparing to celebrate the first christmas he will remember after he woke up thinking it was 1994 . he will spend december 25 with his wife linda , who is now his full-time carer , and daughters olivia , 18 , and lilly , 15 , at their home in basildon , essex . the brain damage which wiped out 17 years of his life happened while he was on holiday in turkey last summer . his wife said it has been a long re-building process since he woke up in a british hospital last september . ` although some of gary 's memories from longer ago have returned , he struggles to remember anything about the last year , or the two years leading up to his heart attack , ' said mrs rogers . ` but now , he is beginning to remember important things that happen - and hopefully this christmas will really be one to remember . ` last year , gary was crying in the run-up to christmas because he knew he used to love all our celebrations - but could n't remember much about them , and knew he would struggle to remember the day once it had passed . big day : the family celebrated christmas together last year in the weeks after gary 's heart attack , however he had already forgotten it by boxing day . here he is sat with daughter lilly , 15 , left , his wife linda , and elder daughter olivia , 18 . ` we took loads of family photos to document the whole day - but by boxing day , gary could n't remember anything . ` this year , his memory is much better , and we 're really looking forward to a lovely , memorable day together . ' gary , who used to work in building maintenance , was put in a medically induced coma after falling ill on holiday . doctors warned his devastated family he had suffered brain damage , caused by a lack of oxygen to the brain . he remained in intensive care in turkey until he was well enough to be flown home to the essex cardiothoracic centre , where doctors woke him . linda said the family realised just how badly his brain had been damaged in the following days . ' i asked him what year it was , and he said 1994 - he was dumbfounded when i said it was 2010 , she said . ' i had to stay strong for the girls and gary , but inside i was broken . the girls were crushed , knowing that their dad did n't have a clue who they were . but we had to stick together and keep fighting . we knew we 'd pull through it as a family . last christmas : gary with olivia and lilly in december 2010 . however , he has no recollection of the day and the last christmas he can recall was in 1994 . ` when gary came home , olivia had to show him round the house - it was like he was seeing everything for the first time . ` he did n't know where things were kept , and did n't recognise any clothes in his wardrobe . it was absolutely awful . ` after we 'd shown gary round the house , he turned to me and said  thanks for letting me stay .  ' i was devastated . i told him it was his home , but he turned to me and said :  you 're not my wife - we 've split up , have n't we ? i 'm married to someone else now .  ' i tried not to show gary how upset i was . i told him we 'd been married for 25 years and had never been apart . ` he said this woman was a bit like me , but different - we think he was confusing me now with how i looked when we first got married - but it was horrible to hear him say it . ' she added that in the days after he woke up he had a ` blank look ' on his face and had no idea he was a father-of-two . linda said : ' i started to talk to him about our . daughters - but he just looked at me blankly . i showed him pictures of . them , hoping he would recognise them - but he just shrugged . ' i desperately tried to get him to remember - but his memories were so vague , he could n't remember anything about them . ' i was devastated . when the girls came to see their dad , he just stared at them blankly - he did n't recognise them . slowly , gary 's long term memory has started to return - after a lot of help from his family . linda and his daughters bought him a diary , to help him remember what he had done - and even made a tick-chart for him so he could cross off certain tasks , like brushing his teeth . linda added : ` gary 's memory is still hazy , and he does n't remember anything at all for the 18 months leading up to his heart attack . ` he has vague memories of the past , but there are still some things that he has no recollection of . ` when we were watching the royal wedding , he suddenly shouted :  princess diana 's dead !  ` it 's been a long journey , and there is still a long way to go , but we know gary loves us , and we will always have each other . ` gary could have died that day - so we consider ourselves very lucky . we 're working towards getting our normal life back . ` we just want the simple life - and a family christmas that we can all have some treasured memories is our wish come true . ' gary added : ' i do n't remember last christmas at all or any before without the help of linda reminding me about them and it is all very vague . ' i am hoping to remember this christmas and the way i look at it is that i will be with my beautiful girls and loving , caring wife , family and friends and that is what is important .
