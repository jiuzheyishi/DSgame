{"text": "global warming has opened up an arctic route mariners have been craving for centuries , making the journey from canada to europe shorter . a large sea freighter has become the first cargo vessel to successfully navigate the hazardous arctic northwest passage carrying - somewhat ironically - coal . if other ships decide to use the crossing through the arctic ocean , along the northern coast of north america connecting the atlantic and pacific oceans , their route would be 1,000 nautical miles shorter than the best alternative . global warming has opened up a route mariners have been craving for centuries - a shorter journey from canada to europe . a large sea freighter became the first cargo vessel to successfully navigate the hazardous arctic northwest passage -lrb- pictured -rrb- between canada and greenland . the 75,000 deadweight-tonne nordic orion , built in 2011 and specially strengthened to cross icy waters , left the canadian pacific port of vancouver in early september with a cargo of coking coal and is scheduled to arrive in the finnish port of pori on october 7 , according to ais shipping data . ` the northwest passage is more than 1,000 nautical miles shorter than the traditional shipping route through the panama canal and will save time , fuel and reduce carbon dioxide emissions , but even more importantly increase the amount of cargo per transit 25 percent , ' said nordic bulk carriers , the danish owner of the ship . harsh conditions in the arctic sea route so far have limited shipping mostly to small cargo vessels and ice-breakers , which supply northern canadian communities . the 75,000 deadweight-tonne nordic orion -lrb- pictured -rrb- , built in 2011 and specially strengthened to cross icy waters , left the canadian pacific port of vancouver in early september with a cargo of coking coal and is scheduled to arrive in the finnish port of pori on october 7 , according to ais shipping data . the 225 metre long nordic orion , a panamax-sized ship that is currently off the western coast of greenland , has a strengthened bulk to cope with floating ice . the . vessel is to deliver the coal to ruukki metals , a finnish steel . producer , which is ironic seeing as many climate scientists have blamed . the melting of arctic ice as a consequence of warmer temperatures caused . by greenhouse gases emitted by burning fossil fuels , particularly coal . as the ice continues to melt , some . experts have estimated that shipping via the arctic could account for a . quarter of the cargo traffic between europe and asia by 2030 . ` the northwest passage is more than 1,000 nautical miles shorter than the traditional shipping route through the panama canal and will save time , fuel and reduce carbon dioxide emissions , ' said nordic bulk carriers , the danish owner of the ship . a selection of routes through the passage are pictured . last november , russian gas export company gazprom made the first ever delivery of liquefied natural gas through the arctic north-east route , sailing from norway east to japan . many maritime analysts have said , however , that large volumes of commercial shipping via the arctic are at least 10 years away . while mariners might be excited by the prospect of faster journeys , some people are concerned what would happen in the event that one of the commercial ships ran into trouble in the remote and icy waters . michael byers , an expert in global politics and international law at the university of british columbia , said : ` there are the environmental risks . the coal being carried by the nordic . orion would not cause much damage in the event of an accident . but the . fuel oil on board the vessel certainly would . ' as the ice continues to melt , some experts have estimated that shipping via the arctic could account for a quarter of the cargo traffic between europe and asia by 2030 . but some people are concerned about the potential environmental impact as an accident in the hazardous waters could see fuel oil polluting the sea . writing in an article for the globe and mail , he warned that shallow waters and icebergs still pose a risk to ice-strengthened ships . he said small , hard chunks of ice called ` growlers ' that float low in the water are incredibly difficult to spot , while ` icing ' - when ocean spray freezes onto the outside of a ship - can cause it to become top-heavy and capsize . in the event of an emergency , he also warned that canada 's search and rescue capabilities are ` desperately poor ' . he said long-range helicopters could take a whole day to reach parts of the arctic northwest passage , offering little help to stranded crews , who even wearing survival suits could freeze to death in just one hour in the harsh environment . an expert warned hard chunks of ice called ` growlers ' that float low in the water are incredibly difficult to spot , while ` icing ' - when ocean spray freezes onto the outside of a ship - can cause it to become top-heavy and capsize . u.s. tanker-icebreaker ss manhattan -lrb- pictured -rrb- was the first commercial ship to make the east-west trip through northwest passage in 1969 . the news of the ` new ' crossing comes in the same week that the united nations ' intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- released it 's latest high profile report . the un scientists today said they are '95 . per cent ' certain that climate change is man made , but still could not . explain why the world has barely got any hotter in the last 15 years . the ipcc said . that sea levels have risen by 19cm since 1901 and are expected to rise a . further 26-82cm by the end of the century . it . added that concentrations of co2 and other greenhouse gases in the . atmosphere have increased to levels that are unprecedented in at least . 800,000 years . as expected , . the ipcc raised its projections of the rise in sea levels to 26-82cm the previous report predicted a rise of 18-59cm . storms will become more intense and frequent , and the oceans will become more acidic , the report predicted .", "summary": " the nordic orion left vancouver in early september with a cargo of coking coal and is scheduled to arrive in finland on 7 october .   the route connecting the atlantic and pacific oceans , is 1,000 nautical miles shorter than the traditional shipping route through the panama canal .   as the ice continues to melt , experts estimate shipping via the arctic could account for a .   quarter of the cargo traffic between europe and asia by 2030 .
