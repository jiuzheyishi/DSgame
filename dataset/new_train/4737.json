{"text": "a conservative blogger is in jail -- arrested for allegedly breaking into a mississippi nursing home to photograph u.s. sen. thad cochran 's ailing wife , who is suffering from dementia .  it 's the worst ,  says the narrator of a new cochran campaign ad airing in the final stretch before the june 3 primary , not so subtly pointing the finger at his gop senate challenger , chris mcdaniel , trying to stir up voter disgust . this race , one of the nastiest so far this election year , has gotten even deeper in the mississippi mud than that . cochran supporters argue the reason the blogger and tea party activist took mrs. cochran 's picture was to feed questions about the senator and his longtime aide , kay webber . cochran : quiet pragmatist faces re-election challenge . conservative outlets that back mcdaniel have been all over the fact cochran rents a basement apartment in webber 's d.c. home , and that webber has traveled extensively with cochran on the taxpayer 's dime . mcdaniel 's campaign often forwards these reports to its media email list , while the cochran campaign calls her trips with the senator part of her job and suggestions of anything untoward are sexist . new ads in nasty mississippi primary . this republican primary was supposed to be about the big struggle of ideas within the gop : a 36-year senate veteran being challenged by a young tea party-backed opponent who calls the senator a big-spending , out-of-touch republican too entrenched in washington . now mcdaniel is fending off questions about whether his campaign was involved in trying to photograph cochran 's sick wife .  our campaign had absolutely no connection to that whatsoever , and the evidence has shown that . what we 're doing right now -- we 're talking about the issues ,  mcdaniel told cnn in an interview . the next ted cruz ? but what gave ammunition to cochran allies is that mcdaniel 's story about when he found out about the break-in has been inconsistent . when we asked for clarification , mcdaniel would n't go there , replying ,  look , we 're going to focus on his record .  three more arrested in mississippi senate primary scandal . if mcdaniel has his way , he would be the next ted cruz , going to the senate to shake things up -- stick to conservative principles , compromise be damned .  we do n't have six more years of the status quo ,  he said .  i am not going to washington d.c. to be a member of the cocktail circuit or to make backroom deals . i 'm going up there to fight and defend the constitution . we do n't have time to waste . so with all due respect i would suggest they join me in this fight because they 've been silent far too long ,  he told us .  he and i are very different with our ideology . he 's a guy that believes in big government . he believes in big spending . he believes in increasing taxes . he believes in increasing his own pay . i am not that guy ,  mcdaniel said . for the tea party movement nationwide -- after a string of primary losses this election year from kentucky to idaho -- mcdaniel has been its great hope of 2014 , the candidate with the best chance of toppling an establishment republican . things were looking good for mcdaniel earlier this year , especially after cochran stumbled by telling a local reporter here that  the tea party is something i do n't really know a lot about .  millions of dollars pouring into mississippi against cochran come from a who 's who of national tea party groups nationwide : citizens united , club for growth , senate conservatives fund , tea party patriots and freedomworks . the sunlight foundation , a nonprofit group that tracks money in politics , says outside groups have spent $ 7.6 million on the race , much of it for mcdaniel and against cochran . 2014 midterms : key races . fighting back against tea party challenges . but like other republican incumbents this year , cochran and his allies are fighting back hard . henry barbour , nephew of former mississippi governor and rnc chairman haley barbour , formed a super pac called mississippi conservatives to help cochran . they have been airing aggressive ads slamming mcdaniel as extreme , inconsistent and out of touch with mississippi 's needs . other traditional gop groups like the chamber of commerce have also come in with ads supporting cochran , like they have for gop incumbents in other states this year . still , cochran 's four decades in washington have won him loyal supporters . on memorial day , cochran attended an event in vicksburg . he was invited by the democratic mayor , george flaggs , who called him a  mentor  and  great friend .  flaggs told cnn he intends to vote for cochran in the gop primary since mississippi law allows democrats and others not registered as republicans to participate . he said cochran fights hard for mississippi 's needs and calls his seniority -- ranking republican on the powerful senate appropriations committee , a big plus for the state .  he 's a leader ; he 's a statesman , and he 's what we need in washington . so stay as long as he wants to stay ,  flagg said . republican briggs hopson serves with mcdaniel in the mississippi state senate , and told cnn he likes mcdaniel but that cochran is the  best person for mississippi right now .   seniority can be a plus . people can lose touch and get lazy and all those things but i do n't think that 's the case with senator cochran . he 's been responsive to the needs in mississippi for many years ,  hopson told cnn . ` those days are over ' when we put those bipartisan sentiments to mcdaniel he responded with an emphatic ,  come on !   i say name one fight senator cochran 's lead against barack obama . name one time he 's raised his voice in defense of conservatism . name one time he 's fought back the liberal agenda . name one piece of legislation he 's authored in 42 years that benefited the conservative cause . name one thing that he 's been outwardly aggressive about . and they ca n't name one ,  mcdaniel told cnn .  look , there may have been a time for that in 1973 when he first went to washington . maybe when richard nixon was president that was the thing people did . those days are over .  we wanted to ask cochran himself why he thinks he should get another six years , after serving 36 in the u.s. senate and six before that in the house . but cochran is trying to run out the clock and avoid unforced errors -- and going to head-scratching extremes to avoid talking to reporters like us . we tried to catch cochran after his event in vicksburg , but when an aide came out and saw us waiting , they did a bait and switch -- the car they told us cochran was getting into screeched away without him , while he snuck out another door and left in another car , leaving reporters in the dust . special coverage : 2014 midterms .", "summary": " race for senate seat , already one of ugliest , has gotten nastier .   conservatives make much of cochran 's relationship with aide .   questions about challenger 's relationship with picture-snapping blogger .
