{"text": "it may not be the most fashion-forward footwear you 've seen , but these bizarre sandals could help save an astronaut body from deteriorating . developed by nasa , a pair was today sent to the international space station in the hope of better understanding of how heavy loads can damage an astronauts ' bones . the forceshoe sandals act as a high tech measurement system working in tandem with the iss 's advanced resistive exercise device -lrb- ared -rrb- . scroll down for video . dubbed the forceshoe , the sandals act as a high tech measurement system and working in tandem with the iss 's advanced resistive exercise device -lrb- ared -rrb- . developed by nasa , a pair was today sent to the international space station in the hope of gaining a better understanding of how heavy loads damage an astronauts ' bones . andrea hanson , an iss exercise hardware specialist , demonstrates the use of the forceshoe on the advanced resistive exercise device . ared helps the astronauts perform weight-bearing exercise to maintain bone and muscle mass while in microgravity . ` ared is a sophisticated exercise device , ' said andrea hanson , iss exercise hardware specialist . ` although it has helped nasa provide better health outcomes for crew members , there is still progress to be made in understanding the effects of exercise on bone and muscle health , and the forceshoe will help us do that . ' using the forceshoe , researchers will measure exercise loads and ground reaction forces on an astronaut . these are the forces supplied by the ground to a body in contact with it . the device measures force in three axes : up and down , side-to-side and front-to-back . it also captures the torque , or twisting force , applied under foot during an ared exercise . ` we are eager to understand how joint forces may be different between exercise performed on the ground and in space , and force shoe technology might help us do this in future investigations , ' said mr hanson . improving researchers ' understanding of exercise performance in microgravity will help create better space workouts that improve bone and muscle strength . researchers will ask two to four crew members to collect static load and dynamic exercise data while wearing the shoes , which look like high-tech sandals . during the static load test , crew members will be asked to set the ared to provide specific loads in the same way they would set loads on a weightlifting machine at the gym . the effects of zero gravity on our muscles , bones and joints have been extensively studied . but while living in space is known to weaken our immune system , no one is sure how our cells are affected in the long-term by prolonged exposure to a weightless environment . now a new iss experiment will seek to answer that very question , and it could provide us with important information on the risk of spaceflight to astronauts . known as the cellbox mission , the experiment was carried to the international space station -lrb- iss -rrb- by spacex 's dragon capsule.the experiment contains a cargo of immune cells . in zero gravity , various immune system functions are known to be impaired . in particular phagocytes , cells that protect our body from harmful foreign bodies , are unable to work properly . a research team is currently studying the structure and metabolism of these phagocytes while they are on the iss . they will then lift the exercise bar and stand still on ared while the shoes collect data . they will also perform dynamic exercises included squats , deadlifts and bicep curls . as crew members perform these exercises , the forceshoe , which acts like an enhanced bathroom scale that measures loads applied downward as well as during front-to-back and side-to-side movements . data will be transmitted via bluetooth technology to computers on the space station and researchers on earth will receive this data a couple of days later . ` as we prepare for future missions to asteroids , mars and beyond , we need to think about minimising and miniaturising equipment because spacecraft will be smaller , ' said mr hanson . ` the forceshoe is a great example of the way we can shrink some of our research tools for future missions . ' lessons learned from exercise performed during long duration missions in microgravity can also be directly applied to populations here on earth . for instance , the results could be used to help people who have restricted movement due to injury , ageing , busy lifestyles , or confined work and living spaces . during the static load test , crew members will be asked to set the ared to provide specific loads in the same way they would set loads on a weightlifting machine at the gym . jaxa astronaut koichi wakata is pictured here working out on ared .", "summary": " forceshoe acts as a high tech measurement system for the iss 's ared .   ared lets astronauts exercise to maintain their bone and muscle strength .   the space sandals will measure exercise loads and ground reaction forces .   the results could be used to help people who have restricted movement on earth due to injury , ageing , busy lifestyles or confined work spaces .
