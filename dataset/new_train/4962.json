{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- catapulted into the international spotlight after the publication of a sensational biography in 2012 , shin dong-hyuk became the most famous north korean defector . a soft-spoken and shy man , shin shared his harrowing story about escaping from a total control zone called camp 14 , giving western audiences an accessible reading on north korea . over the weekend , shin stated that parts of his stories are inaccurate , although he did not specify which aspects . he posted on facebook that parts of his past  that i so badly wanted to cover up can no longer be hidden .  blaine harden , author of  escape from camp 14 ,  wrote on his website that shin had admitted several inaccuracies , including the length of time he spent in camp 14 . for more : north korean prison camp survivor admits inaccuracies . shin 's high-profile role and now admitted inconsistencies in his story raised concerns that it could undermine human rights advocacy efforts and distract from testimonies by other north korean refugees .  there are a lot of people who actually have been to the -lrb- prison -rrb- camp and experienced it . it will be wrong for their witness accounts to lose credibility because of this incident ,  said ahn myeong chul , a former north korean camp guard who knows shin . peter jung , director of the human rights group justice for north korea , said he 's  worried that people testifying about north korea will be called a liar  but that shin 's new revelations ca n't challenge the fact that  north korea control camps exist .  jung said that many north korean refugees , such as shin , suffer from major trauma after escaping the regime and called for support .  i hope he gathers his courage and tells his story accurately and honestly , and we must help him do that .  scrutiny on north korea 's human rights abuses . north korean memoirs and testimonies can not be verified -- there are no paper trails and investigators can not interview or access witnesses in a closed society . their stories are compared for consistency with other defectors and experts , but the process is far from foolproof . cnn has not been able to reach shin , who noted in his social media apology that  these will be my final words and this will likely be my final post .  shin 's admission of inaccuracies comes at a time of unparalleled attention on north korea 's human rights record following a landmark u.n. commission of inquiry report listing abuses of the pyongyang regime . while  escape from camp 14  was not the sole reason for the creation of the commission , navi pillay , then the u.n. high commissioner for human rights , urged the probe after meeting shin and another north korean prison camp survivor in december 2012 . since the commission report 's release in 2014 , the u.n. general assembly has called for more sanctions and a referral of those responsible to the international criminal court . the matter remains at the u.n. security council , where it 's likely china would block referrals of kim jong un and his leadership to the international criminal court . double horror or triple horror ? michael kirby , chairman of the commission of inquiry into north korea , said that shin 's testimony consisted of only two paragraphs in the 400-page report and that he was only one of hundreds of north korean witnesses .  it 's a very small part of a very long story . and it really does n't affect the credibility of the testimony , which is online ,  he said .  lots of people took part -lrb- in -rrb- this inquiry . their stories are powerful and convincing , and these stories do not only represent shin but other people in north korea .  in a reversal of his story told for years , shin told harden on friday that he had been transferred to another prison , camp 18 , when he was 6 , instead of spending his entire life inside north korea at the total control zone camp 14 , the author says on his website . the distinction of whether shin was imprisoned in camp 14 or 18 was not a deal breaker for kirin another words , it 's whether triple horror or double horror ,  kirby said . pressures . shin bears the physical scars of torture , including a missing fingertip and burn marks on his back , according to the book . and harden noted in his book that during the interview process , shin at times was unreliable and  in many crucial instances , corrected his korean memoir  -- an autobiography that shin wrote in 2007 , called  escape to the outside world ,  which was only published in korean . north korea had sought to discredit shin . last fall , a pro-north korea government website released videos with english subtitles featuring a man whom shin recognized to be his father , disputing the story that his son was ever in a prison camp . shin responded with a statement , accusing the government of  holding my father hostage .  it 's unclear if the video had any bearing on the timing of shin 's admission . ahn , the former prison camp guard who has known shin for seven years , said he believes the crux of shin 's story is true and that torture in either camp is still the same .  shin became an icon for north korean human rights . whether he was in camp 14 or camp 18 , he is definitely a person from a political prison camp . he was born there and tortured there .  cnn 's judy kwon and kj kwon contributed to this report .", "summary": " shin dong-hyuk , subject of best-selling book , admits part of his stories are inaccurate .   advocates say it does n't matter which north korean prison camp shin was in .   some fear shin 's admission of inaccuracies will affect views of other defectors ' testimonies .
