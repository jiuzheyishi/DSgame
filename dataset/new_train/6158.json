{"text": "and freya noble . and sally lee . australian grandmother deborah scheithe liked what she saw when her daughter showed off her newly augmented breasts . in fact , the 50-year-old was so impressed that this recently inspired her to go under the knife for breast implants . but ms scheithe is n't alone as she 's part of a burgeoning market of older women seeking boob jobs in australia . nsw resident deborah schiethe had a boob job at age 50 , -lrb- pictured to the left before , and right after -rrb- and is part of a growing trend of older women going under the knife . the grandmother , from tumut in nsw , told news.com.au the reason she had the surgery was because she 'd ` lost a lot of fullness and wanted some of my womanhood back ' . ` my daughter had surgery done the year before and i was so impressed i had mine done , ' she said . to keep up with the demand , cosmetic surgeons are trying to combat competitive packages offered in asian countries by lowering the cost of carrying out the procedure . some women over the age of 50 - even into their 70s - are claiming it is now cheaper to undergo breast augmentation surgery than they expected and more accessible . ms scheithe said she was surprised at the decreased cost , as the cosmetic institute in parramatta , sydney , charged her $ 5,990 for the operation . the institute said despite their usual clientele being women in their early 20s or women between the ages of 30 to 45 going under the knife post-baby , the demand for the discounted procedure is increasing . deborah , pictured with her husband david , decided to undergo the procedure after she saw the results of her daughter 's surgery . recently they had a 70-year-old woman who underwent a boob job and a tummy tuck at their clinic after suddenly finding herself single . the cosmetic institute is also set to open a clinic in bondi due to demand . in a similar vein , discounted boob jobs will be offered on the gold coast to compete against the increase in patients heading to asia for cut-price surgery . in an australian first , a cosmetic tourism agency based in queensland 's broadbeach is teaming up with respected plastic surgeons to offer cheaper procedures . cosmeditour , along with dr craig layt and dr luke stradwick , are offering boob job holidays for about $ 7900 . for those who just want the procedure done , it 's $ 6880 - including an anaesthetist and the hospital stay . through the new gold coast breast academy , the two doctors will train plastic surgeons for standard breast implants that can be offered at a cheaper price . breast implants with a plastic surgeon cost $ 10,000 on average in australia compared to $ 4000 in thailand . gold coast girls natalie kernke , anna thomsen and noi aasen have all travelled to thailand to get their boob jobs through cosmeditour . a surfers paradise or broadbeach boob job holiday includes a nine-night stay , day surgery at southport 's pacific private hospital and a follow-up appointment six days after the surgery . there is also an option to upgrade to have a nurse monitor patients on the first night . and there is already interest coming from new zealand and perth , just days after the package went on offer . ` there are people who do n't want to go to thailand or are not comfortable to have surgery off-shore , ' cosmeditour managing director greg lemon said . ` we do n't send anyone to plastic surgeons in thailand ... and we wanted to offer people the option of using plastic surgeons here . ` you can get cut price boob jobs in australia , but not with plastic surgeons . ' in australia , a plastic surgeon has to be accepted into the royal australasian college of surgeons and study an extra five years to become qualified , where as a cosmetic doctor does not . cosmeditour currently sends about 100 patients every month jet to bangkok or phuket , with 80 per cent of them having breast implants . but there is a catch to getting discount breasts . the cheaper price is for implants up to 400ml and patients have to meet certain criteria . mr lemon said the procedure would be ideal for women with no sagging breasts or asymmetry because they would need different surgery . gold coast resident anna thomsen , who had a boob job in bangkok , welcomed the discounted procedure to australian shores . ' i think it 's a great idea having it on the gold coast because some people would be terrified of the idea of going to thailand so it makes it a bit more convenient , ' she said . according to phuket international hospital 's peter davison , there is a market for cheaper breast implants in australia . he said out of 2000 cosmetic surgery cases a year 1600 were australians , with 30 per cent from queensland and that trend is growing . mr davison said the hospital was seeing a 30 per cent growth in numbers every year . cosmeditour is offering boob job holidays for $ 7900 in surfers paradise or broadbeach . a boob job alone is $ 4000 in thailand .", "summary": " deborah scheithe , 50 , said she was very surprised at how cheap it was to undergo breast augmentation surgery .   increased numbers of aussie women in their 50s and 70s are going under the knife .   costs are decreasing to deter people from seeking cheap overseas jobs .   cosmeditour , based in queensland , is offering cheaper boob jobs .   a nine-night stay costs $ 7900 on surfers paradise or broadbeach .   thailand surgeons charge $ 4000 for a boob job , $ 10,000 in australia .
