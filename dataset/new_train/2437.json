{"text": "facebook users , mark my words : you 'll revolt when the site rolls out its new features in the coming weeks . facebook is about to completely change the way its profile pages look as part of the website 's biggest redesign so far , and only a fraction of the website 's 800 million users seem to have the slightest clue . i 'm not talking about the new real-time  ticker  at the top right of your facebook profile . i 'm not even talking about the  top stories  that now appear at the top of your facebook news feed -- those are tiny , insignificant changes compared to what 's just around the corner . but boy , did some people react badly to even those minuscule improvements . among my facebook friends , more than half said they disliked the changes and some threatened to quit . of course , they did no such thing . how will they react when facebook throws away the old profiles and replaces them with something completely new ? if you use facebook , chances are you 're unaware of the major changes that are slated to begin rolling out by the end of this month -lrb- full disclosure : mashable is one of several news organizations partnering with facebook on a social news app -rrb- . only geeks like me are obsessed enough to have watched facebook 's 90-minute announcement of the new profile pages last week . and an even smaller percentage of facebook users have discovered , like i did , that you can enable the new  facebook timeline  profile page right now so you 're prepared for the launch . so what 's the big change ? facebook will be switching profile pages , perhaps optionally at first , to a new format called  facebook timeline .  i switched my profile over last week and boy was it a shock -- i immediately wanted to switch it back to the old format . i 'm someone who thrives on trying new things , but this change was radical even for me . yet i could find no way to switch my profile back , so i stuck with it for a few days . i 'm so glad i did : facebook timeline is the best change facebook has ever made . here 's what 'll happen once the timeline profiles are launched : your facebook profile will go from having one central column to two , with boxes of text , photos , videos and even maps of your favorite locations . rather than just displaying your most recent activities , your profile will become a scrapbook documenting your entire life , all the way back to your birth . facebook will become a record of your existence : all your memories , your victories and your defeats , your loves , your losses and everything in between . you 'll be shocked , as i was , when this change is made . suddenly your life is laid out before you , the highs and lows somehow pinpointed by facebook 's algorithms . you 'll wonder why the status update box is so tiny now , and where all your most recent updates went . you 'll add a big , new  cover photo  to your page and waste a few hours preening your timeline , choosing to feature your happiest memories , hide the inconsequential ones , and lingering awhile on the most bittersweet of moments . and you 'll realize , as i did , that facebook knows you better than you know yourself . through this process , you 'll realize that facebook timeline is much more than a way to post the minutiae of your existence . while a typical social networking profile might highlight what you ate this morning , or what time you left for work , or where you had lunch , facebook timeline takes these thousands of seemingly inconsequential events , discards the irrelevant ones , finds the most emotive , the most visual , the most striking and emotionally touching moments and pulls them into sharp focus . much like our memories , facebook timeline understands that some moments have resonance that lasts through the years . it 's a marvel of computer programming : an algorithm that comes eerily close to emulating human memory ; perhaps the first algorithm to spark such a deep emotional response . so yes , you will hate the new facebook profile when it launches in the coming weeks . then , like me , you 'll realize that facebook has unleashed something so remarkable that you did n't even recognize it at first : a meaningful social network . and like any other groundbreaking technology -- the pc , the smartphone , the ipad -- you 'll wonder why life was n't always this way , and how you got by without it .", "summary": " facebook is about to completely change the way its profile pages look .   cashmore : i thrive on new things , but this change was radical even for me .   your profile will become a scrapbook documenting your entire life , all the way back to birth .
