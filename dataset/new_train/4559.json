{"text": "when apple unveiled not one but two new iphones last month , it was the dawning of a new strategy for the company , which for six years had championed its single iconic smartphone even as competitors rolled out an array of shapes , sizes and features . but a month later , there are questions about how effective this strategy has been , particularly in regards to the iphone 5c , the cheaper , colorful plastic counterpart to apple 's higher-end iphone 5s . though some observers see a long game in which the  fun  version of the iphone will still prove popular , others are skeptical , based on some early signs . apple has not released figures breaking down sales of the 5c versus the 5s -lrb- an earnings report on october 28 may change that -rrb- . but independent analysts estimate that the fancier 5s is outselling its candy-colored cousin by 3 to 1 or , in some cases , even more . localytics , an analytics and marketing platform creators say samples apps on 1 billion devices , says the 5s is winning 3-to-1 in the united states and a whopping 5-to-1 -lrb- 72 % to 28 % -rrb- worldwide . reports from generally reliable sources in china say apple has cut production of the phone there , less than a month after it went on sale . c tech , a chinese site that ran accurate photos of the iphone 5c and 5s before they were released , quotes insiders who say daily production of the 5c has been cut in half -- from 300,000 to 150,000 . part of the problem , some analysts say , is the price . although the iphone 5c starts at $ 99 with a mobile data plan , many had predicted that it would need to be even cheaper to appeal to buyers in emerging markets like china and india . in china , where phones are n't subsidized by mobile carriers , the 5c is selling for 3,500 yuan , or about $ 560 . and though its style is all new , the 5c does n't sport features significantly upgraded from the iphone 5 , which can be had for as low as $ 199 . the two-year-old iphone 4s can be had for free with a data plan . sarah rotman epps , an analyst with forrester research , says that selling the more expensive 5s , which starts at $ 199 , is good for apple 's bottom line in the short term .  but in the longer term ,  she said ,  it 's bad news .  apple needs new customers to keep growing , and the 5c was supposed to appeal to a new , more price-conscious consumer ,  she said .  turns out that acquisition is a lot harder than retention .  some retailers have responded by slashing prices on the 5c . this month , best buy ran a promotion offering the phone for $ 50 . walmart has discounted it to $ 45 through the holidays , and radio shack is giving customers who buy one $ 50 gift cards through early next month . but some say it 's not quite time to write the phone 's obituary .  rumours on order cuts -lrb- or increases -rrb- from parts of apple 's supply chain tell us absolutely nothing either way ,  benedict evans , an independent analyst , wrote recently on twitter .  too many moving parts .  in another post , he made light of people comparing iphone 5s and iphone 5c sales as an indicator of apple 's success .  iphone 5s outselling 5c ? apple 's growth strategy a failure . sell !  he wrote .  iphone 5c outselling 5s ? cannibalisation and -lrb- revenue per user -rrb- collapse . sell !  this year , apple ceo tim cook himself downplayed the amount of weight observers should place in supply-chain rumors .  i suggest it 's good to question the accuracy of any kind of rumor about build plans ,  cook said during an earnings call .  the supply chain is very complex , and we have multiple sources for things . ... there is an inordinate long list of things that can make any single data point not a great proxy for what is going on .  and there is something to be said for your top-end phone leading the way . the iphone 5s has hit the streets to almost universally high marks from both reviewers and users . apple announced last month that first-weekend sales of both phones combined topped 9 million , a record for the company . still , apple does nothing accidentally . the iphone 5c clearly was released to appeal to customers in a way that the iphone 5s could n't . only time will tell whether apple will succeed , but it will need to see improvements before it does .  apple has more work to do to attract the next generation of iphone customers ,  epps said .  the 5c is n't resonating as apple hoped it would . ", "summary": " analysts expected the iphone 5c to appeal to customers with its low price .   but , especially in emerging markets , it has n't been significantly discounted .   reports say production has slowed , and retailers are slashing its price .   but some observers say it 's way too early to predict success or failure .
