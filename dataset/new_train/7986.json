{"text": "crash victim : paula jurek , 20 , a student from poland , died after being hit by a lorry at a junction . a lorry with a faulty indicator crushed a cyclist to death without the driver even realising what he had done , an inquest heard yesterday . a loose bulb in the indicator meant that paula jurek had no idea the vehicle was turning into her path . the 20-year-old tourism undergraduate suffered multiple injuries and died almost instantly as she went under its front wheel . witnesses told st pancras coroner 's court they did not see driver barry roe indicate before making the left turn . his lorry was later found to have had a bulb fitted incorrectly to its left side indicator . road traffic collision investigator paul deneyes told the inquest : ` it was n't that it was broken as such , it was that the bulb was n't fitted correctly . ` it 's possible that a cyclist travelling on the near side of the lorry may not have known it was making a left turn because they could not see the indicator . ' eyewitnesses said they did n't see the driver indicate before it hit miss jurek , a management and tourism student at london metropolitan university . aa patrolman romain lamamy said : ` the front wheel of the lorry went over her . ' i told him he had driven over a cyclist . i told him several times and pointed her out under the wheel . i was shocked that he had not noticed . ' the accident happened at the junction between camden road and st pancras way in camden , north london , on april 5 , 2011 . mr roe , who was acquitted of causing death by careless driving at a subsequent trial , told the inquest that he did not see miss jurek , who had come to britain from poland two years earlier . he said : ` as i moved off i checked all my mirrors . i was stationary at the lights , then they changed to green and it 's then that i indicated . ' i did not know about the defect with the indicator light . i checked it that morning . i checked the lights and the tyres . it 's normal procedure . ' recording a verdict of death by road traffic collision , deputy coroner selena lynch said : ' i have come to no conclusion about whether or not the indicators were activated by the driver of the lorry . junction accident : paula , 20 , who had been in britain for two years , was studying a management and tourism at london metropolitan university . ` the deceased was riding her pedal cycle and as she approached the lights she came to a standstill to the left of the lorry . she was not visible to the driver , even through his rear and side view mirrors . ` the rear side indicator was defective and the deceased was not aware the lorry was turning left . ` my verdict is one of road traffic collision . i am afraid this is n't the first such case of this type . i have done many over the years . ` there 's a great conflict on london roads between users . great dangers arise when cyclists and lorries come into contact with one and other . it 's always the cyclist that comes off worse . ` perhaps the only comfort we can take is that this death did not involve a lot of suffering as miss jurek was unconscious almost instantaneously . ' accident spot : student paula jurek was cycling straight along camden road -lrb- pictured -rrb- when she was hit by the lorry as it made a left turn into st pancras way at the junction . after the inquest paula 's angry mother , iwona , who travelled over from poland for the hearing , said : ` we did n't know this was an inquest , we thought it was the court case . we have only found out the driver had been acquitted . ` we 're shocked and angry . there has been no communication . we have been waiting for two years for justice . after hearing the evidence we still have doubts and want to take the matter further . justice would make the matter easier to take . ' paying tribute to her ` special ' daughter , she added : ` she had big dreams . she was very intelligent . ` she had lived in london for two years and loved it here . she loved people and wanted to travel the world . she was special . ' a spokesman for the london cycling campaign said : ` crashes with large lorries account for about half the cyclist deaths in london . ` we at the lcc have been campaigning to improve the equipment on lorries and for all drivers to have extra training including sessions riding a bike . ` it is difficult to understand how the driver in this case was acquitted for failing to see paula . if he was turning into a  blind spot  he should have done it with extreme care . ` we have called for that junction to be made safer with a safe area for cyclists but to date nothing has been done .
