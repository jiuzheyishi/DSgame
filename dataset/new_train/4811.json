{"text": "erin and william petersen almost did n't get the ultrasound . you do n't really need it , the doctor told them , but come on in if you like and have a look at your bait looked like a wave hello to mommy and daddy . excuse me , the technician said as she put down the ultrasound wand and headed toward the door .  is everything ok ?  the petersens asked .  no ,  the technician answered and walked out of the room . sky-high rate of a birth defect . nearly two years after the state of washington was alerted to a possible cluster of babies born with severe birth defects , experts are speaking out , criticizing the state health department for not doing enough to save babies ' lives . for four years in a row , from 2010 through 2013 , the rate of babies born with a brain defect called anencephaly -- a type of neural tube defect -- in one rural area of washington has been more than four times the national rate . the defect is always fatal . the washington department of health has steadfastly refused to interview the parents of these babies and has failed to accept offers of help from world-renowned anencephaly experts .  it really looks like they 're dragging their feet ,  said richard finnell , a pediatric geneticist and birth defect expert at the university of texas . he said that to find the cause of the cluster , state investigators need to speak with the parents of children with birth defects in the three-county area to see whether they might have something in common . but the state has not contacted these parents .  this is the highest rate of anencephaly since a cluster in texas back in the '90s , and they should get in there and figure it out . but they do n't seem very excited about it ,  finnell said . that texas outbreak was found to be associated with moldy corn consumed by the mothers . a team of experts on this mold offered help to washington investigators back in february but has n't received a response .  we 're frustrated that they 're not moving more quickly to find the cause ,  said janee gelineau-van waes , one of the mold experts and an associate professor of pharmacology at the creighton university school of medicine in nebraska . the washington department of health has defended its response to the high rate , pointing out that it did a review of the mothers ' medical records and , this month , created an advisory committee to help with the investigation . a state epidemiologist , juliet vaneenwyk , said that at some point , investigators hope to work with the mold experts . if all of that is n't enough of a response , that 's partly because the state 's epidemiologists believe the increased rate could be random , vaneenwyk said . though it is indeed high , the number of anencephaly cases is so small -- 8.7 per 10,000 births -- that next year , the rate could be back in line with the rest of the country . the national rate is 2.1 cases per 10,000 live births .  clusters come and go ,  said vaneenwyk .  this could possibly be a statistical blip .  but finnell and others say they think a fourfold increase is no blip . with anencephaly , the baby is born without a fully formed brain . there 's no chance of survival . research has suggested that pregnant women are at higher risk of neural tube defects if their intake of folic acid is low before and during pregnancy . the united states has seen a 27 % drop in such case since it started fortifying grains with folic acid . ` the lamest excuse i 've ever heard ' when the ultrasound tech walked out the door , the petersens were left alone , erin 's stomach still exposed with the ultrasound gel on it .  it 's ok ,  her husband kept repeating , but erin could n't even look at him . she just stared at the wall , listening to the sound of her own heart beating louder and louder . the tech returned with the doctor .  he told us our baby had anencephaly and had no chance of survival . he was surprised he 'd made it this long ,  erin said .  he went to the computer and brought up a picture of a deceased baby with anencephaly , and there was no skull past the eyebrows . it was horrifying . the image is seared into my head forever .  the petersens scheduled a pregnancy termination for two days later , on june 30 , 2012 . in the meantime , they went home to wait .  i was inconsolable ,  erin said .  i had a baby inside me that was living , and his heart was beating , but i knew i would have to say goodbye in a couple of days .  the day before the termination , billy petersen found a red marker and drew a heart on his wife 's stomach .  i knew our baby was in there , and i was showing him that i love him ,  he said .  it was our last night with him .  this kind of emotion is one of the reasons why the department of health has decided so far not to interview families like the petersens .  it 's very intrusive to start knocking on doors of people who 've had a pretty major trauma in their lives ,  vaneenwyk said .  that 's the lamest excuse i 've ever heard ,  said billy petersen , reflecting the viewpoint of several families interviewed by cnn whose children have neural tube defects .  we want to talk to them ,  he said .  we 'd do anything to help find out why our baby died and help other families . we do n't want anyone else to go through what we 've been through .  vaneenwyk said it 's not clear what investigators would ask these parents . the medical records review showed they had nothing obvious in common .  unless we really think we 're going to learn something that will help us prevent neural tube defects , we 've said that that 's not the route to go yet .  all the petersens can do now is grieve without answers . a few weeks after they terminated the pregnancy , the couple found outthat their baby had been a boy . they named him oliver michael and got tattoos in his memory . billy 's tattoo on his collarbone has a baby 's hand and the letters aimh , for  always in my heart .  erin 's tattoo on the inside of her wrist has the same baby hand .  godspeed ,  it reads .  sweet dreams .
