' david . first began volunteering with the rnli in 1955 at the age of 17 when he . offered to help launch boats at the station which was just yards from . his home . after 15 years , he joined the crew full-time as a helmsman in 1970 and served 18 years before returning to life as a volunteer . always on call : mr james , pictured second left on the lifeboat catherine plumbley n the 1980s . life-saver : mr james , far right , with the rnli crew in 1992 . the cabinet maker has been involved with around 1,000 call-outs over the years . emergency response : a crew out on the water in the mid 1990s . a spokesman for the rnli said the minehead station had launched an average of 22 rescues a year since electronic records began in 1970 . during his career at sea , he was . called out on christmas day in the 1980s to rescue a stricken greek . crewman anchored off the coast of watchet , somerset . they recovered the seaman and put him on a stretcher before lowering him in rough seas onto a lifeboat waiting below . however , getting him back to land proved a challenge . david , . who officially retires tomorrow , said : ` we took a doctor , who was also a . crew member , out to the ship and it turned out the sick man had renal . failure . ` we had to get him . ashore fast , but when we got back to watchet the tide was out and we had . to run the boat aground to haul him across some deep mud . ' it was reported that the mud came up to the crew 's thighs . ` it was getting dark as we came back in and we were singing carols ' , david added . ` the ambulance crew came down the harbour steps to help , and meanwhile the boat had drifted away . ` the seaman was taken off and then we had to retrieve the boat . ' how times have changed : volunteers launch a rescue rowing boat using logs in the 1930s . up against it : around 22 people are rescued per day by the rnli , pictured here in the 1930s , costing a staggering # 385,000 to run , but the charity does not receive any state funding . a number of years later the father-of-three was involved in a rescue where he climbed 50ft up the crumbling culver cliff , in the isle of wight , to reach a man who had got stuck . he received a prestigious award and a framed letter of thanks from the lifeboat operations manager for the rescue , which saw him climb the cliff three times . david said : ` when i got to him he was petrified and would n't move so i climbed back down and got the anchor rope and tied it around him and around the rock and he said : ` will it be ok ? ' ' i said :  you 've got two chances . you will be ok .  i lowered him down and then his radio was up on a ledge and i went up and got that as well . ` lifeboat magazine called it  music while you work ' . i was surprised to get the award . ' in 1988 david became a deputy launching authority - making him one of five people authorised to order the boat to sea - and has worked in that position ever since . now david , who still lives in minehead , plans to enjoy his retirement by taking a trip around the country in a caravan with his wife pam . he added : ` volunteering for the rnli just becomes a way of life , i 'm not sure how i 'll spend the free time now , but i definitely want to get a caravan and tour bits of the country i 've missed over the year .
