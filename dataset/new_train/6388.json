' the freelancer , who was in her 20s at the time , said he repeatedly put his hands inside her baggy shorts as far as her hips while making a programme in australia in the mid-1980s . but bruce harris said : ' i would . have shouted at him , i would have demanded that he stopped . but it never . happened , it would never have been something that he would have done . ' i would have taken the elder brother approach to a younger brother misbehaving . ' the former advertising boss said he had never seen rolf behaving inappropriately towards anyone . ` i 've never had any problems with that at all , ' he told the jury . ` i 've never seen him do anything unpleasant to anybody really . rolf harris arrived at court today accompanied by his daughter , bindi harris , left , and niece , jenny harris , right . ` certainly i watched him perform with children - he . and i had started a series of programmes over the years called school . special , where there were literally hundreds and hundreds of children . ` he worked with them and was always very likeable and helpful in helping the children to perform . ` never did he do anything to cause any problems .

' he went on : ' i was n't trying to get her to change her story , if that 's what you mean , i was trying to see whether she could back up what this girl was saying .

' the jury has already heard that ms henkel could not be certain about what happened on the night of the alleged assault , and that speaking to bruce she claimed she ` felt pressured to say that it could n't have taken place ' . bruce harris repeatedly denied trying to influence her , and said if his brother had performed for the theatre group while they were having dinner together , he would have been most focused on doing his show . ' i ca n't believe if he had done a show like that he would have had time or been bothered to do the kind of things that tonya lee has said , ' he told the court . later , a retired tour manager who worked with rolf harris in the 1980s told the court how the entertainer was always ` quiet and nervous ' before he went on stage . ken jeacle , who was also speaking from australia , said : ` usually rolf was quiet and rather nervous . ` he did n't appear to eat terribly much prior to a performance - he was quietly was assessing himself in readiness for the audience .
