{"text": "and kieran corcoran . builders have rubbished claims that thousands of diggers are being buried under london houses when excavation work has finished . it was claimed the equipment is left at the bottom of the luxury homes belonging to london 's super-rich - who are increasingly expanding their properties downwards to get round tight planning regulations . the heavy machinery is needed to hollow out the ground to make way for swimming pools , cinemas , garages and other trappings of wealth . but , according to the new theory , many of the projects are so ambitious the diggers are left with no way to dig their way out again . construction : when basement excavations on london flats are finished , the diggers used are allegedly left in the ground because it is cheaper than bringing it back to street level -lrb- file picture -rrb- . the strategy is often used for major infrastructure projects , such as the channel tunnel , during which one boring machine dug itself into the ground to let the others pass . the strategy could fuel further outrage over the trend for ` iceberg homes ' , which has led wealthy residents of london 's most well-to-do boroughs to complain en masse - even taking their grievances to the high court . construction apparently workers cover the entombed machinery with earth and concrete , leaving it stuck underground instead . earlier this week , ed smith from the new statesman magazine said equipment discarded under london was worth around # 5million . he . wrote : ` first , a crane would have to be hired ; second , the entire . street would need to be closed for a day while the crane was maneuvered into place . ` both of these stages were very expensive , not to mention unpopular among the distinguished local residents . ' the phenomenon reportedly came to light when conversion specialists contracted to build ` sub-basement ' extensions to homes which had already been enlarged found the leftover machinery when they started digging . row : around # 5million worth of equipment is thought to have been discarded around london , but builders say the claims are ` complete nonsense ' however , a top london builder has said that the claims are rubbish - and that the economics do n't stack up because london floorspace is so valuable . don o'sullivan from london developers galliard , has said the claims are rubbish and make no commercial sense . he told the evening standard : . ` with the basement space worth up to # 8,000 per sq ft why would someone . leave such valuable space filled with dumped equipment and fill in . concrete ? ` much more valuable to extract and have as sellable space -- oligarchs are rich but not stupid . ' but if the strategy has migrated to private homes in london , it would be yet another sign . of the heights to which the capital 's property market has soared . the . average london home is now worth # 459,000 , according to the office for . national statistics . extravagant : multi-storey basement extensions - such as the one above planned by tetra pak heir hans rausing - are becoming more and more common . ` it 's shocking ' : actress joan collins says there is ` too much building work going on ' in her london neighbourhood . developers said the loss of expensive equipment would also be costly to property developers and would risk breaking stringent health and safety procedures . kevin o'connor , managing director of cranbrook basement added that the suggestion was ` utterly ludicrous ' and there are always procedures that can make sure the digger is taken out . ` hell ' : queen guitarist brian may has complained about works near his home in kensington . wealthy homeowners are digging downwards rather than sideways or outwards to fit in saunas , swimming pools , gyms , home cinemas and even workers ' quarters . actress joan collins expressed the outrage of many earlier this year , hitting out at her new neighbours in upmarket belgravia - many of whom she said hardly even use their homes . the dynasty actress , 80 , told a residents ' maagzine : ` it 's really sad . i find it shocking . that people are digging down to put in swimming pools and bowling alleys . when they only live here for two or three months of the year .

' also in 2013 , a group of hampstead residents including lord justice leveson instructed lawyers to seek an injunction from the high court to stop their council approving a bid for an underground swimming pool . over the last five years , there have been 800 planning applications for basements in kensington and chelsea alone .", "summary": " equipment is allegedly being left undergound when excavations are finished .   follows the trend of basement extensions underneath london homes .   builders have said claims made last week are ` complete nonsense '   columnist claimed total number of vehicles discarded is worth # 5million .   could fuel opposition to ` iceberg homes ' trend - voice by likes of brian may .
