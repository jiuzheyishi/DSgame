{"text": "after a chaotic day that saw libya pick a new prime minister only for the vote be declared invalid hours later , the volatile north african country appears to have a new premier -- the fifth in more than two years . the general national congress , libya 's transitional parliament , seemed to have selected a new prime minister on sunday , choosing businessman ahmad mitig during a lively legislative session that saw several rounds of voting . but almost as soon as mitig was sworn in , the deputy speaker declared the election invalid . on monday , the congress confirmed mitig as libya 's new prime minister after approving his appointment .  ahmad mitig was appointed head of the transitional government , and asked to form his cabinet and present it to the gnc for a confidence vote within 15 days ,  said a decision signed by congress speaker nuri abu sahmein .  this decision is in effect from date of publication ... and anything that contradicts it is nullified and all those concerned must implement it .  the resolution was numbered as  no. 38  and dated may 4 but published monday . given sunday 's dispute , it was unclear what exactly would happen next . the appointment makes the 42-year-old businessman libya 's fifth and youngest premier since dictator moammar gadhafi was toppled and killed in a 2011 revolution . but the confusion was another blow to a transitional government that has struggled to impose its authority over myriad militia groups that have grown in power and influence since the nato-backed uprising . parliament 's work has been undermined by internal squabbling and threatened by the north african country 's fractious militias , many of whom fought to oust gadhafi but have refused to lay down their arms . sunday 's vote was the latest in several attempts to choose a prime minister . another vote was abandoned last week when armed men stormed congressional headquarters , sending lawmakers fleeing . it took two rounds of voting before mitig emerged as the front-runner for the post on sunday , but he fell short of the 120 votes required in a confidence vote . a power struggle soon erupted in the assembly , with officials giving contradictory versions of the outcome . second deputy speaker saleh al-makhzoum said mitig had clinched 121 votes after voting resumed . but first deputy speaker ezzedin al-awami , who had chaired the first vote , said it was illegal , as he had already declared the session over . both men could be seen arguing in the chamber on television . al-awami took the role of acting speaker during sunday 's session . abu sahmein , who usually chairs parliamentary sessions , disappeared from public view after the prosecutor general reportedly launched an investigation into a leaked video showing him being questioned over a late-night visit by two women to his house . the premier 's post became vacant after interim prime minister abdullah al-thinni resigned last month , citing an attack by gunmen on his family just a month into his term . he continued as caretaker premier until his successor was picked . he had taken over from ali zeidan , who fled the country after he was ousted by deputies over his failure to stop attempts by rebels in the volatile east to sell oil independently of tripoli 's government . many libyans in the oil-producing nation blame political infighting for a lack of progress in libya 's fragile nascent democracy after more than 40 years of one-man rule . a new constitution is in the works -- a process that has been repeatedly delayed by political wrangling -- but many are increasingly frustrated with the lack of economic progress and deteriorating security . to appease the rising popular discontent , the congress has agreed to hold early elections this year for a new legislature that would also produce a new government .", "summary": " ahmad mitig confirmed by congress as fifth prime minister since end of 2011 uprising .   confirmation follows chaotic scenes in parliament on sunday .   tripoli government struggling to impose order in country awash with weapons .   many libyans angry at slow democratic progress , worsening security .
