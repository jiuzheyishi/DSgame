' mr northrop bought the boat in 2001 for # 11,000 after he said he became fed up with living in a run-down estate in bristol . the family moved in almost immediately and began gutting the heavy engine machinery to make room for their new home . more than a decade later the 70ft boat has a much smaller engine and living quarters split over two levels . mr northrop bought the boat in 2001 for # 11,000 after he said he became fed up with living in a run-down estate in bristol . the family had to gut the heavy engine machinery to make room for living-space . currently moored along a tidal estuary near barnstaple , devon , its lower deck boasts a spacious 15ft by 22ft living room , a bathroom and two bedrooms . there is also a computer nook and a music room large enough for music teacher mrs northrop 's grand piano . the upper deck , meanwhile , has been extended upward to house a modern kitchen with a skylight . mr northrop , a californian who moved to england in the late 1980s , generates his electricity through solar panels and a wind turbine with a backup diesel generator . the family process their own sewage and collect rain for drinking water or visit a nearby spring . mr northrop said : ` my wife 's dream was always to run a musical bed and breakfast so she wanted to buy a place to fix up in the countryside . ' i was pretty certain that even a bombed-out doghouse was going to cost more than we ever had and that proved to be the case . ` but i 'd lived on boats before and i said why do n't we buy a big dutch barge and live in it . the tug was the closest we came to finding one . ` it was all engine room back then but i pulled out 30 tonnes of machinery , put back in a much smaller engine and started to convert the rest into living space . ` most of the hard work is now done but there are still bits and pieces left to do .
