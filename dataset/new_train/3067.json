{"text": "` mistake ' : next has removed the t-shirts from its stores following the outcry . fashion chain next has been slammed by christian groups over a graphic ` sinners ' t-shirt which depicts women as sex objects and uses bible references . a twitter storm has erupted over the shirt with one blogger even claiming the shirt , image and message effectively condones rape . the t-shirt carries the headline ` sinners -- the night before ' above the seductive image of a woman in black underwear lying on a bed . the image is surrounded by a series of slogans which read : ` live for the day -- seize the night and all it may hold ' finally , there is a long smallprint passage which carries a number of definitions of sin including one from the bible from epistle to the romans , chapter seven . gareth davies , of christian action research and education , contacted next via its official facebook page to complain about the t-shirt . he asked : ` why are you marketing graphic t-shirts with misogynistic poses of women in underwear and promoting such images using the bible ? ' mr davies said : ` the image itself is very unhelpful . it gives a message about availability and vulnerability of women . they are then using the word sin and words from the bible to suggest this is both naughty but nice . ` the whole concept is wrong-headed and demeaning to women . human dignity should be cherished and women should not be reduced to the level of an object . ' a number of christian and non-religious individuals joined the condemnation using twitter and personal blogs . one female blogger complained the image was effectively soft core pornography that was more the remit of a top shelf magazine than a family store . she said the woman was presented as simply being available for a man 's sexual pleasure . boss : simon wolfson is chief executive of the next chain of stores . most controversially , she described the lines ` live for the day -- seize the night and all it may hold ' as a rape fantasy slogan . the issue of rape has been headline news in recent weeks with comments from the respect mp george galloway and a leading us politician apparently attempting to downplay the crime.mr galloway suggested the women alleging rape against the wikileaks founder julian assange should not be believed.the blogger wrote in an open letter to next : ` in the wake of the summer of rape apologists - galloway , assange et al - the very last thing we need are t-shirts that tell people that a woman is theirs for the seizing . ' other christian commentators on twitter condemned the t-shirt 's images and messages , but rejected any suggestion it condoned rape . director of the family education trust , norman wells , criticised next for stocking the t-shirt . he said : ` it beggars belief that a company that has a well-established reputation as a respectable family store should be marketing such a cheap and tawdry product that demeans women and encourages a casual attitude to sex . ` we hope that next will think again and take the socially responsible step of withdrawing this product rather than risk having its good name dragged through the gutter . ' next is run by simon wolfson , who is a prominent supporter of the conservative party and was made a life peer by david cameron 's government . last night the company admitted it had been a mistake to stock the t-shirt . a spokesman said : ` next has received some customer complaints regarding a man 's t shirt and sweatshirt . on reflection we agree it was a mistake for us to sell these garments and we are therefore removing them from sale .
