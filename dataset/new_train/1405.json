{"text": "a study found people are still most-likely to contact members of their own racial background on dating websites . race still matters when it comes to searching for a partner - at least online , according to a new study . a sociologist has found that members of dating sites are most likely to contact individuals who share their own racial background , on dating websites . professor kevin lewis studied the interaction patterns of 126,134 users of dating website okcupid.com in the u.s. over a two-and-a-half month period . the sociologist , from the university of california , san diego , found the tendency to initiate contact with someone from a shared race , is strongest among asians and indians and . weakest among whites , the study said . professor lewis only took heterosexual interactions ` for apples-to-apples comparison with the majority of previous findings ' into account and only for individuals who identified themselves as one of the website 's five most popular racial categories , including : black , white , asian -lrb- east asian -rrb- , hispanic/latino and indian -lrb- south asian -rrb- . in the study , published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences , he analysed the first message sent and the first reply - only looking at the data about the sender , receiver and time stamp of the message , rather than its content , which was stripped . while he said white people were the most likely to consider relationships with people from other ethnic backgrounds , he said the biggest ` reversals ' in preference , are observed among groups that display the greatest tendency towards in-group bias . professor lewis ' study also found that a person who is contacted by someone from a different racial background for the first time is more likely to reply , which he explains using his theory about ` pre-emptive discrimination ' . ` based on a lifetime of experiences in a . racist and racially segregated society , people anticipate discrimination . on the part of a potential recipient and are largely unwilling to reach . out in the first place , ' he said . the study found that once an individual has replied to a suitor from a different race on an online dating site , they are more likely to cross racial lines and initiate interracial contact in the future . ` but if a person of another race expresses interest in them first , their . assumptions are falsified and they are more willing to take a chance on . people of that race in the future .
