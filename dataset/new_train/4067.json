{"text": "if you have n't been under a rock the past 24 hours -lrb- and if you have been , you have other things to worry about -rrb- , you know that a certain cupertino-based fruit company has finally unveiled its entry into the smartwatch sweepstakes , and , as expected from the house that the late steve jobs built , the new apple watch is a bushel of insanely geektastic features wrapped up in a sleek and eminently gorgeous package . you can get the scoop on what it actually does -lrb- and whether you should drop your hard-earned $ 349  to start  on it -rrb- elsewhere . the question i 'm interested in is whether apple 's long-awaited arrival in the buzzy wearables category finally means that people -- regular people , that is , not pixel-pushing pundits and tesla-driving tech titans -- are ready to wear them . the fact is , while wearables have generated a lot of attention , they 're being used a lot less than the fanfare might suggest . according to the npd group and strategy analytics , only about 14 million fitness bands and activity trackers and about 2 million smartwatches were sold globally over the 12 months ending this past march . -lrb- everything else -- google glass , cloud cameras , digital jewelry , wi-fi socks , connected underwear -- basically represents a rounding error . -rrb- compare that with the number of smartphones sold around the world : 964 million . that 's the difference between a niche product and an emerging necessity . now , there are pretty good reasons why people have so far failed to adopt wearables in droves . the first is that this first generation of devices have been , in the larger scheme of things , pretty useless . or single use , at most : fitness trackers may be invaluable for dedicated dieters and exercise junkies , but most people do n't have room in their personal digital portfolios for another device that does nothing but count steps and calories . it 's one more thing to update , charge , sync and misplace . -lrb- i had a fitbit when it first came out -- accent on the  had .  it 's currently counting turbulence jolts on a plane somewhere between here and shanghai . -rrb- . hands-on with the new apple watch . but the second and most critical reason is that technology needs to reflect demand , not supply . are consumers actually hungry for what you 're cooking ? if they are n't , your smart -lsb- insert device category here -rsb- is an interesting idea , not a product . it 's an answer looking for a question . and it is designed to make nerd fanboys and technology columnists wet their pants , not to change the way ordinary people live . every game-changing innovation , from the horseless carriage to the first cell phone to streaming video on netflix , is one that fulfills a fundamental need so well that it 's hard to imagine what it was like before that innovation arrived . of course , you often do n't realize this until well after the innovation in question has been released . apple 's original iphone , with its featureless oblong form factor and touchscreen-based ui , was derided as an expensive , keyboardless toy . the ipad was dismissed as an oversized iphone with a feminine-hygiene inspired name . both of these ended up completely reinventing their categories and earning apple billions . the apple watch , meanwhile , received a standing ovation when it was unveiled tuesday as the  one more thing  behind apple 's new supersized iphone 6 , and has been generating a near-universal stream of acclaim from the digerati ever since . people across my social network have been focusing their lust on different aspects of the device -- from its fashion-focused interchangeable bands to its ability to serve as a wave-and-enter key for rooms at starwood hotels , to perhaps the weirdest feature it offers : its ability to send a real-time pulsing display of your heartbeat to any contact on your paired iphone . -lrb- at the very least , that 's going to change the face of action cinema . -rrb- . which may answer my original question : while other companies are trying to figure out how to respond to need , apple , more so than any other company , has figured out how to create it . just now , my mom called me to ask if i thought she needed an apple watch , to go along with her new iphone 5c . if you needed an indicator as to whether the wearable revolution is finally here , that 's as good as any .", "summary": " apple unveiled the long-awaited apple watch .   jeff yang : does apple 's foray into wearables mean people are ready for them ?   he says even though wearables are buzzy , consumers have n't flocked to them in droves .   yang : apple , with its focus on design , may have found a way to start the wearables revolution .
