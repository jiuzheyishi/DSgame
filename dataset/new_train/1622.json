{"text": "if you were described as average-looking , you probably would n't see it as a compliment . but perhaps you would be happy if you looked like any of these computer-generated depictions of the ` average woman ' . with flawless skin , youthful faces and bright eyes - these average faces of women from around the world are nothing short of beautiful . the face of the average woman from a variety of countries including england , china and central africa has been deduced by scientists . hundreds of images of women 's faces were laid on top of each other before a computer programme created the average around a focal point of their eyes . they were created from hundreds of pictures of women from all over the world . using a face-averaging tool hosted online by experimental psychologists at university of glasgow , women from 41 different nationalities and ethnicities were used for the experiment . the tool is a modern version of the technique . that anthropologist sir francis galton pioneered in the late 19th century , multiple images were carefully laid over one another using a computer technology . using the eyes of the women as a focus , it then worked out the average look of each woman from every region but analysing their faces . the method - called ` composite portraiture ' - and was first used in the 1880s by sir francis galton . the . social scientist and cousin of charles darwin first created the image . of the average face by superimposing multiple portraits of . individuals . some have been critical of the average images , saying - as the results all appear to be around 20 years old - they do not reflect any age range within a country . those behind the project say that the method averages the shape of the features before blending the images together - hence why there are no blemishes or imperfections . the technique has been used ever since , particularly in the study of ` attractiveness ' - which studies people 's perception of beauty . however , the results have attracted some controversy - with many saying the results do not reflect reality especially as the ` common ' faces are all beautiful . while many agree that it does make sense the women are all pretty - because averages rule out blemishes - many are perplexed that the women all seem to be in her early twenties - not the average age of any nationality . those behind the project say that many of the criticisms are explained by the process . instead . of having a lot of blurry images with undefined features , they say the . method averages the shape of the features before blending the images . together . some anomalies can be explained by how . the pictures were compiled . the prevalence of mousy hair is a result of . blondeness being easily ` diluted ' . other results also suggest that the study has a few imperfections . the . average south african , for example , should not be pale-skinned as only . 9.2 per cent of the population define themselves as white . the project was inspired by south african photographer mike mike 's project called the face of tomorrow and used techniques developed by social scientist francis galton . the project was inspired by the work of south african photographer mike mike - who created a web project several years ago called the face of tomorrow . the project saw the photographer compile a collection of people 's faces from various cities for a final project while he was studying at goldsmith 's university in london . he said : ` sitting on the underground train , i was intrigued by the sheer diversity of the place -- somalis , indians , americans , zimbabweans , scandinavians and a hundred other nationalities vying for their place in the metropolis . ' i thought :  what is this place , what is a londoner ?  ' i thought if one could merge all the people in a place like london one would be looking at the future of that place -- one would have some notion of what a londoner is or will become . ' anthropologist . sir francis galton - who was also the cousin of charles darwin - . pioneered the method of ` composite portraiture ' in the 1880s . he superimposed multiple portraits of individuals ' faces together to create an average . all of the portraits were registered on the subject 's eyes and the rest of the face was created around them . the . faces have been the topic of fierce debate over the last hundred years , . with much psychological research focusing on the attractiveness of the . face and why different people find one more attractive than the other . other . psychologists , including sigmund freud in his work on dreams , picked up . galton 's suggestion that these composites might represent a useful . metaphor for an ideal type or a concept of a ` natural kind ' . to . this day , the method is still used by scientists studying . attractiveness and beauty - although computer programmes have replaced . much of the original methods used at the turn of the 19th century .", "summary": " pictures of hundreds of women were used to create an average .   images of women from 41 different ethnicities were laid over one another before a computer programme deduced the common look .   created by online tool hosted by experimental psychologists at the .   university of glasgow .
