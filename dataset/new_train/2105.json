{"text": "match-fixing is a  disease  that could kill football , a top official at the sport 's world governing body told cnn on wednesday . earlier this month fifa handed lifetime bans to 41 south korean players who had been involved in prearranging matches . it followed december 's suspension of the president of the south african football association ahead of an investigation into match-fixing in the country prior to it hosting the 2010 world cup .  i really think that it 's a disease and a threat which is on a worldwide basis ,  fifa 's general secretary jerome valcke told cnn in an exclusive interview .  it 's not just about africa . it is in asia , it is in europe , it is in north america , it is in canada , it is in south america . it 's all around the world that this match-fixing , or match manipulation , is active .  valcke was speaking after european football chief michel platini branded match-fixing the greatest threat to the future of football in an interview with a french radio station . platini had warned that football is  dead  if the outcome of matches is prearranged , a statement valcke echoed by saying the appeal of the sport lies in its unpredictability .  if you know the end of the party , of the game , then definitely football is dead ,  he said .  that 's the beauty of the game , you never know who will be the winner .  it can be the team you think would win , but it can also be the other team , the opponent who can make it because it 's just played on one goal . so that 's why we have to protect football as much as we can .  valcke warned that the fight against the highly lucrative match-fixing business could take 10 years , and urged anyone with knowledge of such activity to come forward . in may 2011 fifa announced it would donate over $ 25 million to interpol over 10 years -- the largest grant the world police organization had ever received from a private body -- with a view to tackling corruption .  when i was in rome where we had this meeting with interpol and 50 of the 53 of the european associations , i heard that the business of match manipulation per year is around 100 billion . i do n't know it is in euros or u.s. -lrb- dollars -rrb- , but whatever , it is 100 billion , it 's an amazing figure ,  valcke said .  i think it will be a very , very long fight and it will be very difficult to win . and if we want to win , it is all together . also i told some media in south africa , if you are aware of anything you should tell us . we have to fight all .  all the people who love football should be together towards match-fixing . but it will not be a fight of one day as we have other fights which have been there already . and match manipulation will be another fight that will be there for the next decade .  former interpol director ralf mutschke replaced fifa 's former head of security chris eaton -- who joined a qatar-based sports security consultancy -- in june last year , tasked with tackling the scourge of match-fixing . in the past fifa 's own governance has been questioned . corruption watchdog transparency international cut its ties with the body in 2011 when two of its recommendations -- that the investigator charged with overseeing fifa would be compromised if he was paid by fifa and that he should be allowed to investigate old corruption scandals -- were dropped .  there is no limit in what we have to do in order to make sure we can eradicate match-fixing one day in our game ,  valcke said .  or at least to make sure that match-fixing is not a threat anymore to our game .
