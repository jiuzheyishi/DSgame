{"text": "so where , exactly , is edward snowden ? president vladimir putin knows . but russia 's chief snooper is n't telling . not exactly , anyway . the ex-kgb officer and master of doublespeak described snowden as a  free man  -lrb- biding his time in a  transit area  in moscow 's sheremetyo airport . so free , of course , that the young american ex-surveillance officer -- watched around the clock by hawkish russian security agents - has become as ubiquitously and transparently invisible as the brightly lit subject of a dystopian kafka story . read more : how to hide your data from internet . snowden is n't alone in his fate . the truth is that anyone who uses the internet is also all in that brightly lit  transit area .  i 'm afraid we are all in danger of becoming edward snowden now .  mr. snowden really did fly into moscow ,  putin said , with just the glimmer of a secret policeman 's smile .  for us it was completely unexpected .  oh , yes , it must have been totally unexpected . so unexpected , indeed , that the area between passport control and the arrival gates in sheremetyo airport has been transformed into a high security hotel designed to both shield snowden from public view and to watch him . yes , sheremetyo is beginning to mirror the internet , a vast all-seeing digital panopticon , a network in which somebody might be watching everything we do , a place where individual privacy no longer exists . and snowden 's fate -- of being watched around the clock , of having zero privacy -- could easily become all of our fates . opinion : in digital age , everyone is becoming a spook . ironically , it 's snowden himself who has most clearly revealed to us our fate . in secret national security agency -lrb- nsa -rrb- documents which snowden gave to the guardian newspaper , we now know that for more than two years , the obama administration allowed the nsa , to continue -- as the newspaper put it --  collecting vast amounts of records detailing the email and internet usage of americans .  doublespeak is n't , of course , unique to the russian security apparatchik . the americans are pretty skilled at it too .  i 'm not going to say we 're not collecting any internet metadata ,  thus one obama adminstration official told the washington post . but , as the guardian notes , the distinction between metadata and data is mostly semantic . the truth is that the nsa has been data-mining us all of us to death -- americans and foreigners alike -- in their paranoid search for enemies of the american state . last year i wrote a book warning about this and called it  digital vertigo  -- in homage to alfred hitchcock 's nightmarish movie about a san francisco private eye whose life is destroyed by both surveillance and voyeurism . some people said i was exaggerating . now they know i was n't . by being able to read our emails and internet usage , by harvesting over a trillion metadata records , the nsa knows absolutely everything about us . they know our tastes , what we think , where we go , what we eat , how we sleep , when we are angry , when we are sad . they have become our eyes and our brains . hitchcock 's 20th century movie about surveillance and voyeurism really has become the truth about 21st century digital life . more from andrew keen : should we fear mind-reading future tech ? it 's almost as if the agents at the nsa have become as omniscient as google or facebook . the really terrifying thing about snowden 's revelations is the doublethink articulated by the silicon valley technology companies whose pipes and platforms have been hijacked by the snooping nsa bureaucrats . google , facebook and the rest all , of course , claim , in the sophisticatedly obtuse doublespeak of their lawyers , both ignorance and innocence about the nsa allegations . but , as techcrunch founder mike arrington notes , the truth about silicon valley 's complicity is this horror story is much murkier , much more like the dark transit area in sheremetyo airport where vladimir putin 's spooks are monitoring snowden 's every movement . silicon valley 's fetish with radical transparency , with encouraging us to broadcasting everything we do and think , is destroying our privacy . and without privacy , i warn , our individuality , the very thing that defines us as unique human-beings , is fatally compromised . snowden 's fate , whether he ends up in ecuador or guantanamo or stays in sheremetyo airport , is to be watched by spooks for the rest of his life . snowden , the  free man  in putin 's doublespeak , will never truly be alone again . to avoid becoming edward snowden , we need to be much more critical of the invasiveness of silicon valley 's big data companies . we must recognize the creepiness of all-seeing location devices like google glass . most of all , we need to remember that the internet is never really private so our most intimate thoughts are best kept to ourselves . visibility is a trap . remaining free in our digital age requires us to be alone . we have to teach the internet how to forget . we must build an off-switch to the internet , to reinvent it as a dark space , a place where nobody can know what anyone else is doing .", "summary": " snowden is stuck in the transit zone in moscow , watched by russian security services .   keen : presumably it is his fate to be watched for the rest of his life wherever he ends up .   keen says we are with him , as we embrace devices that monitor all our activities .
