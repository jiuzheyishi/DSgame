{"text": "san diego when asked over the years if he can use executive power to stop deporting illegal immigrants , president barack obama has responded : yes , we can ! other times , the answer was : no we ca n't ! this week , at the betty ann ong chinese recreation center in san francisco , obama was heckled by an audience member who was later identified as ju hong , an undocumented student from south korea who graduated from the university of california at berkeley with a degree in political science . when hong pleaded with obama to put the brakes on deportations and stop separating families , obama responded : .  now , what you need to know , when i 'm speaking as president of the united states and i come to this community , is that if , in fact , i could solve all these problems without passing laws in congress , then i would do so . but we 're also a nation of laws . that 's part of our tradition .  but , on october 26 , 2011 , at the university of colorado-denver , obama said this when talking to students about using an executive order to reduce student loan debt .  we 're not going to wait for congress . i 'm going to act with or without congress . where they wo n't act , i will , through a series of executive orders . ... we 're going to look every day to see what we can do without congress .  and on october 25 , 2010 , on the spanish-language radio show ,  piolin por la manana  -- when host eddie  piolin  sotelo asked him why he had n't moved faster on immigration reform , obama responded : .  i am president , i am not a king . i ca n't do these things just by myself . we have a system of government that requires the congress to work with the executive branch to make it happen .  yet , two years later , while facing re-election and eager to reignite support among latinos , obama managed to get something done without congress ' approval . on june 15 , 2012 , he announced that his administration was offering deferred action for childhood arrivals to allow undocumented young people to temporarily avoid deportation and apply for a two-year work permit . speaking from the rose garden , obama said : .  it makes no sense to expel talented young people who , for all intents and purposes , are americans . ... in the absence of any immigration action from congress to fix our broken immigration system , what we 've tried to do is focus our immigration enforcement resources in the right places . ... effective immediately , the department of homeland security is taking steps to lift the shadow of deportation from these young people .  confused ? join the club . obama 's immigration schtick is simple . he blames republicans for the fact that we do n't have immigration reform . h3 covers up for democrats in congress who have had a poor record on immigration . he insists that his administration is not deporting dreamers or anyone else who is n't a hard-core criminal . and -- as he did this week -- he claims that his hands are tied because he needs congress as a dance partner . so if a president takes action without congress , he violates the law ? but this is n't true . there 's such a thing as the executive order . obama has issued 164 executive orders on such things as climate change and student debt . it 's a well-worn presidential tool -- george w. bush issued 287 ; bill clinton issued 308 . in his most recent use of executive power , obama is attempting to tinker with the requirements of the affordable care act so that americans can keep their health plans a while longer . the point : when it comes to using the power of the presidency for causes he really cares about , obama is no shrinking violet . so he must not care about immigration . the audience in san francisco was n't buying it . hong shouted at the president that he had  the power to stop deportations for all  because there are  thousands of families separated every single day .  the actual figure is about 1,100 deportations every day if apprehensions and deportations keep pace with the rate in previous years -- roughly 400,000 per year , totaling a record of nearly 2 million since obama took office . obama pushed back against hong , insisting that he did n't have the power to stop deporting people or dividing families .  that 's why we 're here ,  he said . other people in the crowd sided with hong and began to shout :  stop deportations ! yes , we can !  on the defensive , obama unleashed the left 's favorite weapon : condescension .  so the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like i can do something by violating our laws ,  he said .  what i 'm proposing is the harder path , which is to use our democratic process to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve . but it wo n't be as easy as just shouting . it requires us lobbying and getting it done .  you know what is an easy way out , mr. president ? not being constrained by core principles because you change your position whenever you need to get out of a scrape . after the exchange , hong claimed that he had n't planned to challenge the president of the united states , but that he could n't take it anymore .  this is very urgent ,  he told reporters .  this is the only venue where i could speak out , and i 'm representing the voices of other undocumented students who are actually in the detention center right now and who can not be here .  bravo . this young man is a hero for bravely speaking truth to power . way to represent . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of ruben navarrette .", "summary": " heckler wanted president obama to stop deportations with executive order .   ruben navarrette : obama said he could n't make law , yet he has used executive orders before .   navarrette : obama created the deferred action for childhood arrivals without congress ' ok .   navarrette says obama acts without congress only on issues important to him .
