' the toxoplasma parasite , which has flu-like symptoms , can be deadly , causing spontaneous abortion in pregnant women or killing immune-compromised patients , but it has a zombie-like effect in mice . ms ingram speculates the parasite could directly alter neurons involved in memory and learning in mice , or it could trigger a damaging host response , as in many human autoimmune diseases . she became interested in the parasite after reading about its behaviour-altering effects in mice and possible effects in its common host - the cat - as well as humans . one-third of people around the world have been infected with toxoplasma and probably have dormant cysts in their brains . kept in check by the body 's immune system , these cysts sometimes revive in immune-compromised people , leading to death , and some preliminary studies suggest that chronic infection may be linked to schizophrenia or suicidal behaviour . infected mice lose their fear of cats , which is good for both cats and the parasite , because the cat gets an easy meal and the parasite gets into the cat 's intestinal track , the only place it can sexually reproduce and continue its cycle of infection . pregnant women are already warned to steer clear of cat litter , since the parasite is passed through cat faeces and can cause blindness or death in the fetus . one main source of spread is undercooked pork , ms ingram said . she is now looking at how the mouse immune system attacks the parasite to see whether the host 's response to the infection is the culprit . ms ingram said : ` the idea that this parasite knows more about our brains than we do , and has the ability to exert desired change in complicated rodent behavior , is absolutely fascinating . ` toxoplasma has done a phenomenal job of figuring out mammalian brains in order to enhance its transmission through a complicated life cycle . '", "summary": " a university of california , berkeley study found the three most common strains .   of toxoplasma make mice less fearful of cats for at least four .   months .   researchers believe the animals ' lack of fear occurs within three weeks of infection but the behavioral change persists in the absence of parasite cysts .   the toxoplasma parasite can be deadly , causing spontaneous abortion in pregnant women or killing immune-compromised patients .
