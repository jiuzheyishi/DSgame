{"text": "lucky that these school kids ca n't vote ! new jersey governor told students at a school in the state that he 's a dallas cowboys fan . while talking to students at samsel upper elementary school in parlin , new jersey , governor christie was asked which teams he supports . he revealed that he roots for the knicks , mets and rangers . scroll down for video ... sports fan : governor christie is a sports fan but when it comes to american football he does n't support the new york jets or the giants . excuses : the governor said that when he was growing up the new york area teams were n't very good , so he chose one that was - the dallas cowboys . ` now the last answer is one of the things that gets all of my political advisers nervous , ' christie said . ` my favorite football team is not the new york giants . ' there was a stir in the assembly hall at hearing the news . ` it is not the new york jets ... and it is not the philadelphia eagles , ' christie continued with the students on tenterhooks . little chat : the governor had already admitted to being a fan of the cowboys -- as well as the more locally acceptable new york mets , knicks and rangers -- back in 2010 . glory supporter ? of course , there are plenty of other reasons why the governor may be a keen supporter of the dallas cowboys ... ` get ready now . my favorite football team are the dallas cowboys ... which by the way is not the smartest thing for the governor of new jersey to want to be is a fan of the dallas cowboys . ' there was uproar in the hall and the students booed loudly . governor christie could only shake his head as he listened in amusement . the governor explained that his father was a giants fan but he grew up a fan of the cowboys and roger staubach . ` the giants and the jets pretty much stunk when i was a kid , ' christie said . ` and my father was a giants fan and i used to remember watching him when i was eight , nine-years-old . every sunday , he would watch the giants and yell at the tv set . i used to think to myself , why would i want to root for a team that makes you angry ? so i decided not to and the cowboys were really good back then . ' christie 's support of an out-of-state team may lead some to question how much he values loyalty in his life . many republicans took issue with the fact that christie met with and praised president obama just days before the 2012 election after hurricane sandy hit . christie , a popular governor widely seen as a possible republican contender in 2016 , frustrated some in the romney campaign who feared he had given what was a critical boost to obama , a democrat . ` if the president of united states comes here and he 's willing to help my people and he does it then i 'm gon na say nice things about him because he 's earned it . ' ` obama provided help to my people at one of the worst crises that this state has ever faced , ' christie added . ` when somebody does a good job , they deserve credit . '", "summary": " governor : ` the giants and the jets pretty much stunk when i was a kid , '   ` my father used to yell at the tv set so i followed the giants who were good back then '   will lead many to question christie 's loyalty once again after he backed president obama in the wake of hurricane sandy prior to the 2012 election .
