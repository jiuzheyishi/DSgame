{"text": "with a manager as combustible and as clever as jose mourinho , you always know that he is going to blow at some stage of the season . by highlighting anthony taylor 's performance at southampton , where the referee gave cesc fabregas a yellow card for diving , mourinho created some hysteria . that was a carefully orchestrated move by mourinho , delivering the same message in each of his post-match press conferences with equal conviction . jose mourinho 's comments about referee anthony taylor were a calculated move designed to heap pressure on officials in the all-important premier league title run-in , possibly to chelsea 's benefit . mourinho criticised taylor after cesc fabregas was booked for diving during chelsea draw at southampton . fabregas was infuriated by taylor 's decision , believing he was fouled and deserved a penalty . at face value it looked like he was trying to attack pundits , experts and analysts . by turning his fire on them , and away from the referee , he avoided an fa charge . but his real target was referees . the title race could be decided by a referee 's decision and mourinho wants to influence them . at white hart lane on new year 's day , phil dowd is on notice and will be well aware that chelsea have not been awarded a penalty away from stamford bridge this season . that is an incredible statistic . dowd is one of the most volatile referees in the barclays premier league . whenever he booked me he would flash the card so quickly that it felt he was about to punch me . dowd treats players like little boys and can inflame and aggravate situations . he really used to wind me up . this is a big test for him , a big night at white hart lane for tottenham , and it comes just a few weeks after mauricio pochettino 's team lost 3-0 at stamford bridge . speaking on sky sports , mourinho claimed that officials have a ` campaign ' against chelsea . the chelsea boss clearly feels that decisions have gone against his team at key moments this season . fabregas reacts with incredulity after being booked for simulation after going down in the area . chelsea currently have a three-point advantage at the top of the barclays premier league . dowd 's last chelsea match was their 1-1 draw at old trafford . he sent off branislav ivanovic in the 90th minute and robin van persie equalised 45 seconds later . if there are any tricky decisions to be made tonight , dowd might have jose 's comments ringing in his ears . mourinho is a brilliant team builder . he quickly identifies areas he needs to improve and creates a cause like no other manager in the premier league . it can work as a real positive energy . he is a trophy hunter and there is a lot of silverware to be won before he is done with english football . but his team , for all their quality , are stuttering on their travels after losing at newcastle and drawing at sunderland and southampton . it is easy to criticise a referee , to distract people from a performance , but i believe his recent comments were deliberate because he showed restraint . he did just enough to create headlines and debate -- and to get inside the heads of referees . mourinho is a master manipulator , using situations to his advantage , and he knows the pressure is on chelsea in the second half of the season . manchester city are lurking in striking distance . at some stage his dressing room will feel tension because they are leading from the front and are expected to win their first premier league title since he returned to chelsea . boot room preview for tottenham vs chelsea on new year 's day . mourinho was left furious after branislav ivanovic was sent off in the late stages at old trafford . robin van persie scored united 's equaliser seconds after ivanovic was sent off at old trafford . at arsenal we had all sorts of little psychological ploys to gain an advantage before kick-off . mourinho works the same way . we would never come out of the dressing room at highbury until the opposition were waiting for us in the tunnel . we are arsenal , we decide when we come out . in matches against manchester united i would deliberately shield the officials as they came off the pitch at half-time so that sir alex ferguson could not get to them . in games of this magnitude , you will seize upon any little advantage . mourinho must keep his players onside , convince them that they are the best team as they enter this crucial second half of the season . chelsea players do dive . they have had four yellow cards for simulation this season and there is a reason for that -- our eyes are not deceiving us . clearly , though , mourinho wants to create an ` us against the world ' mentality . eden hazard kept chelsea on track with his equalising goal at southampton on sunday . fabregas is brought down by southampton 's matt targett in the incident that started the debate . mourinho goes mad on the touchline after chelsea appeals for a penalty are waved away . that attitude can really bond a group because if you feel you are hard done by , you are even more determined to play well . the other , more subtle impact is on referees . there is no doubt mourinho makes comments like these to increase the pressure on officials . still , complaining in such exaggerated terms about chelsea being victimised does not cast him in a good light . his team are top of the league and playing some of the best football ever seen at stamford bridge . he does n't need to complain , just win matches . no-one wants to see a whingeing manager win trophies and as brilliant as mourinho is -- he 's one of the best -- he might want to keep a lid on what he is saying . when he came back to stamford bridge he talked about staying a long time . to do that he needs to make friends , not enemies . just when we were starting to like him again he overstepped the mark at southampton . he has self-destructed at previous clubs and had to leave . he ca n't afford to do the same again . there is n't a campaign or witch-hunt against chelsea but mourinho has stepped up the pressure on match officials at a crucial stage of the season . tonight it will be fascinating to see how dowd handles it .", "summary": " jose mourinho alleged a campaign by referees against chelsea this week .   it came after cesc fabregas was booked for diving at southampton .   referee anthony taylor later said sorry to mourinho for not giving penalty .   but mourinho 's comments are a carefully orchestrated move .   the portuguese is making a deliberate
