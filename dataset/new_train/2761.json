{"text": "there were always three possible scenarios for new jersey gov. chris christie and bridgegate : . one , that he was explicitly involved in the shutting down of three lanes feeding the george washington bridge in fort lee , new jersey , as political retribution against a no-name mayor who did n't endorse him in an election christie ran away with . two , that he was marginally involved , in that he told staffers to  take care of  the problem mayor but was n't specific about the actions to take . and three , that he was n't involved at all ; that an appointee at the port authority and staffers in his office cooked this up unbeknownst to him , did n't tell him and repeatedly lied to him about their involvement until e-mails proved otherwise . wednesday , many assumed the third option impossible , admittedly including me . it 's christie , we said . it 's politics , we said . it 's ... new jersey , we said . nonetheless , that 's exactly the story christie 's going with , and in his two-hour news conference , he did a tremendous job convincing me , at least , that he really was blindsided by the news . and as apologies go , he hit all the right notes : . i 'm sorry . i 'm responsible . i 'm sad . i 'm embarrassed . he stuck around for an hour and a half answering reporter questions . he admitted the buck stops with him . he fired two staffers immediately . he said he planned on meeting with the jilted fort lee mayor and with fort lee residents to apologize directly to them . in contrast to other well-known news conferences , it was one of the best mea culpas in recent memory . but he 's not out of the woods yet . democrats would very much like to hang christie on this , and they will not be satisfied with the  it was n't me  defense . if there 's any dirt , any inkling that he had knowledge of this , they 'll find it and destroy him over it . this is sure to be a sideshow for the next few weeks , if not months , as investigators look into exactly how this happened . and even if it turns out christie 's hands are clean , it still wo n't paint a pretty picture of politics in trenton . he 's also heading up the republican governors association , a post that requires him to regularly raise funds and speak alongside other republican governors . christie said in his news conference that this would n't affect his job at the rga , but that 's pretty naive . what governor wants to share a stage , at least in the short term , with a guy embroiled in a seedy , petty political scandal ? in the long term , however , if christie is telling the truth , this is perfectly survivable . if he 's not ... well today 's performance was oscar-worthy -- and fatal . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of se cupp .", "summary": " s.e. cupp saw three scenarios : 1 . christie knew directly about bridge payback . 2 . he knew obliquely .   third possibility : he was in the dark . she says this is the one he went with , convincingly .   she says news conference hit all right notes ; opponents will still try to hang him with issue .   cupp : if he 's telling truth , his career should survive ; if he is n't , issue will be fatal .
