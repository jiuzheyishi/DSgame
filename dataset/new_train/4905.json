{"text": "so it looks like michael dunn , a white man who fatally shot black teenager jordan davis for refusing to turn down his  thug music ,  may be going to prison for the rest of his life . but that 's a consolation prize . not a real victory . it 's not a real victory because the jury that convicted dunn , 47 , did n't convict him for killing the 17-year-old davis . they convicted him for almost killing davis ' three friends who were riding in the dodge durango with him . they found dunn guilty of three counts of second-degree attempted murder and one count of shooting deadly missiles . each attempted murder count carries a minimum sentence of 20 years . but it 's a hollow victory . it 's hollow because it means that , in 21st century america , the notion that a mouthy young black male could be a threat carries more weight with some people than the fact that an impulsive middle-aged white man could be a liar . think about it . apparently someone on the dunn jury -- a jury that took four days to deadlock on whether dunn was justified in killing davis -- believed that davis ' cursing at dunn and arguing over the volume of his music equaled a serious enough threat to make dunn reasonably fear for his life . gunman ` in disbelief ' over loud-music verdict . someone on that jury saw davis with a shotgun that likely never existed , but did n't see the real bullets -- 10 in all -- that dunn pumped into the suv and into davis ' body , bullets that left davis bleeding and dying in his friend 's lap . it 's hollow because it underscores what seems to be a scary trend . i guess now any random white man can confront a black teenager whose style of dress or music he does n't like or views as suspect . and when that teenager does n't submit to him , or responds to him in a confrontational manner , or in a way that any rebellious teenager is apt to respond , then it 's perfectly fine to exterminate him . see evidence in case . we first saw this with trayvon martin . martin was walking to his father 's home when george zimmerman took it upon himself to follow him because he was wearing a hoodie . yet just as zimmerman thought martin looked suspicious , the 17-year-old thought zimmerman looked suspicious . but when martin responded to zimmerman 's stalking and wound up in a fight with him , zimmerman fatally shot him . and he got away with it . zimmerman claimed self-defense . in a confrontation that he provoked . so did dunn with davis . dunn took it upon himself to drive up to a convenience store in jacksonville and , even with a number of empty spaces available , decide to park next to the one vehicle full of young black men playing some thumping hip-hop music . rather than avoid music he hated , he parked right next to it . and when davis did n't submit to his wishes to turn it down , he did n't like it . they had words . he did n't like that . michael dunn was not going to be sassed by a black kid . so dunn reached into his glove compartment , pulled out his 9 mm handgun and started shooting at davis and his friends . and he killed him . verdict evokes mixed reactions . yet this jury believed that the unarmed black teenager , jordan davis , was so scary , so profane that they could n't see their way to convict dunn of murdering him . so even though dunn is going to prison , it 's tough to feel good about the verdict . it feels hollow . what the verdict says is that in this nation , in the 21st century , some white men still believe they have the right to intrude into the space of young black men and make demands . and if the black man is unarmed -- with no weapon except his words -- those white men can still kill him . and call it self-defense . all they need is a jury to buy it .", "summary": " tonyaa weathersbee calls the verdict in the michael dunn murder case a hollow victory .   dunn admitted firing into an suv , killing jordan davis , 17 , but said it was in self-defense .   dunn was found guilty of three counts of second-degree attempted murder .   the florida jury could not reach a verdict in the murder charge for davis ' death .
