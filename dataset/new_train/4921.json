{"text": "managed to knock down his obstacles and maneuver his way up the washington food chain . if a few bodies were left in his wake -- figuratively and , in one case , literally -- well , the ends justify the means . as underwood noted in the very first episode as he put a wounded dog out of its misery ,  i have no patience for useless things .  but that 's not to say that underwood does n't also want to make the system work . in an interview last fall with cnn , showrunner beau willimon explained that underwood , at heart , is  an optimist ,  though he understands the darker view . ` house of cards ' creator willimon plays a solid hand .  where i think people mistake his optimism for cynicism is that he 's unapologetically self-interested . he believes ideology is a form of weakness -- a form of cowardice ,  willimon said . the writer and producer observes that one of the character 's models is lyndon johnson , known for his shrewd knowledge of the legislative process both as a senator and as president . willimon added that  house of cards  is n't necessarily a show about politics , despite its washington setting . it 's a show about power -- in all its manifestations .  that power is displayed in our love lives , or our work environments , the way we comport ourselves when randomness brushes up against us ,  he says . and , he adds , power can be more useful than money :  power has no limits if you 're willing to go far enough in order to get as much of it as you can .  ` mr. macbeth goes to washington ' ? naturally , willimon and his stars have been tight-lipped about how far underwood will take things in a show the kansas city star nicknamed  mr. macbeth goes to washington .  trailers and tidbits , however , offer some tantalizing hints . there 's a suggestion that underwood could be implicated in a murder investigation . perhaps barnes might be locating her ethics . a new york times magazine profile of willimon mentioned a  super-duper-double-major spoiler .  and underwood appears headed for a showdown with wealthy industrialist -- and fellow power broker -- raymond tusk -lrb- gerald mcraney -rrb- , a friend of the president . just as intriguing is the future of underwood 's wife , claire . in the first season 's early episodes , she seemed more troubled by unethical behavior than her husband ; after all , she was a lobbyist for environmental issues . but that changed as she found her own livelihood threatened . in this , she is much like her husband , said wright .  she is a pragmatist in the art of war ,  the actress told the new york times . however the second season concludes ,  house of cards  has already been a winner . netflix spent $ 100 million to produce the show 's first two seasons . in return , the show was nominated for eight emmy awards last fall , winning three , and netflix 's subscriber base and stock price have both hit new highs . the service has quickly become a major player for original programming , with last summer 's  orange is the new black  also earning raves . the company recently renewed  house of cards  for a third season . in the meantime , one can only wonder whether a better shakespearean parallel for underwood is  othello 's  iago , dropping poisoned hints in the president 's ear . all willimon will promise is the show will hold on to its darkness .  there are people who do n't like the level of darkness , who find the characters unsympathetic ,  he told the times magazine .  and we need to own that .
