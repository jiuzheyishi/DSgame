{"text": "walking into a pyongyang hospital room to greet her imprisoned son , myunghee bae was overcome with emotion . talking exclusively to cnn , bae said it was a  very happy moment . at the same time , i could not believe he was a prisoner in north korea ; a new realization .  bae was granted a five-day visa to north korea and three short visits with her son , kenneth ; a total of six hours , in which she says there was not one moment 's silence .  he said he 's being treated very fairly ,  she said .  he was taken to a special labor camp , so he was the only prisoner , and a whole lot of people have to stay with him , guards and doctors .  bae from north korean prison : please help me . kenneth bae , an american citizen , was arrested in november of last year and sentenced in may to 15 years of hard labor . the north korean regime says he was found guilty of  hostile acts  and attempts to topple the government . his mother says he has a profound love for the country and its people , and any offense he caused was not intentional .  always , he wanted to help the people over there , help the country ,  she said .  he always thought that way , but apparently he misunderstood their system , so a lot of things he realized -- he did some harm to their country .  bae added that her son 's christian faith was so strong , he wanted to convey his feelings . north korea is officially an atheist state and has punished missionaries in the past . although bae was unable to meet with north korean officials to plead her son 's case , she wants to make her message to them clear :  please give him mercy and give him amnesty to send him home . we apologize as a family on his behalf , but his health can not sustain any longer if he is sent back to the labor camp again .  kenneth bae , american imprisoned in north korea , moved to hospital . bae was forced to work in the camp for three months until his health deteriorated . his mother says his illnesses include diabetes , an enlarged heart , gallstones , back and neck pains , and high cholesterol . bae says he looked better when she met him than he appeared in the footage of his hospitalization in august . but that brings its own concerns .  my worst fear is to send him back to the labor camp because his health seems a little bit improved , that 's my worst fear . because i do n't think his body can endure eight hours labor a day , six days a week .  previous americans detained in north korea have been released when high-profile visitors have traveled to the country to plead their case . most notably , former presidents bill clinton and jimmy carter went on two separate occasions in 2010 . bae believes her son 's case has not encouraged such attention , as relations between washington and pyongyang hit a new low this year . myunghee bae says it has been an agonizing 11 months , not only for her , but also for kenneth bae 's wife and three children .  they all had a very hard time , and i think we all as a family felt helpless . we could not do anything for him , only sending letters ... we do n't have any power to bring him home .  the most heart-breaking part of the trip for bae was leaving pyongyang and walking out of the hospital without her son .  it was very hard ; i can not express my pain and my heartache to leave him behind as a prisoner in north korea . how long will it take to see him again ?
