{"text": "with a happy grin on her face , malone farrow nestles into her husband - the man whom she credits for helping to put the troubling memories of her childhood behind her . at the age of 28 , the adopted daughter of woody allen and mia farrow has settled down and is a college graduate , writer and artist , married to an information-technology specialist . malone - who changed her name from dylan - says he helped her recover from a childhood which she claims was marred when she was molested by award-winning director allen when she was seven . breaking her silence last year , she told maureen orth in november 's vanity fair : ` he 's the best thing that ever happened to me . i would not be functioning without him . ' it is this case that was brought back into the public eye yet again last night when allen was honoured with the cecil b. demille award at the golden globes - much to the chagrin of his son ronan farrow and ex mia farrow , who were quick to react with disgust . love : mia farrow expressed her love for daughter malone by posting a picture of her and her husband on her twitter account in september 2012 . the couple wed in 2010 . family portrait : mia farrow holds son satchel - now known as ronan - in her arms , while ex woody allen holds their daughter dylan - now known as malone . lashing out : ronan and mia farrow , pictured in may 2012 , slammed woody allen on twitter on sunday . ronan , 26 , whom mia recently revealed could in fact be the biological son of . her first husband frank sinatra , lashed out on twitter as allen 's long-time collorator and ex-girlfriend diane keaton made a lengthy and gushing tribute to the blue jasmine director . ` missed the woody allen tribute - did . they put the part where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at . age 7 before or after annie hall ? ' he tweeted . in august 1992 , malone told her mother that allen had touched her inappropriately and kissed her all over in the attic at mia 's connecticut country home . allen , 78 , has always denied the claims . however , malone stands by the allegations and told orth she bitterly regrets not standing up herself in court , insisting : ' i have never been asked to testify . if i could talk to the seven-year-old dylan , i would tell her to be brave , to testify . ' she claims that allen told her it was their secret , but said it made her feel that she was a ` bad kid ' , stating she told her mother because she was ` cracking ' and wanted the alleged abuse to stop . speaking to vanity fair , malone recounted her childhood and revealed that even the sight of a fellow student at school wearing a woody allen t-shirt had once left her in a ` fit of vomiting ' . she told writer orth that she will never utter her father 's name , adding : ` there 's a lot i do n't remember , but what happened in the attic i remember . i remember what i was wearing and what i was n't wearing . ' orth added : ' i asked her if what she had said happened in the attic happened more than once ' , only for malone to reply : ` that was isolated . the rest was just everyday weirdness - the weird routine i thought was normal . ' she called her fears of her father ` crippling ' and said : ` i 'm scared of him , his image . nobody wants to think this legendary filmmaker is my worst nightmare . that 's what scares me , when i picture things chasing me or happening -- i think it 's him after me . it 's hard to explain how terrifying that is . ' justice elliott wilk dropped the . case in 1993 . he awarded custody of malone - then dylan - to mia and . denied allen immediate visitation with her . he allowed mia 's son moses to decide for himself whether he wanted to . see his adoptive father again , and he increased ronan 's - then satchel 's . - visits to three a week , supervised . the . judge concluded that allen demonstrated no parenting skills and was . ` self-absorbed , untrustworthy , and insensitive . ' allen appealed , but the . opinion was upheld . and he lost his visits with satchel in 1996 due to . his son 's ` phobic reaction ' of him . the judge then ruled dylan would . never have to see him either and both brother and sister have since had no relationship with their father . malone married her husband in 2010 and it 's obvious that mia is hugely proud of her daughter , posting a touching picture twitter in september 2012 with the note : ` my daughter malone & her husband . happiness . love . ' strong words : woody 's son and ex-girlfriend were n't happy about him receiving an honour at the golden globes . it is a far cry from malone 's childhood , in which she recounted struggling with depression and even making a suicide attempt . malone 's claims were made in 1992 - a year after mia and allen separated when . the actress discovered the director was having a sexual relationship . with her adopted daughter soon-yi . the couple are now married and have two adopted daughters . following the molestation court case , mia moved her children from new york to connecticut . but following the death of her adopted sister tam at the age of 21 in 2000 from a heart condition , malone told how she sank into a deep depression . she started cutting herself and made a ` halfhearted ' attempt at suicide , admitting : ` i 'm not proud of it . it was very hard for me to cope . my mom was my rock , and ronan was my best friend . ' her depression was further exacerbated when she said that allen succeeded in contacting her . the first time was just before her 19th birthday in 2004 , she said , when he sent her a letter saying that because she was 18 he wanted to have a conversation and ` set the record straight about what your mother has told you , ' signing off ` love , your father . ' three years later , during her senior year of college , she said , he sent her a package of pictures of the pair together - and said that soon-yi missed her - adding that he wanted her to meet his new , adopted daughters , which stunned malone . since meeting her husband , malone is now writing and illustrating a book and made it clear he is her ` saviour ' . controversial relationship : mia and woody split when she discovered he had a sexual relationship with her adopted daughter soon-yi , who he is now married to . woody and soon-yi are pictured here in september . but that does not stop her mother and brother from furiously bringing the case back into the public eye . rosemary 's baby star mia had been . live tweeting throughout the golden globes ceremony on sunday , but made it clear that as soon as woody 's . tribute was about to begin , she was switching off . ` time to grab some icecream & switch over to #girls , ' she wrote , followed by a simple : ` nite all . ' -lsb- sic -rsb- . she re-tweeted her son 's message , but today hit back with anger , tweeting : ' a woman has publicly detailed woody allen 's molestation of her at age 7 . goldenglobe tribute showed contempt for her & all abuse survivors , ' the star then added : ` is he a pedophile ' , before linking back to the vanity fair article . meanwhile , a family source today told mailonline ; ` whever ronan gets the chance to remind people he has no problem taking advantage of this opportunity .
