{"text": "four years ago , mary foord-brown was in despair , afraid she was never going to find the right medical help for her two children . branded an ` over-protective ' mother who was ` inventing ' illnesses for them , she had just been struck off by her gp surgery in woodbridge , suffolk . she had two sick children at home - lilac , then 12 , and victor , ten - suffering from scarlet fever , and subsequently a form of pneumonia . this had come after a litany of other illnesses . desperate : turned away by her gp surgery , mary foord-brown despaired over the health of her two children - until she discovered the honorary doctors ' association . ` anyone could see they were n't well - they seemed exhausted and did n't pick up after normal childhood illnesses , ' says mary , 48 , a charity volunteer who is married to martin , 58 , a psychologist . ' i took them to the gp a number of times , and eventually waited for the out-of-hours service to click in as i felt i got better care then . the children were both treated with antibiotics but neither seemed to be getting better . ` they needed to see a paediatric consultant but i could n't get a referral . ' indeed , the gp surgery 's response was a letter informing the family that ` due to a breakdown in relationships ' they would no longer treat them . ' i felt as if the nhs washed its hands of us , ' says mary . desperate , she called a private doctor , although she could not afford prolonged private treatment - and the secretary suggested she contact a new organisation , the honorary doctors ' association . this charity offers free advice and treatment from some of the most eminent private and nhs consultants and gps in the country . it was set up four years ago by marius van oldenborgh , an ophthalmologist , to help people crying out for a second opinion after they have been failed or misdiagnosed by the nhs or private practice in the uk . ` many of the people we see are genuinely in despair , ' says mr van oldenborgh . ` we provide a lifeline which is free at the point of care . ` we do not see ourselves as operating  in competition  with the nhs and fully support its core principles . we are not a political organisation . we simply offer a second opinion . ` if an nhs doctor disagrees with our diagnosis , it 's up to the patient to decide which advice to follow.at first i was concerned we might encounter opposition from doctors , but in fact we have been met with tremendous goodwill . ` we now have around 140 private and nhs doctors and consultants registered with us , but there are around 900 doctors in the uk i can ring and ask for advice , and so far no one has refused to help . relief : now that mary and her children have been accurately diagnosed by the hda , they can lead happy , normal lives . ' i have developed quite a thick skin in ringing up eminent consultants and saying :  look , could you see this person for free ?  the majority of doctors see their profession as a calling , and are frustrated by the limitations under which they have to work . ` many gps have only about eight minutes to see a patient , and some are seeing 60 patients a day . almost inevitably there will be misdiagnosis , lack of knowledge and wrong treatments occurring . ' the honorary doctors ' association -lrb- soon to be renamed the patient care trust -rrb- was set up after mr van oldenborgh realised he was treating one in ten of his patients free , as they could n't afford to pay him . ' i rang around other specialists and consultants and found many did the same . i thought if we formed ourselves into a network , we could offer this vital second opinion service . ' he emailed 200 eminent consultants and doctors , and more than half replied immediately that they would become involved . last year the charity helped almost 200 patients . its helpline is manned by just mr van oldenborgh and a staff of two . ' i listen to their case , then call on my specialists and refer their cases on . most patients can see a specialist within weeks . ` we see people who have exhausted every avenue in the nhs , been given inadequate explanations , insufficient follow-ups or have been misdiagnosed . many could never afford to see a private doctor for a second opinion . ' for mary , the relief of being able to speak to a medical professional was ` immense ' . ` mr van oldenborgh became an  umbrella  mentor for our care . he researched our case and made invaluable suggestions . ' with the hda 's help , mary discovered that she and her children suffer from an auto-immune condition , hughes syndrome -lrb- or ` sticky blood ' -rrb- , where the blood clots too quickly . patients often have intense migraines - victor is particularly prone to these , which also caused him to vomit ; he used to suffer from blackouts , too . as well as hughes syndrome , lilac and her mother have systemic lupus , another auto-immune condition , which causes joint pain and extreme fatigue . with the right diagnosis and care , the children now lead happy , normal lives . victor , who takes daily aspirin and a drug called plaquenil , no longer has blackouts and both children are doing well at school - victor is also schooled partly at home . mary has found a new gp practice , which she describes as ` excellent ' , and sees various paediatric experts . ` the hda gave me a sense of security and professional support at a difficult time , ' she says . for two years , snehal thakar , an it consultant in the city , struggled to get specialist treatment for persistent and increasingly crippling pain above his knee , caused by a footballing injury . ' i was constantly fobbed off by my gp , who said the pain would go away , but it was getting progressively worse . he 'd just give me more painkillers , ' says the 45-year-old from harrow , middlesex . the pain became so excruciating that he could n't walk more than 40 metres . ' i finally stood in my gp 's surgery and said i would refuse to leave until i was referred to a consultant . ' an orthopaedic consultant said - wrongly , it turned out - that the problem was fragments of bone in his ankle , and snehal had an operation to remove these . lifeline : the honorary doctors ' association offers free advice and treatment from some of the most eminent private and nhs consultants and gps in the country . when the pain persisted , an ultrasound scan - the first he 'd been offered - revealed the real cause : a blood clot above his knee . ` my consultant said i might need an artery bypass but this would n't be available for at least two years . ' a year later , with the pain badly affecting his daily life , snehal was at the end of his tether . a colleague mentioned the hda and he was referred to john scurr , a world-leading vascular surgeon working privately in london . ` for the first time , i felt someone was really listening . he said if i 'd been given the right treatment in the beginning it would have cleared the clot , but now it was too big and i would need a bypass . ` having an eminent surgeon confirm the diagnosis was such a relief . he also recommended daily exercises that eased the pain . ` i 'm now armed with expert knowledge to fight my case for a bypass operation on the nhs . ' retired nursery nurse wendy stokoe credits the hda with saving her sight . wendy , 63 , from billericay in essex , had been taking strong painkillers for 15 years for back pain . around four years ago , her sight started deteriorating . ` my gp said it was glaucoma . gradually , my sight became worse and worse and i could only see a pinpoint of light . i could n't drive , i could barely read and hardly left the house . i was told there was nothing that could be done . ' mary went to marius van oldenborgh . ' i said i could n't afford lengthy private treatment , and he said he 'd treat me for free . ` he investigated tirelessly , and finally told me he did n't think it was glaucoma but a toxic build-up from the painkillers . he advised me to stop taking one , and gave me daily b12 vitamin injections . ` over a matter of months , my eyesight began to return . i firmly believe that but for the work of the hda , i would be blind . ' the hda is ` only a small organisation ' , says mr van oldenborgh , ` but we are growing all the time ' . he adds : ` we do n't feel we hold all the answers , but we do our best to help . with the patient 's permission , we like to write to their gp saying what we would recommend . ' for mary , the crucial thing was that an expert was really listening . ' i felt , for the first time in years , as if someone actually cared .
