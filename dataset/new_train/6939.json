' mr hopper said the defendants then laundered the money by withdrawing it from the accounts as cash or banker 's cheques and then paying it into other accounts belonging to tipler , chaplin and their co-conspirators . butcher allowed his account to be used to receive a # 25,000 cheque and a # 20,000 banker 's draft from horan and quinlan , which he then withdrew in cash , the court heard . mr hopper added : ` this represents laundering of criminal funds and was of great assistance to the main conspirators as it allowed the to remove large amounts of money from the accounts in one go . ' the money was diverted from alliance pharmaceuticals , hospira aseptic services , baxter healthcare ltd , alliance healthcare and aah pharmaceutical ltd between december 2011 and may 2012 . the prosecution said tipler covered her tracks by placing false descriptions in the agresso system and changing invoice details . in april , the payment system was outsourced to nhs shared business service , meaning tipley lost control of it . however , money continued to be diverted to woollery and william flynn meaning a total of # 300,000 was lost . tipley of carshalton , surrey , was arrested in may 2012 after an employee of alliance healthcare told the nhs that the company had received two remittance slips , but no payment to go with them . mr hopper added : ` tipler first made a straightforward denial . she was interviewed again in august , by which stage the full scale of the fraud had been uncovered . ` she now admitted to changing all the bank details in order to divert payments but claimed to have done so as a result of being threatened by horan and woollery . ' ` she also believed -lrb- william -rrb- flynn had attacked chaplin in order to place pressure on her to carry out the fraud . ` the prosecution 's case it that this duress defence has been created by tipler with chaplain 's help . ` the crown does not accept there was any duress on either side . all the defendants were fully aware of the mechanism of the fraud and all knowingly participated . ' he added : ` tipler and chaplin had acquired a substantial level of personal debt . at the time she was first interviewed she believed she owed # 30,000 . she and chaplin planned to get married in may 2013 and had begun to pay for the wedding .
