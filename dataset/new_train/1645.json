{"text": "one of the most valuable paintings found in a hoard of art looted by the nazis -- a matisse valued at up to # 60million -- is due to be handed to the ex-wife of dominique strauss kahn . sitting woman , found among more than 1,400 artworks in a recluse 's munich flat , is thought to have belonged to miss sinclair 's maternal grandfather , the late french art dealer paul rosenberg . the news marks a change in the fortunes of miss sinclair , 65 , who helped pay for her ex-husband 's defence when the womanising international monetary fund chief was accused of being a rapist . they divorced in march . remarkable : a painting from henry matisse called sitzende frau -lrb- sitting woman -rrb- - one of the previously unknown works found at gurlitt 's flat - is projected on a screen during a news conference in augsburg . anne sinclair is laying claim to it . mr rosenberg , whose clients included . matisse and picasso , fled paris during the second world war , leaving . many works to the germans . chris marinello , of the group art recovery international , said he was confident miss sinclair would be given the matisse . the 1,400 paintings were found last . year at the home of cornelius gurlitt , 80 . his father hildebrand had . been employed by the nazis to sell art said to be ` degenerate ' . many . were bought for a pittance from fleeing jewish collectors . in a phone call to mailonline mr marinello revealed that he met with the rosenberg family on thursday and has drafted a letter for the german authorities claiming ownership of the matisse . he said : ` we 're hoping that they will accept our offer of a meeting in munich . ' the painting , he explained , was confiscated from paul rosenberg 's gallery in paris . he then fled to new york and upon his return to paris after the second world war could not find the artwork . he was matisse 's art dealer and so received the sitting woman directly from the artist himself , mr marinello added . it was on display in paris , but it 's not likely that many members of the public ever set eyes on it . meanwhile , phones in the cramped london offices of the art loss register have been ringing off the hook since german prosecutors announced what the register 's chairman , julian radcliffe , calls ` the biggest cache of illegally stored art since the end of the war . ' ` people who are registered with us have been ringing to say , ` you 're on the case , are n't you ? ' ' radcliffe said wednesday . relationship : anne sinclair -lrb- right -rrb- divorced dominique strauss-kahn -lrb- left -rrb- the former director of the imf , in march 2013 . the flurry of activity follows the discovery in germany of more than 1,400 artworks - some by modern masters such as marc chagall , henri matisse and pablo picasso - stacked in the munich apartment of an elderly man . for families whose treasures were stolen by germany 's nazi regime , the discovery has raised hopes - but also stirred frustration . citing an ongoing tax probe into the apartment 's resident , german authorities have not revealed many details about the vast majority of the paintings , drawings , engravings , woodcuts and prints they have found . at a news conference tuesday , officials described only a fraction of the spectacular find , including - tantalizingly - previously unknown paintings by matisse , chagall and german artist otto dix . that has sparked a clamor for information from art hunters , museums and the lawyers of those seeking to recover looted art . the munich apartment where officials discovered the hidden gurlitt paintings . a reproduction of a painting by italian . painter canaletto presented during the news conference on tuesday that . could be worth # 10million . treasure trove : an allegorical scene . painting by marc chagall worth an estimated # 15million had never been . seen by the art world before emerging from gurlitt 's collection . the munich trove was found in early 2012 at the home of a man whom german officials did n't name but who has been identified in media reports as 80-year-old cornelius gurlitt . his father , hildebrand gurlitt , was an art dealer who acted for the nazis in the 1930s to sell art considered ` degenerate ' by the regime - including impressionist and modern masterpieces - outside of germany in return for cash . some of the works were seized from museums , while others were stolen or bought for a pittance from jewish collectors who were forced to sell . gerhard finckh , director of the von der heydt-museum in wuppertal , western germany , called for an inventory of the gurlitt trove to be published online quickly so museums can find out whether their stolen works are among them . collector : hildebrandt gurlitt amassed more than 1,500 masterpieces and ordered them to be destroyed in 1945 . ` if our works are among the discovered art , we will do everything to get them back , ' said finckh , whose museum lost pieces by dix , paul klee , vassily kandinsky and many others . jewish groups also have called for the works to be made public immediately . spokesman steffen seibert said wednesday that chancellor angela merkel 's government favored releasing information about works that ` may have been confiscated from people persecuted by the nazis . ' but he gave no details or timeframe for that to happen . that leaves people seeking the return of artworks with no quick path to restitution . imke gielen , a berlin lawyer specializing in restitution claims , said prospective claimants should approach the bavarian prosecutors with queries about specific works . she said it was vital to prove ownership of the artwork until jan. 30 , 1933 , the day the nazis seized power . any art lost after that is presumed to have been sold under pressure or seized , boosting the chances of restitution . others will turn to the art loss register , which maintains a database of several hundred thousand works of stolen or missing art . the organization 's team of art sleuths , historians and legal experts was busy on wednesday trying to match works on its database with the items found in germany . radcliffe says it has already found one match - not the matisse - but wo n't say what artwork it is . although there has been criticism of the germans ' delay in announcing the find , art law expert coco soodek was sympathetic . she said the trove is so large that it takes time to catalog the works - and ` it might take a decade ' to reunite them with their owners . german officials say they have done preliminary work on only 500 pieces so far . ` it 's like a giant game of ` concentration , ' ' said soodek , head of the art law team at bryan cave llp . ` they will designate the ones that we know to exist and match those up with documentation of stolen art . those are the easy ones . you match up the ones you can get to first , and then you start a big detective search .
