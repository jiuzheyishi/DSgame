{"text": "the extreme winter weather around the great lakes will cause lake superior to completely freeze over , an expert predicts . an estimated 91 per cent of its surface was covered in ice on february 6 , the most recent measurement , according to the great lakes environmental research laboratory . but jay austin , associate professor at the large lakes observatory in duluth , minnesota , believes that the lake , which has a surface area of 31,700 square miles and is the largest freshwater lake in the world , will freeze over before the arrival of spring . lake superior has never had more than 91 per cent ice cover since records began . ice one : lake superior will completely freeze over by the end of the winter , an expert predicts . monitoring : the ice cover for the great lakes stood at 80 per cent as of february 2014 . the last total freeze-over was in 1997 . however there is now more ice on the lake than then , as it is thicker in the areas that have frozen already . its current ice cover equals the record set in 1994 , but that is about to be smashed , according to professor austin . the 40-year average annual lake superior ice coverage for february is just 30 per cent . prof austin told cns news that there 's a ` very high likelihood ' that the lake will freeze in the imminent future , thanks to the longevity of this year 's extreme temperatures . calm before the storm : lake superior , the largest of the great lakes system , is seen here before the winter storms hit . according to an analysis by noaa 's great lakes environmental research laboratory , ice covered 78.7 percent of the great lakes on february 6 . not since early 1996 has ice been so widespread on the great lakes . seen here is lake superior at 4.22 pm local time on february 7 , 2014 . he pointed out that the mercury did n't rise above zero in duluth , which sits on the edge of lake superior , for 23 days in a row recently , breaking the 1936 record of 22 days . george leshkevich , who has been tracking great lakes ice for the national oceanic and atmospheric administration great lakes environmental research laboratory since 1973 , said this winter has had among the most rapid ice buildups of his tenure . lake superior is the largest freshwater lake in the world with a surface area of 31,700 square miles . air temperatures show this is the coldest winter since 1979 , according to twin cities . the widespread ice in january and early february this year ` would n't have been anomalous back in the '70s or with some of the winters in the mid - '90s ' . ` but it certainly has been a while since we 've seen this much ice this early , ' leshkevich said . the extent of the freeze comes despite warnings from scientists that climate change was causing the lake to become warmer . a study in 2007 suggested that the long-term trend was for higher air temperatures in summer over the lake , and less ice in winter on it .", "summary": " the ice cover on lake superior currently stands at 91 per cent .   superior is the largest freshwater lake in the world at 31,700 square miles .   an expert from the large lakes observatory believes it could freeze over .   ice is covering 80 per cent of the great lakes at present .   air temperatures show this is the coldest winter since 1979 .   last total freeze was 1997 - but climate change scientists had said lake was getting warmer .
