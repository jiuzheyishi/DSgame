{"text": "excessive ? a new report claims that osama bin laden was shot more than a hundred times by navy seals in the 2011 raid . special operations sources have claimed that the terror leader was shot more than one hundred times in the fatal 2011 raid . a new report from a website known within the intelligence and armed services community claims that the sheer number of times that osama bin laden was shot is the reason why the government has never released photos of his dead body . citing two confidential sources , the special operations forces situation report tells how ` operator after operator took turns dumping magazines-worth of ammunition into bin laden 's body ' . the site goes on to argue that while the navy seals may have felt it was ` morally , legally , and ethically appropriate to shoot the body a few times to ensure that he is really dead and no longer a threat , ' that does not justify the extent of this damage . ` what happened on the bin laden raid is beyond excessive . the level of excess shown was not about making sure that bin laden was no longer a threat . the excess was pure self-indulgence , ' author jack murphy writes . at the time of the assassination , president obama and his administration argued that they were justified in never releasing the photos of the dead body or the burial at sea because they could be used as propaganda for al qaeda . the new theories , however , suggest that they are just trying to avoid retribution for allegedly being excessive . scroll down for video . hollywood interpretation : zero dark thirty imagined the events leading to bin laden 's capture . mission : the al qaeda leader was killed at this . compound in abbottabad by u.s. special forces and new reports suggest that the excessive force that was used may be why his death photos have not been released . photos that have been released : images of bin laden , like these which are being used as evidence in the ongoing trial against his son-in-law , have prompted debate among military veterans and good government groups . details about the classified mission were unearthed in seal team six member mark bissonnette 's book which differ from the sofrep account , but murphy writes that bissonnette 's version ` is perhaps the most measured and polite description that one could give ' . in his book , bissonnette does not put a firm number on the amount of bullets used but it sounds far less excessive than the latest reports . ` in his death throes , he was still twitching and convulsing . another assaulter and i trained our lasers on his chest and fired several rounds , ' bissonnette wrote in no easy day which was published in september 2012 . ` the bullets tore into him , slamming his body into the floor until he was motionless . ' incorrect depiction : the latest information suggests the raid of the bin laden compound went down very differently to the events since fictionalized in hollywood in films like zero dark thirty , pictured . his version : mark bissonnette , who was a member of seal team six who was at the raid described them using far fewer bullets to kill the elderly terror leader . tension : the raid of bin laden 's abottabad . compound was watched by president obama and his closest advisers in the . situation room of the white house . murphy argues that the number of bullets used is less of a issue pertaining specifically to this particular case but grows problematic if it represents a changing attitude within the navy seals . ` gone unchecked , these actions get worse over time , ' the army special operations veteran writes . ` the real issue is not that bin laden was turned into swiss cheese , but rather that this type of behavior has become a standard operating procedure in this unit . '", "summary": " special ops sources have claimed that the navy seal team unloaded multiple magazines full of ammunition into the dead terror leader 's corpse .   some think the alleged excessive treatment is the reason why the obama administration has not released the ` death photos ' of the al qaeda leader .   white house has always said that any photos of his dead body or sea burial would be used as propaganda by terror cells .
