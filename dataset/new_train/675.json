' john . carr , who sits on the board of ukccis , said : ` i am astounded by the . contents of this leaked email . it reflects a degree of cynicism which . does not fit with my expectations of this government in this area . ` potentially , it means this whole consultation is a sham with the outcome already pre-determined . ' helen goodman , who is labour 's media . spokesman , said : ` this email is explosive . it is very important we have a . proper consultation which gives parents and children 's organisations . the chance to say why they want to put children first . it is time . ministers stood up for ordinary people rather than big business . ' the consultation , which was launched by children 's minister tim loughton last week , includes an option for ` active choice plus ' , which is favoured by child safety campaigners and many mps . this option is being resisted by internet companies , which make millions from adverts for pornographic websites . in his email , mr kernahan , who is public affairs manager at the ispa , described the ten-week consultation exercise as ` essentially a questionnaire ' . last night he said : ` this was a private email sent to our members . ` it was my take on where we are , which is that the government and ukccis support active choice . ` the point of the consultation is to get more evidence and views . ' i do n't think this is a foregone conclusion . i was stating the current position . ` this issue is out to consultation and our members will be making their views known . we do support active choice as the most sensible solution . ' but mr carr , who is also secretary of the uk children 's charities ' coalition on internet safety , said : ` there is growing evidence of the damage being done to children by unrestricted access to hardcore porn . ` we have never said there should be no porn on the internet . but if you want to have access to it , you should have to prove you are old enough to access it . ' tory mp claire perry said : ` this is exactly what i would expect from ispa who have been constantly resistant to the idea of changing anything . ` this issue matters to millions of parents and ordinary people across the country . ` this is even more reason why they should make their views heard in the consultation . ' a department for education spokesman said : ` it is simply not true that ministers have already made up their minds , regardless of what one official may have said . ` the reported comments do not in any way reflect government policy . we are seeking views and evidence from everybody . ' officials yesterday shut down the consultation exercise website following a security blunder . site visitors were able to see other people 's confidential responses and personal details -- including passwords and email addresses .", "summary": " leaked email says internet firms have been assured they will not face stringent filtering systems .   comes after government launched consultation on dealing with online porn .
