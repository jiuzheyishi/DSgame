{"text": "it 's easy to forget that bugs have faces - complete with eyes , a mouth and , if not a nose , a pair of large antennae . but now a wildlife photographer has captured extreme close-ups of creepy crawlies - revealing the complex compound eyes of flies , the triangular profile of a praying mantis and a moth during metamorphosis among others . many of the images have been lit in such a way they resemble mind tricks , optical illusions and even ink blots . this macro image of a pair of owlflies was taken by 33-year-old photographer yudy sauw at his home studio in tangerang , indonesia . owlflies are dragonfly-like insects with large eyes . they are distant relatives of flies , dragonflies and damselflies and typically grow up to 2-inches -lrb- 5cm -rrb- long . the images were shot by 33-year-old yudy sauw at his home studio in tangerang , indonesia . he used a photography technique known as focus stacking , also known as focus blending , which combines multiple shots of the same subject , taken at different focal distances . sauw was able to capture the extreme close-ups by placing his camera 4-inches away , but other shots were captured at up to 20-inches distance . each image took around ten minutes and involved sauw keeping calm and still so not to disturb the insects . sauw said : ` all of the photographs were taken in my studio in indonesia . all of the insects had to be incredibly still for the process to work . among his collection were a pair of owlflies , which sauw captured facing each other to resemble an ink blot . owlflies are dragonfly-like insects with large eyes . they are distant relatives of flies , dragonflies and damselflies and typically grow up to 2-inches -lrb- 5cm -rrb- long . the images were shot using a photography technique known as focus stacking , also known as focus blending , which combines multiple shots of the same subject , taken at different focal distances . sauw was able to capture extreme close-ups , including this shot of a soldierfly , by placing his camera 4-inches -lrb- 10cm -rrb- away . in addition to insects , sauw also shot alien-looking images of praying mantises . the head consists of a rounded triangle with eyes that take up almost three quarters of the creature 's face . it is the only insect that can swivel its head over its shoulder , over 300 ° , which gives the mantis a distinct advantage when looking for prey . wasps , such as the one captured in this image , do not reproduce during mating flights , like bees . instead they reproduce between a fertile queen and either a single , or multiple male wasps . after successfully mating , the male 's sperm cells are stored in a tightly packed ball inside the queen until they are needed . wasps , such as the ones

inches -lrb- 1.6 cm -rrb- and only lives up to eight days . its colour and size mimics the appearance of the organ pipe mud dauber wasp , this is enhanced by the fly 's elongated , wasp-like antennae

is the only insect that can swivel its head over its shoulder , over 300 ° , which gives the mantis a distinct advantage when looking for prey . this image , which resembles a human face , is a macro photo of a longhorn beetle . several species are pests and the larvae often bores into wood , where they can cause damage to trees and structures . a number of species mimic ants , bees , and wasps . by taking images over a series of weeks , sauw was able to capture a moth going through metamorphosis -lrb- pictured left -rrb- , and emerging -lrb- pictured right -rrb- . for the most part , moths are nocturnal and they fly and feed at night . butterflies and moths pupate , or become adults , differently . both go through their metamorphosis in a chrysalis , but moths will often spin a silk cocoon around this protective shell , sometimes camouflaging it with leaves or debris . although the majority of sauw 's images focus on flies , this shot is of a metallic jumping spider . these spiders have been known to jump from 10 to 50 times their own body length by increasing the blood pressure in their legs . their large eyes have stereoscopic vision to help them stalk prey and communicate with the opposite sex . in one image , which resembles a human face , sauw also captured the front of a longhorn beetle . several species are pests and the larvae often bores into wood ,

gradually changing the distance of the subject . this involved moving the camera , rather than than subject , which in this case was the insect . individual photos are then aligned so their content is overlaid pixel-by-pixel to create the effect seen here . adult owlflies , such as the one pictured , have been known to release a strong chemical to deter enemies . they typically hunt at sunset and dawn , while resting during the day on twigs . its eggs are laid under stones and as larvae develops it becomes predatory . although the majority of sauw 's images focus on flying insects , he also
