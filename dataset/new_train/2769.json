{"text": " less than human .   lost .   courageous .   unwanted .  those are a just few of the dozens of responses cnn ireport got when we asked our online community how their incomes make them feel .  my income makes me feel unwanted because i , like many people , have to rely on food assistance ,  said marcus kastler , a 31-year-old from kansas .  there is a huge gap that is unfair and unrealistic . -lrb- low -rrb- minimum wage keeps this gap wide because you ca n't advance without higher education . we need to start more entry level jobs so that low income can work their way up . lower the cost to go to college so we can afford to go .  ireport : my income makes me feel ... plenty of pundits this week are talking about america 's  war on poverty ,  which has lasted 50 years now . somewhat missing from the conversation is the war that has emerged since the 1964 state of the union address , when president lyndon b. johnson , as the nation describes it ,  slowly put on his black-framed reading glasses , looked around at the assembled dignitaries and immediately issued a call to action  on american poverty . america 's new war is on income inequality . it 's time we put our glasses on and saw this shift clearly . i started reporting on income inequality last year because cnn readers wisely voted me to cover that topic as part of the change the list project . i spent about two weeks reporting in east carroll parish , louisiana , which has the largest rich-poor gap in the nation . there , i learned that the income gap can get so wide that people do n't understand each other anymore . that 's what splits one america into two . related : the most unequal place in america . how to change course ? that 's something i 've wrestled with in recent months . anyone who says they have all of the answers is lying to you . but i do think one way we can start to knit our nation back together is to talk about income inequality -- to acknowledge how different america is today from the time of john f. kennedy and johnson , when the rich were n't so stratospherically different from the rest of us , and when the minimum wage was actually worth more in real dollars than it is now . it 's clear the nation has been diverging . since the late 1970s , the united states went from being a relatively egalitarian country to one of the more unequal places in the world . america is more unequal than russia , kenya and pakistan , according to the cia world factbook . and the 1 % continues to do better than the rest : that group saw 86.1 % real income growth from 1993 to 2012 , according to a uc berkeley analysis . the bottom 99 % of the population only saw 6.6 % growth in their incomes during that time . related : is income inequality morally wrong ? it 's not about the numbers , though -- it 's about society . there 's research to show more unequal countries tend to have problems with health , education , incarceration and infant mortality . there 's an empathy gap , too , researchers have argued in books such as  the spirit level ,  which was written by two epidemiologists . people stop knowing each other . that 's why we decided to ask ireporters to submit essays , videos and photos about how their incomes make them feel . the goal was to initiate a conversation about the increasingly wide range of economic experiences in the united states . aimee clark , a 30-year-old in colorado , said her income makes her feel  lost .   i feel lost because although we are not in poverty anymore , we are not financially safe ,  she said .  we still live paycheck to paycheck , just not as dire as years before . i feel lost because i can taste the ` american dream , ' but it 's like a tease .  related : war on poverty is n't over . i think many americans can identify with that limbo . the high cost of education -- a ladder out of poverty -- was another consistent theme .  i feel like i 'm living from paycheck to paycheck and owe more than i 'm worth ,  said nicole lucas of baltimore . she said she is struggling to pay down student loans while working a part-time job that has no benefits .  people say ` go to school , market yourself , cut back , ' etc. . however , the recession taught me that you can have a good job , have a 401 -lrb- k -rrb- and have a degree , but still be the last to know your job is going to go under .  recently , there has been much talk about what would increase  economic mobility  in the united states , which is the term academics use when they 're talking about the american dream . the united states has has fallen behind many european nations in that category .  if you want to live the american dream ,  kate pickett , a researcher who studies income inequality , told me last year ,  you 'd better go to denmark or finland .  there , it 's easier to get ahead . related : 5 things the world could teach america . so it 's telling that lucas , the woman in baltimore , also said the american dream , to her , is  not sustainable , let alone attainable .  it feels out of reach . shifting attitudes like that should scare us all . who wants to live in a country where people do n't believe they can get ahead anymore ? not all of the ireport responses to our query were negative , of course , but i did n't see any reports from the super-rich , either . -lrb- buffett ? bloomberg ? there 's still time ... -rrb- . julie west of columbus , ohio , said her income makes her feel  grateful .  she lost her job in 2008 but found a new , lower-paying gig in 2010 .  many people that were hit with unemployment in 2008 lost homes , experienced many hardships just as i did ,  she said .  many have never fully recovered . i feel like i had been given a chance to turn it around for myself . i will always be grateful .  related : how to help inequality , usa . that 's pretty incredible , huh ? not just because west has managed to remain  grateful  in the face of hardship but because she 's aware that others are n't so lucky . she has empathy for other americans . that 's something all of us , regardless of income , could take to heart . it 's not that the war on poverty is over . it is n't , and it should n't be . but extreme poverty exists , now more than in recent decades , alongside extreme wealth . it 's time for  america 's longest war  to evolve and expand . the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of john d. sutter . cnn ireport 's christina zdanowicz contributed reporting .", "summary": " cnn ireport asks readers to say how their income makes them feel .   the assignment follows a series by john sutter on income inequality .   sutter reported on the  most unequal place in america    he says the war on poverty should morph into a war on inequality .
