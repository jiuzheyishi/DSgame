' since the early 19th century , numerous tests have questioned the alleged superiority of the old italian violins . time and time again , listeners have failed to distinguish between the sound of the old and new instruments . but critics have been quick to pick holes in these studies . antique : antonio stradivari lived in cremona between 1644 and 1737 and also crafted cellos , guitars , violas , and harps . it is estimated he made up to 1,100 instruments during his lifetime . above , a stradivari violin . in most cases , the listeners were not . experts , and the players and researchers knew which violin was which - a . flaw that could have biased the results . the latest findings claim to have closed these holes . prof fritz said : ` some studies open new fields for investigation . this study attempts to close a perennially fruitless one , the search for the  secrets of stradivari  . ` great efforts have been made to explain why instruments by stradivari and other old italian makers sound better than high quality new violins , but without providing scientific evidence that this is in fact the case . ` doing so requires that experienced violinists demonstrate both a general preference for old italian violins and the ability to reliably distinguish them from new ones . ` the current study , the second of its kind again shows that first rate soloists tend to prefer new instruments and are unable to distinguish old from new at better than chance levels . ' antonio stradivari lived in cremona between 1644 and 1737 and also crafted cellos , guitars , violas , and harps . it is estimated he made up to 1,100 instruments during his lifetime and about 650 survive , including around 500 violins .", "summary": " stradivarius could be no better than bog-standard violin , says new study .   world 's leading violinists could not distinguish between two instruments .   this is despite antique italian violin having reputation for being superior .   antonio stradivari , from cremona , also crafted cellos , guitars and harps .
