' dixon , who had to learn to walk again with a prosthetic limb after losing his left leg below the knee when an ied detonated under his vehicle in afghanistan in december 2009 , said men slept in shifts , eating 800-calorie freeze-dried meals . but when the boat 's desalinator broke , three weeks after they set off from la gomera in the canary islands , they had no way to make fresh water to add to their food and so had to ration themselves . they ate ` snack packs ' made up of sweets , cereal bars , fruit and nuts , and energy drinks for 14 days . dixon added : ` that kind of thing affects the crew in different ways . working hard : the crew endured miserable conditions aboard the boat , with no fresh water for 14 days when they had to eat snack packs to keep going . somewhere in the atlantic : the crew paused for a seasonal pose on christmas day - pictured front row -lrb- left to right -rrb- will dixon , neil heritage , rory mackenzie . back row -lrb- left to right -rrb- carl anstey , ed janvrin , alex mackenzie . ' i came into this row pretty much overweight so for me the calories has not been as important but i really struggled when we were low on water . ' i seem to have lost a lot of weight , about two stone . but a couple of members of the crew could have done with my rolls of fat , they 've been very hungry at times . ' and when it came to relieving themselves , he said it was time for the crew to go back to nature . ready to go : servicemen -lrb- left to right -rrb- alex mackenzie , rory mackenzie , neil heritage , will dixon , carl anstey , ed janvrin as the group of british servicemen prepared to embark on their gruelling challenge . ` essentially we squatted over the edge . of the boat , so it 's straight into the sea . but if the waves were . going , at least you got a bit of a bidet effect . ' thousands of miles across tempestuous seas from one continent to another , the atlantic challenge is considered one of the toughest trials on the planet . travelling along the route fabled to have been taken by christopher columbus more than 500 years ago , teams cover nearly 3,000 miles on the journey between la gomera in the canary islands and port st charles , barbados . setting off in december to avoid coinciding with the end of the hurricane season , teams aim to get the maximum benefit from the easterly trade winds and atlantic currents . in 1966 sir chay blyth and john ridgeway performed their legendary open-boat row across the atlantic ocean in english rose iii . the trip took 92 days and it laid the foundation for the atlantic challenge . since then more and more people have tried it - this year 's talisker whisky atlantic challenge began on december 4 with 17 teams . boats are 23ft long and 6ft 6in wide , with only a small cabin for protection against storms . three . other members of the crew are also amputees , including corporal neil . heritage , 31 , who had a double above-knee amputation after being blown . up in iraq in november 2004 . corporal rory mackenzie , 30 , lost his right leg in a roadside bombing in basra city in january 2007 . and lance corporal carl anstey , 26 , needs a leg brace to walk after a blast from a rocket-propelled grenade in afghanistan in january 2009 . the team , dubbed row2recovery , was completed by able-bodied ex-captains janvrin and mackenzie , 32 and 33 . writing on the team 's blog yesterday , cpl heritage said : ` i 've got some tough moments ahead , like mastering the art of walking again on my prosthetics after losing a lot of muscle on my stumps as a result of being sat down for extended periods , but it will have been worth it . ' dixon added : ' i think it 's going to be similar for all the amputees . ' i have lost a lot of weight around my stump . ' i row in a prosthetic and had to pad that out with socks and have to keep adding socks each time i lose weight . ` it 's fine for sitting and rowing but i think it might be difficult when i try to walk . ' queen elizabeth ii sent a message of support to the team . her majesty said : ` please convey my warm thanks to all the members of the row2recovery team on the occasion of them reaching the end of their row across the atlantic , in aid of injured soldiers and their families . ' i heard of the trials and tribulations on your journey and , in return , i send my good wishes to you all for the successful completion of the challenge .
