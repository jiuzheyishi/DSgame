{"text": "homeowners and shopkeepers are to be given the right to protect themselves against burglars and robbers . they will now be allowed to use reasonable force if they perceive a threat to their property . previously they could act only when they feared for their lives . the surprise proposal is a response to public outrage over cases such as that of tony martin , the norfolk farmer who shot a burglar dead , and munir hussain , who chased and beat a man who had held his family at knifepoint . the proposal comes after criticism over cases like those of tony martin , left , and munir hussain . it is one of a series of reforms . unveiled by david cameron in a sharp turn to the right on law and order . as well as more life sentences there will be tougher punishments for . knife crime . liberal democrats were quick to . condemn the package , especially the pledge for mandatory life sentences . for those committing very serious offences twice . the prime minister finally scrapped controversial proposals to halve jail terms for offenders who enter early guilty pleas . making a point : prime minister david cameron proposed a raft of new measures at a press conference yesterday . grilling : the prime minister was repeatedly asked about the u-turn on sentence reduction . other measures include : . mr cameron and justice secretary . kenneth clarke attempted to deny they were making a u-turn , insisting . previous coalition policies had merely been ` proposals ' . slapped down : justice secretary ken clarke , leaving the cabinet meeting , saw his plans scrapped . but in reality , yesterday 's package marked not only a rowing back on sentence discounts following a public outcry , but a complete shift of tone and a bid to restore the tories ' reputation on law and order . the prime minister 's intervention was a crushing blow for both mr clarke and deputy prime minister nick clegg , who chaired a cabinet committee that signed off the reforms . the father of murdered schoolboy damilola taylor welcomed the about-turn , but called for the justice secretary to be sacked . richard taylor said : ` ken clarke does not know what is going on in the streets , he does not know what criminality is about . ' the justice secretary now has to find # 130million a year in extra savings , with deeper cuts likely for the probation services and courts . after a series of policy u-turns , the prime minister claimed abandoning 50 per cent sentencing discounts was a sign of confidence , showing the government was prepared to listen . the ` weak thing to do ' , he claimed , was to keep ` ploughing on ' even when it became clear there was a better way of doing things . ` being strong is about being prepared to admit you did n't get everything right the first time , you are going to improve it and make it better , ' mr cameron said . ` my mission is to make sure that families can feel safe in their homes and they can walk the streets freely and without fear . the public need to know that dangerous criminals will be locked up for a very long time . ` we . want prisons to be places of punishment with a purpose , instead of . prisoners setting in their cells . we will require them to work hard and . reform themselves . ' the self-defence clause is likely be added to the sentencing bill over the next few months . justice secretary kenneth clarke 's proposed cuts to the legal aid budget will have a greater impact than feared after his department admitted making an error in its impact assessment . mr clarke 's plans to cut the # 2.2billion-a-year budget by # 350 million are now expected to cost 66,200 legal representations a year , almost 50 % more than the original estimate of 45,000 , the ministry of justice confirmed . the proposals , which will also cost 500,000 instances of legal assistance , have been met with widespread opposition , with actress joanna lumley adding her voice to the calls for mr clarke to think again . richard miller , head of legal aid at the law society , said : ` it 's surprising that on a matter as important as how many people will be denied help in the future , the ministry should make such a mistake . ` clearly the fact that over 66,000 people who have been helped with complex legal proceedings would get no help under the government 's plans is an issue of major importance . ' the error was made in a calculation and an updated impact assessment will be published alongside the justice bill . guidance to police , prosecutors and the courts will be revised to give clarity about when it is sensible to prosecute . they have previously had to decide what constitutes excessive force by using legal precedent . amending the law in the way mr . cameron suggests would make it clear that using force to defend . property , as well as the person , is reasonable . exactly what constitutes . ` reasonable force ' remains to be clarified . with 23,000 violent crimes against householders every year , campaigners say the case for a change to legislation is growing ever stronger . the tough sentencing rules would mean predatory violent and sexual attackers who carry out a second serious offence will face a mandatory life term . the ` two strikes and you 're out ' policy , first proposed by michael howard in 1997 , will mean the most dangerous criminals automatically receiving a life term after a second offence . senior liberal democrats expressed their unease . lord thomas of gresford , co-chairman of their parliamentary home affairs committee , said it would be a ` very strange thing ' for mandatory life sentences to be imposed in cases other than murder . and lib dem justice minister lord mcnally said : ` the longer i have been in this job the more convinced i have been we should rely on the discretion of a well-informed judge rather than parliament trying to second-guess the judiciary . ' mr clegg yesterday claimed he had never supported the shorter sentences policy and appeared to blame mr clarke for the fiasco . he called the original plans ` arbitrary ' and sources close to him insisted they had been ` badly sold ' to voters . yesterday 's announcement that those who use ` reasonable force ' to protect their families will not be prosecuted follows growing resentment of a justice system that is seen as favouring burglars over victims . there have been several notable cases of homeowners being jailed for defending themselves against intruders . the most recent high profile one is that of millionaire businessman munir hussain , 54 , who in december 2009 was sentenced to two and a half years in jail for attacking a knife-wielding burglar who threatened to kill his wife and family at their buckinghamshire home . both businessman munir hussain , left , and farmer tony martin provoked public outcry when they were jailed . his case provoked nationwide fury when he and his brother were imprisoned for injuring career criminal walid salem , while the convicted burglar was allowed to walk free . but a month after being send down , britain 's top judge released mr hussein from hmp bullingdon after changing his term to a suspended sentence . lord judge said his decision came because of the exceptional nature of the case and the public outrage it has provoked . however , the most famous case to date is that of tony martin , a norfolk farmer , who in 1999 shot two burglars in the back - killing one - after allegedly having his property raided on ten previous occasions . he was first convicted of murder and later manslaughter following an appeal . nevertheless , he became a cause célèbre for the homeowner rights movement and helped galvanise support for a change to the law . he was released from jail for good behaviour in 2003 .", "summary": " people can use ` reasonable force ' to defend themselves .   plans for halving jail terms officially scrapped .   cameron also announced plans for tougher punishment for knife crime .   more life sentences to be handed out , angering lib dems .   prisoners earnings inside prison to be paid to victims of crime .   squatting to be made into a criminal offence .   a six-month mandatory sentence for adults who use a knife to threaten or intimidate ; .   prisoners made to work while inside , with earnings used to compensate victims ; .   tougher community sentences , with longer curfews , travel bans , confiscation of assets and # 2,500 fines for non-compliance ; .   plans for a criminal offence of squatting .
