' however , lord o'donnell said mr coulson was asked to sign a form . declaring any outside interests when he entered downing street but the shareholding was not disclosed - . although it should have been . a decision was taken to vet him so he could have unrestricted access to secret materials after the airline bomb plot when printer cartridges packed with explosives were found on planes . lord o'donnell said mr coulson needed more access to top secret documents . the press secretary already had undergone a full security check giving him substantial access to secret materials and supervised access to top secret materials . questions have been raised about why mr coulson was cleared only to sc level ` security checked ' in no 10 , rather than the tougher dv or ` developed vetting ' level . tony blair 's former spin doctor alastair campbell was given the higher level of security clearance when he was in downing street . lord o'donnell said he had been keen to keep the numbers of people given the highest vetting to a minimum , to help avoid leaks . he added that he did n't know whether other former press secretaries had been cleared to dv level . the ex-news of the world editor resigned before the process was complete . he also pointed out that dv was designed to establish ` whether you are blackmailable ... in terms of your position or your personal life ' . ` it would not have gone into enormous detail about phone hacking , for example , ' lord o'donnell said . exit : jeremy hunt 's special adviser adam smith who resigned last month after admitting that the contacts over the bskyb bid had become too close . lord o'donnell said that jeremy hunt 's aide adam smith should have dealt with the bskyb fairly . mr smith resigned last month after . admitting that the contacts over the bskyb bid had become too close . labour has been demanding that mr hunt quit for allowing the situation . to get out of control . lord o'donnell said it was for . ministers to authorise their special advisers ' activities , but there was . not likely to be a written record of instructions . ' i would have expected the minister to be clear about what his special adviser should be doing , ' he said . he insisted that ` keeping all parties informed about process is perfectly reasonable , but not getting into substance ' . he added that reviewing the bid was a ` quasi-judicial procedure ' and there was an obligation to deal with it fairly . lord o'donnell said he was right to tell gordon brown not to launch an inquiry into media standards in the weeks before the general election . he said that if a probe was launched it should have been done with all-party agreement - which would have been difficult in march 2010 . ` there were stories that there was more information out there and i think there was still a question mark as to whether more would emerge ... ` on the basis of what we knew then i would stick with that recommendation .

' mr davies said the documentary record had no evidence of an explicit or implicit deal to exchange favourable media coverage for favourable treatment . mr murdoch also had no reason to lie about having no recollection of the key lunch at chequers , as mr jay suggested last week in ` headline-grabbing style ' , he added . ` it is against the rules , and for good reason , to raise such an issue after the witness has gone , rather than when he is here to answer for it , but never mind that , ' mr davies said . ` mr murdoch has nothing to lie about . the documents tell the story . ' mr davies accused mr jay of suggesting it was ` sinister ' for newspapers such as the sun to back politicans they agree with . ` that is exactly what they are meant to do , and are expected to do , as agents of a free press in a democracy , ' he said . ` in mr jay 's hands , the characteristics of a large readership , floating voters , an absence of immutable party loyalties , begin to sound sinister .
