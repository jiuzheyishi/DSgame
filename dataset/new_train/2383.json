{"text": "it 's hard to imagine a more bizarre juxtaposition than dennis rodman and the north korean regime . we ca n't look away and , surely , that 's part of the plan . rodman , the fantastically strange former basketball player , loves the spotlight and he knows how to draw our attention . he can be outrageously entertaining . usually , it 's all relatively harmless and inconsequential . but rodman 's north korean visits and his avowed friendship with kim jong un , the country 's dictator --  i love the guy ,  he has said repeatedly -- have placed him in the middle of something deadly serious . rodman 's trips to north korea , ruled by the world 's more repressive regime , bring up a moral controversy over one of the most fundamental questions faced by society , by countries , and by each human being : . what is our responsibility in the face of terrible injustice and great suffering ? the dilemma was framed succinctly in biblical times : are we our brother 's keepers ? in some respects , rodman 's interaction with kim and his regime overlap with the issues we must wrestle with when we hear about the killing in syria , the turmoil in the central african republic , even the plight of the homeless in the u.s. simply -- what , if anything , are we going to do about it ? rodman has come under withering criticism for befriending the young dictator . a member of congress likened the visits to sitting down to lunch with adolf hitler . for his most recent visit rodman has organized an exhibition basketball game with former nba players to celebrate kim 's birthday . critics say he has helped legitimize , and thus strengthen , the regime . rodman sang  happy birthday  and bowed to north korea 's absolute ruler , behavior that no doubt will serve kim 's massive propaganda at home . even if he would rather ignore it , rodman rightly faces sharp questions because of the sheer brutality of the regime with which he is interacting ; because kim is a big fan of his . because he might , just might , be able to make even a small positive difference . it 's hard to know precisely what rodman 's views are on the issue of his responsibility to intercede on behalf of kim 's victims . the pressure of reflecting on the matter , of facing questions about his views and his intentions , is visibly getting to him . on tuesday , when cnn 's chris cuomo asked him if he planned to bring up with his north korean hosts the case of kenneth bae -- an american imprisoned without charges for more than a year by the north korean regime -- he became practically incoherent with anger , declaring , cigar in hand , that he did n't  give a rat 's ass  what cuomo thought . his suggestion that bae is guilty of some unspecified crime makes his behavior even more reprehensible . bae 's family was dismayed . in a press release , his sister said ,  rodman could do a lot of good ... but instead he has decided to hurl outrageous accusations at my brother .  by all appearances , rodman views his unique opportunity to meet with the north korean leader , the result of kim 's passion for basketball , as little more than a chance to bask in the warm limelight that has become more elusive with the passage of time . the complicated problems are not his concern , despite his suggestion that basketball might  open the door a little bit .  with him , it 's about hedonism and fame . that 's his philosophy . rodman says he has no interest in the politics of north korea .  whatever -lrb- kim -rrb- does political-wise , that 's not my job . i 'm just an athlete .  saying you do n't like politics , as so many do , is a transparent excuse for inaction , for ignoring our responsibilities as human beings . for his part , rodman has done much worse than completely ignoring the suffering of the north korean people . if he had kept quiet , we might have given him the benefit of the doubt and chalked it all up to sports diplomacy , an elusive effort to thaw tensions . but rodman has gone out of his way to praise the ruler of an imprisoned , starving nation . not only has he showered praise on kim , but he has extended it to his father and grandfather , the previous dictators who handed the country down as if it were a private family heirloom .  they were great leaders ,  he said , adding that he is not the only one who loves the young kim .  his country likes him -- not like him , love him .  that 's because , as rodman explains ,  the guy 's really awesome .  there is no such thing as a neutral stance on a situation like north korea 's . kim inherited a regime whose brutality defies belief . more than 150,000 people are imprisoned in a network of gulags -- camps where entire families , generations of individuals deemed a threat to kim 's authority , are kept in horrific conditions . famines have plagued the nation , killing hundreds of thousands , as resources are diverted toward the military , including the buildup of a nuclear arsenal . kim has threatened his neighbors -lrb- and the u.s. -rrb- with nuclear war and has detonated nuclear devices as recently as last year . we all have a responsibility to speak up , to do what we can when weak people are so clearly victimized . for most of us , there are limited opportunities to help , and there are many issues competing for attention . rodman , on the other hand , has a unique chance to at least try to make a difference . choosing to do nothing when you may have the ability to help is an even greater moral failing than ignoring a crisis when it is more difficult to intercede on behalf of the powerless . perhaps dennis rodman will have a moment of lucidity and do something meaningful . perhaps he will surprise us . for now , behind his permanent sunglasses and shining lip rings , he is offering only weird entertainment , and an unintentional reminder that human beings have larger responsibilities . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of frida ghitis .", "summary": " people are captivated by the spectacle of dennis rodman 's trip to korea .   frida ghitis : rodman has gone beyond just saying he is n't interested in the politics .   by praising kim jong un , rodman increases his obligation to act , she says .   ghitis : choosing to do nothing when you can help suffering people is a moral failing .
