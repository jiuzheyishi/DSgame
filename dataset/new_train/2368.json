{"text": "with pollen and other spring allergens in the air , researchers investigated whether place of birth affected the risk of developing allergies , and the answer turns out to be -- yes . having an allergic reaction -- with its sneezing , wheezing , itchy eyes and runny nose -- is an all too familiar experience for many americans , particularly children . about 11 % of youngsters suffer from asthma , and up to 20 % may experience some immune-based reaction to allergens such as pollen , dust , animal hair and even foods . but this relatively high prevalence seems to be unique to the united states , so researchers delved into whether different environmental exposures , dictated by where children were born , could affect risk of allergic disease . reporting in jama pediatrics , the scientists studied 91,642 kids between the ages 0 to 17 , all currently living in the united states , who participated in the 2007 - 2008 national survey of children 's health . the children or their parents answered questions about where they were born , and if they were born outside of the country , they were asked to note how long they had lived in the united states . the researchers also collected medical information about the children 's allergic diseases , including asthma , eczema , hay fever and food allergies . time.com : bullying over food allergies . when they compared place of birth with allergic-disease prevalence , the scientists found that children born outside of the united states were less likely to develop asthma or allergies compared with those born in the united states : 20 % of foreign-born kids developed allergic diseases compared with 34 % of the american-born children . the prevalence of asthma was even lower , with those born outside of the country 47 % less likely to develop the condition than those born in the united states . even after the researchers accounted for factors that could affect rates of allergies , such as race or ethnicity and socioeconomic status , the strong association between being born in the united states and the higher risk of allergic diseases remained . time.com : why we 're going nuts over nut allergies . in fact , it was clear that the u.s. environment played some role in the trend , since foreign-born children who had lived in america for more than 10 years were three times as likely to develop allergic diseases as those who spent less than two years stateside . and foreign-born children whose parents were also born outside of the united states seemed to benefit from additional protection from these conditions : 18 % of these children developed allergic disease compared with 33 % of foreign-born children whose parents were born in the united states . the results confirm those of previous studies that found higher rates of asthma among american children compared with kids from other countries , and investigators have also reported similar differences in allergic diseases between immigrants and native-born citizens in italy , israel and australia . what does birthplace have to do with how the immune-system functions ? the most likely explanation could involve the  hygiene hypothesis ,  which suggests that improved sanitation methods and efforts to keep germs at bay may deprive young , still-developing immune systems from being trained to recognize and react appropriately to the right types of irritants .  the hygiene hypothesis suggests that early-life exposures to infection or an unclean environment may protect against allergies . children born and raised outside the u.s. likely have more and/or different infectious exposures than those born in the u.s. ,  says study author dr. jonathan silverberg of st. luke 's - roosevelt hospital center in new york .  that american cities are ` too clean ' may be overstated . however , previous studies suggest that rolling in the dirt from time to time may be a good thing for kids .  time.com : why kids with known food allergies are still at risk . parental behaviors and cultural practices may also play a role .  parents born and raised outside the united states may , for example , follow a healthier diet or have foods with a different antigenic profile than typically encountered in the western diet ,  the authors write .  some cultures more commonly use spices , such as curcumin , and green tea that have antiallergy and inflammatory properties .  such factors could explain why having foreign-born parents seemed to lower risk of allergic disease in their children even further ; the finding held even after the researchers accounted for differences in race , ethnicity , socioeconomic status , and whether or not the child lived in a metropolitan area . sneezing and wheezing solutions : surprising ways to relieve spring allergies . in terms of what features of the american lifestyle or culture could be contributing to an increased risk of these diseases , previous studies from the same team of scientists suggested that factors such as climate , obesity , the western diet and various types of infections could play a role . the current study was n't designed to identify which specific environmental factors might be the most influential , but silverberg says ,  one of our goals is to determine which factor -lsb- or factors -rsb- have the greatest impact on allergic disease , and to help develop public-health interventions to decrease rates of allergic disease in the u.s.  -- because those influences would likely be far easier to change than where you 're born . this story originally published on time.com : . location , location : being born in the u.s. puts kids at higher risk of allergies . & copy 2012 time , inc. . time is a registered trademark of time inc. . used with permission .", "summary": " the u.s. environment seems to play some role in the allergy trend .   ` hygiene hypothesis ' may have something to do with it .   parental behaviors and cultural practices may also play a role .
