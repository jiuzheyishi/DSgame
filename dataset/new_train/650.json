{"text": "giant tv screens have helped to bring families back together in the living room , new research suggests . ofcom 's communications market report found that despite competing challenges for recreational time , the time people spent watching television has actually gone up . british viewers spent an average of four hours each day watching tv in 2011 , up from 3.6 hours in 2002 . meanwhile , in the first quarter of this year , more than 35 per cent of tv sets sold were at least 33in in size . happy family : big televisions are luring the children back to the living room , a new report by media regulator ofcom suggests . james thickett , ofcom 's director of research , said larger and flatter tv screens appeared to be bringing children back into the living room , reversing a trend which saw them watching a separate set in their bedroom . ` television viewing has been robust between 2002 and 2011 , ' he said . ` what 's interesting here is that with all these new technologies being adopted by 16 to 24-year-olds and to some extent children , we 're not seeing tv viewing among those age groups falling . ` it 's always been lower than average for the younger age groups because they have different lifestyles and less time at home . but we 're not seeing a major impact on tv viewing by all this extra adoption and use of new technology . ` at the same time we are seeing an increase in viewing among the older age groups . ' some 40 per cent of households had only one tv set in 2011 , compared to 35 per cent in 2002 . in 2011 , individuals watched around 209 minutes of tv on their main set each day , compared to 187 minutes on a main set in 2002 . ` one of the things that has helped drive strong tv viewing figures is the evolution of television technology , ' mr thickett added . ` in the past 10 years we have seen the development of widescreen television , hd television , screens getting flatter and very importantly screens are getting bigger ... ` what this is doing is actually bringing people back into the living room and television is taking on a new role as a family experience whereas 10 years ago , in the early 2000s , we were seeing kids , different members of the family watching different television shows in different rooms using different sets . ` the quality of the tv viewing experience has improved , the choice of channels has improved . ` we 've now got new technologies like digital video recorders that are improving the television experience . we believe that has all helped to maintain television viewing at around four hours a day . ' he said that if younger members of the family did watch different shows , they now tended to use a laptop rather than a different set . ` kids are now more likely to watch stuff on their computer or on their laptop through the iplayer rather than go up and watch television , ' he said . ` the proportion of digitally enabled second tv sets is relatively low compared to the proportion of analogue tv sets say 10 years ago . ` they 're not replacing their tvs in their bedrooms . they 're relying on laptops or different screens . we 're not going to see that mass adoption of tv screens all around the house . ' glued : in 2011 , individuals watched around 209 minutes of tv on their main set each day , compared to 187 minutes on a main set in 2002 . while tv watching has remained stable , the long-term radio listening trend has gone down . in 2011 , uk adults spent 22.5 hours a week listening to the radio , down from 24 hours in 2001 . but the figure was up by 24 minutes on 2010 . among 15 - to 24-year-olds , the long-term downwards listening trend was even more pronounced , by 22 per cent compared with 2001 . bbc radio 4 extra was the most popular digital-only station , reaching 1.5 million listeners in the first quarter of 2012 . mr thickett said : ` there has been a gradual decline in listening , being driven primarily by the younger age group . ` while they have remained pretty consistent with their tv viewing their radio viewing has gone down significantly . ` in the future we 're likely to see these trends continuing .
