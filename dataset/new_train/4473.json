{"text": "brussels -lrb- cnn -rrb- soldiers stood guard outside the jewish museum in central brussels on saturday , as belgium joined france in deploying its military alongside police to counter the threat of potential terror attacks . security has been stepped up across europe in the wake of last week 's shootings in paris and a sweeping belgian counterterror operation two days ago that left two suspects dead in the city of verviers . an attack at the jewish museum in brussels last year by an accused gunman suspected of having joined isis in syria left four people dead . soldiers in camouflage gear and police could also be seen by the great synagogue of europe in brussels and some roads in the area were closed to traffic . troops have been deployed in belgium 's largest city , antwerp , to protect its jewish district . the move follows a series of police raids that authorities said targeted a terror cell on the brink of carrying out an attack against police officers . defense minister steven vandeput told a news conference that besides jewish sites , a number of embassies in brussels were being protected , including those of the united states , israel and britain . belgium has deployed 150 troops so far in brussels and antwerp , he said . that number could be increased by another 150 in the coming days and could be extended to other cities in belgium , depending on police requests . the military personnel are supporting the police and are under their command , vandeput said . belgium 's security council is expected to review the national threat level and security measures next week . vandeput told journalists it was the first time in 35 years that the military had been deployed on the streets of belgium . overall , authorities made 17 arrests related to the belgium threat -- 13 in belgium and four at two locations in france . three people remained in custody and two were released under strict conditions saturday in belgium , the prosecutor 's office said . the others were released . in addition , belgium is seeking the extradition of two belgian nationals arrested in france . in a sign of the widening scope of the threat , police in greece said they are conducting an investigation in connection with the belgian terror plot . a police spokesman would not specify whether anyone had been taken into custody , saying ,  we are not in a position to comment at this point .  meanwhile , france has deployed more than 10,000 troops alongside thousands of police officers as it responds to the deadly attacks in paris last week , in which 17 people were killed . a total of 122,000 police officers , gendarmes and military personnel are deployed as part of the security plan , interior minister bernard cazeneuve said friday . there are 12 people in custody in the paris region in connection with the investigation there , according to the paris prosecutor 's office . a number have been arrested and then released . two men in their early 40s were also arrested friday in berlin on suspicion of links to isis , police said . they did not appear to have been planning attacks in germany and the police operation had been planned for some weeks . european counterterrorism agencies are scrambling to assess the potential terrorism threat from people with suspected links to islamic extremists . as many as 20 sleeper cells of between 120 and 180 people could be ready to strike in france , germany , belgium and the netherlands , a western intelligence source told cnn . european union and middle east intelligence agencies identified an  imminent threat  to belgium , and possibly to the netherlands , the source told cnn .  there is a tremendous amount of concern over sleeper cells in europe ,  said a western official with direct knowledge of the situation . however , the netherlands said it was not raising its terror threat level , currently at  substantial ,  the second-highest level -- where it has been since march 2013 .  that means there is a realistic threat , but no concrete or specific information of an attack in the netherlands ,  said edmond messchaert , a government spokesman . one of the two gunmen who attacked france 's charlie hebdo magazine , said kouachi , was buried overnight in his hometown of reims , france , his lawyer , antoine flacaquier said . said kouachi 's wife was there , but no other family members -- and there was no imam present , flacaquier told cnn affiliate bfm on saturday . kouachi was buried in an unmarked grave , flacaquier said . his brother cherif kouachi 's widow , izzana kouachi , had requested that both brothers be buried in gennevilliers , on the outskirts of paris . the gennevilliers mayor 's office told cnn that the city was obliged by law to bury cherif kouachi there , as he was a resident of the city . but a spokesman for the mayor , jean-francois boye , said that it would not do the same for said , because he lived in reims . the two suspects killed in belgium were shot during a police raid on a building in the eastern city of verviers on thursday , belgian authorities said . a third suspect was injured and taken into custody in the operation . authorities have not yet confirmed their identities . federal prosecutor eric van der sypt said friday that 13 people were arrested in a dozen ensuing anti-terror raids overnight .  this group for what we know now was specifically targeting belgium police and planned to kill belgium police on the streets or in buildings where belgium police is housed ,  he told cnn .  we always have to take into account that there is a possibility that people who go to syria and come back have plans to commit terrorist attacks . when possible , we try to monitor and we try to follow up these people and especially those who we think could be a threat , but like i said , a zero threat is impossible .  he said the belgian authorities were already doing all they could to manage the threat . the suspected terror cell , which included people returning from syria , planned to target police officers , van der sypt said . police said they recovered weapons , bomb-making materials and police uniforms . two people suspected of involvement with the alleged terror cell in verviers were detained trying to cross from france into italy through the frejus tunnel , a spokesman for belgium 's federal prosecutor 's office said . the attacks in paris began on january 7 , when said and cherif kouachi raided charlie hebdo magazine , killing 12 people . a day later , gunman amedy coulibaly -- who purportedly was affiliated with isis -- shot a policewoman in the south of paris . coulibaly killed four more people he had held hostage at a kosher supermarket . police shot him and the kouachi brothers dead on january 9 . security officials have since been working to track those with links to the three attackers . how the kouachi brothers were radicalized . al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , al qaeda 's yemen affiliate , claimed responsibility wednesday for the charlie hebdo shooting . one or both the kouachi brothers are thought to have traveled to yemen . sectarian turmoil in yemen is bolstering al qaeda in the arabian peninsula 's -lrb- aqap -rrb- local recruitment , and buying it space for attacks against the west , according to one western diplomat . aqap 's claimed involvement in the charlie hebdo attack has turned the spotlight on yemen and potential connections between jihadists there and in france . a yemeni official briefed on security matters told cnn that two frenchmen had been detained a few months ago as they tried to leave the country . they were  suspected of offering logistical support to aqap in the south ,  the official said , adding that they were not thought to be offering to fight . he said officials were assessing whether to charge the men or what their next step would be . isis , the extremist islamist group that controls swathes of iraq and syria , may present an even greater threat . officials are monitoring groups of men who have returned from fighting in syria . it is believed isis directed operatives to return to europe to launch attacks in retaliation for airstrikes against the terror group in syria and iraq , according to the official . several european nations , including the united kingdom , france , belgium and the netherlands , are participating in the air campaign against isis in iraq . isis runs large training facilities in syria , has deep pockets , and access to thousands of potential european recruits .
