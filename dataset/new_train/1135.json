{"text": "residents of orange county now have a new option when filling up their cars - fuels created from human waste . an experimental project from the university of california hopes to prove that human waste can have its uses as a fuel . it is even working with car maker hyundai , which is set to begin leasing cars that can use the new fuel - for free . powered by poo : hyundai plans to begin leasing a fuel-cell version of its tucson crossover , which can travel about 480 kilometers on a tank of hydrogen . first , sewage is separated into water and biosolids . the waste water is cleaned , filtered and treated for reuse , while solid waste is piped into airless tanks filled with microbes . a byproduct of their digestion is a gas that 's 60 percent methane and about 40 percent carbon dioxide , which is burned at the plant for power generation . however , some is filtered and piped into a unique , stationary ` tri-generation ' fuel-cell device , designed by the irvine team , that produces electricity , heat and hydrogen . the hydrogen gas is then piped several hundred feet to the public pump where fuel-cell autos are refueled daily . inventor jack brouwer developed the system wit fellow scientists from uc irvine 's national fuel cell research center . they developed a sytem that feeds the solid waste to microbes . the gas they give off is then burnt for power , while some is kept back and used to fuel hydrogen powered cars . however , one downside has been that the orange county sanitation district 's fountain valley waste facility does have a certain unique aroma . ` it smells like money , ' brouwer optimistically told bloomberg . the team built the fountain valley project with about $ 10 million in funding from sources including california government bodies and a u.s. department of energy grant , and it makes enough hydrogen to supply about 200 fuel-cell vehicles each day . brouwer 's customers are soon set to increase . hyundai plans to begin leasing a fuel-cell version of its tucson crossover , which can travel about 480 kilometers on a tank of hydrogen . the lease price will be $ 2,999 down and $ 499 a month , hyundai said - which includes free fuel from nearly a dozen hydrogen pumps around the state . hyundai is also partnering with enterprise rent-a-car to make the tucson fuel cell available to consumers in the los angeles/orange county region . toyota , honda , mercedes-benz and gm are also beginning to sell hydrogen cars in the region . power to the people : researchers say human waste is a viable source of power for hydrogen cars . the fuel-cell powered tucson can drive for 50 miles per kilogram of hydrogen , and its two tanks hold about 5.64 kilograms -lrb- 12.4 pounds -rrb- . costs of compressed gas in california range from about $ 5 to $ 10 per kilogram , depending on the facility , and it takes around three minutes to fill the tank . hyundai says it hopes the technology will become popular - and will take on the electric car as the eco-vehicle of choice . ` hydrogen-powered fuel cell electric vehicles represent the next generation of zero-emission vehicle technology , so we 're thrilled to be a leader in offering the mass-produced , federally certified tucson fuel cell to retail customers , ' said john krafcik of hyundai motor america . ` the superior range and fast-fill refueling speed of our tucson fuel cell vehicle contrast with the lower range and slow-charge characteristics of competing battery electric vehicles . ` we think fuel cell technology will increase the adoption rate of zero-emission vehicles , and we 'll all share the environmental benefits . '", "summary": " fuel cell cars can be refilled from stations powered by human waste .   waste taken directly from southern california 's sewage system .   hyundai will lease cars with unlimited refills of hydrogen fuel .
