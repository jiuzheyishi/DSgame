{"text": "we 've learned that some varieties of fish are low in fat and contain oils that keep the heart healthy . but recent reports about contaminants such as mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls , or pcbs , have prompted some health experts to rethink their advice about seafood . lots of varieties of fish are safe , but some types of seafood can be risky for certain groups of people . for seattle cardiologist florence sheehan , m.d. , it is n't just her patients she worries about . it 's her family , too .  ours has a history of high cholesterol ,  sheehan says .  so i eat fish frequently to keep my cholesterol down .  lately , she finds herself scanning medical journals and government advisories to stay abreast of fish safety issues . she says that untangling the facts behind the latest seafood scares is n't as complicated as it seems .  the key is to place the benefits and risks into perspective ,  sheehan says .  lots of varieties of fish are safe . it 's just that some types of seafood can be risky for certain groups of people .  here 's a look at which fish pose risks , and which ones are safe -- and good for you , too . the truth about salmon . a 2004 study in the journal science raised concern among fish lovers with news that farm-raised salmon , the type found at most supermarkets , contained higher levels of cancer-causing pcbs than wild salmon . -lrb- banned in the 1970s , pcbs still contaminate the environment . they are released by incinerators and toxic waste sites . -rrb- but two more recent studies , one on farm-raised salmon and the other on wild , found that both harbor similar levels of this pollutant . the first study , done with chilean - and canadian-farmed salmon , found an average of 11.5 parts per billion pcbs . the second , conducted by the alaska department of environmental conservation , sampled 600 wild salmon from the gulf of alaska and the bering sea , and found 8.2 to 10 parts per billion pcbs . it 's important to realize that the amount of pcbs being talked about is very small , says cornell university seafood specialist ken gall , who has studied fish safety issues for 22 years .  high doses of pcbs , like the kind of contamination that occurs with an industrial accident , can be dangerous ,  gall says .  but it 's uncertain whether the tiny amounts of pcbs found in many foods such as fish , meat , or milk can cause cancer .  most health experts feel the health benefits of salmon far outweigh the risk posed by minute levels of pcbs . william connor , m.d. , a professor of medicine at oregon health and science university , in portland , who has spent most of his career studying the health benefits of the omega-3 fats found in salmon , says he has no qualms about recommending farm-raised salmon .  i would rather my patients not miss out on the benefits of salmon , a fish with some of the highest levels of heart-healthy omega-3 fats around , than fear pcbs ,  he says . connor adds that for most people , farmed fish might be all that 's available in the local supermarket . indeed , the majority of the 16 pounds of fish the average american eats annually is farmed . another benefit of farm-raised salmon and other fish , he says , is that they 're typically low in mercury . cookinglight.com : 7 salmon main dish recipes . minding mercury . since exposure to high levels of mercury can cause neurological damage in a growing fetus , the food and drug administration continues to issue related seafood safety advisories to pregnant women and young children . in march of 2004 , the fda updated that advice with stricter , more specific rules : pregnant women , or women who plan to become pregnant , should avoid eating four fish with high levels of mercury : swordfish , shark , tilefish , and king mackerel . while fresh and canned tuna did n't make the fda 's list , many experts say pregnant women may be better off limiting fresh tuna steaks and canned albacore , or  white ,  tuna to one meal per week or less , since these large fish can harbor mercury levels close to the one part per million threshold the fda deems safe . -lrb- canned light tuna is considered safe since it is made with smaller skipjack fish that are low in mercury . -rrb- the american medical association recently encouraged the fda to require supermarkets to post warning signs about mercury near canned tuna as well as at the fish counter . cookinglight.com : risks , benefits of 8 most popular u.s. seafood . being aware of mercury is also a good idea for those who are n't pregnant . when internal medicine specialist jane m. hightower , m.d. , performed a yearlong study of 123 of her patients , she found that a steady diet of high-mercury fish caused serious symptoms such as headaches , hair loss , problems with concentration , and high blood levels of mercury . fortunately , once these patients switched to eating low-mercury varieties , symptoms began to disappear , and blood mercury levels returned to a safe level . minimize risk . purdue university seafood expert charles santerre , ph.d. , thinks the key to minimizing health risks for any food is to aim for variety .  if you ate swordfish or shark or king mackerel every day , you could experience mercury toxicity ,  santerre says .  but if you eat them once a month -lsb- and trade off with -rsb- some other low-mercury fish , it should n't be a problem .  however , the  sensitive population ,  including pregnant and nursing women , should always avoid swordfish , shark , tilefish , and king mackerel , santerre says . on his list of safe , low-mercury options : shrimp , salmon , pollock , farm-raised catfish , tilapia , flatfish -lrb- flounder , sole , plaice -rrb- , scallops , haddock , farm-raised trout , herring , crawfish , mullet , oysters , ocean perch , sardines , squid , white fish , and anchovies . connor agrees . he eats seafood three or four times per week and calls the health benefits of fish , particularly the varieties that harbor omega-3 fats , profound .  these fats prevent heart disease . they lower blood pressure and help prevent strokes . and studies show that eating two meals of fatty fish like salmon or sardines each week can help prevent sudden death ,  connor says . cookinglight.com : the alphas of omega-3s . there are additional benefits as well .  -lsb- by eating fish -rsb- you may be replacing a fatty meal like a bacon cheeseburger with something low in fat ,  sheehan says . she advises her patients to eat fish at least twice per week , particularly those rich in omega-3s . and after looking at all the safety issues , she feels comfortable taking her own advice . safe supplements . if fish can harbor toxins , it seems plausible that the oils extracted from fish to make supplements might be contaminated , but that 's not the case .  fish oils are pure ,  says connor . one recent study tested 16 fish oil supplements sold in warehouse clubs , pharmacies , and supermarkets , and none contained significant amounts of mercury , pcbs , or the pollutant dioxin . currently , the american heart association recommends 1,000 milligrams of fish oil supplements per week for people with heart disease . according to connor , supplements are a great way for nonfish lovers to tap into the important heart-healthy benefits of omega-3 fatty acids . angling for trouble . freshwater sport fishing brings its own share of safety concerns because of runoff from farms and sewage treatment plants , as well as the same environmental contaminants like mercury and pcbs that are found in ocean fish .  the risk is different if you 're fishing in a lake and eating only fish from that lake ,  says cornell 's gall .  chances are you 'll be eating a good amount of the fish you catch , so your exposure levels to a particular contaminant , or the contaminants in the lake , will be higher than exposure levels for someone who eats a variety of commercial fish from many sources .  cookinglight.com : selecting , storing and cooking fish . gall advises anglers to check with their local or state environmental health department for the most current warnings regarding the area where they plan to fish . if waters are safe to fish , the environmental protection agency suggests catching the smallest fish allowed -- as a rule , the smaller the fish , the fewer the contaminants . other safe freshwater choices include bluegill , perch , stream trout , and smelt . since these panfish feed mainly on insects , they 're less likely to harbor pollutants . pregnant women are advised to eat only six ounces of freshwater fish a week since freshwater predator fish such as walleye , smallmouth and largemouth bass , lake trout , and northern pike tend to contain higher levels of mercury than other local water varieties . e-mail to a friend . for more tips on making healthy taste great , try
