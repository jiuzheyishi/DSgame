{"text": "in what could be considered the ultimate in wearable technology , a biohacker has inserted a computer under his skin . the biometric sensor is fitted into german-based tim cannon 's forearm - between his skin and tissue - and tracks changes in his body 's temperature . this sensor can connect wirelessly to any android device , produce readouts of the temperature changes and send cannon a text message if he 's suffering from a fever , for example . scroll down for video . german-based biohacker tim cannon fitted the biometric sensor , pictured , under the skin on his forearm . it connects by bluetooth to an android tablet . the sensor tracks changes in his body 's temperature . if the temperature reaches a certain level , a text message is sent warning him of a fever . to insert the device , an incision was made on cannon 's forearm above an existing tattoo . his skin was lifted and separated away . from his tissue and the device was inserted into the pocket that is . created before being sutured shut . the sensor can connect wirelessly over bluetooth to . any android device , produce readouts of the temperature changes , and . send cannon a text message if he 's suffering from a fever , for example . circadia is protected inside a protective case and has a battery that can be charged wirelessly . cannon created the sensor , called circadia 1.0 , using a bluetooth connector , computer chip , and fitted it with led lights . these leds act as ` status lights ' that can be used to light up a tattoo on cannon 's arm , under which the sensor is fitted . the first version of the sensor reads temperature changes but , in theory , later versions could be used to track other vital signs and body changes . circadia is protected inside a protective case and has a battery that can be charged wirelessly . ` the human body is really failing in almost every way , ' cannon told motherboard , vice 's science and technology channel . ` i want to live to be thousands of years old , i do n't want to die and i do n't know why anybody would . ` -lsb- the idea behind the sensor -rsb- is very fun . it 's meant to capture people 's imagination . ' cannon created the sensor , called circadia 1.0 , pictured , using a bluetooth connector , computer chip , and fitted it with led lights . the sensor is set to go on sale ` soon ' for around $ 500 -lrb- # 313 -rrb- and is open source , meaning the data can be collected and used in whichever way the owner wants . cannon is a biohacker working for a company called grindhouse wetware that builds devices designed to integrate with the human body . cannon added : ` we basically focus on the merging of man and machine . ' to insert the device , an incision was made on cannon 's forearm above an existing tattoo . his skin was lifted and separated away from his tissue and the device was inserted into the pocket that was created before being sutured shut . it was inserted by a so-called flesh engineer called steve haworth at the body modification conference in germany . to insert the device , pictured , an incision was made on cannon 's forearm above an existing tattoo . his skin was lifted and separated away from his tissue and the device was inserted into the pocket that was created , before being sutured shut . leds fitted to the sensor act as ` status lights ' to show the device is working . cannon told motherboard that no doctor would carry out the procedure , and haworth did not use any anaesthetic . before the procedure , haworth told motherboard : ` when we put this in it will make history . ' the circadia 1.0 is set to go on sale ` soon ' for around $ 500 -lrb- # 313 -rrb- and is open source , meaning that the data can be collected and used in whichever way the owner wants . this does not include fitting , which haworth said he would charge around $ 200 -lrb- # 125 -rrb- .", "summary": " hacker tim cannon inserted the chip to track changes in his temperature .   he fitted the circadia 1.0 biometric sensor under the skin of his forearm .   the sensor links with an android device and can even send text messages .   would-be hackers will soon be able to buy the sensor for $ 500 -lrb- # 313 -rrb- .
