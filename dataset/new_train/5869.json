' her family are raising money for the bucket list and to raise money for research into the syndrome . ` we have got to make memories with ella , ' said jodie . ` she does n't want us to be upset , she wants us to be happy . she is such a lovely girl and very loving . ` everyday is special when you know it is coming to an end .
