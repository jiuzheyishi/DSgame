{"text": "president barack obama is sending about 100 u.s. troops to africa to help hunt down the leaders of the notoriously violent lord 's resistance army in and around uganda .  i have authorized a small number of combat-equipped u.s. forces to deploy to central africa to provide assistance to regional forces that are working toward the removal of joseph kony from the battlefield ,  obama said in letter sent friday to house speaker john boehner and daniel inouye , the president pro tempore of the senate . kony is the head of the lord 's resistance army . u.s. military personnel advising regional forces working to target kony and other senior leaders will not engage kony 's forces  unless necessary for self-defense ,  obama said .  i believe that deploying these u.s. armed forces furthers u.s. national security interests and foreign policy and will be a significant contribution toward counter-lra efforts in central africa .  obama noted that the group  has murdered , raped , and kidnapped tens of thousands of men , women and children in central africa  and  continues to commit atrocities across the central african republic , the democratic republic of the congo and south sudan that have a disproportionate impact on regional security .  what is the lord 's resistance army ? according to the state department ,  since 2008 alone , the lra has killed more than 2,400 people and abducted more than 3,400 . the united nations estimates that over 380,000 people are displaced across the region because of lra activity .  obama said the united states since 2008 has backed regional military efforts to go after the lord 's resistance army . state department spokeswoman victoria nuland said that since that time the united states has provided more than $ 40 million in support . efforts to combat the lra , however , have been unsuccessful . in his letter , obama cited the lord 's resistance army disarmament and northern uganda recovery act of 2009 . in that measure , congress  expressed support for increased , comprehensive u.s. efforts to help mitigate and eliminate the threat posed by the lra to civilians and regional stability ,  he said .  i have directed this deployment , which is in the national security and foreign policy interests of the united states , pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct u.s. foreign relations and as commander in chief and chief executive . i am making this report as part of my efforts to keep the congress fully informed , consistent with the war powers resolution ,  he said .  i appreciate the support of the congress in this action .  obama said the initial team of u.s. military personnel  with appropriate combat equipment  deployed to uganda on wednesday . other forces deploying include  a second combat-equipped team and associated headquarters , communications and logistics personnel .   our forces will provide information , advice and assistance to select partner nation forces ,  he said .  subject to the approval of each respective host nation , elements of these u.s. forces will deploy into uganda , south sudan , the central african republic and the democratic republic of the congo . the support provided by u.s. forces will enhance regional efforts against the lra .  the u.s. troops backing the operation  are primarily comprised of special operations forces ,  according to the pentagon . it said the united states has been helping uganda and the other regional countries in their fight against the lra since 2008 . the u.s. has provided logistical support , non-lethal equipment , training and intelligence assistance , as well as $ 33 million to uganda 's people defense forces effort to counter the group . the pentagon cited multiple examples of its assistance , such as sending equipment to central african armed forces and training a democratic republic of congo light infantry battalion deployed in that country 's northeast . it noted that u.s. africa command is  exploring ways to support the military of south sudan .  in early october 2010 , the u.s. military had more than 1,700 troops deployed in sub-saharan africa , the pentagon said . the majority of them -- around 1,380 - were deployed in djibouti . but u.s. troops had at least a small presence in 33 different nations in sub-saharan africa . at this time last year they had nine troops in uganda . one conservative member of congress , sen. jim inhofe , r-oklahoma , weighed in to support the effort .  i applaud our nation 's military for making this a priority and taking the steps outlined in our legislation that will eventually protect the children and people from joseph kony 's reign of terror ,  inhofe said .  i have witnessed firsthand the devastation caused by the lra , and this will help end kony 's heinous acts that have created a human rights crisis in africa . we must work to bring justice to the children and victims in uganda devastated by kony and the lra . i have been fervently involved in trying to prevent further abductions and murders of ugandan children , and today 's action offers hope that the end of the lra is in sight .  kony claims he is a prophet sent from god to replace the ugandan government with a democracy based on the ten commandments . the group has been  notorious for kidnapping children and forcing them to become rebel fighters or concubines ,  according to the website globalsecurity.org . the international criminal court has issued arrest warrants against kony and four other group leaders for crimes against humanity and war crimes . chief prosecutor luis moreno-campo said that the  lra is an involuntary army and the majority of the fighters are formerly abducted children .  obama 's plan in dealing with the lra calls for increasing  protection of civilians ,  apprehending or removing kony and senior lra commanders from the battlefield , promoting the  defection , disarmament , demobilization and reintegration of remaining lra fighters  and increasing  humanitarian access .  representatives of 34 groups in the lra-affected areas of northern congo , central african republic , and southern sudan wrote obama in december , applauding his commitment to tackle the problem and urging him to deal with the group , according to human rights watch .  each day that goes by without a solution to the problem of the lra is another day of terror and pain for those of us living under constant threat of renewed attacks . already , the lra has brutally killed more than 2,300 of our family members and abducted over 3,000 others since they began their latest wave of killings in september 2008 ,  the letter said .  many of our children are still in the hands of the lra . we do not know if they are alive or dead . those who have managed to escape the lra bear the physical and mental scars of what they have suffered and will never be the same again . we have few means to help them readjust and integrate back into our communities , but we are trying to do what we can .  the letter cites massacres in 2008 and 2009 .  during these attacks , our family members were killed in unimaginably savage ways : their heads crushed with clubs or machetes ; their faces disfigured ; and their genitals , mouths , ears , legs and arms cut off , for no reason other than to terrorize . ", "summary": " groups say that  without a solution ,  it is daily  terror and pain    the united states is going after the head of the lord 's resistance army .   the  army  operates through central africa .   a republican senator supports the move .
