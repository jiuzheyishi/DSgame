{"text": "the u.s. house on tuesday approved a 10-year extension of a federal law requiring that all guns be detectable by metal screening machines . but partisan wrangling could still mean the undetectable firearms act , approved 25 years ago , will expire next monday . the law prohibits guns that do n't contain enough metal to trigger screening machines commonly found in airports , courthouses and other secure areas accessible to the public . it has become an issue with the advent of 3-d printers , which the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives recently said its tests showed are capable of producing lethal firearms entirely made of plastic . atf tests show 3-d guns lethal as metal detection law expires . a one-sentence bill by rep. howard coble , r-north carolina , was approved easily by house lawmakers and sent to the senate . the obama administration and congressional democrats want any extension to also deal with potential loopholes for 3-d-printed guns , which the house bill does not do . currently , plastic guns made using 3-d printers comply with the law by inserting a removable metal block . that has led to worries that plastic guns could pass through metal detectors without being flagged by simply removing the block , which is n't required for a 3-d-printed gun to operate . plastic components have become common in popular guns , but commercial manufacturers often use metal as a permanent part of the gun to comply with the law . proposals to extend the law have languished for months . the obama administration and congressional democrats want an extension to also take into account the new technology , by making all guns be required to contain metal in the functioning parts of the firearm . the white house said it supported reauthorization of the  commonsense gun safety  measure .  but congress should work to close any loopholes that make it possible to evade the law with new technologies ,  said white house spokesman matt lehrich . sen. charles schumer , d-new york , is sponsoring a one-year extension of the law , arguing it would give lawmakers time to come up with a new measure that would tighten the rules to require metal parts in guns . texas company makes metal gun with 3-d printer . schumer has said he 'll try to get his bill passed next week .  the house bill is better than nothing , but it 's not good enough ,  schumer said .  we absolutely must close the loophole that allows anyone to legally make a gun that could be rendered invisible by the easy removal of its metal part . under current law , it is legal to make a plastic gun so long as it has some metal in it , even if it is easily removable . the bill we 'll try to pass in the senate would fix that .  republicans say democrats are refusing to work with them to pass a longer-term extension of the law .  the -lrb- democratic -rrb- majority is playing politics with public safety ,  iowa sen. charles grassley said last week after democrats tried a legislative maneuver to pass schumer 's one-year extension .  it does n't meet the common-sense test to only reauthorize an extension of the undetectable firearms act for a short year ,  grassley said . with the senate out on a break and not returning to work until monday , it remains unlikely legislation will be ready to take its place .", "summary": " law requiring all guns include enough metal to be detected during screening to expire .   congress must act by next week to renew law , but wrangling continues .   white house and democrats want tougher measure than house-approved bill .   concern growing about plastic guns made through 3-d printing .
