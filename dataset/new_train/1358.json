{"text": "we readily sit down to watch tv , or read books , or listen to music on the radio . but there is one sense we rarely record and play back - the sense of smell - even if we can all recall our favourite scents , such as the smell of coffee in the morning , a freshly-cut lawn or the salty bracing smell of sea air . now , graphic designer and photographer kate mclean has been combining her love of maps with her desire to explore our overlooked sense , leading to ` sensory maps ' of cities around the world . each map is a labour of love as well as a lot of labour , with kate moving around each city , meeting the people who live and work in the various districts , and then capturing and re-creating the smells she encounters to create the maps . her experiences have led her to the fishermen of the river clyde in glasgow , who occasionally have to pull bodies from the water , to the ` smelliest ' block of new york , as well as the olfactory delights of paris and the fresh sea air of newport in rhode island . all have all come under the keen observation of her nose , and found their way into her maps . paris , distilled : kate builds a map of each city , guided by her own experiences and the observations of local people . kate . says her aim is to sensitize tourists and visitors to a new place , and . use a ` largely-ignored sense in their perception of that place ' . she . said : ` smell has a  do not enter brain processing  connection with our . emotions , making smell the supreme retainer of memory over our other . senses . ` we have 100 per cent smell recall after one year but only 30 per cent sight memory after three months . ` the . first time we smell a new scent we automatically associate it with . whether we like it or not -lrb- positive or negative -rrb- and we associate it . with the location where we smell it . ` therefore i propose that smell can be used in tourism marketing to foster lasting memories of a place . ' how does glasgow smell to you ? scents picked up by kate mclean include perfume , fast food , building dust and ` hot bovril at the footy ' speaking to her alumni publication for suffolk university , she said : ` maps are an old graphic device of data visualization . ` maps . show proximity , range , location -- all characteristics of smell that are . difficult to explain verbally in any kind of a coherent way . ` moreover i have been fascinated by maps since i was a small child . ' i . wanted to make maps but realized , at ten years of age , that the world . had already been discovered . so , if the physical , geographical world has . been represented then i just had to discover a new territory -- my . landscape is the smell-scape . ' new york 's smelliest block : cabbage , car oil , dried fish , cheap perfume and a/c all combine to make this a smell to remember . kate started with paris ` because it has astonishing emotion-inducing scents . ` the . paris smell map is a virtual d√©rive , a collection of perfumes placed on . shelving on a board showing parisian streets . audience members walk a . pace at a time to sniff as they  wander  the city 's streets . ' i . moved on to edinburgh . that city has one pervasive smell -- identified . as malt extract from the breweries -- which sweeps the city 's streets , . but the secondary smells are equally evocative . ` the . maps themselves do not smell ; instead i make up individual scents using . only natural ingredients that best reflect the smells i have selected . to depict visually . ` each . scent is stored in its own bottle which is stored in a small cabinet . underneath the map . i prefer to keep the contents of the bottles hidden . so that the audience can not rely on visual cues to identify the smells . ` for . this reason i do not label the smells . i make most of the smells . myself , trying to capture and hold elusive scents in the small bottles . ' i . have learned how to distill rose petals , to create a perfume of stinky . cheese , to depict the smell of penguins at the zoo without harming a . single penguin . i can fabricate the smell of a building site and of . boy 's toilets in primary schools . ' from the smells of sea , sand and beach to boys toilets in primary schools . you may not agree with kate 's descriptions , but she does paint quite a sensory picture . each . project varies slightly as i amend my methodology . initially i decided . on the smells based on personal experience . then i started asking local . residents of the city in question to provide me with the smells that . they associate with their environments . this progressed to asking for comments via my blog and to asking local media to help solicit responses . ` overall . there is nothing to beat talking to local people , and in newport i took . time to devise a couple of smell walks and a wonderful smell bike ride . bikers are keen sniffers ! ` the . resulting conversations revealed a vast amount of data including . numerous descriptions of the ocean smell from the bikers -lrb- ocean , salt , . weed , brine , home , fog -rrb- and a collection of urban aromas that combined . the smell of homes , transport and business with the overall heady aroma . of freshly frying bacon just outside the newport police station .
