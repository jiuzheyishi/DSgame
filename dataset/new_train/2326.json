{"text": "after losing a close friend to liver failure , candy chang spent a lot of time thinking about how she wanted to live out her days . contemplating death brought clarity to her life , but she struggled to maintain perspective amid the daily grind . she wondered whether other people went through the same struggle , and what mattered to them . she decided to invite others to share those thoughts by painting a chalkboard on the side of an abandoned house in new orleans stenciled with the sentence  before i die i want to ________ .  what began as an experiment in making a public space into a shared space has become a global art project , with more than 400  before i die  walls in 60 countries and 25 languages . it 's been quite the journey for chang , who did not launch the project with plans to expand beyond new orleans . but it resonated among pockets of passionate people around the globe .  our public spaces are as profound as we allow them to be ,  chang , an artist , designer and urban planner , said in an e-mail .  our public spaces are our shared spaces , and they have a lot of potential to offer us a more valuable and meaningful kind of life . i think about why we came together in the first place . some of the earliest gathering places were graves and sacred groves . we gathered so we could grieve together and worship together and console one another and be alone together .  many of the walls disappear a few months after they 're  born ,  just like chang 's did , after someone bought the building and renovated it . then , others pop up . such is life . in honor of the release of the first book celebrating before i die 's global footprint , we asked chang to reflect upon the most common themes expressed in the walls . hopefully , they inspire you to reconsider your hopes , dreams and aspirations . 1 . well-being .  before i die  came out of chang 's grief and depression , and the responses  have reassured me that i 'm not alone as i try to make sense of myself ,  she said .  carl jung said it 's easier to go to the moon than it is to penetrate one 's own being . mental health takes as much exertion as physical health ,  she said . examples : .  abandon all insecurities  -lrb- new orleans -rrb- .  come to terms with who i am  -lrb- washington -rrb- .  slow down for a moment and maybe even stop  -lrb- portsmouth , hew hampshire -rrb- .  find serenity  -lrb- vicenza , italy -rrb- .  stop being afraid  -lrb- jerusalem -rrb- .  overcome depression  -lrb- newport news , virginia -rrb- .  lose my fear of death  -lrb- trujillo , peru -rrb- .  find what i 'm looking for -lrb- san francisco -rrb- .  heal  -lrb- montreal -rrb- .  find closure  -lrb- erfurt , germany -rrb- .  keep getting better every day  -lrb- chung-li , taiwan -rrb- .  feel comfortable in my skin  -lrb- burning man festival -rrb- .  reach my constant happiness  -lrb- berlin -rrb- .  learn to be brave  -lrb- almaty , kazakhstan -rrb- .  right all my wrongs  -lrb- brooklyn -rrb- .  learn how to enjoy myself and let go  -lrb- savannah , georgia -rrb- .  feel that nothing was missing or left over  -lrb- santiago , chile -rrb- . 2 . love .  love and be loved  is one of the most common responses on walls around the world , chang said . she 's also seen budding romance on walls .  in new orleans , someone wrote , ` before i die i want to eat a salad with an alien , ' and someone else drew an arrow and wrote ` before i die i want to marry this person , '  she said . examples : .  love her until the end of the world  -lrb- cordoba , argentina -rrb- .  sleep with a harp player  -lrb- lisbon , portugal -rrb- .  get married for the 10th time  -lrb- dublin -rrb- .  find and kiss her one last time  -lrb- chicago -rrb- .  find my true love  -lrb- beijing -rrb- .  love recklessly again  -lrb- new orleans -rrb- .  find my other half  -lrb- madrid -rrb- .  accompany him forever  -lrb- chung-li , taiwan -rrb- .  be loved unconditionally  -lrb- jersey city , new jersey -rrb- . 3 . travel . who does n't have a long list of places they 'd like to visit ? travel can be the hardest thing to find the time and money to invest in , but that does n't stop us from dreaming and plotting adventures .  my family had a big white van that we drove all over the place when i was a kid ,  chang said .  ever since , traveling has been my school and my therapy . i 've taken many road trips across america , and i worked in nairobi , helsinki , medan , johannesburg and beyond . those experiences deeply shaped who i am today . it 's made me more open-minded , reflective , compassionate , and grateful .  examples : .  travel around the world by foot  -lrb- almaty , kazakhstan -rrb- .  ride a motorcycle across south america  -lrb- cordoba , argentina -rrb- .  take my wife to liverpool  -lrb- portsmouth , new hampshire -rrb- .  ride my bike up the top ten highest mountains in thailand  -lrb- chiang mai , thailand -rrb- .  visit venice with the love of my life  -lrb- auckland , new zealand -rrb- .  drive route 66  -lrb- melbourne , australia -rrb- .  travel across india on a bike  -lrb- hyderabad , india -rrb- .  straddle the international date line  -lrb- new orleans -rrb- .  finish climbing everest  -lrb- reno , nevada -rrb- .  enjoy a pleasant cruise  -lrb- pohang city , south korea -rrb- . 4 . helping others . many of us say we 'd like to  donate lots of money ,   change a child 's life ,   help my neighbor  or  build a public school and a shelter .  but putting others ahead of ourselves can be a tall order for some , especially in an era of instant gratification . but , it 's never too late , said chang , and even the smallest gesture can last a lifetime .  i 'll never forget a middle school art teacher who encouraged me when i was full of self-doubt , a neighbor who fixed my bike pedal or a stranger who went out of his way to return my lost bag . compassion lasts much longer than the moment .  examples : .  teach kids to live love and be free  -lrb- johannesburg -rrb- .  save lives  -lrb- dubai -rrb- .  help people through neuroscience  -lrb- portsmouth , new hampshire -rrb- .  fix nick 's car  -lrb- cape town , south africa -rrb- .  make someone 's day  -lrb- milwaukee , wisconsin -rrb- .  see a just society  -lrb- madrid -rrb- .  do something for animals and make the world a better place  -lrb- hyderabad , india -rrb- . 5 . family .  making this project made me realize how much more i want to know my parents ,  chang said .  i 'm glad we 're at a stage where we 're good friends now , and i ask them fifty questions for every photograph from their childhood . each week , my dad sends me endearing stories that only enhance the inspiring mythology of our lives .  examples : .  bring peace of mind to my mom  -lrb- brooklyn -rrb- .  see my youngest fly  -lrb- minneapolis -rrb- .  see where my grandma grew up  -lrb- townsville , australia -rrb- .  see my parents again  -lrb- erfurt , germany -rrb- .  speak with my children one last time  -lrb- cordoba , spain -rrb- .  make my parents proud  -lrb- burning man festival -rrb- .  see my daughter graduate  -lrb- new orleans -rrb- .  be back in my kid 's life  -lrb- reno , nevada -rrb- .  build a house for my mother  -lrb- trujillo , peru -rrb- .  meet my daughter  -lrb- montreal -rrb- .  be a grandfather  -lrb- madrid -rrb- .  take care of my parents  -lrb- hyderabad -rrb- .  have seven children  -lrb- asunciÃ ³ n , paraguay -rrb- .  raise good kids  -lrb- charleston , south carolina -rrb- .", "summary": " the  before i die  global art project invites people to share hopes , dreams on public walls .   more than 400  before i die  have been created in 60 countries and in 25 languages .    before i die  walls are celebrated in a new book out this month .   creator candy chang reflects upon the 5 most prominent themes on the walls .
