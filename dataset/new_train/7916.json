' last week , official figures showed that the government 's squeeze on entrants from outside the eu has succeeded in pushing immigration into britain to its lowest level in nearly a decade . the number coming to live in britain fell by 74,000 in the 12 months to june last year as curbs on students and workers from outside europe began to bite . ` we have reviewed all migration routes to the uk and have put in place measures to reduce immigration , ' said a source close to the home secretary . ` the latest statistics are encouraging and show that net migration continues to fall . but our work is not complete . ' the source said mrs may was examining ` financial bonds as a further deterrent to reduce non-compliance by high-risk nationalities ' . the measures are being considered as part of a package designed to limit the number of people who come from bulgaria and romania when controls are lifted at the end of this year . ` we are looking at a pilot at the end of the year , ' they added . ` if you 're allowed to come to the uk on , say , a family visit visa , you would have to put down a bond to guarantee that you wo n't draw on certain services and to prove that you will leave the country . ` when you leave , as per the terms of your visa , you can have your money back . if you do n't , we will put the money into an enforcement pot . ' ministers are also examining separate proposals to reduce ` pull factors ' for migrants from the european union . a triple squeeze on access to the national health service , taxpayer-subsidised housing and welfare is being considered as part of a package designed to limit the number of people who come from bulgaria and romania when controls are lifted at the end of this year . the latest proposals will cheer the tory benches , following confirmation that mrs may is examining options for reform of human rights law , including withdrawal from the european convention on human rights , to be included in the party 's next manifesto . labour examined the idea of making families pay a # 1,000 deposit for visiting relatives to ensure they left the uk on time , but eventually backed away from the idea . keith vaz , the labour chairman of the commons home affairs committee , has warned that such bonds will ` antagonise settled communities in britain and enrage our allies such as india ' .", "summary": " will pay ` entry fee ' to guarantee that they will not be a burden on taxpayers .   cash would be repaid but only if they have not drawn on services .   those already in uk , would be required to put up a sum into ` thousands ' "}
