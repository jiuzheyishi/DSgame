' ms moody , a mother of four children aged between 15 months and 15 years , was breastfeeding her youngest child when another café customer made a snide remark under his breath . ' i was just breastfeeding in a café and he was a young man who obviously thought i was ruining his day by feeding my child , ' she said . ms moody was inspired to write the song after a young man said something snarky to her when she was breastfeeding in a cafe . ` to be honest i 'm paraphrasing him but it was along the lines that i should have a bit more respect . ' i was quite floored at a time . i 'm not quite sure how respect comes into it . ' rather than respond directly to man , she used sarcasm to write a song and she thinks that 's what helped the video go viral . ' -lsb- the breastfeeding in public debate -rsb- has always been tackled from someone getting criticised and then it comes up in the media but we took the issue on head on , ' she said . ` because we used humour , instead of a responsive reaction , i think it 's been empowering for people and i think that 's why people have got behind it . the folk duo decided to fight the stigma against public breastfeeding with humour rather than outrage . ' i guess what we were trying to do was put the attention on the bystanders rather than the feeders . ' since releasing the song in february the folk duo have performed at the adelaide fringe festival and they are in talks to take their show to the edinburgh fringe festival next year . they 're also currently producing their next film clip which will be released in early july . ms moody says the song is similar to ruin your day and makes light of a social issue . ` it 's something probably a bit more comical but we 're looking at the battle of the sexes , ' she said . ruin your day has since been translated into 10 languages . ` it 's kind of a marriage-related topic which we 're keeping under wraps . ' while the response to ruin your day has been mostly positive , they have received some nasty comments online . ` like anything when things go out on youtube you only have to read the comments to see people 's negative feedback , ' she said . ` but not directly , we have n't had any direct negative comments . ` we 're certainly aware that our view is n't the view of everyone . for us that just shows there 's even more reason to put it out there .
