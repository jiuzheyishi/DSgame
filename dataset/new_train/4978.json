{"text": "so much for being underwhelmed . after apple 's two new iphones -- the 5s and 5c -- disappointed some observers when they were unveiled last week , the first round of reviewers are now rendering their verdicts after spending time with the devices . and in contrast to initial reactions , which included yawns from tech sites and a dip in apple 's stock price , the first wave of reviews are largely singing the praises of the new phones -- particularly the top-of-the-line iphone 5s , which comes packed with an upgraded 64-bit processor , souped up camera and apple 's first-ever touch id fingerprint-scanning system . many noted that , like the iphone 4s before , the 5s is more of an upgrade of the 5 than a radically new device , a fact that probably led to a lot of the mixed initial response . but under the hood , many say the iphone 5s is truly different , and one reviewer is even calling it the best smartphone on the market . here are some of those reviews . unless otherwise noted , the reviewer is referring to the iphone 5s . walt mossberg , all things digital .  the iphone 5s is the first digital device i 've seen with a simple , reliable fingerprint reader -- one you can confidently use , without a thought , to unlock the device instead of typing in a passcode . ... it sounds like a gimmick , but it 's a real advance , the biggest step ever in biometric authentication for everyday devices .   my biggest disappointment is that there have been only minor improvements to the keyboard . unlike in android , apple still bars you from substituting third-party keyboards with better auto-correction ... . overall , however , the new iphone 5s is a delight . its hardware and software make it the best smartphone on the market .  darrell etherington , techcrunch .  apple has worked some behind-the-scenes magic with its latest and greatest , and made some design changes for the better , too , all of which adds up to a new smartphone market king .   at first glance , it 's easy to dismiss the fingerprint sensor as a whiz-bang feature designed to attract eyeballs and do little else . but this is n't that . ... it feels like a mature feature that actually enhances the overall experience of using an iphone in a noticeable way that you encounter very frequently .   the hardware may resemble its predecessor in many key ways , as with the 4-inch retina display , but it improves dramatically in areas like the camera where it makes the most difference to every day users , and in the addition of the fingerprint sensor , which is already a feature i miss when i switch back to older generation devices or the iphone 5c .  anand lal shimpi , anandtech .  like the s-devices that came before it , the iphone 5s is left in the unfortunate position of not being able to significantly differentiate itself visually from its predecessor . ... i think gold is likely the phone i 'd opt for simply because it 'd be very different than everything else i have , but otherwise space grey is probably the best looking of the three devices to me .   it remains to be seen the impact display size has on iphone sales . anecdotally i know a number of die hard iphone users who simply want a larger display and are willing to consider android as a result . i still believe that users do n't really cross shop between android and ios , but if apple does n't offer a larger display option soon then i believe it will lose some users not because of cross shopping , but out of frustration .   at the end of the day , if you prefer ios for your smartphone -- the iphone 5s wo n't disappoint . in many ways it 's an evolutionary improvement over the iphone 5 , but in others it is a significant step forward . what apple 's silicon teams have been doing for these past couple of years has really started to pay off .  david pogue , new york times .  if we 're reaching a point of diminishing returns in hardware breakthroughs , the software breakthroughs are only just getting under way.the new iphones come with ios 7 , a redesigned operating system . ... this software looks nothing like the old ios . it 's all white and clean , almost barren . ... you might love this design , and you might loathe it . you also might get used to it . but in any case , ios 7 is more efficient to navigate , because nothing on the screen is eye candy ; everything is a button , so you spend less time hunting for things .   if you wanted to summarize ... here it is : apple still believes in superb design and tremendous polish . the iphone is no longer the only smartphone that will keep you delighted for the length of your two-year contract -- but it 's still among the few that will .  on the iphone 5c :  it 's essentially identical to last year 's iphone 5 , except that its back and sides are a single piece of plastic instead of metal and glass . it 's a terrific phone . the price is right . it will sell like hot cakes . ... but just sheathing last year 's phone in shiny plastic is n't a stunning advance .  lauren goode , all things digital . on the iphone 5c :  you 've seen this phone before . sure , it has a new name : iphone 5c . and its plastic body comes in different colors . it also has an attractive price when tied to a wireless contract . but the 5c is really a slightly improved iphone 5 , which apple is no longer offering . while the 5c looks and feels very familiar , it 's still a good phone and an improvement over the 5 . but its improvements are evolutionary , not revolutionary .  myriam joire , engadget .  though it 's easy to dismiss this handset as iterative , the 5s is the first smartphone with full 64-bit support and a capacitive fingerprint sensor , and it also ships with a fresh , revamped version of ios . this might not matter to folks who were content with the status quo , but it matters a lot to apple -- and to the company 's future as well -- especially if the company wants to fend off an increasingly fierce pack of competitors .   the 5s is a solid effort from apple , but its true worth is yet to be determined . if developers come up with clever ways to take advantage of the m7 coprocessor and the 64-bit support in ios 7 , the 5s will truly shine . if not , many people might just wait it out another year .
