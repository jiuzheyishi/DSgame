{"text": "there was a rueful look on martin murray 's face as he emerged from the medical examinations which followed his brutally heroic defeat by the heir apparent to floyd mayweather and manny pacquiao as boxing 's pound for pound king . here , in the plush surroundings of monte carlo , stood the second best middleweight on the planet but still with no world championship belt around his waist . lesser men have held one of those titles but for the third time the hard man from st helen 's had come up short . gennady golovkin connects with a brutal right jab as martin murray feels the force of the unbeaten kazakh . murray was sent to the canvas three times by a rampant golovkin but showed guts galore to take the fight into the 11th round . golovkin grins after another victory for the enormously impressive 32-year-old , who successfully defended his middleweight title once more . 1 -rrb- floyd mayweather . 2 -rrb- manny pacquiao . 3 -rrb- wladimir klitschko . 4 -rrb- gennady golovkin . 5 -rrb- roman gonzalez . 6 -rrb- guillermo rigondeaux . 7 -rrb- tim bradley . 8 -rrb- juan manuel marquez . 9 -rrb- carl froch . 10 -rrb- canelo alvarezg . once again there was no shame in losing , on this occasion to the phenomenal gennady golovkin . yet again the demeanour was reminiscent of aussie great ken rosewall whenever he was told that he was the best tennis player never to win wimbledon . that is a back-handed distinction which murray remains determined to purge from his resume . ` golovkin is a terrific boxer , ' he acknowledged . ` but i believe that if i fought like this against any of the other belt-holders i would have won . ` i have to keep going . my day will come . ' there can be a badge of honour in defeat and murray wore his in the livid scars , purple weals and black bruises on his face . he was clutching one small but worthy victory , that of extending golovkin the great as far as the 11th round for the first time in a career littered with the fallen bodies of his opponents . golovkin is embraced in the ring after another dominant display from arguably the best pound-for-pound fighter on the planet . golovkin is hoisted aloft by a member of his team after demonstrating exactly why he is one of the most feared fighters on the planet . prince albert claps as golovkin clutches his middleweight belts after a convincing display to stop murray in the 11th . unlike many of his predecessors , murray kept getting up after being floored by the most destructive pound-for-pound puncher in the prize-ring . he had never been knocked down before but he dealt with the shock with typical courage . when he did so for the fourth time , after the most devastating blow of all , referee luis pabon wisely decreed that he need take no further punishment . that intervention may well have saved murray to fight another day . golovkin has ended the careers of several of his challengers and any more of those thunderous punches might have done the same to murray . much as would have objected , his corner should have pulled out a little earlier . the problem for murray is that the strength , determination and no little skill which he brought to this challenge may make it as difficult for him to find opponents as it is for golovkin . the kazakh whose 29th victory inside the distance in 32 fights now gives him the highest knock-out ratio in middleweight history is finding unification fights against alternative belt wearers hard to come nor is he showing much enthusiasm for giving murray his fourth title shot . the monte carlo crowd were treated to a fight of blood and guts from murray and unstoppable power and precision from golovkin . it may be that the man from st helen 's , who is big for a middleweight , should move up to the super-middle division in which there are more big-money matches to be made . for the time being he will probably focus on pursuing whoever emerges from the winner of peter quillin and andy lee versus billy joe saunders . ` i 've always wanted to clean up against the other domestic fighters , ' he says , ` but at this stage whoever i can get i need it to be in big fights . ' they wo n't come any bigger than golovkin . murray has protested about the draw which robbed him in his first title shot against felix sturm . he believes he would have been given the decision against sergio martinez had the fight not take place in argentina . but there were no complaints this time . murray showed the matured and reformed aspect of his nature when he said : ` it was an honour to be in the ring with someone as good as golovokin . not only did i feel his power but he kept coming so hard and fast that it was impossible to keep him off me . ' the maestro returned the compliment : ` it was not a surprise that he lasted to the 11th round . murray is a good boxer , one of my toughest opponents and a very brave man .
