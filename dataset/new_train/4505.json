{"text": "dna tests have confirmed that human remains found buried beneath an english car park are those of the country 's king richard iii . british scientists announced monday they are convinced  beyond reasonable doubt  that a skeleton found during an archaeological dig in leicester , central england , last august is that of the former king , who was killed at the battle of bosworth field in 1485 . mitochondrial dna extracted from the bones was matched to michael ibsen , a canadian cabinetmaker and direct descendant of richard iii 's sister , anne of york , and a second distant relative , who wishes to remain anonymous . experts say other evidence -- including battle wounds and signs of scoliosis , or curvature of the spine -- found during the search and the more than four months of tests since strongly support the dna findings -- and suggest that history 's view of the king as a hunchbacked villain may have to be rewritten . ibsen said he reacted with  stunned silence  when told the closely-guarded results .  i never thought i 'd be a match , and certainly not that it would be so close , but the results look like a carbon copy ,  he told reporters . the skeleton was discovered buried among the remains of what was once the city 's greyfriars friary . after centuries of demolition and rebuilding work , the grave 's exact location had been lost to history , and there were even reports that the defeated monarch 's body had been dug up and thrown into a nearby river . read more : richard iii : the king and the car park ? the remains will be reburied in leicester cathedral , close to the site of his original grave , once the full analysis of the bones is completed . richard iii 's body was found in a roughly-hewn grave , which experts say was too small for the body , forcing it to be squeezed in to an unusual position . its feet had been lost at some point in the intervening five centuries , but the rest of the bones were in good condition , which archaeologists and historians say was incredibly lucky , given how close later building work came to them -- brick foundations ran alongside part of the trench , within inches of the body . what was initially thought to be a barbed arrowhead found among the dead king 's vertebrae turned out instead to be a roman nail , disturbed from an earlier level of excavation . archaeologists say their examination of the skeleton shows richard met a violent death : they found evidence of 10 wounds -- eight to the head and two to the body -- which they believe were inflicted at or around the time of death . read more : back from the grave , king richard iii gets rehab .  the skull was in good condition , although fragile , and was able to give us detailed information ,  said bioarchaeologist jo appleby , who led the exhumation of the remains last year . the king had suffered two severe blows to the head , either of which would have been fatal , according to appleappleby said there were also signs that richard 's corpse was mistreated after his death , with evidence of several  humiliation injuries ,  which fitted in with historical records of the body being displayed , naked , in leicester before being laid to rest . richard buckley , the lead archaeologist on the project said the unusual position of the skeleton 's arms and hands suggested he may have been buried with his hands tied . investigators from the university of leicester had been examining the remains for months . others got their first glimpse of the battle-scarred skull that may have once worn the english crown early monday when the university released a photograph ahead of its announcement . read more : will richard iii discovery rewrite history ? turi king , who carried out the dna analysis , said it was a  real relief  when the results came through .  i went really quiet . i was seeing all these matches coming back , thinking , ` that 's a match , and that 's a match , and that 's a match . ' at that point i did a little dance around the lab .  king pointed out that  in a generation 's time , the dna match would not have been possible , since both individuals used in the tests are the last of their line ,  a fact echoed by ibsen , who told cnn before the results came through that  they caught us just in time .  the initial discovery of the remains provoked much debate in britain as to what would happen with the body , if it were proven to be that of richard iii , with many calling for a state funeral at westminster abbey , and others backing a burial in york minster , in keeping with the king 's heritage as a member of the house of york . opinion : richard still the criminal king . but on monday those involved in the search said he would be reinterred in leicester cathedral , the closest church to the original grave site in a memorial service expected to be held early next year . canon chancellor david monteith said it was important to remember that as well as being the subject of important historical and scientific research , the skeleton also represented  the mortal remains of a person , an annointed christian king ,  and as such should be treated with dignity . supporters of the infamous king , including members of the richard iii society , hope the discovery will now force academics to re-examine history , which they say has been tainted by exaggerations and false claims about richard iii since the tudor era . screenwriter philippa langley , who championed the search for several years , told cnn she wanted  the establishment to look again at his story ,  saying she wanted to uncover the truth about  the real richard , before the tudor writers got to him .   this has been an extraordinary journey of discovery ,  langley said .  we came with a dream and today that dream has been realized . this is an historic moment that will rewrite the history books .
