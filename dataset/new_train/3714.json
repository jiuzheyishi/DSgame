{"text": "the united states tortured al-qaeda detainees captured after the 9/11 attacks , president obama said friday , in some of his most expansive comments to date about a controversial set of cia practices that he banned after taking office . ` we tortured some folks , ' obama said at a televised news conference at the white house . ` we did some things that were contrary to our values . ' addressing the impending release of a senate report that criticizes cia treatment of detainees , obama said he believed the mistreatment stemmed from the pressure national security officials felt to forestall another attack . he said americans should not be quick to pass judgment through the lens of a seemingly safer present day .  it 's important not for us not to feel too sanctimonious in retrospect , ' he said . obama said friday that a forthcoming senate report will confirm that the u.s. tortured al-qaeda detainees after 9/11 . in a picture that became emblematic of u.s. torture , an unidentified detainee was forced to stand on a box with a bag on his head and wires attatched to him in late 2003 . hooded protesters were common sights in front of the white house in 2005 during the george w. bush administration , after methods of torture practiced against al-qaeada detainees were first aired publicly and then-vice president dick cheney worked to exempt the cia from a ban on ` enhanced interrogation ' techniques . ' i understand why it happened . i think it 's important to recall ... how afraid people were ' after the 9/11 attacks , obama added . ` people did not know if more attacks were imminent . ' that view , which he expressed as a candidate for national office in 2008 and early in his presidency , explains why obama did not push to pursue criminal charges against the bush era officials who carried out the cia program . to this day , many of those officials insist that what they did was not torture , which is a felony under u.s. law . the president 's comments are a blow to those former officials , as well as an estimated 200 people currently working at the cia who played some role in the interrogation program . in 2009 , obama said he preferred to ` look forward , not backwards , ' on the issue , and he decided that no cia officer who was following legal guidance_however flawed that guidance turned out to be -- should be prosecuted . a long-running criminal investigation into whether the cia exceeded the guidance -- which is an allegation of the senate report -- was closed in 2012 without charges . still , obama 's remarks on friday were more emphatic than his previous comments on the subject , including a may 2009 speech in which he trumpeted his ban of ` so-called enhanced interrogation techniques , ' and ` brutal methods , ' but did not flatly say the u.s. had engaged in torture . at an april 2009 new conference , he said , ' i believe that waterboarding was torture and , whatever legal rationales were used , it was a mistake . ' in addition to water boarding , the cia used stress positions , sleep deprivation , nudity , humiliation , cold and other tactics that , taken together , were extremely brutal , the senate report is expected to say . obama on friday did not mention a specific method , but he said the cia used techniques that ` any fair minded person would believe were torture . ' obama banned torture techniques after he took office in 2009 , but acknowledged the nature of the interrogation methods on friday , saying americans should n't be ` sanctimonious ' about them in retrospect . ` against our values ' and not just by the cia : american soldiers were filmed posing with nude , hooded iraqi prisoners at the infamous abu ghraib prison . ` we crossed a line , ' he said . ` that needs to be understood and accepted ... we did some things that were wrong , and thats what that report reflects . ' obama on friday did not address two other central arguments of the soon-to-be-released senate report -- that the brutal interrogations did n't produce life-saving intelligence , and that the cia lied to other elements of the u.s. government about exactly what it was doing . the president also expressed confidence in his cia director , john brennan , in the wake of an internal cia report documenting that the spy agency improperly accessed senate computers . there have been calls for his resignation on capitol hill . obama said the internal report made clear that  some very poor judgment was shown ,  but he seemed to say it was n't brennan 's fault , and he praised his director for ordering the inquiry in the first place .", "summary": " cia used water boarding , stress positions , sleep deprivation , nudity , humiliation , cold and other tactics against al-qaeda detainees .   a senate report is expected to be made public in the coming days outlining the details .   obama said americans should not ` feel too sanctimonious in retrospect '   ' i understand why it happened , ' he said ; ` people did not know if more attacks were imminent ' "}
