{"text": "controversial : francesca minerva says doctors should have the right to kill newborn babies because they are disabled , too expensive or simply unwanted by their mothers . doctors should have the right to kill newborn babies because they are disabled , too expensive or simply unwanted by their mothers , an academic with links to oxford university has claimed . francesca minerva , a philosopher and medical ethicist , argues a young baby is not a real person and so killing it in the first days after birth is little different to aborting it in the womb . even a healthy baby could have its life snuffed out if the mother decides she ca n't afford to look after it , the article published by the british medical journal group states . the journal 's editor has defended . the piece , saying the publication 's role is to present well-reasoned . arguments , rather than promote one particular moral view . but . the article has angered other ethicists , peers and campaigners . they . have described the call for legalised infanticide as chilling and an . ` inhumane defence of child destruction ' . the doctor , a research associate at . oxford , has received death threats and hate calls telling her that she will ` burn in hell ' , and she said the last few days since publication have been ` the worst of my life ' . writing . in the journal of medical ethics , dr minerva and co-author alberto giubilini , a university of milan . bioethicist , argue that ` after-birth abortion ' should be permissible in . all cases in which abortion is . they . state that like an unborn child , a newborn has yet to develop hopes , . goals and dreams and so , while clearly human , is not a person -- someone . with a moral right to life . in contrast , parents , siblings and society have aims and plans that could be affected by the arrival of the child and their interests should come first . the article , after-birth abortion : why should the baby live ? first addresses scenarios in which parents are unaware their child is disabled until after it is born . the piece argues that , though the child may be happy , it will not reach the potential of a normal child . ` to bring up such children might be an unbearable burden on the family and on society as a whole ... on these grounds , the fact that a foetus has the potential to become a person who will have an -lrb- at least -rrb- acceptable life is no reason for prohibiting abortion . ' right to decide : dr minerva argues a young baby is not a real person and so killing it in the first days after birth is little different to aborting it in the womb . the ethicists are also in favour of . the infanticide of a healthy baby when the woman 's circumstances have . changed and she no longer has the time , money or energy to care for it . they argue that while adoption might be an option , it could cause undue psychological distress to the mother . as the hate calls came in , dr minerva she had not . been expecting the overwhelmingly negative reaction . joanna jepson : ' a compelling reason to stop late-term abortions ' she . said she . believes her argument was taken out of its academic and theoretical . context , and that ' i wish i could explain to people it is not a policy - . and i 'm not suggesting that and i 'm not encouraging that ' . she believes the majority of threats have come from religious or pro-life groups . some of the hate messages told her that she would be punished by god , while others suggested she should ` burn in hell ' . the article also provoked responses from religious and pro-life groups . rev joanna jepson , came to public attention when she spoke out against a late abortion that had been carried out in 2001 . doctors are permitted to carry out abortions beyond the 24-week legal limit if they believe a baby 's disability is serious enough , but joanna argued that a cleft palate was a minor physical flaw , not a severe abnormality . she revealed that , until surgery at the age of 19 , her own face was disfigured by a congenital defect . her upper jaw overhung her lower jaw , which receded into her neck , and posed the question : ` would it have been right to abort me ? ' she said : ` it 's misleading to call this ` after birth abortion ' . the pregnancy is already over , there is nothing to abort . what is being discussed is infanticide . ` there is a logic to their point - if we consider it acceptable to abort a baby up until birth then why not allow it to die afterwards ? it is just a difference in geography - within or outside the mother 's body . ` of course , i would see this a compelling reason to abolish late-term abortion , if infanticide is morally repulsive then abortion is too . ` if a baby , because of it 's physical disabilities , is seen as being  incompatible with life  then we need to let life and death take its course . becoming agents of death fundamentally changes doctor 's role as healer and physician , and it also has massive repercussions on society 's conscience shifting what is understood to be morally and socially unacceptable to become acceptable . of course motherhood is inconvenient , physically , emotionally , psychologically , financially - but this inconvenience is not allowed to become acceptable grounds for abandoning one 's child . ` if a child or an adult has a life-changing accident or illness , do we suggest we 'll put them down because their goals and dreams now have to change ? ` my brother , alastair , has great and huge goals and he goes after them with great courage . his downs syndrome does not stand in the way . ` they are very different dreams and goals to my own but no less valuable or of contribution to society . at what level would dr minerva assign somebody 's meaning and value to be worth a life ? mass grave : yewden villa in buckinghamshire . while infanticide may seem an inhumane concept for many people , there have been periods in history where it has been accepted behaviour - and even a legal obligation . in roman culture , disabled infants were often abandoned after birth by parents who did not want or could not afford the financial burden . the child would simply be left outside to die from starvation and the elements in a practice known as ` exposure ' . it was an established and acceptable procedure . in 1912 , yewsden villa -lrb- right -rrb- was excavated in hambleden in buckinghamshire , and researchers were shocked to find the bodies of 97 babies in a mass-grave . the babies had apparently all been killed shortly after birth , and the prevailing theory is that the site was near a brothel . with a lack of contraception in roman times , unwanted pregnancies would likely have been much more common , and the mass grave is another example that infanticide did not pose such an ethical dilemma in that era . archaeologists believe romans did not consider infants to be ` full ' human beings until about the age of two , and babies who died before that age were not buried in cemeteries , but instead in public or domestic areas . however a roman couple were entitled to raise a disabled child . in sparta , there was little choice in the matter . newborns were seen as the property of the state and all babies were inspected by a community leader . if the child showed signs of deformity or ill-health , the parents were ordered to expose it . many parents in ancient greeks would also expose their newborns because of sickness , financial pressure , or simply for being the ` wrong ' sex in the male-dominated society . many religions had did not raise moral objects to infanticide , although christianity and islam notably rejected it . leaving the child to the elements was the preferred method to ` dispose ' of the child , because it meant the child died of natural causes , which was a more ` moral ' death than directly killing the child . the practice generally died out , and was outlawed in the last years of the roman empire . however there are references to infanticide in many cultures in every historical era , and is believed to still take place in certain parts of india , africa , and china . china 's controversial ` one-child ' policy leads to many children being abandoned after birth . trevor . stammers , a lecturer in medical ethics and former chairman of the . christian medical fellowship , described the viewpoint as ` chilling ' . gill . duval , of the prolife alliance , said every life is precious and added : . ` everybody talks about what women want but women would n't want this . ' lord alton , chairman of the all party . parliamentary group on pro-life , told the catholic herald : ` it is . profoundly disturbing , indeed shocking , to see the way in which . opinion-formers within the medical profession have ditched the . professional belief of the healer to uphold the sanctity of human life . for this impoverished and inhumane defence of child destruction . ' julian savulescu , the journal 's editor , said that the article 's argument has been made before by eminent figures . he added : ` i 'm not defending practising infanticide . i 'm defending academic and intellectual freedom . ' he said that dr minerva has a ` loose relationship ' with oxford and her main position is at the university of melbourne . struggling mother : the ethicists are also in favour of the infanticide of a healthy baby when the woman 's circumstances have changed and she no longer has the time , money or energy to care for it .", "summary": " philosopher and medical ethicist francesca minerva argues that .   killing a newborn is little different to aborting .   it in the womb .   even a healthy baby could have its life snuffed out if the mother decides she ca n't afford to look after it , dr minerva suggested .   doctor receives death threats and hate calls telling her to ` burn in hell '   anti-abortion vicar : ` if infanticide is morally repulsive , then abortion is too ' "}
