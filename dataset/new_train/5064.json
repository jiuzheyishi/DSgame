{"text": "few gifts could be more precious than the one david whaymand gave to his wife carolyn this christmas . when cystic fibrosis sufferer carolyn was told her kidneys were failing and that her only chance of survival was a transplant , her devoted husband stepped in without hesitation to offer one of his own organs . it was a touching gesture of love and one david was happy to make after 15 years of marriage to his childhood sweetheart . gift of life : husband david whayland was a donor for his wife carolyn 's kidney transplant just before christmas . but what makes his sacrifice all the more remarkable is that , in similarly desperate circumstances 13 years ago , david also gave carolyn a portion of one of his lungs . these two inspiring deeds are now thought to represent a world first . doctors and transplant experts say there are no known cases in which a living donor has given up two organs . this is due to the serious risks of such surgery . the fact that the recipient in both case was david 's own wife makes the story even more extraordinary -- especially considering that it is highly unusual for a husband to be able to donate to his spouse , as finding a suitable match for a transplant is notoriously difficult . world class treatment : carolyn received her transplant at hammersmith hospital in west london . the latest successful operation took place at hammersmith hospital in west london on december 12 and the couple were back at their # 500,000 home in ingatestone , essex , in time for christmas . david , 39 , an accountant for bank j.p. morgan , told the mail on sunday : ` they say marriage is in sickness and in health . when i married carolyn i knew it would n't be easy and that she might die without a transplant . when it came to me being a live donor , i did n't hesitate for a second . ' i was prepared to make the sacrifice that could have seen us both lose our lives . i could n't stand by and watch carolyn die for want of a lung donor . ` and when it turned out she needed a kidney , of course i was ready to make the sacrifice again . ` it was child 's play compared with the first operation , which was definitely more risky . ' for solicitor carolyn , 42 , it is difficult to explain just how much david 's sacrifices have meant to her . ` he 's more worried about my suffering than his own , ' she says . about 1,000 people in the uk give up a kidney for a friend or loved one every year . the human tissue authority , which regulates all donations by living people , must decide who is suitable . volunteers must prove they are in robust health and understand what the lengthy , physically arduous process will involve . there can be a 12-week recovery period , and a one-in-3 ,000 risk of dying while having a kidney removed . carolyn , who was diagnosed with the genetic condition cystic fibrosis aged two , was already on the transplant list when david proposed in 1996 . the couple , who met when they were teenagers , were married the following year . cystic fibrosis affects the internal organs , especially the lungs and digestive system , by clogging them with sticky mucus , making it hard to breathe and digest food . in sickness and in health : david and carolyn were childhood sweethearts before marrying in 1997 . only half of sufferers live past the age of 40 . within a year of their marriage , carolyn 's situation became more desperate . ' i was on oxygen a lot of the time and towards the end i was on it all of the time , ' she says . ` but neither of us had ever considered that david could donate part of his lung . ' carolyn was receiving her treatment at the specialist lung unit at harefield hospital in uxbridge , west london , when a friend saw a magazine article on lung donation . ` the doctors were very cautious and said they had done some live lung transplants at harefield . but the operations were risky for both the donor and the recipient , ' she says . ` they explained the survival rate was n't very high and there was a strong risk that i might not pull through afterwards . ' at first the couple rejected the idea but as carolyn became increasingly ill , it suddenly became their only option . david , along with four members of carolyn 's family , including her father and brother , volunteered to be tested to see if they could donate . unusually , david turned out to be a good match and carolyn 's cousin also offered a section of his lung . ` we had to take a gamble on live donation because i might have got to the stage where i was too sick to have a transplant from a donor -- live or dead , ' says carolyn . ` both david and my cousin agreed -- after counselling -- that they were prepared to risk their lives to save mine . both were desperate to see me living a normal life . ' pioneer : sir magdi yacoub , carolyn 's surgeon during her lung surgery , is one of britain 's experts on organ transplants . david adds : ' i had watched her deteriorate and it was enough for me to do something about it . the risks were there , but there was no question i would donate . ' the pioneering surgery , carried out by professor sir magdi yacoub , one of the world 's leading transplant surgeons , was hugely controversial because so many patients had died during previous procedures . in fact the operation has subsequently been suspended in britain because of the risks . today , carolyn is regarded as something of a medical miracle because she is one of only four patients who underwent the procedure in the uk and survived . only about 50 per cent of any lung transplant patients are still alive after ten years , so the fact she has survived 13 years with very limited problems makes her tale all the more remarkable . carolyn 's lungs function perfectly and she has near-normal breathing . however , she has needed to take powerful drugs to suppress her immune system and prevent her body from rejecting the new organ . she still also has the digestive problems associated with cystic fibrosis and must take daily enzymes and immuno-suppressive drugs that have had an effect on other organs . about five per cent of those who have lung transplants go on to suffer kidney damage because of these drugs . unfortunately , carolyn is one of those affected , and during the past 12 months doctors informed her that tests showed she would soon need dialysis or a kidney transplant . she says : ` ordinarily , going on to dialysis would n't have been a problem , but i was at added risk by being someone who had already had a transplant . ` there was an increased risk of picking up an infection and the effect of the dialysis on my anti-rejection medication . the doctors were worried it would put me at risk . ' for david , who was left with a scar on his back after donating part of his lung , the answer was simple . he says : ' i had invested part of my lung all those years ago and it was ironic that the drugs used to keep carolyn 's lung healthy had damaged her kidneys and i was called upon again . ' i love her , and i was n't prepared to see what i gave to her all that time ago put at risk . ' the latest operation was carried out by professor nadey hakim of imperial healthcare nhs trust . david was discharged on december 17 , and carolyn was allowed home four days later . david expects to be well enough to return to work in the middle of january , while carolyn will be recovering for several months . a spokesman for the human tissue authority said : ` this would appear to be a first . live donors are a very important part of the transplant programme . ` mr whaymand should be congratulated on giving twice . ' prof hakim added : ` it is amazing for someone to give an organ twice . in all my years in transplant surgery i have not heard of an example . ' carolyn 's lung physician , dr martin carby , said : ` i 'm not aware of any other individual donating tissue twice to a spouse or any other -- it is an extraordinary case . the lung donation would have been the more risky of the two transplants . but i admire anyone who gives an organ twice . ' david is prepared to donate again should carolyn need his help a third time -- although his options are understandably limited . he says : ' i would n't think twice about doing it again if i had to , although all i have left to give is my liver -lsb- the only remaining organ he , as a living donor , could donate part of -rsb- . ` ironically , doing this for carolyn has actually improved my life expectancy because i 'm having such regular check-ups . ` both times , the medical teams have been just fantastic . if our story can encourage other people to become living donors , that would be wonderful .
