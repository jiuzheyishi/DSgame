{"text": "beijing one year in the job as the chinese communist party supremo , xi jinping so far has presided over a relatively smooth transition of leadership . but what is his vision for the next 10 years , when he is expected to serve as paramount leader ? no one has a crystal ball that gives definitive clues . in the first few months since he took power , xi has pushed a popular and arguably progressive agenda : attacking corruption , not just flies -lrb- junior officials -rrb- but a few tigers -lrb- senior officials -rrb- too ; curbing official extravagance , like senseless banqueting , and , one of my favorites , banning  empty speeches .  but in recent weeks , xi has turned  left  . he allowed tighter control over the traditional and social media , silenced dissenting voices among academics and scholars , and cracked down on liberal activists , petitioners and protesters . at the same time , xi has paid homage to chairman mao zedong and some of his preaching . he visited a few revolutionary shrines , endorsed the maoist practices of  criticism and self-criticism  -- ostensibly to purify the party ranks -- and advocated  mass line  campaigns to improve the party 's popularity among the people . analysts wonder : is xi a maoist or a dengist ? is he a conservative or a reformist ? clearly , xi is not a chairman mao nor a deng xiaoping . like his two predecessors -- jiang zemin and hu jintao -- xi is not a legendary revolutionary figure who can command absolute loyalty . in the current political system , he is merely a primus inter pares -- first among equals , who leads by consensus . left or right ? like deng , xi may not have to seek absolute dominance , a la mao , to be an effective leader . instead , he may just seek to find the center of the debate . still , unless and until there is fundamental political reform , china will remain a nation more dependent on the power of a single leader , a charismatic strongman , than on institutions . friends in china asked me these same questions , and my honest answer is : no one knows for sure , but i think xi is signaling  left  so he can turn  right  . expectations of xi were high on the eve of the third plenum of the communist party 's central committee , china 's 300-plus political elite , who last week met behind closed doors in beijing . sinologists had drawn parallels to the third plenum in 1978 , a landmark meeting that launched deng xiaoping 's reform and open-door program . chinese media accounts on documents approved during the plenum signal significant changes : . prickly issues . china 's top leaders have been deliberating these prickly issues for years , but decisions have been put off for lack of consensus or political will . that xi was able to push these through this time , analysts say , indicates xi 's growing influence . the plenum has also agreed to set up two new institutions : the leading group on comprehensive deepening of economic reform and the national security commission . the security commission will be a supra-ministerial body that will take charge of over-arching security issues , including military and police matters , territorial disputes , cyber-attacks and ethnic unrest . xi is expected to play a leading role in the two groups , even though premier li keqiang may head the economic reform commission . these institutions , analysts say , will allow xi and his team to supervise the complex and often conflicting bureaucracies -- the communist party , the government , the military and police in a top-down authoritarian way . proponents of reform sound optimistic . endorsements . the plenum gives market forces a  decisive role  that will allow enterprises and individuals to invest more overseas , economist wang zhile , an expert on international business and trade told me . the most significant endorsement came from wu jinglian , the octogenarian guru of the deng 's reform program who also served as doctoral degree adviser of premier li keqiang at peking university . speaking in beijing this week , wu said the system set up by china in 1978 when china embarked on reform and opening was  the initial primary-stage version of market economy for the late 21st century , which still took on many vestiges of the old system .  the one put forth by xi , he said , is  an upgraded version for a more mature market economy system that suits the current demands .  but analysts also caution against excessive optimism . it will take longer than expected to make these reforms work , says economist cheng siwei , using the chinese maxim  bu pa man , zhi pa zhan  -- slowing down is not worrisome ; a standstill is . three decades ago , the late communist leader chen yun , a contemporary of deng xiaoping , likened the chinese economy to a bird and the chinese political system to a bird cage . while the cage may be enlarged to let the bird fly more freely , chen argued , it must never be discarded . xi and his cohorts seem to agree on that .", "summary": " far-reaching reform package indicates xi jinping 's growing influence .   but reforms come as xi tightens media controls and pays homage to mao zedong .   rhetoric suggests xi is signaling  left  so he can turn  right    chinese political system likened to a bird cage : cage can be enlarged but not discarded .
