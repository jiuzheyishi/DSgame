{"text": "recovered : debra gotch was delighted to find out her brain tumour had finally gone six years after she was diagnosed . a mother owes her life to her daughter - after her pregnancy led doctors to discover a huge brain tumour that had been hidden in her skull for years . just hours after debra gotch gave birth to daughter sophie doctors found a tumour the size of a satsuma growing deep within her brain . they carried out emergency surgery in a bid to save her life and feared she might not make a full recovery . however , debra , from hull , fought back saying she was determined to watch her daughter grow up . now six years after her initial diagnosis , doctors have finally told the mother-of-one , 44 , that the tumour has gone - and will probably never return . debra is now lobbying the government for more training to be given to medics to help them diagnose brain tumours earlier . debra said : ` i 'd been suffering really severe sickness and blinding headaches all the way through my pregnancy - but i just assumed i was one of the unlucky people who had to put up with morning sickness for nine months solid . ` i 'd had bad headaches for about three years before i got pregnant - but i put it down to stress . ' i would wake up feeling like there was an axe buried in my head . but after sophie arrived , i felt like my brain was shutting down , and i suffered a huge fit . ' i was stunned when doctors told me i had a tumour in my brain the size of a satsuma , which they thought had been growing for at least two years . ` if i had n't had sophie , it might have been too late by the time i was eventually diagnosed - she probably saved my life . ' debra in hospital following brain surgery . she lost her sense of smell during the operation . debra first started suffering from headaches in the year before she fell pregnant - but put the symptoms down to stress . she was running a health and beauty sales business at the time - working long hours and travelling around the country , and was convinced that the stress of her job , and pressure of keeping the business afloat , was affecting her health . but when she fell pregnant , the symptoms grew more severe - and she started to suffer from terrible nausea - which she believed was as a result of her pregnancy . debra said : ' i was being horrendously sick all hours of the day , but i just thought i was unlucky with my pregnancy . ` it got so bad that one day , when i was driving to a business meeting across a bridge over a river , i ended up being sick all over myself , as i could n't pull over - it was awful . ` the headaches i was suffering were changing too , they were really debilitating , but as a first-time mum , i did n't know any different . ` my sense of smell went wild - everything smelt to strongly , and made me feel ill . ' i even started to experience hand tremors , but after visiting the doctor , he put my symptoms down to stress during pregnancy , and sent me away . ` when sophie did finally come along , i had a horrendous labour , which lasted for two and a half days , and after two episodes of shaking uncontrollably , i had an emergency c-section . ` but immediately after the birth , i felt like i was closing down - i was exhausted , and could n't enjoy sophie properly . ' the tumour had been growing for around two years before it was discovered . debra said she felt like she was ` closing down ' after her daughter sophie was born . the next day she suffered a convulsion and was rushed to hospital . although debra was allowed home from hospital within hours , the next day , she suffered a convulsion while nursing sophie - and doctors realised something was seriously wrong . she said : ` mike had left me nursing sophie with her lying on my chest - but when he came back into the room , i was convulsing and unconscious . ` he quickly grabbed our baby and called an ambulance - and within hours , they had found out what was causing my symptoms . ` the doctors said my tumour was big , and wrapped right around a cord in the middle of my brain . i was shocked , but i did n't have time to be frightened for myself - i just knew i had to fight this for the sake of my ba' debra had risky surgery at the hull royal infirmary to remove the tumour . the operation was a success - but surgeons were forced to damage the part of the brain which detects smell . although debra made a steady recovery , doctors have kept a close eye on her , fearing the tumour would return , having regular scans . but now , medics have confirmed the tumour is unlikely to return - and have told her she no longer has to be monitored every few months . debra two weeks after surgery to remove her brain tumour -lrb- left -rrb- . right her inspiration - daughter sophie . debra , who is now writing a book about her recovery , said : ` it 's such a relief to finally be told i can get on with the rest of my life - but i am starting to focus on campaigning for more funding and research into brain tumours . ' carol robertson , charity development manager for brain tumour research and support across yorkshire , said : ` research into brain cancers amounted to less than one per cent of the funds allocated for cancer research , and as was the case with debra , diagnosis of brain tumours is often delayed . ` symptoms can often be mistaken for side effects of other conditions , as debra 's were , and by the time one doctor has a eureka moment , diagnosis has often been delayed by several weeks . ` we 're lobbying the government to change that and provide better training for gps in spotting tumours .
