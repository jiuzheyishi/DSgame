' gerard hastings , social marketing professor at the university of stirling , added : ` this is about subterfuge to get into the kids ' lives to get into the family life and thereby access to the parent 's pockets . ` you 've got a product that might sell , all they 're concerned with is selling it . ' promotion : the game features a mcdonald 's restaurant despite the ban on advertising junk food to children . advertising unhealthy food during children 's television programmes was banned by ofcom in 2007 in a bid to curb childhood obesity . the measure followed food standards agency research which found a direct link between overweight children and the impact of tv advertising . however , the ban does not cover the internet , meaning many brands have simply switched to targeting youngsters while they play on their computer , tablet or smartphone . facebook rules stipulate that you must be at least 13 years old to have a profile , but many children lie about their age . the dispatches undercover team created a profile using the birthday of a 16 year-old , but posted messages online saying they were 11 years old . they identified six brands which they found to be interacting with children on facebook , and posted messages on their walls about an up-coming 11th birthday . some of the brands responded by commenting on the post . chewits wrote back : ` happy birthday for saturday ! well , we now have chewmix bags which have a random mix of core and xtreme flavours in them and later this month we will be announcing a very exciting new product so keep your eyes peeled . keep chewing !

' brands including chewits wished children ` happy birthday ' on social . media sites , before pushing their products . kellogg 's krave , a sugary cereal laced . with chocolate , also indicated that they ` liked ' one of the child 's . messages posted on facebook . many . brands are now also producing ` advergames ' for children which they can . download onto their computer or smartphone from an online app store . programme . researchers found games by coca cola , oreo and cadbury 's that were made . available with a 4 + age on the parental control rating . all three of these brands have previously pledged not to advertise sugary and fattening products to anyone under the age of 12 . in . one example highlighted by the programme , coca-cola has produced a game . in collaboration with mcdonald 's called crabs and penguins . it features a mcdonald 's restaurant as part of the scenery , and the game involves getting a crab to collect cola bottle tops . chewits also has a game featuring a chewitsaurus , while swizzles matlow also have one themed around their sweets , squashies . dr . jennifer harris , marketing expert at yale university , told the . programme : ` the way that companies market to children online is really . very sneaky . advertising really is most effective when people do n't . think of it as advertising , when they 're thinking of the game they 're . playing . ' ian barber of . the advertising association added : ` it 's absolutely the case that . advergames are less easily identifiable as an advert than something that . interrupts the programme you 've just been watching for the last half an . hour . the fundamental point is , is it appropriate ? ' when approached for comment , all the companies mentioned said they do not target children with advertising . a . kellogg 's spokesman said : ` as soon as we noticed the age we unliked it , . reported the post to facebook , and sent a note to the girl and her . parents . ` the post . mentions that it was her eleventh birthday and we accept that this is . something that should have been identified earlier .
