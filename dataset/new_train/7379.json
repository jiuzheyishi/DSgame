{"text": "before man became brave enough to conquer space himself , canine cosmonauts were sent in our place . it was a perilous job , with almost half of all dogs destined not to come home . but two female strays employed in the soviet space programme , comet and shutka , proved to be remarkable survivors . canine cosmonauts : females comet , left , and shutka , right , survived a failed rocket launch in december , 1960 . during a mission , the pair plummeted 125 miles to earth after their rocket malfunctioned and remained trapped inside for four days in the siberian wilderness . to the astonishment of the soviet authorities , they were found alive . their incredible story , as reported by the siberian times , has only just emerged after being kept secret for more than 50 years . on december 22 , 1960 , the space dogs - who had been picked after surviving a rough life on the streets - were launched from baikonur cosmodrome on board a vostok 1k spacecraft . it was comet 's third space flight , having twice been sent into orbit the previous year . but this launch would prove to be disastrous . the rocket failed to reach orbit after suffering a malfunction in the third stage of the rocket . armen gyurdzhian , who was in charge of training the soviet space dogs , found comet and shutka still alive inside the failed rocket capsule . the emergency systems sprung into action and the rocket plunged back to earth , crashing some 2,200 miles from the launch site . ` at the beginning of the third stage the engine failed , ' said arvid pallo , a close colleague of sergei korolev , the lead soviet rocket engineer and spacecraft designer . ` the control system gave the order to separate the ship , and according to the calculations it was to be found in yakutia . ` was the ship damaged ? how did it land after the accident ? ` what happened to the dogs that were to be catapulted in their container on yakutian frost ? these were the questions we had no answers for . ' in temperatures of minus 40c , a search group from the state commission was sent to try to find the wreckage . four days later the remains of the rocket were found near the village of tura , between the rivers ognekte and yukteken . crucially , the two female dogs remained inside the insulated module due to failure of the ejection system , a fact which saved their lives in the perishing conditions . on christmas morning , rescuer armen gyurdzhian began to open the capsule and could hear quiet barking . ` they were alive despite the most pessimistic forecasts , ' he said . gyurdzhian wrapped the frozen and exhausted animals in his coat and went back to tura by helicopter . he . described them as being ` in a state half death because of the shock . after crashing down and ... . the cold in which they had to spend time . till they were found ' . the rocket 's ejection system failed , keeping the dogs trapped inside and protecting them from the perishing conditions of the siberian wilderness . the rocket crashed some 2,200 miles from the launch site where temperatures were minus 40c . records show gyurdzhian took them back to moscow where they were said to be ` feeling good ' the next day . the fate of shutka after returning to moscow is not known . but comet was adopted by academic oleg gazenko , a specialist in aviation medicine , with whom she lived for 14 years . after her siberian adventure , she went on to have puppies . ` she was such a cute , fluffy , fair-haired dog with a sharp nose , ' he said . ` she was a hero , flying as many as three times - twice in rockets , and a third on board the satellite , the forerunner of the ship which was used for yuri gagarin 's flight ' . the spacecraft 's designer korolev wanted to make the news of comet and shutka 's faile flight public but was banned from doing so by soviet officialdom . as a result , their heroic adventure has not been properly recorded in many histories of space animals - until now . comet was adopted by academic oleg gazenko following her adventures and went on to have puppies .", "summary": " strays comet and shutka were launched into space in december 1960 .   soviet rocket failed and crashed back to earth 2,200 miles from launch site .   dogs were found still in space capsule after ejection system also failed .   despite four days in siberian wilderness they were still alive .
