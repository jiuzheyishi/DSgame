' but senator franken said that while a password can be kept a secret and changed if it 's hacked , fingerprints are permanent and left on everything a person touches . scroll down for video ... senator al franken -lrb- left -rrb- has sent a letter to apple 's chief executive , tim cook , -lrb- right -rrb- highlighting what he believes to be ` substantial ' security concerns about fingerprint recognition technology on the iphone 5s . in a letter to apple chief executive , tim cook , the minnesota democrat asked for more clarity on security questions . ` if someone hacks your password , you can change it -- as many times as you want , ' said senator franken , in his letter . ` you ca n't change your fingerprints . you have only ten of them . and you leave them on everything you touch ; they are definitely not a secret . ' apple claims this kind of technology boosts security for users . it added that the fingerprint data is stored on the phone in a place that 's inaccessible to other apps and to apple 's remote servers . apple said the touch id fingerprint sensor is designed to provide ` accurate readings from any angle , so the motion to unlock your device ought to be as automatic as it is now ' touch id uses a small touch sensor encased around the home button that scans the layers of skin on a finger . users can ` train ' their iphone to . read and learn their unique fingerprint and when they touch the home . button , the phone is unlocked . touch id can also be replace an app store password when buying music , apps or books . it uses a ` laser cut sapphire . crystal ' to take a high-resolution image scan before the touch id software in ios 7 . detemines whether the print belongs to the owner or not . all fingerprint information is . encrypted and stored securely inside the device 's chip . the prints are not stored on an apple server , or backed up to icloud . senator franken said that , unlike a string of numbers , a fingerprint uniquely identifies its owner . ` let me put it this way , ' he said . ` if hackers get a hold of your thumbprint , they could use it to identify and impersonate you for the rest of your life . ' apple is yet to issue an official response to senator franken , but it has published a support document on its website outlining the security features of touch id . ` touch id does not store any images of your fingerprint . it stores only a mathematical representation of your fingerprint , ' it said . ` it is n't possible for your actual fingerprint image to be reverse-engineered from this mathematical representation . ' ` your fingerprint data is never accessed by ios or other apps , never stored on apple servers , and never backed up to icloud or anywhere else , ' it added . apple recently announced plans to open a mineral plant that uses sapphire-based materials . apple already uses sapphire crystal in the touch id fingerprint scanner on its iphone 5s , pictured , and to protect the cameras on its latest models . rumours now claim apple could use the plant to make strong sapphire glass screens . apple 's phil schiller , pictured , explained the scanner was secure because prints are saved to the chip , and not online . yet security researchers are concerned that prints can be stolen from anywhere . even before the new iphone 5s was released , a group of hackers pooled their funds to offer a bounty of over # 10,000 , bottles of booze and other prizes , for the first person that can crack the iphone 5s 's touch id fingerprint sensors . istouchidhackedyet.com , the creation of security researcher nick depetrillo , said it is hoping to help apple identify bugs that it may have missed . security engineer charlie miller said it could take fewer than two weeks for a smart hacker to get around the new lock . among those getting ready for the hacking contest is david kennedy , a former u.s. marine corps cyber-intelligence analyst who did two tours in iraq and now runs his own consulting firm , trustedsec llc . kennedy said he needs to examine the new iphone to figure out how to best attempt an attack . he said his choices include hacking the software that analyses the fingerprint data , or physically opening up the phone and connecting it to a custom-built device that would impersonate apple 's fingerprint reader . he added that it might be possible to lift a user 's fingerprint from elsewhere on the device and somehow make a clone of it . the touch id sensor is built into the premium phone 's ` home ' button and can be used to unlock the phone , as well as pay for shopping and apps automatically - effectively replacing the need for a password or pin . speaking at the launch event in cupertino , apple 's senior vice president of worldwide marketing phil schiller said : ` half of smartphone customers do not set up passwords . -lsb- touch id -rsb- is an easier and more fun alternative . ` it uses key you have with you everywhere you go . your finger . ' it works by using a small touch sensor encased around the home button that scans the layers of skin on a finger . a user can ` train ' their iphone to read and learn their unique fingerprint and when they touch the home button , the phone is unlocked . touch id can also replace an app store password when buying music , apps or books . it uses a ` laser cut sapphire crystal ' to take a high-res image scan and the touch id software in ios 7 determines whether the print belongs to the owner or not . apple said it is designed to provide ` accurate readings from any angle , so the motion to unlock your device ought to be as automatic as it is now . ' schiller reassured users that touch id is secure by explaining that ` all fingerprint information is encrypted and stored securely inside the device 's chip ' adding the prints are not stored on an apple server , or backed up to icloud .", "summary": " touch id feature allows you to use your fingerprint to unlock the iphone 5s .   apple maintains that touch id is ` one of the best passwords in the world '   but the democrat is concerned about hackers getting hold of fingerprints .   ` they could use it to impersonate you for the rest of your life , ' he said .
