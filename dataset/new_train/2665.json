{"text": "as you step closer to the artwork , it 's as if you 're venturing into a crimson-hued dreamscape , a psychedelic realm immersed in feverish landscapes and eerie sounds . yet , this is no dream . using a special and discontinued technology , which registers an invisible spectrum of infrared light , irish artist and photographer richard mosse has captured beautiful and challenging imagery of people and landscapes in eastern democratic republic of congo . designed by the u.s. military in the 1940s for camouflage detection , the kodak aerochrome film renders the landscape in an unexpected light , turning shades of lush green into dramatic pinks and glowing reds . the result is both spectacular and shocking : rolling hills appear dotted with candy-coated trees ; river valleys are covered with pink savannah grasses ; gun-holding soldiers , clad in purple uniforms , stroll under darkened skies . set against the horrors of eastern drc 's humanitarian disaster , where more than five million people have died due to war-related causes since 1998 , mosse 's surreal palette presents an alternative view of the region 's complex situation . read this : why the world ignores congo conflict . it 's this juxtaposition of alluring panoramas and defiant militia , of haunting beauty and unsettling violence , that forces viewers to pause and think .  the idea was to use this medium to see into the unseen , to reveal the hidden and make visible the invisible of this forgotten conflict ,  says mosse , 33 .  that works really on a very simple level through the color palette ,  he adds .  the pink is so surprising and shocking and unnatural that really makes people stop .  mosse first used infrared film in his highly praised 2011 photographic series  infra ,  also about eastern drc . he now takes that project a step further with  the enclave ,  a multimedia installation that opened last weekend at the irish pavilion of the venice biennale in italy .  the enclave  is centred on a six-screen projection of a nearly 40-minute documentary , shot on 16mm infrared film . throughout large parts of last year , mosse traveled across eastern drc with cinematographer trevor tweeten and composer ben frost . embedded with armed militia , they captured video , stills and audio to create a powerful installation about the region 's rebel groups and their surrounding communities .  there 's no plot , there 's no narrator , there 's no dialogue -- it 's very much a video art piece ,  says mosse , who first travelled to eastern drc in 2010 . read this - war reporter : ` my camera is my weapon '  throughout , the camera it 's very much a documentary work ,  says mosse .  it is unscripted ; we just really go into the warzone and it comes to us . we ca n't really make things up ; it 's really what we had the luck to capture and what we turned our sights on .  mosse says that at the heart of the project is an effort to bring  two counter-worlds into collision : art 's potential to represent narratives so painful that they exist beyond language , and photography 's capacity to document specific tragedies and communicate them to the world .   the enclave  is exhibited at fondaco marcello in venice until november 24 .", "summary": " artist richard mosse has taken infrared images of eastern congo .   his artwork shows rolling landscapes and heavily armed militia .   his latest work ,  the enclave ,  is a multimedia installation blending stills , video and audio .   it opened last weekend at the venice biennale in italy .
