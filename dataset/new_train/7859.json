' mr smith said in a victim impact statement : ' i feel humiliated that i have been taken in like this . ' mr aziz , who has a wife and two children said : ` it 's a lot of money to me . i thought it was an honest deal . ' mr singh received ten cars , mr bennett three cars , mr blagden , mr smith and mr stockdale one car each , while mr aziz got nothing . the court heard that other customers received cut-price cars from hoystead but have not complained to the police . he went on : ' i have to acknowledge that honest people have lost a considerable amount of money . but some were happy with what happened . they approached this lady and bought cars from her at half the price they would have cost you or me . ` it does beg the question as to what they thought was going on here when a receptionist was able to promise time after time these cracking deals for cars . ' he said every time she found a car and sold it cheap she was getting more and more into debt . ` this is a lady who is particularly vulnerable to pressure being brought to bear upon her .

' judge paul watson said hoystead had glowing testimonials and ordinarily was a ` decent and caring mother . ' she had not set out to be dishonest from the outset . ` it was one which grew and grew causing these extremely substantial losses , ' he said . after the hearing miss marshall said : ` she thought these customers were her friends and she did n't want to let them down . she thought if she stopped she would lose their friendship .
