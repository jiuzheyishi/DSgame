{"text": "tunis , tunisia even while under curfew following the ouster of their long-serving authoritarian leader , tunisians on saturday experienced newfound freedoms online as their acting president promised a  new phase  for his embattled land . filters on websites like facebook and youtube , put in place under former president zine el abidine ben ali , were dropped and internet speed picked up considerably -- a development that followed the new government 's vow to ease restrictions on freedoms . in addition , three tunisian journalists -- including two bloggers critical of ben ali -- have been freed from jail , the committee to protect journalists said saturday . these developments come as fouad mebazaa was sworn in as the country 's acting leader on saturday , after ben ali and his family took refuge in saudi arabia following days of angry street protests against the government . speaking on national tv , mebazaa , who had been the country 's parliamentary speaker , promised to ensure the nation 's  stability ,  respect its constitution and  pursue the best interest of the nation .   citizens , sons and daughters of our country of tunis , in this important and urgent moment in the history of our beloved country , i appeal to all of you of various political parties , and nationalist organizations , and all civil society organizations to fight for the national interest and to respect the army 's command and the national security in security matters , and to preserve private and public property and to bring the return of peace and security in the hearts of the citizens ,  he said . mebazaa 's temporary assumption of the presidency corresponds to an article in tunisia 's constitution that says power will be transferred to the parliament speaker when the president resigns , dies or is unable to perform his responsibilities . he asked mohamed ghannouchi to remain as prime minister of what is now a caretaker government . this dramatic power shift comes after the departure of ben ali , the leader of the north african country since 1987 who had a reputation for ruthlessness and corruption , ben ali fled to jeddah , where he was welcomed by the saudi arabian king .  the government of the kingdom of saudi arabia announces that it stands fully by the tunisian people , wishing , by god will , its people will stand solid to overcome this difficult phase in its history ,  the saudi royal court said in a statement . moammar gadhafi , leader of neighboring libya , denounced the developments in a televised speech saturday night . ben ali remains the nation 's rightful president , per its constitution , and blamed unrest on criminal gangs , he said .  sadly , tunisia is headed to more chaos and we do not know how it will end ,  he said . gadhafi closed his speech by saying he was  sad and hurt  by the recent developments , which he said threatened to derail significant progress in tunisia .  i hope your sanity returns and your wounds heal , because you had a big loss that will never return ,  he said , addressing the tunisian people . as the political situation remained fluid , the army appears to have clamped down and established a strong presence on the streets in the cities of tunisia , long a relatively stable and prosperous country in what diplomats have described as  a rough neighborhood .  tunisian state tv reported that officials plan to hold presidential elections in 60 days , and an opposition leader told cnn that opposition figures were meeting with the caretaker prime minister to discuss formation of a unity government . the ruling government declared a state of emergency , ordering a curfew requiring all people to remain indoors between 5 p.m. saturday and 7 a.m. sunday . no large street protests in the capital , tunis , were reported saturday . but multiple videos posted online showed that tunis ' main train station had been burned . there were also reports of rioting and looting in the country , and security forces also have been spotted rounding up and roughing up people . at least 42 people died when a fire swept through a prison in the eastern tunisian city of monastir , dr. ali chadly of the university hospital of monastir told cnn . it was not immediately clear what sparked the fire . a travel warning from the british foreign office on saturday said  there have been demonstrations , some violent  and  significant looting  in tunis and other locations , citing sousse , sfax , nabul , hammamet , douze , kasserine , requeb and thia . under ben ali , tunisia was a pro-western state supportive of u.s. policy in the middle east and in its efforts against terrorism . on friday , u.s. president barack obama condemned  the use of violence against citizens peacefully voicing their opinion in tunisia  and lauded  the courage and dignity of the tunisian people .  he also urged tunisia 's government  to respect human rights -lrb- and -rrb- hold free and fair elections .  the wave of rallies in the north african nation was stirred by the suicide of an unemployed college graduate , who torched himself last month after police confiscated his fruit cart , cutting off his source of income . since then , protesters had called for ben ali to step down and held daily demonstrations denouncing his government . the grass-roots protests , organized and supported through online networks centered on twitter and facebook , focused on poor living conditions , high unemployment , government corruption and repression . amnesty international spokesman claudio cordone said that 55 people have been killed over the past several weeks of demonstrations . the former president had put the number at 21 before his departure .  we hope that the army will match its reputation for being more professional and less trigger-happy than the security forces that have been responsible for much of the violence over the last several weeks ,  cordone said . the tumult , including ben ali 's departure , has reverberated in the arab world , where the news of the uprising elated people in other countries across the region , where authoritarian rule has persisted for years . in cairo , egypt , about 100 people inspired by what some are calling the  jasmine revolution  in tunisia massed in front of the press syndicate and called for a similar uprising there . amid heavy security and the presence of many riot police in the city , the people chanted ,  down with hosni mubarak ,  the nation 's leader , and called him a corrupt and ruthless ruler . tunisia has close cultural and economic links to france , which invaded tunisia in 1881 . that move led to the creation of a protectorate until tunisia became independent in 1956 . an official statement from french president nicolas sarkozy noted france 's  many ties of friendship  to tunisia and called for free elections as soon as possible . after sarkozy met with some senior members of his cabinet saturday to discuss tunisia , finance minister christine lagarde sent instructions to financial institutions and banks to freeze the assets in france of the ben ali family . french government spokesman francois baroin said saturday that france asked some of ben ali 's relatives to leave the country , adding that ben ali would n't be allowed in france . the african union 's peace and security council on saturday  expressed its solidarity  with tunisians and deplored the  excessive use of force against demonstrators .  it also urged  the political stakeholders and the tunisian people to work together , in unity , consensus and respect for legality , towards a peaceful and democratic transition , which will allow the tunisian people to freely choose their leaders through free , open , democratic and transparent elections .  also saturday , the arab league released a statement regarding  this historic stage  and urged the  return of calm and security ,  according to a report by jordan 's state-run news agency , petra . the cairo-based alliance offered support for a peaceful , legal realization of  the tunisian people 's aspirations for a decent , secure and stable future in a climate of democracy and political stability .  journalists elham nakhlawi and ian lee contributed to this report .", "summary": " new : filters on websites like facebook and youtube have been dropped .   new : tunis ' main train
