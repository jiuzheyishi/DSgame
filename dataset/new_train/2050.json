{"text": "london the ceiling collapse that injured dozens of people at a london theater involved  no criminal act ,  police said friday in an initial assessment . police said the investigation into thursday evening 's collapse of the ceiling of london 's historic apollo theatre , in the heart of the capital 's buzzing theater district , will be continued by the westminster city council . investigators combing through the wreckage want to know what caused part of the century-old structure 's ornate plaster ceiling to tumble onto the crowd who packed the nearly sold-out show . nine people were seriously hurt in the collapse , but there were no fatalities , the london ambulance service said friday .  it could have been a lot worse -- there were about 720 people in the auditorium at the time , and a large area of the ceiling came down ,  said london fire brigade 's kingsland station manager nick harding . three injured people were trapped under debris and had to be rescued by firefighters , he said . some of the  walking wounded  were treated in neighboring theaters , he added . london ambulance service said it helped 79 people , 56 of whom were taken to local hospitals . some had head and back injuries , while others had breathing problems or cuts and scrapes . images from inside the apollo , which opened in 1901 , showed planks , plaster and other debris strewn across the dusty , red plush seats . the drama unfolded shortly after 8 p.m. thursday , about 40 minutes into the play ,  the curious incident of the dog in the night-time .   one of the actors said , ` watch out ! '  said one woman .  we thought it was part of the play .  it was n't . instead , it was part of the plaster ceiling collapsing and dropping down five stories onto the theatergoers below . ` somebody screamed '  we heard a creak , somebody screamed , somebody from over there said , ` look out ! ' and then the ceiling kind of creased in the middle and then just collapsed ,  said hannah , who with her husband had snagged one of the last pairs of tickets to the performance in the 775-seat theater . though she said she felt  slight panic ,  she credited those around her for keeping calm .  it was n't every man for himself ,  she said , noting that several of her fellow theatergoers checked on those around them .  everyone was looking out for each other , and in a couple of minutes , everyone was out .  martin bostock , who was with his wife and two children , said he thought the cave-in was part of the show until something very hard hit him on the head and chaos and panic erupted .  you could n't see across the room because of the dust , which we were all breathing in ,  he told cnn .  it was absolutely horrific and very terrifying . i was with my wife and two kids . thank god , we got out .  another theatergoer , simon usborne , said :  my view of the stage was immediately obscured by this dust and debris -- some other people have said it was like an avalanche , and that 's probably a better description .  no alarm sounded , but it was clear that something serious had happened , he said .  everybody knew that something was wrong and the fear was then that more might come down , so everybody immediately dashed for an exit -- people were screaming -- i was fortunately close to an exit ,  he said . harding , who said the theater had been evacuated in a swift and orderly way , told reporters friday it was too soon to speculate on the cause of the collapse . some observers have speculated that heavy rain over london earlier thursday evening might have played a part . the apollo is on shaftesbury avenue near piccadilly circus , in london 's soho district , which is usually packed with tourists , shoppers and diners at theater time . the area around it was cordoned off after the collapse as bloodied and dust-covered theatergoers stumbled onto the street . the local london authority , westminster city council , said friday morning that the apollo theatre 's roof is now  secure ,  but what led it to give way was not known . historic theaters are required to undergo rigorous roof safety checks every three years , the council said .
