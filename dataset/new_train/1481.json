{"text": "we 've all been guilty of over-packing for a holiday abroad . even if you 're only jetting off on a quick weekend jaunt , it 's easy to start dreaming up every possible weather contingency or holiday activity scenario that could have you needing those knee-high wellies , your full gym kit , or one of your many hair-styling gadgets . but does anyone ever actually use these ` must have ' items ? almost never . scroll down for video . do n't let this happen to you ! ensure that you never over-pack again with these top expert tips . to help you solve any of your potential packing problems , we 've gone right to the source , polling several top travel writers , fashion bloggers and beauty gurus on their must-have - and must-leave-behind - holiday items . blowdryers , flat irons , curling irons . this one often winds up being completely redundant . ` almost all hotels and many hostels have them , ' says julie falconer , writer and owner of travel blog , a lady in london . ` hairdryers just take up a lot of space in luggage . ' ` plus , if you 're travelling abroad , you 'll often find that your hairdryer does n't even work due to different electric voltage in other countries . ' leave your blowdryers at home ... most hotels and hostels have them these days anyway . more than one jacket or coat . this is a packing faux pas with one heavy price to pay - it will weigh your bag down and may even require you to opt for a checked case over carry-on luggage . ` too many coats and jackets can be a pain because they take up space and weight , ' british fashion blogger , susie bubble , admits . ` on cold breaks away , i 've now learnt to just wear one on-board and stick to it . ' you wo n't wear those flimsy summer dresses - and if you do , you 'll wind up freezing , like this woman -lrb- left -rrb- . seasonally inappropriate dresses . ' i always pack lots of slip dresses , ' susie continues . ' i do n't even know where one buys slip dresses anymore but i have a stash of vintage ones that in my head are ` handy ' for holidays . i 'll layer them , i think . that never happens . ' noted : leave all rarely worn flimsy frocks at home . trainers take up a lot of space in your carry-on , and , be honest : will you really hit the hotel gym ? a full gym kit . it 's been a busy week leading up to your holiday in the sun and you have n't had time to exercise . no problem , you think , i 'll work out in the hotel gym once i arrive . this is rarely the case . instead , you wind up taking up precious space with trainers , spandex leggings and a sports bra that you wo n't look at again during your getaway . if you pack your best lingerie , you 're more likely to meet the man of your dreams , right ? er , maybe not ... lingerie . if you plan for it , that must mean that you 'll meet the man of your dreams on holiday , does n't it ? of course there 's always a chance , but that stiff corset you shoved into your bag probably is n't even all that necessary when it comes to wooing said hypothetical guy . way too many tampons . even if it 's not that dreaded time of the month - does n't matter - a lady must always be prepared . nevermind the fact that almost any destination you 're heading off to will likely sell the products in question , we all know those women who insist on bringing the entire variety pack . even if it 's not that time of the month , many women still feel the need to pack several variety packs . several handbag options . you need one for touring during the day , a smaller option for a night out , and a carry-all for the plane , right ? before you know it , half of your suitcase is comprised of handbags . we went to the experts to find the perfect all-round option . ' i take a rucksack or a roomy crossover bag with secure closures , ' susie says . ' i do n't do clutches on holiday - too easy to lose or get stolen and not enough room to carry all the essentials . ' think you 'll read that book you 've been meaning to for months ? probably not on the plane ... that book you 've been meaning to read . chances are , if the book has been collecting dust on your bookshelf for several weeks , your upcoming plane ride is almost certainly not the time you 'll finally crack it open . excessive amounts of beauty products . an array of moisturisers and cleansers ? leave them . nail varnish remover ? nope , you wo n't use it . when it comes to bringing beauty products abroad , stick to the basics and try to opt for an all-in-one compact . makeup artist and pixiwoo video blogger , samantha chapman , says : ' i tend to take products that have multiple purposes , like bb creams that have coverage and spf or lip and cheek duos . ' ` micellar water is also great as it removes makeup from eyes , lips and cheeks , ' adds susannah taylor , editor of beauty website , get the gloss . instead of taking your entire beauty bag , opt for products that pull double duty or an all-in-one compact . expensive jewellery . why risk it ? those shoes you never wear -lrb- be it sky-high stilettos or rubber wellie boots -rrb- . ` one pair of shoes for walking around during the day and another for any dressier occasions in the evening is usually sufficient , ' julie says . ` leave the ` just in case ' shoes at home . they can take up a lot of packing space , often unnecessarily . ' those sky-high stilettos you never wear ? the best time to try them out is definitely not during a holiday . stay aware from alluring airport bargains ! the only travel accessory you really need is an adaptor . loads of travel gadgets and accessories . all you really need is an adaptor -lrb- depending on where you 're headed -rrb- and your smart phone to keep you connected . and when it comes to those bargain travel accessories , skip the airport shops and their allure - including those inflatable pillows , hand-held fans and under-clothes money belts . ` i have a leopard eye mask that i always think i will use , but in reality , am far too embarrassed to take out of my bag , ' says todd plummer , a new york city-based fashion writer . full-size shampoo and conditioner . this can be a tempting one . after all , you never know how the cold air , or alternatively , the heat and humidity , will mess with your hair . still , most hotels do leave mini versions out for guests and , really , is packing the gargantuan bottles really worth being forced to check your bag ?", "summary": " most women fall victim to over-packing when heading off on holiday .   fashion expert susie bubble shares her most recent packing faux pas .   travel blogger , a lady in london , also reveals what she leaves at home .
