{"text": "lots of love for  12 years a slave .  a big push for  american hustle .  nothing for  lee daniels ' the butler .  the hollywood foreign press association , the little group -lrb- about 100 members -rrb- with the outsized influence , presented the nominations for the 71st annual golden globes on thursday morning , and some trends quickly became obvious . given that the globes are often used as tea leaf samples with which to forecast the big daddy of awards shows -- the oscars -- what do they indicate ? 1 -rrb-  12 years a slave  and  american hustle  are the front-runners .  slave ,  the steve mcqueen film about a free man taken into slavery in 19th-century america , dominated the proceedings among dramatic films . -lrb- the globes spread the wealth by having categories for both film dramas and film comedies , and do the same for television shows . -rrb- it received seven nominations , including nods for best drama , best director , best actor in a drama -lrb- chiwetel ejiofor -rrb- , best supporting actor -lrb- michael fassbender -rrb- and best supporting actress -lrb- lupita nyong ` o -rrb- .  hustle  matched that number , earning nominations for best comedy or musical , best director -lrb- david o. russell -rrb- , best actor in a comedy/musical -lrb- christian bale -rrb- , best actress in a comedy/musical -lrb- amy adams -rrb- , best supporting actor -lrb- bradley cooper -rrb- and best supporting actress -lrb- jennifer lawrence -rrb- . expect a lot of the same when the oscar nominations are announced january 16 . 2014 golden globe nominations : the list . 2 -rrb- you call these comedies ? of the five films nominated for best comedy or musical , none is an out-and-out laugh riot . in fact , a couple are as dark as they come -- and probably richer than the nominated dramas .  inside llewyn davis ,  the coen brothers film about a struggling folksinger in early - '60s new york , features an unpleasant lead character who mooches off some friends and alienates others .  nebraska ,  directed by alexander payne -lrb-  sideways  -rrb- , stars bruce dern as a curmudgeonly old man convinced he 's won a big cash prize ; like all of payne 's films , it has plenty of bitter with the sweet .  the wolf of wall street  is a three-hour martin scorsese film about a crooked financial trader on a headlong rush to trouble . there 's no  bridesmaids  - like film in the bunch -- nor , for that matter , a  secret life of walter mitty .  special coverage of awards season 2014 . 3 -rrb-  the butler  got shown the door . in the screen actors guild nominations , announced wednesday ,  lee daniels ' the butler  did surprisingly well , earning nominations for ensemble -lrb- the equivalent of best film -rrb- and performers forest whitaker and oprah winfrey . none of them were nominated for a globe -- and this despite the fact that the globes often appear to hand out nominations based as much on star power as quality . sorry , oprah : you 'll have to be invited like any other guest . also getting short shrift from the hollywood foreign press : scorsese , who missed out on a directing nod ;  august : osage county ,  which picked up two acting nominations but nothing for film , director or screenplay ; and woody allen , though two of his  blue jasmine  stars got nominated . not that woody would have shown -- the awards-show curmudgeon , who never goes to the oscars either , will receive the cecil b. demille award from the hfpa , but diane keaton is scheduled to accept on his behalf . 4 -rrb- no sag award nomination ? no problem ! ok , so  the butler  got stiffed by the globes . not so for  rush ,  which earned a nomination not only for daniel bruhl -- who did get a sag nod -- but also for the film itself . and how about kate winslet ? there 's been little chatter about jason retman 's  labor day ,  but she earned a best actress -lrb- drama -rrb- nomination . robert redford also got tabbed . the venerable 77-year-old actor , who 's a one-man show in  all is lost ,  picked up a best actor nomination . his snub by the sags may have been wednesday 's biggest surprise . 5 -rrb- watch out for  gravity .  alfonso cuaron 's film has a spare screenplay and a small cast . indeed , its lack of a true ensemble could have possibly hurt it with the sags . but sandra bullock got an acting nod -lrb- as she did from the sags -rrb- , and the film also earned globe nominations for drama , director cuaron and its score . oscarologists still consider it a front-runner for best picture , and the globes did nothing to dispel that belief . incidentally , for all the attention paid to the globes , their real attraction is as a raucous , celebrity-studded party . the liquor flows freely and there 's generally a loose , devil-may-care vibe from the winners . -lrb- no surprise -- this is the award that once gave pia zadora a  new star of the year  honor for the immortal film  butterfly .  -rrb- . the hosts , once again , will be tina fey and amy poehler , so expect a good time -- and terrible singing . the golden globes will be broadcast on sunday , january 12 . the program will air on nbc . keep up to date with the awards tracker .", "summary": " golden globe leaders :  12 years a slave ,   american hustle     the butler  comes up empty , though .   robert redford gets globe nomination ; he was snubbed by sags .
