{"text": "they said he was crazy . and he knew they were a little bit afraid . when a small swedish industrial town took in thousands of african immigrants , there were some concerns as to how it would work . the locals in borlänge , located 200 km north of the capital , were already struggling with the economic realities of modern-day life . the arrival of 3,000 somalis would swell the population to almost 50,000 -- raising the type of fears that have become all too common across europe . last may sweden experienced its worst riots in years following the death of a 69-year-old man who was shot by police earlier while wielding a machete in the stockholm suburb of husby , which has a large number of immigrant residents . but one man thought he had the answer .  i feared there would be problems with a lot of people coming from somalia to a little town ,  says borlange resident patrik andersson .  that can make problems . i thought integration in sport was a good way to work . it 's something everyone has in common . if we could just do something that everybody could get together around , it would help .  i do think people in borlänge were afraid as they 'd not seen that situation before . i think from the start very few people have been angry with me . there have been good vibrations .  football is often credited with bringing people together , a unifying force -- and indeed a game popular with the somalis . but andersson had a better idea . why not get them to play the local game , bandy -- a close relative of ice hockey ?  people on the street said i was crazy , the manager said i was crazy , the people of somalia asked if i was crazy , the national bandy organization too . but we are nearly there now ,  andersson told cnn . he has managed to bring together a team of somali football players , none of whom had ever skated on ice before , and take them to the bandy world championships starting in russia this weekend .  just being there is a victory whether we win , lose or draw ,  says ahmed hussain , who plays in midfield .  ok , we want to score once but this is our victory . it will be amazing to play in our national colors , to hear our national anthem .  hussain , who moved to sweden five years ago , admits he was not well versed in snow or ice -- which is not surprising , having grown up in an east african country where the temperature gauge rarely drops below 23c -lrb- 73f -rrb- .  really , i thought ice was just something you put in coca-cola ,  he says , almost embarrassed by the recollection . andersson was well aware of the challenge he faced . the players , most of whom are 18 or 19 , were not exactly natural skaters .  i said to them they were like bambi on ice -- the problem was they had n't even heard of bambi ,  he adds , laughing . for hussain , it is a welcome relief from the ordeal of living in his war-torn homeland .  life in somalia was awful and tough to handle ,  he admits .  every day is like a new day in somalia .  you do n't know what 's going to happen tomorrow or even in the next hour . it was a clash every day . there was war and between that you could still be shot .  my mum took care of me , and she would keep me at home , but i have seen things .  i had a friend who was 10 years old when he was shot in the back , who just wanted to go to the football field . he made it , he did n't die , but it 's so hard for him now just to walk . his life is tough . people were just always running . it 's so tough .  when not practicing his bandy playing two hours a day , the 19-year-old is studying with the aim of becoming a doctor or architect . his father hussein also lives in sweden , while his mother has moved to uganda .  initially my father saw the sport and said , ` you 're going to break your arm or leg , ' and he was right ,  he says .  when i first skated i was terrible . there were children aged five on the ice better than me . i was thinking even if i ice-skate for six years i ca n't do this , i spent so much time falling over .  those first tentative , bambi-like steps took place just six months ago and now his father 's perceptions have changed .  he 's ok now , he 's happy ,  says hussain . the somali players have finally found the target , scoring their first goals in training this week . how the journey ends remains to be seen , but a film is being made of their passage from somalia to siberia . a hollywood ending seems unlikely , though that is hardly the point .  we want to show the world that everything is possible ,  hussain says . coached by per fosshaug , who won five world titles playing for sweden , the somali team will take on japan , ukraine , germany and mongolia in the tournament , which starts in the siberian city of irkutsk on sunday . local borlange band apopocalyps even recorded a world championship anthem for the town 's adopted team . somalia 's entry is a contest that makes david versus goliath look like a fair fight , as the novices take on the powerhouses of a sport played between two teams of 11 on an ice rink the size of a football field , using hockey sticks and an orange ball .  i 'm so nervous just to think about it because i never imagined this would be possible ,  hussain says .  i dreamed one day to be a world champion but i never had anything but football . when i was first told about this , i was like , ` is this serious or a joke ? ' but it 's now real .  it has made us so proud . i explain it to my family and friends in somalia . they do n't understand bandy completely but they are so proud of us , the country is proud of us .
