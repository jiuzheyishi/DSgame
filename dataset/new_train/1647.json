{"text": "amie miller died aged 15 of encephalitis , a disease which causes swelling of the brain . the parents of a schoolgirl who died after a catalogue of errors at a failing hospital told how they were forced to endure ` five years of torture ' as they battled to find out the truth behind the tragedy . amie miller , 15 , died of a brain injury just days after she was admitted to hospital with agonising headaches . doctors failed to carry out basic neurological checks which might have saved her life . but nobody from the hospital would even meet the family -- even though the mother worked at the hospital -- to discuss their concerns for more than a year . they then had to fight for four more years to get an inquest . yesterday , that inquest jury found medics at basildon hospital in essex missed a string of opportunities to save amie 's life in 2008 . in a damning narrative verdict , they said staff had failed to take even the most basic steps -- such as checking whether she could open her eyes , or examining the size of her pupils -- which might have alerted them to her injury . doctors also administered the wrong treatments -- which may have made her condition worse . after the inquest , amie 's stepfather mbarek aitmarri said the past five years had been torture . he said the hospital -- which is under special measures and is one of 14 singled out for having high death rates -- had ` evaded ' responsibility for her death and had failed to respond to 81 allegations of negligence they had lodged . mr aitmarri , a pharmacy technician , said : ` from the moment amie died we faced constant evasion and were passed from one person to another . this has tortured us for the last five years . ' amie 's step-father mbarek says his other children have struggled to cope and wo n't go to the doctor . amie 's step-dad mbarek has said that he would never take another of his children to the hospital and would advise other parents to consider all their options first . he added : ` they knew what had gone wrong from day one and they did n't implement changes because it was not in their interests . ` you have incompetent staff and management that , i believe , are more focused on collecting a pay cheque than caring for people and that is a recipe for disaster . ` i 'm not saying that everyone in the hospital is a rouge but it is the system that fails . the culture , the intimidation , and the lack of value for life . ' despite being singled out for its . abnormally high death rates , basildon hospital 's procedures ` had not . changed ' , mr aitmarri said . ` for us there 's no doubt that systematic failings caused amie 's death , ' he added . ` our daughter has been treated as collateral damage . i ask . myself every day whether , if i had taken her to another hospital , she . would still be alive . ' speaking about the continued problems at the hospital , mr aitmarri said : ` there is no way i would take any of my other children there . ` they do n't want to go to the doctor anymore . we now dread taking them to any hospital let alone basildon . ` it is not for me to tell other people what to do with their children if they are sick but going to a hospital with such high profile problems , i would think twice and consider other options . ' amie was admitted to basildon hospital in essex after suffering headaches , vomiting and fitting . his wife sonia , amie 's mother , added : ` it took until 2009 for the . hospital to arrange a meeting and the doctors were very vague . we were . just passed backwards and forwards . ' amie , a promising pupil who had dreamed of becoming a paediatrician , had . had severe headaches for seven days and had started vomiting and having . fits . she was taken to basildon 's a&e department on november 16 , . 2008 . dr michel sun wai told the inquest he did not carry out basic tests on . november 17 , because a colleague told him amie 's condition had improved . ' a number of changes have since been . introduced in the treatment of children and adults with neurological . illness , including the introduction of more regular observations . ' she died on november 19 of encephalitis , which causes swelling of the brain and is normally triggered by infection . the doctor said : ` with hindsight the neurological observations should . have been done . but the handover to me was that the patient was waking . up and was getting better . ' the inquest at chelmsford coroners ' court found a string of other . errors . staff misinterpreted the results of a ct scan and failed to . carry out a mri scan , despite one being recommended . in addition , a lumbar puncture , in which fluid is taken from the spine , may have exacerbated her condition . amie was also given propofol , a sedative only meant for adults , which . could have masked warning signs of brain damage . it is the drug linked . to the death of pop star michael jackson . amie 's mother works as a pharmaceutical technician at basildon hospital , . and her husband admitted ` it has been hard for her to work there ' . amie was kept on an adult ward at the hospital because of a shortage of beds at london 's paediatric intensive care units . she paid tribute to her daughter , a pupil at grays convent high school . in thurrock , saying : ` she would be 20 if she were still alive . she . wanted to be a paediatrician and we are sure she would be at university . now . we miss her every day . ' the family said they would pursue regulatory , disciplinary and criminal action against the hospital . mr aitmarri said the tragedy had been hard on his other children as some of them had become introverted while others cried constantly . despite this hardship he said the family would now work with solicitors to pursue regulatory , disciplinary and criminal action against the hospital . ` to stop here is just not fair to amie and not just to any of her family ' he said . ` our legal claim is going to hopefully highlight the failures and those responsible for taking our daughter from us . ' tim spring of moore blatch , who was the family 's legal representative , said : ` whilst we welcome today 's conclusions by the jury and the specific criticisms made - we remain concerned . ` the length of time taken to establish and document a plan to prevent a re-occurrence of this type of incident was unacceptable in our view . ' basildon and thurrock university hospitals nhs foundation trust . apologised for the blunders . a spokesman added : ` a number of changes . have since been introduced in the treatment of neurological illness . ' the jury returned a narrative verdict .", "summary": " amie miller was admitted to basildon hospital in essex after she 'd been vomiting and fitting .   she was admitted to an adult ward because there were no beds in the children 's ward .   one doctor said he ` did n't worry too much ' about the checks because amie was ` getting better '   amie died in november 2008 , but it has taken experts five years to find out how she died .   step-father blames systematic failings in both staff and management .
