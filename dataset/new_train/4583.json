{"text": "it may seem weird that the 2004 low-budget breakout comedy  napoleon dynamite  is surfacing as an animated series , but for writer/director jared hess , it 's not that odd that his world of preston , idaho lives on .  we were approached about doing a sequel but at the time it did n't feel right ,  hess told cnn .  there 's so much low-budget charm in the first film , that it would be hard to recreate that in a live action way in being able to use a real budget .  real discussions on turning  napoleon dynamite  into an animated series began more than two years ago , when hess met with  simpsons  veteran mike scully . the pair assembled a pitch and a writing team and are now seeing the fruits of their labor -- a short , six-episode first season , airing during fox 's  animation domination  sunday night block . whether or not the show will continue past this initial short order remains to be seen , but hess and his staff are busy writing more episodes in the event that they get picked up . so how does the process of turning  napoleon dynamite  into an animated series work ? cnn recently spoke with hess from his home in salt lake city where he explained just that . cnn : when did the idea to turn this into an animated series start gestating ? jared hess : there were different stages , obviously , but it kind of happened when we were shooting the movie . but we did n't know anything would happen with the movie at the time . it was just a pipe dream . it really was my wife 's idea ; we started work on this about two and a half years ago . that 's when we met up with mike scully . he was already a huge fan of the film and i was a huge fan of his work on  the simpsons .  cnn : the normal thing for a live action show is you have to shoot a pilot before it gets picked up . how did it work in this case ? hess : you do a little animation presentation piece to showcase what an episode would look like , design-wise . initially , back in the day , for  king of the hill  and stuff like that , it was a two-minute stencil animation test to show what it would look like . over the years , they 've ponied up more money because they want to see it fleshed out . we actually did a nine-minute pilot presentation , with a story arc and everything . we did that about a year and a half ago . based on that and addition to a pilot script and other artwork to make a full packet , they decided to order a season or not . cnn : that 's a serious endeavor . hess : especially with the animation . one episode , from the time you write it to the color , it takes about nine months . just doing an animation presentation , that was about seven to eight months . once you get picked up , you have to start hiring people . cnn : with  the simpsons ,   king of the hill  and  family guy ,  they had to start out getting an audience interested in their world . but we already know the  napoleon dynamite  world . how does this show materialize ? hess : we have a staff of about 12 writers and we all lock ourselves in a room ; there 's a couple of dry-erase boards , some sticky notes and we just start pitching potential story lines . we zero in on the ones that we think will be the most funny .  the simpsons  is coming up on its 500th episode and we have a couple of people that are longtime  simpsons  people that are working on our show and they 've been valuable . we 'll pitch something and they 'll be like  i think we did that season 10 , episode 5 .  we actually wrote a lot of the scripts as a group for this first season in getting the right tone and what we wanted to establish for the show . after we have a script , we get a draft of notes , and then do a table read with the cast as well as people from the network and people that just want to come in and enjoy it . it 's a room full of people and we 're reading it out loud and in character . after that , we get one more set of notes that we try to turn around pretty quickly and then immediately go and record all the voices . you cut together an audio track -- almost like a radio show -- and we cut it to the length of the episode and that goes to the animators and they start storyboarding to the audio track that we recorded . then we get an animatic back and we give notes on that and once we 've locked the animatic , it ships off to get animated . cnn : one of the things about the film is that it does n't rely on bad language , raunchiness or sex jokes . but the fox sunday night animation block certainly does in its various ways . how does  napoleon dynamite  continue with its style in this case ? hess : we 've been very aware of it and we 're working hard to maintain the innocence that people responded to in the film and keep that . fox already has shows that do that and we can be our own thing without trying to imitate what the other 's do . cnn : who do you see enjoying this show ? who is the demographic ? hess : i have n't been able to isolate that into age group or cultures . i think it boils down to people 's specific sense of humor . and the film demonstrated that for us . cnn : what are some of the upcoming plots that you 're excited about ? hess : we have one where napoleon gets a job at a liger breeding facility and that one 's a lot of fun . that was the first episode we wrote as a group , about a year ago . one of my favorites is where we have ... in preston , my hometown , they do this thing every year called the bed races , where it 's this annual tradition in the town around christmastime , where everyone races beds up and down main street . we 've got an episode about that which is super funny . we also have a future farmers of america episode , where we had to get their official approval . we sent them the script and they were like ,  well , there 's some inaccuracies here about the soil-judging competition but we 'll let it go .  cnn : did you ever win a bed race growing up ? hess : no , i actually did n't . i filmed the bed races for my eagle scout project . i did a little video for the chamber of congress . -lsb- laughs . -rsb- . cnn : are you working on any new scripts or any new movies ? hess : i got a project with lorne michaels ' company that i 'm hoping to do this year . it 's a heist comedy based on these people that pulled off the second-largest cash heist in u.s. history back in 1997/1998 , in north carolina . it 's a funny , ridiculous story .", "summary": " discussions on the  napoleon dynamite  animated series began two years ago .    mike scully was already a huge fan of the film ,  writer/director jared hess said .    we 're working hard to maintain the innocence that people responded to in the film ,  he said .
