{"text": "now that the trailer for the seventh  star wars  movie is out , you can imagine the anticipation among the millions of fans of the film franchise . and why not ? the six  star wars  films have been enormous successes : they have grossed over $ 2 billion domestically at the box office , spawned scores of books , comic books and merchandise -lrb- how many kids have their own light saber ? -rrb- and made household names of characters like darth vader , han solo and luke skywalker . they 've also been the worst thing ever for the science fiction genre . i say this as someone who has been a devoted sci-fi reader since childhood . i was so blown away by the first  star wars  film when i saw it in 1977 , i went back two more times the same week to wallow in its space age fantasy . but here 's the thing : george lucas ' creation , basically a blown-up flash gordon adventure with better special effects , has left all too many people thinking science fiction is some computer graphics-laden space opera/western filled with shootouts , territorial disputes , evil patriarchs and trusty mounts -lrb- like the millennium falcon -rrb- .  star wars  has corrupted people 's notion of a literary genre full of ideas , turning it into a saturday afternoon serial . and that 's more than a shame -- it 's an obscenity . science fiction is in fact one of the most creative literary genres around . the best of sci-fi is filled with meditations on what 's  out there ,  what makes us human , how technology is used and how it is changing us . it takes up issues of race , sexuality and quite literally everything else under the sun . it is essentially about ideas , not action , and that 's the problem , as far as hollywood is concerned . there are , for example , no light sabers , spaceships or death stars in the 1979 novel  kindred ,  by octavia butler , who won the hugo and nebula , sci-fi 's top awards , and was also awarded a macarthur foundation  genius  grant . butler 's main themes are race and sex , and in  kindred  she wrote about a modern black woman who travels back in time to the antebellum south , where she is enslaved . the novel is regularly taught in classrooms and has made at least one list of  great books by women .  but hollywood has yet to adapt it for the screen . maybe if the lead character had a wookiee by her side ... many of the great works of sci-fi have not been made into films -- the foundation novels of isaac asimov , joe haldeman 's  the forever war ,  william gibson 's  neuromancer ,  among others -- partially because they are too smart , too dense and too thoughtful . sure , some classics have made the transition , but the track record is spotty : david lynch 's  dune  was a disaster , for example , and the recent  ender 's game  was a mixed bag that was not successful at the box office . francois truffaut 's  fahrenheit 451 ,  although stylish and intellectual , was a bit too frigid for a mass audience . which means that hollywood studios , not known for thinking outside the box , opt for the  star wars  template -- lots of whiz bang , plenty of quirky alien characters , cgi to the max , plenty of explosions and little thought of any kind . to be sure , the first  star wars  was a breath of fresh air , a fun flick for sci-fi geeks . but the series quickly ossified , a victim of its own success . only two of the films --  star wars  and  the empire strikes back  -- show any originality . the rest tread water , give the hardcore fans the same old , same old . i mean , how many light sabre duels can you sit through before you 're bored out of your skull ? how many outer space dogfights ? how many seemingly profound yoda-esque thoughts ? me , i 'm giving up on the whole thing . i do n't care that j.j. abrams , a director with talent , is helming the new flick . he 's hemmed in by audience expectations -- like casting the stars of the original in this film -- and recycling stale material . i 'll pass . instead , i 'll queue up  the matrix ,  and enjoy the most original sci-fi movie of the past 25 years . i recommend  star wars  fans do the same . they need to be reminded what real creativity is all about .", "summary": " lewis beale : people thrilled about seventh  star wars movie  do n't get it 's bad sci-fi .   he loved first installments , but franchise evolved into worst thing ever for rich literary genre .   hollywood only wants cgi-ready sc-fi plots , skips complex greats like butler , asimov .   beale : few real sci-fi movies made . new  star wars  promises to be empty of ideas .
