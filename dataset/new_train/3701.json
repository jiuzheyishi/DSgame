{"text": "colonialist : david tennant 's doctor who with freema agyeman as his first black companion , martha jones . through all his incarnations , doctor who has fought selflessly to ensure the survival of all manner of life forms across the universe . but now an international group of academics has branded the heroic time lord ` thunderingly racist ' . the doctor 's new foes claim that his dismissive attitude towards black companions , his contempt for ` primitive ' people , and even his passion for cricket are all proof of a reactionary ` whiteness ' pervading his adventures . their concerns are published in a new book , doctor who and race , which says the bbc programme is based in attitudes ` that continue to subjugate people of colour ' . but fans dismiss such criticisms as ` groundless ' and ` ridiculous ' . one of the more bizarre theories is offered by amit gupta , an american professor , who argues that peter davison 's cricket-loving incarnation of the character in the eighties was thinly disguised nostalgia for the british empire . he wrote : ` -lsb- he -rsb- portrayed the amateur english cricketer of the late 19th century when the game was characterised by both racial and class distinctions . ` cricket also had a role in maintaining the status of british imperialism through the exercise of soft power as it was successfully inculcated by the colonial elites . davison 's cricketing doctor once again saw the bbc using who to promote a racial and class nostalgia that had already outlived its validity . ' several of the 23 contributors to the book lament the failure to cast a black or asian actor as the doctor . and in earlier series , white actors were cast as other ethnicities . singled out for criticism is a 1977 storyline , the talons of weng - chiang , set in victorian times and featuring the white actor john bennett as a chinese villain . nostalgia for empire : peter davison 's cricket-loving time lord takes on the daleks . there is also an attack on the ` second-class ' treatment of black characters such as martha jones in more recent episodes . a feminist contributor with the pen name fire fly , says the doctor 's relationship with martha , who was played by freema agyeman , is proof of the ` white perspective ' of the series . she singles out a 2007 episode set in elizabethan london when martha voices her fears that she might be sold into slavery , only to be told by david tennant 's doctor that she should ` walk about like you own the place . it works for me ' . fire fly wonders why the doctor will depose tyrannical alien regimes but will not challenge human slavery . and she claims the exchange ` betrays the ignorance of writers about historical racial violence and contemporary white privilege ' . there is further criticism of the introduction and adolf hitler as a character last year , which was condemned as ` comic-book ' and ` slapstick ' , and did nothing to increase understanding of the holocaust . the doctor also dismisses as primitive any civilisation that does n't share his belief in scientific progress -- which the academic critics say is a very ` west european ' attitude . in the show 's very first story , william hartnell 's doctor compares the disbelief of his new companions when they first enter the tardis with the red indian ` whose savage mind disbelieved steam trains ' . and the introduction of the ` savage ' -- and scantily-clad -- companion leela in the 1970s is offered as further proof of the time lord 's inherent racism since she was treated as being ` more primitive than us ' . runaway success : the latest doctor who matt smith , with sidekick jenna-louise coleman . australian academic lindy orthia , who compiled the anthology , concluded : ` the biggest elephant in the room is the problem privately nursed by many fans of loving a tv show when it is thunderingly racist . ' but fans dismissed her criticisms . sebastian j brook , editor of doctor who online , said the show ` embraced rather than divided ' . he added : ` i think the suggestion the show is racist is ridiculous . doctor treated martha jones no differently from the way he treated any other character . ' and the bbc said : ` doctor who has a strong track record of diverse casting among both regular and guest cast . freema agyeman became the first black companion and noel clarke starred in a major role for five years -lsb- mickey smith -rsb- . ` reflecting the diversity of the uk is a duty of the bbc , and casting on doctor who is colour-blind . it is always about the best actors for the roles . ' doctor who and raceedited by lindy orthia , is published by intellect books and is priced at # 19.95 . an ebook version is available .", "summary": " group of academics have criticised dr who 's contempt for ` primitive ' people .   american professor says dr who promotes ' a racial and class nostalgia ' "}
