' she said the twins ' frustration at the situation makes the situation even more heartbreaking . ` it is very difficult and frustrating for them as they do n't understand why they ca n't see any more , or read their favourite books . ` it 's also hard because it 's like having toddlers who can reach anything , so we have to be with them constantly . ` all our efforts are focused on making the most of the time we 've got left .
