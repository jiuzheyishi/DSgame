{"text": "the curtain has n't even opened on netflix 's new dvd-by-mail spin-off company qwikster , and many customers are already walking out . the company recently revised its quarterly projections of net subscribers to show 1 million fewer customers than it had previously expected . much to netflix 's chagrin , folks are realizing that the king of mail-away media is n't the only game in town . we 've taken a look at some of netflix 's -lrb- and qwikster 's -rrb- main competitors , and judged each service accordingly . do the rest offer enough to stand up to the best ? netflix/qwikster . also known as netflix : redux . it 's the same service we know and love , only completely different . faced with massive customer backlash in the wake of a price hike , netflix split itself into two separate companies this week . the streaming service will retain the netflix branding while the dvd-by-mail service will be named qwikster . netflix ceo reed hastings said the split will better serve customers in the long run because each company will be able to better focus on one type of service . netflix pioneered the dvd-by-mail service , creating an entire industry where one did not exist previously . but after serious flux in netflix 's new pricing system -- which split the streaming and dvd mailing services into two separate plans starting at $ 8 a month minimum -- there 's no guarantee the company 's customers will continue to stick around . wired : it 's been around the longest , and is the most familiar service . massive offering of physical mail-away media . new game rental service sounds intriguing . streaming to all ios devices and android smartphones . tired : can you say price increase ? we do n't like paying more money for the same service , and we 're failing to see how splitting the companies in twain is going to benefit consumers . streaming-only service still lacks selection compared to dvd catalog . amazon prime . amazon 's elite-level service launched in 2005 , offering two-day shipping on any of its products to members anywhere in the continental united states and other select countries for a reasonable $ 80 a year . originally meant for those who could n't wait more than 48 hours for their tangible goods , prime expanded in february to offer instant , streaming movie and tv show access to existing prime customers at no added cost . wired : fast shipping on everything amazon ! what other movie service offers that ? lower yearly rate than netflix and qwikster . works with over 100 different web-connected set-top boxes , including the ever-popular roku . tired : smaller media selection compared to other existing services . lacks the dvd rental option that made netflix famous . redbox . redbox made it possible for legions of supermarket shoppers to pick up a movie on the cheap , without having to make multiple stops . instead of leaving the grocery store -lrb- or 7-11 , walgreens or what have you -rrb- with only a tv dinner and a mountain dew in tow , redbox 's 30,000-plus dvd-rental kiosks make sure you wo n't go home alone on a friday night again . wired : cheap , cheap , cheap . dvd rentals average two bucks a pop , with anywhere from 50 to 200 recent titles to select from in each kiosk , updated weekly . game rentals to roll out this year . tired : no streaming service ? bummer . blockbuster . once the dominant force in the media-rental industry , blockbuster has fared horribly over the past few years . after scoffing at netflix 's business model years ago , the big blue-and-gold company filed for bankruptcy last september . however late , blockbuster jumped on the bandwagon with its own netflix clone mail-away service , but with the added advantage of allowing customers to return dvds to brick-and-mortar blockbuster stores . and finally , blockbuster express is a blue-and-gold redbox rip , with kiosks placed in grocery stores and kwik-e-mart 's across the country . wired : the dish network acquisition could mean big things for blockbuster when -lrb- or if -rrb- the companies get a game plan up and running . tired : brick and mortar is slowly dying , so the leg-up blockbuster has on netflix with in-store dvd exchange may soon be moot . ripping off its two major competitors shows a lack of ability to innovate , possibly signifying that the company is still behind the times . hulu plus . at $ 8 a month , hulu plus offers instant streaming access to a wealth of tv shows only a day or so after they 've originally aired . but seriously , if you 're paying a monthly fee , you should n't have to deal with mid-show commercial breaks . that 's the whole point of paying for streaming service , right ? still , i challenge you to find a more comprehensive archive of hell 's kitchen reruns on the web . wired : streaming to all ios devices and some android smartphones and tablets . tons of tv shows that are n't out to rent on dvd . tired : despite taking your $ 8 monthly fee , you still have to sit through asinine commercials .  hundreds ,  not thousands , of movies to choose from . again , no physical media . rights agreements sometimes complicate how many episodes are available for viewing on the site . android market . google has struggled to keep up with apple in its media service offerings , only recently debuting its movie rental service on the android market in conjunction with a complete interface makeover . fortunately , renting flicks from google is available on all android devices running version 2.2 and up -- that 's something even hulu ca n't say . wired : rental ai n't pricey , averaging around two to five bucks a pop . streaming to android phones is nice . compatible with pcs . tired : no physical media . not functional across all android tablets . itunes and apple tv . there 's a down-payment to get apple tv up and running in your home , and it 's in the form of a small , sleek set-top box . fortunately , it 's only $ 100 . along with netflix compatibility , apple lets you purchase and rent movies from its itunes media store , along with the ability to buy tv shows -lrb- due to lack of customer demand , apple discontinued tv show rentals last month -rrb- . further , you 're able to watch streaming media on all of apple 's mobile devices . the company wants to hook you into an apple-centric world , and the interconnection between its services makes it easier for customers to buy in . wired : purchase prices are par for the course , ranging from $ 1 to $ 3 depending on whether you want to rent or own . ability to buy entire seasons of a show is convenient . rumors and speculation have long suggested bigger plans for apple tv 's future , though apple itself is staying mum on any potential developments . tired : lacks an  all-you-can-stream buffet  option , which can get costly if you watch a lot of flicks . though its library is extensive , itunes alone does n't contain the esoteric indie films that netflix totes . so if you 're subscribing to netflix and buying through itunes at the same time , charges could add up fast . vudu . wal-mart got in on the media-services game in 2010 by buying vudu , another streaming media company . initially the service was available only in a set-top box version , but vudu has since extended itself to other platforms as a standalone media service in and of itself , available to playstation 3 users , boxee for osx owners and windows-based pc users . wired : rentals and purchases stay on par with most other services , settling in the $ 1 to $ 5 range for rentals , and upwards of $ 5 for purchases . titles available the same day they 're released on dvd , unlike other services that require waiting periods . streaming video available on ipad . tired : no monthly unlimited movie-streaming option .", "summary": " amazon prime launched in 2005 , offering two-day shipping on any of its products .   redbox made it possible for legions of supermarket shoppers to pick up a movie on the cheap .   at $ 8 a month , hulu plus offers instant streaming access to a wealth of tv shows .
