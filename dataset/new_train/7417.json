{"text": "we were walking home together when my ten-year-old daughter told me she had eaten a cake at school that day . this perhaps unremarkable statement left me overjoyed because , throughout her life , molly has lived with a potentially life-threatening milk allergy . holy cow : a cow 's milk allergy is extremely common , affecting up to 8 % of children , including ten-year-old molly . molly 's allergy was so severe that she could not manage anything containing even the tiniest amount of milk , such as a regular sandwich with butter or an ordinary biscuit . for years we had been among hundreds of thousands of british families meticulously planning allergen-free lives . in our case this meant dairy-free meals and hunting for alternatives to milk-based treats . at birthday parties , molly could n't touch any of the cake , but would have to take her own box of dairy-free food . we 'd pack soya milk cartons for holidays abroad . restaurants were the hardest , when she would scour the dessert menu hoping for something she could eat . i 'd normally have to shake my head and promise her an alternative at home . molly was always incredibly accepting and mature about it . a cow 's milk allergy is extremely common , affecting up to 8 per cent of children and usually developing in the first year of life . this means it can be difficult to diagnose because many of the symptoms , such as reflux and diarrhoea , are common during infancy , explains dr david luyt , a consultant paediatrician at leicester royal infirmary . ` on average , it takes three months and six visits to the gp before a milk allergy is diagnosed , ' he says . diagnosis is based on a skin prick test - a small amount of the suspected allergen is inserted under the skin with a tiny needle and raised , red skin is a sign of allergy . milking it : by having small doses of foods made with milk , molly was eventually able to overcome her allergy . there is also a blood test to check levels of the antibodies which trigger an allergic reaction and a ` food challenge ' - when food containing the suspected allergen is given in the controlled environment of the hospital . but for us , the diagnosis was unequivocal and unforgettable . molly was breastfed , so her first taste of dairy was from formula milk mixed with baby rice when she was six months old . she had three spoonfuls and screamed . her face quickly began to swell . by the time i had dialled 999 , molly 's left eye had disappeared under the swelling . an ambulance took us to a&e at birmingham children 's hospital where she was given a dose of adrenaline - this reduces inflammation and swelling in the throat , opening the airways and easing the itching . a blood test confirmed she had a severe allergy . an allergic reaction happens when antibodies become over-sensitive and attack the proteins in certain foods . these antibodies then bind themselves to the allergen and cause the release of chemicals , including histamine , which triggers swelling , itching , rashes and tightening of the airways . in extreme cases , it can cause anaphylactic shock , with severe swelling , breathing difficulties and sometimes loss of consciousness . ' a food allergy , particularly to milk , which is in so many foods , has a massive impact upon a child and their family , ' says dr scott hackett , consultant paediatrician in allergy at heartlands hospital , birmingham . one study of 40 children , half with a food allergy and half with diabetes , found those with food allergies reported more fear about their health and eating , and more restrictions on their life overall . when it came to molly 's brother samuel , now seven , we avoided giving him any dairy products for his first year . we were overjoyed when , aged one , he had a blood test which showed his risk of milk allergy was very low . he has eaten freely since . with the help of my husband , dave , 46 , a communications manager , i found we could make dairy-free cake and obtain dairy-free ice cream for molly . her annual hospital tests showed little change in the allergy . the tests checked her levels of ige antibodies which trigger an allergic reaction . a normal reading is 0 to 6 - at the age of six , molly 's result was 78 , slightly higher than when she was younger . ` she had three spoonfuls and screamed . her face quickly began to swell . by the time i had dialled 999 , molly 's . left eye had disappeared under the swelling . ' most children do grow out of their milk allergies - with about 80 per cent becoming fully tolerant by school age . it 's thought this is due to a natural reduction in the ige antibodies , and a rise in igg4 , which blocks the antibodies from binding to the allergen . ` we used to say 90 per cent will grow out of a milk allergy by school age , but we 're now seeing a growing number of children whose allergy persists longer , sometimes beyond age ten , ' says dr hackett . this seems particularly the case for children with more severe milk allergies . even eight months ago , molly became itchy after mistakenly having a few spoonfuls of porridge made with cow 's milk . but a new scheme could offer these children an alternative to a life spent anxiously avoiding dairy . dr luyt has established the uk 's first cow 's milk tolerance system , which manipulates the immune system to actually cure the allergy . it 's an approach more widely used in europe and the u.s. and based on immunotherapy , a long-established treatment for hay fever sufferers . ` the principle is if you give someone very small doses of the allergen , very slowly building it up over time , their sensitivity to it will decrease , ' says dr luyt . the programme is for children with a milk allergy which has persisted to the age of six . they start by having a drink which is 1 per cent milk to 99 per cent water . the dose is incrementally increased over 67 consecutive days up to full cow 's milk . so far 50 patients have completed the course , with 23 completely overcoming their allergy and nine developing partial tolerance - for example , they could eat cake made with butter , because the milk proteins have been partially broken down during baking . ` we 've worked with children who had really severe milk allergies who went on to develop full tolerance , ' says dr luyt . beating the allergy : molly 's experience and dr luyt 's scheme demonstrate it is possible to cure the allergy . ` it can be challenging for them - children usually have tingling lips and sometimes suffer nausea and vomiting . ` but this has enormous implications because it means we can offer families more than avoiding the allergy or hoping their child will outgrow it . ' the one-third for whom it does not work are not necessarily the ones with the strongest allergies . some struggle with the side-effects of the programme , such as nausea and mild sickness , and do not complete it . a similar programme exists for nut allergy sufferers at addenbrooke 's hospital , cambridge , and uk experts are likely to follow colleagues in mainland europe and japan in setting up a tolerance programme for egg allergies . but in her own way , molly had already stumbled across the approach by herself . last year during breakfast , she mistakenly had a piece of toast with butter . she kept quiet , but came into the kitchen ten minutes later , asking whether the toast had butter on and grinning broadly as we realised it had . ` nothing happened , mum , ' she said . we were both excited about what this could mean . she later tried cheese-flavoured crisps , and then a teaspoon of dairy ice cream . the second caused her lips to tingle , but she said it was ` ok because it will go away soon ' . she had recognised the familiar symptoms of an allergic reaction , but also had the confidence to sense they were mild and temporary . if anything , i had a greater fear of molly eating foods containing milk than she did . and molly became increasingly determined to overcome her restrictive diet . once she had eaten dairy ice cream several times , the lip tingling disappeared . soon , there was nothing on the ` forbidden ' list . by the time molly tried a cake at school , she 'd eaten enough similar food at home to give her the confidence to go ahead . the time from molly 's first taste of butter through to full tolerance was less than three months . we had not heard of dr luyt 's programme , but its principles reflected much of what i 'd witnessed with molly - motivation is important , as is confidence that symptoms can be handled and that the allergy can be overcome . but dr hackett warns people with allergies to avoid trying known allergens at home without supervision . ` there can be severe and even life-threatening reactions and we see this particularly with teenagers , who are fed up with a restrictive diet , ' he says . watching molly tuck into her first ever ice cream on the beach on holiday recently , it seemed as if a miracle had occurred . moving to an unrestricted diet is surely something which , if possible , should happen for children sooner rather than later .", "summary": " a cow 's milk allergy affects up to 8 % of children , including molly .   last year , molly overcame her potentially life-threatening allergy .   she introduced small doses of the allergen to decrease her sensitivity .   this approach is also used by new schemes that can cure the allergy .
