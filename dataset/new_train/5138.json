{"text": "message : care minister norman lamb says that some pensioners have a dismal existence and britain must build a less neglectful society . neglect by families and neighbours is to blame for elderly people having to endure dismal lives in care homes , the minister in charge of social care has said . norman lamb said older britons could lead independent lives at home , if only they had more support from relatives . instead , many are never visited at home and are ` pushed ' into care , mr lamb said . the lib dem mp 's comments came as age uk warned it was ` critical ' that legislation was introduced to improve the lives of older people . mr lamb 's criticism of ` neglectful ' families was met by an angry response from labour , which accused the coalition minister of dismissing the many carers who voluntarily look after loved ones . the minister urged local authorities to rebuild ` neighbourly resilience ' to stop old people leading lonely lives , instead of expecting the state to ` do everything ' . this would also reduce the burden on the state as fewer people would need to be housed in residential care . mr lamb said : ` we all have a part to play . ` in this way , we can make the system sustainable , and it can be a more decent society , a less neglectful society than we sometimes experience where we just expect the state to do everything . ' he suggested that more could be done to stop the elderly from going in to homes . ` the system pushes them there , ' he said . ` the system does not do enough to help them maintain their independence . ' mr lamb added : ` with the right support and the right community resilience , and a rebuilding of the neighbour support that used to be there , more people could stay in their own homes for longer . ' britain had ` lost the extended family because families have become dispersed ' , he said . ` if someone is living on their own never seeing anyone , that is a dismal existence , and it often ends up with it all collapsing and them going into a care home . ` give them support , some companionship , and help them maintain activity in mind and body and everyone benefits . ' he suggested that more councils should follow the example of leeds , where elderly people are given grants so that they can adapt their homes to stay living in them independently . liz kendall , labour 's spokesman for care and older people said : ` britain 's six million unpaid family carers are n't being neglectful of their loved ones and they do n't expect the state to do everything -- far from it . ` they look after their frail elderly and disabled relatives day in day out , often with precious little help and support . ` instead of blaming families for the care crisis , the government should be facing up to its responsibilities by putting in place a decent and fair system for funding social care now and in future . ' mr lamb also confirmed that the government would announce a cap on care fees , expected to be around # 75,000 , above which the state will pay . warning : the elderly are ending up in care too easily people should be more ` neighbourly ' so they can stay in their own homes , mr lamb said . however , he warned that the new . funding agreement was ` not a panacea ' and ` does not remove all financial . pressures ' as people would still have to pay for the accommodation . component of living in a care home . currently , anyone with assets of more than # 23,500 faces unlimited charges . critics warn that with middle-class . couples facing a total outlay of as much as # 200,000 , many elderly . people may still be forced to sell their homes even with the new cap . age uk urged the government to adopt new legislation in order to improve the lives of the elderly . the campaign group called for a flat basic state pension and for older people in care to be treated with dignity . the call for action by the government . follows a recent report by a commission looking into dignity in care . which said old people were patronised in care homes and often treated as . a medical condition rather than as a person . in a statement , age uk said : ` we must . make sure older people are supported to live happy and healthy lives . through equal access to appropriate prevention , treatment and . rehabilitation services . ` we need to work together to ensure that they are supported to meet their aspirations and to live rewarding later lives .
