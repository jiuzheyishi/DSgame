{"text": "almost half of boys and one in five girls in jordan 's capital city , amman , believe that killing a woman who has  dishonored ,  or shamed , her family is justifiable , a study of teenagers ' attitudes published thursday revealed . a third of all teenagers involved in the study by researchers at britain 's cambridge university advocated so-called honor murders . exclusive : how my brother tried to kill me in ` honor attack ' a key finding was that support for honor crimes was not connected to religious beliefs , but is far more likely in adolescent boys with low education backgrounds from traditional families . professor manuel eisner and cambridge graduate student lana ghuneim interviewed more than 850 teenagers , with an average age of 15 , for the study , published in the journal aggressive behavior . disappearance , then discovery leads to ` honor killing ' outrage . honor crimes can include physical assaults , rape , acid attacks and disfigurement , as well as murder . they can be triggered by a range of acts thought to bring shame on the family , from premarital sex to adultery to pregnancy outside marriage , or even contact by the woman with a man who is not a relation . the researchers say their study is one of the first to attempt to gauge cultural attitudes about honor murders in the region . it found that attitudes in support of honor murders  are anchored in a broader system of beliefs about patriarchal authority and dominance , and assumptions about female virginity and chastity .  this means that any attempt to change views would probably need to tackle the broader cultural support for patriarchal dominance , it said . ` honor ' crime : why just kissing a boy can trigger murder . in total , 33.4 % of all those surveyed either  agreed  or  strongly agreed  with situations depicting honor killings . boys were more than twice as likely to support honor killings : 46.1 % of boys and 22.1 % of girls agreed with at least two honor killing situations in the questionnaire . about six in 10 teenagers from the lowest level of educational background showed supportive attitudes towards honor killing , as opposed to about one in five where at least one family member has a university degree . teenagers who had a large number of siblings were more likely to condone honor killings than those from smaller families , the study found . belief blog : islam does n't justify ` honor murders , ' experts insist .  while we found the main demographic in support of hka -lrb- honor killing attitudes -rrb- to be boys in traditional families with low levels of education , we noted substantial minorities of girls , well-educated and even irreligious teenagers who consider honor killing morally right , suggesting a persisting society-wide support for the tradition ,  said eisner .  any meaningful attempt to reduce attitudes in support of such practices requires a broader societal commitment , including coherent messages against honor-related violence from political and religious elites , and decisive action by the criminal justice system .  jordan has a long traditional of honor crimes , the researchers note , although it has taken steps in recent years to pass stricter laws against the practice . until 2001 , an article of the jordanian penal code stated that a man who  catches his wife , or one of his female close relatives committing adultery with another , and he kills wounds or injures one or both of them , is exempt from any penalty .  in line with new legislation passed since then , a special court was set up in 2009 to prosecute honor crimes , the researchers say . but their study indicates attitudes are not necessarily changing in line with new legislation , even in a younger generation .", "summary": " researchers look at attitudes about  honor  murders among teenagers in amman , jordan .   a third of more than 850 teenagers surveyed believe honor killings are justifiable .   study : support is  anchored in a broader system of beliefs about patriarchal authority    teenage boys with low education backgrounds are more likely to condone honor killings .
