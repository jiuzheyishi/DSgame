{"text": "myra hindley 's crimes so shocked the nation that they became the benchmark by which other acts of evil were measured . but behind bars the moors murderer set about a rigorous course of self-improvement , secret files reveal . she wanted to transform herself from a ` brassy blonde ' to an ` intelligent , well - educated woman with middle-class values ' . self-improvement : moors murderer myra hindley turned herself from a ` brassy blonde ' to an ` intelligent , well-educated woman ' and even earned an open university degree , pictured right . she took up hobbies including badminton and making tapestries , ` threw herself with enthusiasm into the choir ' and won a music prize for a love song . prison papers describe the child killer as an ` extremely meticulous person ... even obsessive ' , with one governor noting : ` her room is always tidy and very clean . ' but prison officials continued to regard hindley suspiciously as an ` arch - manipulator ' and a ` scheming woman ' who was ` cold and calculating ' , ` devoid of emotion ' and should not be trusted , the files show . with her lover and partner in crime ian brady , hindley was responsible for the murders of five children in the 1960s . they were lured to their deaths , sexually tortured and buried on saddleworth moor near manchester . evil : ian brady who killed five children with myra hindley between july 1963 and october 1965 . hindley died in 2002 aged 60 and her confidential files were supposed to have remained secret for another 50 years . but they have been released early to the national archives owing to the huge interest in her life . tom clark , a sheffield university lecturer , has spent three years studying them . the boxes of typed reports and handwritten notes fill more than 30ft of shelf space and give a unique picture of hindley as seen through the eyes of fellow prisoners , welfare workers , probation officers , warders and chaplains . hindley became a practising roman catholic and dedicated student , earning an open university degree in humanities . ` myra hindley is a young woman of superior intellect and academic ability , ' wrote one observer . and her ability to soak up information was undoubtedly aided by an amazing gift . she has ` almost total recall of the spoken and written word ' , said one assessment . her tutor recalled how she sat o-level german and once out of the examination room ` wrote the entire paper out again from memory so that i could go through it and assess her chances ' . hindley was jailed for life in may 1966 for the murders of lesley ann downey , ten , and edward evans , 17 , plus being accessory to the murder of 12-year-old john kilbride by brady . in 1987 hindley and brady confessed to murdering pauline reade , 16 , and keith bennett , 12 . despite her criminal notoriety she had a ` very conscientious ' attitude towards her jobs in jail and was put in charge of the kitchen on e wing at holloway prison in north london . her view that she was better than her fellow inmates quickly became obvious . ` myra is fundamentally a very arrogant woman and considers herself superior to the other members of her wing , ' said a 1968 report . she revelled in her celebrity status and put herself as being among the ` elite ' lifers . for christmas dinner in 1969 she and another lifer refused to join the others ` through feelings of superiority ' . and ten years into her sentence it was noted after a routine cell change how she would gather several ` sycophants who will do all the cleaning , fetching and carrying she has become accustomed to ' . however , most of the time she got on well with fellow inmates , despite her reputation . victims : pauline reade , 16 , left , was their first victim and john kilbride was killed in 1963 . murdered : lesley ann downey , 10 , left , and edward evans , 17 , right . twelve-year-old keith benett was abducted on his way to visit his grandmother in manchester on 16 june 1964 . his body has never been found . ` women have confessed their horror on learning they were to join a wing with myra on it , only to admit later what a pleasant and easy woman she was to get on with . ' one prisoner subjected to an unprovoked attack while serving tea wrote to the governor to praise hindley . ` i owed a special thanks to inmate m hindley who literally threw herself between the attacker and myself whilst i was being kicked , ' she said . ` due to this unselfish assistance she suffered blows and kicks that were meant for me . ' as far back as 1974 the prison governor , who had hour-long monthly chats with hindley , was sufficiently impressed to suggest a ` target date ' be set so that ` parole should be a practical possibility ' . by 1977 hindley 's obsession with course work -- tackling subjects as diverse as the age of revolution , the 19th century novel and its legacy , and 20th century poetry -- meant she put on weight through lack of exercise . after hindley was transferred to durham prison , a tutor remained sceptical about her motives for self education , saying : ` her outside contacts and studies are convincing her she is more able than i think she is . i admire the way she refuses to allow herself to become a cabbage . but i do not trust her . ` she often appears to me to be a scheming woman , building up contacts with anyone she thinks has influence . ' by 1981 , a report concluded : ` she has changed from the brassy blonde of more than 16 years ago to the current picture of an intelligent , well-educated woman who possesses some taste and whose views seem culturally more attuned to middle-class values . ' yet she never lost the ability to manipulate others . jailed : hindley was put in charge of the kitchen on e wing at holloway prison in north london and died in 2002 at highpoint prison , suffolk . ` she was cold and calculating and devoid of emotion , able to smile or cry as the need arose .

' hindley was transferred to highpoint prison , suffolk , in 1998 and spent her final years in ` unofficial segregation ' with a television , video recorder and word processor in her single room . she pursued a long campaign for parole which was always denied her by the courts and the home secretary .", "summary": " prison papers about myra hindley released early to national archives .   killer became ` intelligent , well-educated woman ' and did humanities degree .   officials continued to regard her as an ` arch-manipulator ' and ` scheming '   she and lover ian brady killed and tortured five children in the 1960s .   bodies of victims were then buried on saddleworth moor near manchester .
