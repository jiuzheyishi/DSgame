{"text": "charleston , south carolina a dog 's life is fairly easy . it usually involves waking up late , eating some food and then passing out for eight hours in the backyard . i 've tried it a few times , myself . was n't disappointed . the rest of a dog 's day is generally spent whizzing on various plants and mindlessly staring at things that pass by the house . again , i 've dabbled in the lifestyle . and i approve . but there 's this one dog in charleston , south carolina , who just seems to have it better than most . and i recently got to meet her . i first learned of belle when i saw a popular picture of her on the website reddit . it was posted in a section called  aww  that is dedicated to all things cute and adorable -- puppies , bunnies , canadians doing canadian things in canada . the photo showed belle staring out from under a gate , and the title read : waiting for his family to return in charleston , sc -lsb- oc -rsb- . it got dozens of comments . in reddit parlance , -lsb- oc -rsb- means original content , which is to say the individual who posted the image actually created it . this was helpful when it came to tracking down the whereabouts of this dog -lrb- who we now know is actually a female -rrb- . you see , i was going to charleston over thanksgiving and was looking for a pointless adventure -- something that would take me to a particular part of town i may not have otherwise seen . and i figured trying to find this dog from reddit was as good enough an adventure as any . so , i messaged the guy who took the photograph and learned that his name is carlos morales , 31 , of gainesville , florida . carlos and his girlfriend , nia haynes , were driving home from vacation and decided to stop and spend the night in charleston . while wandering around the historic neighborhoods near the battery , carlos stumbled upon belle .  he seemed like the kind of dog quite used to this routine ,  carlos wrote me .  but not anxious about his family returning . just slightly forlorn .  carlos did n't know the exact location of the house , but he sent me a link to an approximate street view on google maps . eventually , i sorted out the actual address on my own , thus exhausting my brain 's entire lifetime supply of deductive reasoning . i treated myself to a nap . finally , on the saturday after thanksgiving , i walked up to belle 's house and knocked on the old door leading into the courtyard . mind you , this kind of bold , unsolicited introduction is the kind of thing you can do when you 're a serious journalist hoping to write a fluff piece on somebody 's dog . otherwise , it 's sort of creepy . though , to be fair , even with my cnn business card in hand , it was still probably kind of creepy . i 'm a mouth breather . nevertheless , frank barnwell politely greeted me at the door along with belle , who was carrying a boot in her mouth . it was frank 's boot . which is to say , it was now belle 's . her official name is belle de la lumiÃ ¨ re . in french that translates to belle of the light . i learned she was actually born on new year 's eve 2002 , just around the corner from frank 's home . this year she turns 11 . and speaking of 11 , that was the exact number of yellow lab puppies in her litter . belle was the runt . frank 's daughter , sally , was friends with one of the children who lived around the corner from where belle was born . the mother of the friend called up frank 's wife and said ,  i hate to tell you this , but sally 's fallen in love with one of our puppies .  frank says ,  we knew our goose was cooked .  and right as he told me this , just like clockwork , sally suddenly emerged through the courtyard door , returning from a jog . sally , a history student at the university of virginia , remembers first meeting belle , and that most of the puppies were named after characters from the hit tv show ,  friends .  which , sadly , means somebody out there has a dog named ross . but when the breeders ran out of  friends  characters , they started using disney names . belle , being the runt , was originally called tinker bell . and names are important . if you 've ever adopted a dog you know how influential they can be . my dog is mikey , and when i first found him online and saw his name , i figured it was a sign . i 'm a big fan of the band widespread panic , and their late guitarist also went by mikey . clearly , it was meant to be . of course , mikey -lrb- my dog -rrb- was also really cute . so , at the time , i pretty much could 've justified any name .  this is polio .   i 'll take him .  but belle seems to fit this particular dog quite nicely , and these days she spends most of her time in the courtyard of the historic 200-year-old house , looking out at tourists walking down the street . it 's pretty much her job . and , though she only recently earned a bit of internet fame on reddit , it 's certainly not the first time belle has come under the lens . frank says ,  literally almost every day i see somebody taking a picture of her with her nose under the gate .  in the south of broad neighborhood of charleston , belle is sort of a big deal . everybody knows her , and she 's an important member of the community . in fact , belle recently escaped from the yard during the annual turkey day run 5k , and , just like a local , simply joined all the joggers running down king street . another time , she got out of the yard and spent the entire day riding around in a pedicab .  the guy had her in the back and was trying to figure out where she belonged ,  sally remembers .  i do n't think she wanted to come back . she made a friend .  frank chimes in ,  belle likes all dogs and most people .  just do n't take her boot . follow @jarrettbellini on twitter .",
