{"text": "sex advice : dr marie stopes , the author of married love which published in 1918 , was an instant bestseller and reprinted 39 times in the next seven years . deeply embarrassed yet clearly keen to make a success of his marriage , the anonymous correspondent plucked up the courage to ask for advice on a delicate matter : how to make love to his wife . ` for the first four months of our married life i did not know that it was necessary to move my body in any way , ' he wrote . ` we only know of the one positions -lsb- sic -rsb- in which my wife is underneath . . . now can you tell me of alternate positions and also is my wife supposed to move about ? ' the letter was one of many sent to marie stopes , the birth-control pioneer and author of married love , a manual with information on physical intimacy that emphasised how husbands should endeavour to satisfy their wives rather than merely expecting them to put up with ` it ' . the book , published in 1918 , was an instant bestseller and reprinted 39 times in the next seven years . young couples and those who had been married for years devoured it . though erotic novels had long been in circulation , practical advice for ` normal ' couples was non-existent . brides went into marriage woefully ignorant of what to expect , while their bridegrooms were very often equally naive . when stopes asked her readers to write to her with evidence to support her theory that women had a ` cycle ' of desire -- feeling more amorous at certain times of the month than others -- she was inundated with thousands of letters from men and women desperate for information about sex . the act of ` married love ' did not come naturally for many , and they were acutely aware of their failings . some of the letters are touchingly naive , others heart-breaking . other men and women were writing letters sharing their sexual experiences , fantasies and bizarre proclivities to magazines such as london life . these were published alongside racy pictures of chorus girls disrobing . an american academic has unearthed these letters to stopes and the risqué magazines , drawing on them for an intriguing new book about british sex lives between the wars and how people communicated their sexual problems and desires . while victorian marriages had been largely about wives submitting to husbands -- in the bedroom and elsewhere -- by the twenties many men and women -lrb- at least among the middle classes -rrb- wanted a more equal relationship . but they 'd been raised by victorian parents reluctant to broach such a distasteful subject , so often had no idea how to do it . this was where stopes stepped in . she had been entirely ignorant about sex before she married . highly educated though she was -lrb- she had a doctorate in botany -rrb- , it was not until several years into her marriage that she stumbled across a description of sex in a library book and realised she had never experienced it . in 1916 she obtained a divorce on the grounds her marriage had not been consummated -- a claim her husband furiously denied -- and set about trying to dispel the ignorance that had led her and , she surmised , many others to miss out on this vital part of marriage . the reception of married love proved her right . though the church , press and medical establishment were outraged -lrb- couched though it was in coy euphemisms -rrb- , ordinary couples fell on it eagerly , using it as a guide to navigate their way through territory as bewildering as another planet . cheeky : edwardian magazines printed revealing shots , left , while marie stopes book , published in 1918 , revolutionised sex for married couples , right . one woman wrote that her husband , despite having a biology degree from cambridge , was clueless as to the geography of the female body , and they 'd been unable to achieve ` union ' . after studying the book , they pinpointed the vital location and ` eventually were successful ' . not all sexual impasses could be resolved so happily . the war had left many men with physical injuries that made sex impossible . others suffered mental trauma that inhibited them . one young man wrote to stopes that he had been wounded three times during the war , the last time in both legs . he had suffered shell shock and two nervous breakdowns but had recovered -- or so he thought -- sufficiently to get married in 1925 . sadly , he had been unable to consummate the marriage on honeymoon , and the experience was so off-putting for his wife that she lost all desire for him . other men with disabilities worried that their inadequacy would cause the wives to have nervous breakdowns . they were mortified and felt ` selfish and mean ' or ` like a cad ' for being unable to fulfil their role . perhaps some feared their wives would seek sex elsewhere , like constance in d. h. lawrence 's novel lady chatterley 's lover . for other men , the war had provided an outlet for sexual preferences they had n't been aware of . a sapper wrote to london life of how , while taking part in morale-boosting theatrical performances , he 'd discovered he loved dressing in women 's clothes . one man claimed happy memories of cross-dressing sustained him during a long recuperation from war wounds . most refused to see their penchant as effeminate . one man who liked wearing female underwear wrote robustly : ` nothing namby-pamby in that ! ' the era also saw the rise of the sporty girl , who cast off the corsets and stays worn by her mother 's generation and enjoyed hiking and tennis . some saw the rise of these modern women as deeply worrying , but for others the image of girls wrestling or boxing was a source of admiration and titillation . magazines such as london life obliged by running reports of such matches accompanied by photos of semi-naked girls in the wrestling or boxing ring . one woman , calling herself sporty wife , wrote many letters to london life , sending readers ' pulses racing with descriptions of her underwear . in response to multiple requests , she sent in her photo and it was printed . but her fans were disappointed by the disparity between the curvaceous figure she had described and the reality . one wrote in describing himself as ` sadly disillusioned ' . in need of help : some men turned to marie stopes 's book because they were worried that their wife might take a lover like constance in lady chatterley 's lover . magazines with deceptively anodyne titles catered to more risqué tastes . englishwoman 's domestic magazine , for instance , was all about whipping . novels were a source of information and titillation . in 1919 , nearly a century before suburban housewife e. l. james wrote fifty shades of grey , e. m. hull , a pig farmer 's wife from derbyshire , published the sheik -- a romantic novel about an englishwoman who is kidnapped in the desert by a sheik and spends months being sexually dominated by him until they fall in love . the bestseller was made into a hit film starring rudolph valentino . people who wanted something more raunchy could visit certain bookshops in london , though the national vigilance association and london public morality council would alert the police if the material being sold was too explicit . -lrb- presumably , these moral guardians had to read them thoroughly first in order to make such a judgment . -rrb- . many people preferred to get erotic literature from mail-order companies that would deliver it in brown paper . most consumers were middle class , as were marie stopes ' correspondents -- at least those concerned about sexual pleasure . the working classes , if they could write , tended to have more practical concerns : they wanted information about birth control . their mothers were equally reluctant to enlighten them about the facts of life as those in the middle classes . one young woman from lancashire believed that ` if a lad kissed yer , you 'd be having a baby ' . such innocence seems a world away from our own , rather more sexually confident age . making modern love -- sexual narratives and identities in interwar britain by lisa z. sigel -lrb- temple university press , # 18.99 -rrb- .", "summary": " birth control pioneer marie stopes gave sex advice to men in her book married love .
