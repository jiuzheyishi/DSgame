{"text": "former arkansas governor and presidential hopeful mike huckabee sparked outrage across the country this week for his offensive remarks about women and birth control . but the real problem is n't what he says -- it 's what he and too many other politicians believe , and it 's the policies they would advance if they have the chance . in a speech to the republican national committee , huckabee said that it was wrong to give women access to no-co-pay birth control under the affordable care act -- that by doing so , women were being told  they are helpless without uncle sugar coming in and providing for them a prescription each month for birth control because they can not control their libido or their reproductive system without the help of government .  of the thousands of types of medical care covered by insurance companies -- somehow he and a lot of other politicians have focused like a laser on birth control -- on taking coverage away from women . indeed , huckabee 's remarks were no  gaffe ,  as too many pundits have called them . this is a speech he 's made before , and his remarks are a look inside the playbook of politicians who appear to have no idea how birth control works and why it 's so important to millions of women as a basic , preventive health care . they ignore the fact that women use birth control for a whole host of medical reasons -- and that 's their business , not mike huckabee 's . in huckabee 's vision , every boss in america would be empowered to decide whether his or her female employees should have access to birth control the way they do for any other prescription medication . huckabee is joining a battle being waged cross the country . over 40 for-profit companies have filed lawsuits against the birth control benefit of the affordable care act , and the supreme court will hear arguments in two of those cases in march . if the court rules in favor of the for-profit companies , employers for the first time ever could have the right to dictate to their employees the type of health care they may have access to . meanwhile , 20 state legislatures have moved to exempt certain employers and insurers from allowing their employees access to birth control without a co-pay . in kansas , pharmacists are allowed to refuse to fill a prescription for birth control if they have a moral objection -- even if there 's no other pharmacist in the area that a woman can go to instead . and while the states are individually waging separate battles , on the national front the u.s. house of representatives approved an amendment a few months ago to roll back the birth control benefit . the politicians behind these moves disregard how important birth control is for women and families . it allows women to take control of their health and economic security and to take personal responsibility for their family planning decisions . many women also need birth control for medical reasons . for example , it can help relieve painful menstrual cramps , and help avert infertility by addressing the symptoms of endometriosis . access to birth control is also an economic issue . until now , the cost has been expensive , with many women paying an average of $ 600 a year -- but sometimes much more -- for contraceptive protection . the affordable care act enables 27 million women to receive their prescription birth control without a co-pay . birth control also allows women , who make up nearly two-thirds of minimum-wage workers , to remain in the labor force . for a woman working for minimum wage at a retail store , or for tips at a restaurant , the birth control benefit is tremendously important . for many women , it means the difference between taking birth control regularly and not being able to -- between getting pregnant and not getting pregnant . as we look toward the midterm elections later this year , it 's increasingly clear that access to birth control will be on the ballot . mike huckabee 's remarks this week underscore what 's at stake -- and why women will not allow out-of-touch politicians to take us back to the 1950s .", "summary": " cecile richards : mike huckabee caused uproar with clueless comments about birth control .   he said women told they need goverrnment  uncle sugar  to pay for their birth control .   richards : his words show political agenda to deny women contraceptive coverage .   richards : birth control key in women 's lives , health . next election , issue will be in balance .
