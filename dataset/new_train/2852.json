{"text": "there was a time when my biggest fear was getting my brain munched by zombies . but that childhood fright of halloweens past has given way to a scare that often grips me as a journalist today -- the fear of failure . alright , i know i 'm not alone here . many of you know exactly what i 'm talking about . it 's those moments of workplace indecision , avoidance , or perhaps procrastination all due to the simple fear of making a mistake on the job . so when i sat down with trend micro chief eva chen for cnn 's  leading women ,  i made sure to hit the topic . you see , just months into her job as ceo of the company , she had to manage through an episode of failure . make that , monstrous failure . in 2005 , one of the company 's signature files caused computers worldwide to crash . the effects were so far-reaching , the bug even forced ever-timely trains in japan to grind to a halt . did that epic fail make chen doubt herself or her ability to be the ceo ? not at all . instead , she focused on a solution .  there were two problems i tried to address ,  she tells me .  one is external -- how do i help the system quickly recover ? my customers ' businesses need to continue .  the second one is internal : how do i make sure that the values of trend micro -- innovation and ` dare to fail ' -- really stayed .  chen says the lessons learned from that mistake helped propel trend micro from a player in traditional antivirus software to the forefront of cloud computing protection . a company philosophy at trend micro reads as follows :  we drive our growth by innovation ; we encourage risk-taking and our management style dares you to fail .  that call to embrace failure , like firewalking or  trust falls  at a corporate retreat , can reek of management malarkey . but chen is a leader who sincerely takes it to heart . to this day , she still does n't know which employee was responsible for the faulty file that crashed computers across the planet . nor does she ever want to know . risk-taking and fear management came early in her career when chen founded the company in 1988 with her brother-in-law , steve chang , and sister , jenny chang . cold-calling potential customers , she found herself reluctant and afraid to speak on the phone . to address her phobia , chen mined her memories and rediscovered a moment in early childhood when her mother was speaking on the telephone just as lightning struck a tree that fell inside their home and set ablaze the phone 's wiring .  the impression just made me feel that the telephone line would kill my mom ,  chen tells me .  so something that you never expect -- that image from my childhood -- actually became an obstacle when i tried to do business .  chen says once she identified that fear , it went away .  every time you overcome one obstacle , you feel you 've learned something and you grow . that 's the joy of entrepreneurship and taking challenges .  so what is the one obstacle that is holding all of us back ? did you ever turn down a challenging assignment because the depressive realist inside said you could n't do it ? -lrb- i know i have . -rrb- . how many times have you failed to truly speak your mind at a meeting ? -lrb- guilty . many times over . -rrb- . instead of sitting on our hands , we should raise them high and dare to ask that question , make that assertion , or take on that new challenge . like eva chen , we must lean into our fear to conquer it .", "summary": " eva chen is ceo of trend micro -- a japanese software security company .   within months of becoming ceo , a bug caused worldwide problems for the business .   chen turned mishap into opportunity , turned company into cloud computing protection leader .
