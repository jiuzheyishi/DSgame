{"text": "charlotte hutton : ` it gave me financial independence ' school leavers are to be urged to go straight into professional jobs as apprentices without getting a university degree . oxbridge-educated skills minister matthew hancock has announced schemes to throw open the doors of the professions to non-graduates so that teenagers can train as lawyers , accountants and insurance brokers . he said youngsters who go straight from a-levels into training for high-flying city careers , can immediately receive a salary and many see a faster rise up the career ladder than graduates . mr hancock , who holds degrees from both oxford and cambridge universities , and worked as a bank of england economist before entering politics , said that if he was leaving school today and had the option of an apprenticeship ' i would have considered it ' . auditors and accountants can now train straight from school at the professional services giant pricewaterhousecoopers , while a law course for school leavers being designed with bpp , a chain of law schools in eight british cities , is set to begin in september . a scheme for insurance professionals is already up and running which allows them to qualify in three years -- a year ahead of their peers who do a three-year degree and then must do a year of on-the-job training afterwards . mr hancock said : ` the idea is it will allow more people to think , at the age of 18 , if i want to be a lawyer or an accountant i do n't have to go to university to do it . ` instead of three years of an undergraduate degree and a couple of years afterwards , you can qualify as a lawyer quicker and get paid for doing it . ' ` we have started with these three professions but i see this as very much demand-driven and if any other professions come forward i 'm all ears . these apprenticeships reflect the economy how it is now , not how it was 20 years ago . ' however , professor les ebdon , director of the government 's office for fair access , said intelligent , motivated students would be best off going to university . academic study , he told the bbc 's pm programme , would broaden their horizons , hone their writing and debating skills and give them a professional network for life . ` we are trying our best to remove barriers , ' he said . ` if you have the potential , you should look to university . it 's the best career move you can make , and nobody regrets education . ' some professionals such as solicitors used to be able to do all their training on the job without taking a degree , although they still had to obtain professional qualifications . but such apprenticeship-style training was phased out several decades ago . around 500,000 young people a year become apprentices in careers such as engineering and construction . britain 's biggest firms such as bae systems and rolls-royce have large apprenticeship schemes . but mr hancock said the aim was to broaden it out to white collar careers , with a # 25million fund for professional apprenticeships set up by the department for business , innovation and skills . ' i have nothing negative to say about university , you learn an awful lot there , but this gives 18-year-olds more options , and that 's especially important to ensure everyone who is bright has a chance to access the professions , ' he said . ` it 's a paid job -- that 's an important principle . apprenticeships not only mean people are paid while they are learning but they learn faster and learn very practical skills for that job , which raises morale for the apprentice and everyone in the workplace . ' opportunities : mr hancock said a university education ` is not for everyone ' but that all youngsters should have the chance to aim for ` valuable jobs ' in areas such as a law , financial services and engineering . he said social mobility was the main . aim of the scheme , but that apprentices could also be a good ` export . market ' as britain has a strong professional services sector whose . employees are sought after in emerging markets such as china , india and . brazil . from next year firms including kpmg , jaguar land rover , capgemini , ibm and microsoft are planning schemes . jane . bolton , chief operating officer at the national apprenticeship service , . which delivers the schemes , said that in the past year increasing . numbers of high-achieving school leavers have given up university places . for on the job training . ' i . recently visited apprentices at rolls-royce , one of whom gave up a . place at oxford to study maths , ' she said . ` another girl we had works . for bae systems . she got great a-level grades and was destined for . university but decided not to go . ` apprenticeships . are no longer just for crafts and with the cost involved in going to . university , and the attraction of being employed and earning money from . the beginning , it is a serious contender for some young people .
