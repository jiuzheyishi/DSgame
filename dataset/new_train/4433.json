{"text": "the food and drug administration on thursday took a step toward essentially a total ban on artificial trans fats in america 's food supply . this is not a trivial change . not that long ago , trans fats were a part of all kinds of processed foods . partially hydrogenated oils , as they are otherwise known , tend to improve both the shelf life and flavor of many foods . trans fats have been around for more than a hundred years . they 're used in a wide range of foods , from frozen pizza to microwave popcorn to packaged cookies . but trans fats are amazingly bad for you . by the 1990s , evidence was building that trans fats carried a significant risk for increasing coronary heart disease . specifically , they were found not only to increase your level of low-density lipoprotein -lrb- ldl , or bad cholesterol -rrb- but to decrease your level of high-density lipoprotein -lrb- hdl , or good cholesterol -rrb- . because of this , the negative effects of trans fats are about double those of saturated fat -lrb- which is n't that good for you , either -rrb- . it gets worse . trans fats also increase your level of lipoprotein -lrb- a -rrb- and triglycerides , both of which are thought to be associated with cardiovascular disease . these laboratory findings bear out in all kinds of epidemiologic studies showing that a diet containing higher levels of trans fats carried greater health risk than a diet similarly high in saturated fat . there has been a longstanding argument that we should stop using trans fats . the american heart association recommends that people 's diets contain 2 grams or less of trans fats a day . that amount is what you might normally get in dairy products and meat . but if you eat processed foods , you 'll end up consuming more trans fats . in 2006 , the fda started mandating that food labels list the amount of trans fats in foods in order to make consumers aware of their hazard . some companies have made an effort to stay away from trans fats . mcdonalds stopped using them 7 years ago . burger king has a minimal amount in its foods , and that 's from small amounts that are present naturally in meat and cheese . new york banned trans fats in restaurants in 2007 . it was a controversial decision at the time , but consumption of trans fats in the city has dropped dramatically because of the ban . the centers for disease control and prevention says that removing trans fats from the u.s. food supply could prevent about 20,000 heart attacks a year and 7,000 deaths from cardiovascular disease . finally , the fda issued a federal register notice announcing that trans fats are not  generally recognized as safe .  such a notice allows a period of time for people and businesses to comment and offer opinions and evidence if they believe that trans fats should not be banned . of course , there are costs to such a move . the fda estimates that it will cost about $ 8 billion initially to remove trans fats from the food supply . it believes the 20-year costs to be between $ 12 billion and $ 14 billion . i think it 's likely that processed food producers will comply . there 's almost no good evidence -- or argument -- to support the continued use of trans fats . in fact , it 's been reported that some manufacturers have voluntarily lowered the use of trans fats by almost 75 % in the past eight years . given these moves , it 's not hard to imagine them going the rest of the distance . there is some irony in this , of course . trans fats first became more common in our diet because they were believed to be safer than animal fats -lrb- think margarine instead of butter -rrb- . turns out the opposite is true . the fda 's actions are putting us on the road to correcting that mistake , hopefully sooner rather than later .", "summary": " the fda took a first step toward eliminating artificial trans fats in food supply .   aaron carroll : fda made the right move , since trans fats are very bad for people .   he says evidence shows trans fats increase bad cholesterol and heart disease .   carroll : it 's likely food suppliers will comply despite the costs of removing trans fats .
