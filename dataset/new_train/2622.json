{"text": "los angeles , california when i was a child in adelaide , australia , i loved games with clear , unambiguous rules ; puzzles that were tough but fair ; and the clean , abstract , simplicity of numbers and symbols . so it is perhaps not surprising that i have been drawn to mathematics for as long as i can remember . for much of my childhood , playing with mathematical problems , equations and facts was one of my favorite activities ; i even went so far as to compete in international high school mathematics competitions , racing to solve tricky sets of problems in a few hours . i still remember the realization in college at flinders university in australia that mathematics was not just an abstract game of symbols , but could be used as a tool to analyze and understand the modern world . why are some statistics trustworthy and some not ? why are some investment strategies sound , and others risky ? how come a computer can search the entire internet for you in a matter of seconds , but can not read a printed word if it is even just slightly distorted or blurred ? how come our modern array of satellites can tell millions of drivers their location with amazing accuracy , but can not correctly predict the weather a fortnight into the future ? knowledge of mathematics can answer these questions , and make the world comprehensible and orderly rather than mysterious and capricious . once i saw the power of this knowledge , and the satisfying feeling when everything  clicks  and one sees a confusing problem resolve itself into a clear solution , i was hooked for life . i wanted to use mathematics to explore and understand as much of the world as i could . in 1992 , when i was 16 , i moved to the united states to start working on my ph.d. at princeton university in new jersey . i alternated my time between australia and the united states for many years , but by 1999 i had a permanent job in the united states , on the faculty of ucla 's department of mathematics . by 2002 , i was married to an american -- we were married in the united states -- and last year i became a u.s. citizen -lrb- while retaining australian citizenship -rrb- . of course , my life is more than just my work . i am a husband and a father and a proud citizen of two countries ; my homeland of australia and my adopted country here in the united states . i identify with them both . i enjoy a good meal , a good vacation or a good movie , much as anyone else would . but mathematics is both my profession and my hobby , and the place where it seems i am best able to make a contribution ; so if i had to answer the question  who am i ?  i would have to say ,  a mathematician .  the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of terence tao .", "summary": " when he was a boy in australia , terence tao says , he loved games , puzzles , math problems .   once he realized that math could answer questions about the world , he was hooked , he says .   at 16 he came to u.s. to study for ph.d ; split life between u.s. and australia ; married in u.s.   tao : i 'm husband , dad , citizen of both countries now , but my identity is as a mathematician .
