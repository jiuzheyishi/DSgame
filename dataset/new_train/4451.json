{"text": "the first frosts of winter have already dusted the spectacular city of st. petersburg with a powder of glistening ice . the air outside feels sharp and crisp . russians hurry along the elegant boulevards , wrapped up tight against the biting cold . russia 's winter , its annual deep freeze , has begun . but this year there 's more than just a bitter chill in the air . for the past nine months relations with the west have become decidedly frosty too . on the face of it the problem is ukraine . the west backed a popular uprising there in march , which toppled a kremlin-friendly government . infuriated , russia 's president , vladimir putin , annexed the strategic crimean peninsula , where it has a key naval base . since then he has been accused of fuelling a separatist rebellion in the mainly russian-speaking east of the country . that unrest has already cost more than 4,000 lives . the united states and europe have imposed costly sanctions and travel bans . it threatens more . on the international stage , russia has been excluded from the g8 group of industrialized nations . at the recent g20 summit in brisbane , president putin was cold-shouldered by his western counterparts . but the russian leader appears unmoved , his ukraine policy unchanged . one fascinating explanation for the failure of western sanctions and rebukes to change this vast country 's behavior may be in the mindset , the world view , of its strongman president . i 'm one of the few western journalists to have sat down with vladimir putin . i met him at his residence outside sochi in 2008 , just after russia 's invasion of georgia . i asked him back then if he could guarantee that russian troops would not invade other former soviet states , like ukraine . he reacted quite angrily , saying he objected to my question . it was russians , he said , who should be given guarantees that no one attacks us . the comment sheds light , i think , on how vladimir putin sees the world outside the walls of the kremlin . for him , russia is under constant threat from the west . nato expansion into former eastern bloc nations has eroded russia 's security . the prospect of georgia joining the western military alliance , let alone ukraine , is unthinkable for him . the cold war , from this perspective , has never really ended ; we 're still living in the 1980s . the west , in particular the united states , still strives to  subjugate  russia . president putin repeated this just a few days ago in moscow . sanctions are an inevitable consequence of russia 's resistance to this subjugation . ukraine was the motive , but if it had not been ukraine it would likely have been something else . from a western perspective , this seems like a cynical distortion of the facts , a kremlin ploy to confuse and obfuscate . but it may help explain why russia is doing what it is doing , and why sanctions are not changing -- and may never change -- kremlin policy . it may also help to explain why , at a time of growing economic hardship , russia 's president remains so utterly popular at home . his world view is theirs too . like the harsh cold of the coming russian winter , confrontation with the west is inevitable and must be endured .", "summary": " putin accused of fuelling separatist rebellion in mainly russian-speaking east of ukraine .   on international stage , russia has been excluded from g8 group of industrialized nations .   but russian leader appears unmoved , his ukraine policy unchanged .   putin told cnn 's matthew chance : russians should be given guarantees no one attacks us .
