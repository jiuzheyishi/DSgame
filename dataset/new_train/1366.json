{"text": "it is widely accepted that people with a family history of schizophrenia are more susceptible to the mental health condition . but the theory that people can develop it after being infected with toxoplasma gondi -- a parasite transmitted by soil , undercooked meat and cat faeces , is controversial . now , a new study suggests that one fifth of cases of schizophrenia may involve the parasite . a new study suggests that a fifth of cases of schizophrenia may involve the parasite toxoplasma gondi , which is transmitted by soil , undercooked meat and cat faeces . a tissue smear containing the parasite is shown . gary smith , professor of population biology and epidemiology at the university of pennsylvania 's school of veterinary medicine is behind the research . ` infection with toxoplasma is very common , so , even if only a small percentage of people suffer adverse consequences , we could be talking about problems that affect thousands and thousands of people , ' he said . just over one third of the us population is infected with t. gondii and the vast majority of people are n't aware of it , according to the study published in the journal preventive veterinary medicine . the parasite can be especially dangerous to certain groups of people . for example , if a woman becomes infected for the first time during pregnancy , her foetus can die or suffer serious developmental problems . the theory that toxoplasma gondi causes schizophrenia -lrb- illustrated with stock image -rrb- is n't new , but now the health risk has been quantified . people with hiv or other diseases that weaken the immune system are susceptible to a complication of t. gondii infection called toxoplasmic encephalitis , which can be deadly . while it has long been believed that most healthy people suffer no adverse effects from a t. gondii infection , recent studies have found evidence of worrying impacts , including an association with schizophrenia , because the parasite is found in in the brain as well as in muscles . some antipsychotic drugs can stop the parasite from reproducing , but studies in mice , rats and people have also shown that infection with t. gondii triggers changes in behaviour and personality . to investigate this connection , professor smith sought to calculate the population attributable fraction -lrb- paf -rrb- which experts use to determine how important a risk factor might be . in this case , the paf is ` the proportion of schizophrenia diagnoses that would not occur in a population if t. gondii infections were not present , ' he explained . by taking into account the fact that the proportion of people that are infected with t. gondii increases with age , he worked out the average paf during the average lifetime to be 21.4 per cent . ` in other words , we ask , if you could stop infections with this parasite , how many cases could you prevent ?  professor smith said . ` over a lifetime , we found that you could prevent one-fifth of all cases . that , to me , is significant . ' he noted that in some countries , the prevalence of t. gondii infection is much higher than in the us and these countries also have a higher incidence of schizophrenia . ` by finding out how important a factor t. gondii infection is , this work might inform our attitude to researching the subject , ' professor smith said . ` instead of ridiculing the idea of a connection between t. gondii and schizophrenia because it seems so extraordinary , we can sit down and consider the evidence . perhaps then we might be persuaded to look for more ways to reduce the number of people infected with toxoplasma . ' ` infection with toxoplasma is very common , so , even if only a small percentage of people suffer adverse consequences , we could be talking about problems that affect thousands and thousands of people . ' schizophrenia is a long-term mental health condition that causes a range of different psychological symptoms , including : . doctors often describe schizophrenia as a psychotic illness . this means sometimes a person may not be able to distinguish their own thoughts and ideas from reality , according to nhs choices . the exact cause of schizophrenia is unknown . however , most experts believe the condition is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors . the theory that it is caused by toxoplasma gondi is not new , but it is controversial .", "summary": " the theory that people can develop schizophrenia after being infected by the parasite toxoplasma gondi is not new , but it is controversial .   parasite is transmitted by soil , undercooked meat and cat faeces .   now a study by the university of pennsylvania suggests one fifth of cases of schizophrenia may involve the parasite , which is very common .   expert calculated how important a risk factor the parasite might be .   research may lead to experts looking ways to reduce the number of people infected with toxoplasma - including a third of the us population .
