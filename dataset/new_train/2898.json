{"text": "new guidelines for the management of hypertension suggest that people 60 or older might be able to handle higher blood pressure readings than originally thought . hypertension , which can lead to strokes , heart attack , kidney failure and death , is traditionally treated with medication and diet . the goal of most doctors is to keep their patient 's blood pressure below 140 -lrb- systolic -rrb- / 90 -lrb- diastolic -rrb- . but after reviewing mounds of evidence , a committee of experts now says the systolic number , especially in older people , can be higher at 150/90 . and many of these patients who were on medication would no longer need to be . it is not clear how many people would be affected by these new guidelines , but experts are estimating in the millions . the committee was asked to update the guidelines that have been in place for more than 30 years . they were published online wednesday in the latest edition of the journal of the american medical association . the group of 17 experts found no reason to change any other section of the guidelines . according to the report ,  there is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a bp goal of less than 150/90 and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 .  however , there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal , or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal , so the panel recommends a bp of less than 140/90 for those groups based on expert opinion . ", "summary": " panel of experts publish findings in journal of the american medical association .   conclusion : people 60 and older might be able to handle higher blood pressure readings .   traditionally , systolic number goal in that group is below 140 .   now , they are saying people the number can be below 150 in that age group .
