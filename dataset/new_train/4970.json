{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- goodbye , stephen colbert . we hardly knew you . in fact , that was the idea , was n't it ? colbert -- the pugnacious ,  nation  - inspiring champion -- hosted his last  colbert report  on comedy central thursday night . about six months from now , he will take a new role as host of cbs '  late show .  it will be like superman changing into clark kent -- or , perhaps , into kal-el . for the colbert we 've been watching bears only a tangential resemblance to the real thing . the real colbert , as revealed in profiles in the new yorker and the new york times , is a modest family man , a devout catholic with three children who 's  extremely normal ,  one of his neighbors said . the colbert of the  colbert report  is bombastic and ironic , equal parts bill o'reilly -lrb- who 's referred to as  papa bear  on the show -rrb- and david letterman , the man the real colbert is replacing . nevertheless , it 's worth noting that bombast and irony have paid off handsomely for the onetime  daily show  correspondent and  strangers with candy  actor . in some ways , he has become the power he 's ridiculed . without colbert , we would n't have a word for what 's now called  truthiness ,  the concept that if you feel it in your gut , it must be true . -lrb- it was merriam-webster 's word of the year in 2006 : the power of stephen at work . -rrb- we would n't  know a district  and the sometimes humorless people who are elected to them . and we would n't understand how to turn the other cheek to internet activists who wanted to #cancelcolbert . colbert ` late show ' staying in new york . yes , occasionally the colbert alter ego pushed boundaries a little fiercely . when he was the featured entertainer at the 2006 white house correspondents dinner , his scathing jokes about president bush , the bush administration and the news media -- delivered with all mere feet away -- hit close to home . -lrb- so close , in fact , that the entertainment for the 2007 dinner was provided by the much safer rich little . -rrb- . and then there was the colbert super pac , americans for a better tomorrow , tomorrow . colbert thought it would show the absurdity of campaign finance laws . it did -- but mainly because both democrats and republicans were willing to go along with it . anything for money , it seems . it 's a funhouse mirror that colbert 's partner in crime , jon stewart , has willingly supported . both have found comedy gold through mockery , but if stewart is the exasperated uncle , colbert has been the mischievous nephew . by questioning reality through a character , colbert has actually shown how absurd real reality often is . obama fills in for stephen colbert . no wonder he 'll be missed . who else can symbolize america with a ben & jerry 's ice cream flavor , a nasa device and a minor league hockey mascot ? colbert is the real america . even president obama paid tribute . occasionally he 's shown us who he is underneath the character , of course . he answered a reddit ama very much as himself , and took the time to be a grown man for a rookie magazine feature . he may be that guy when his  late show  stint begins . but we do n't know who the new colbert will be . will he be full of smarm , like a martin short parody ? a puckish intellectual , a la dick cavett ? a rollicking steve allen type ? whatever he is , he 's said he 's leaving the  colbert report 's  colbert behind . colbert 's time slot will be well-cared for , thanks to larry wilmore and the  nightly show ,  which will follow stewart 's  daily show  starting january 19 . but his impact may never be equaled . surprisingly , colbert was worried that the character would n't sustain . as he told the new york times ,  i thought topical stuff had an ephemeral quality -- it would be meaningless in a week . i wanted my character to be eternal .  no worries there , stephen colbert . we 'll always remember . opinion : goodbye , ` stephen colbert ' ?", "summary": " stephen colbert wraps up  the colbert report  thursday night .   colbert 's blustering  stephen colbert  character has made him famous .   real colbert is a soft-spoken family man .   colbert will take over for david letterman in 2015 .
