' i have discussed it with a number of people in the rugby world and they can not believe it . ' i have been to six olympic games and thousands of sporting events . during the 25 years i have been covering sport and i 've never seen . behaviour like it from a player . ' he added it was ` absolutely disgraceful behaviour ' and said northampton should be placed in the dictionary to represent everything ` naughty , outrageous or disgusting in . sport ' . but after the school denied his . version of events and accused him of ` provoking ' their student , 5 . live 's acting controller jonathan wall has today apologised to headteacher rod goldswain . mr goldswain , a former rugby player for northampton saints , says the boy spat at the ground , . not at bunce 's wife , and although he called him a ` stupid t *** ' the school . denied the boy called him a ` c *** ' or a ` p **** ' . the pupil had been given a ` dressing down ' , he said . after hearing his version of events mr wall wrote in an email seen by mailonline : ' i have spoken to steve bunce today to tell him this was a private matter that he should n't have raised on bbc radio 5 live . it is not an issue he will discuss again on this radio station . ` as you know from our conversation , i 'm sorry for the inconvenience this has subsequently caused you . thank you for accepting my apology . ' scroll down for video . denial : northampton high school for boys -lrb- pictured -rrb- has demanded steve bunce apologises and says he ` provoked ' the boy by shouting at him . mr goldswain said : ' i am happy to accept the apology , it would , of course , be good if mr bunce responded in a similar way . ` unfortunately he -lrb- mr bunce -rrb- has used his privileged position as a bbc radio presenter to create what he sees as entertainment by criticising and naming a school and attempting to disparage both this school and our town , ' he said . unsavoury : the incident happened during a schools rugby match as mr bunce watched his son -lrb- file picture -rrb- . ` this is grossly unfair based , as it was , on one isolated incident . those who know the school will not recognise the presenter 's comments applying to northampton school for boys . ' i would hope that steve bunce regrets the comments he made in the name of so called entertainment . ' mr bunce denies shouting at the boy but admitted today he should not have brought it up on fighting talk . ' i do n't want the kid to get in trouble . i want him to be reprimanded , ' he told the daily telegraph , adding : ` perhaps i should have written to the school and not mentioned it on fighting talk . ` but perhaps some little kid should n't have gobbed or sworn at two people standing on the sidelines on a fantastic winter 's afternoon in northampton . ' a spokesman for the bbc told mailonline this morning : ` this is a matter between steve and the school . ' the school 's local mp , tory michael ellis , has also stepped in to slam steve bunce . ` it is ridiculous to use a national radio broadcast to launch a personal tirade against a teenage school boy and his school , ' he said . ` unlike mr bunce i know northampton school for boys to be an excellent school with strong standards of discipline . ` mr bunce 's broadcast comments about the worst behaviour he had seen in 25 years were , in my opinion , absurd and melodramatic .
