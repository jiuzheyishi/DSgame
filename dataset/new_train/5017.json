{"text": "a tragic baby girl survived for just 15 hours following a catalogue of blunders by hospital staff which included an obstetrician ignoring three bleeps to his pager . a coroner ruled that mother lucy day was ` badly let down ' by the nhs who missed opportunities that could have saved tragic daughter fleur . dr martin voss was alerted three times by the midwife team amid growing concerns for the expectant mother . the child was born at cheltenham general hospital in gloucestershire but survived for just 15 hours after a catalogue of errors by staff . he only arrived to review her at 4.05 am after initially being called at 3.15 am and gave no explanation for his delay , an inquest heard . mrs day gave birth to little fleur by caesarean section within the hour at 4.54 am on december 9 , 2010 at cheltenham general hospital . she weighed just 5.86 lbs and was very cold . she was not feeding naturally from her mother and developed both hypoglycaemia and hypothermia . but a coroner said other staff also failed the mum as her condition did n't trigger alarm bells quickly enough and there was a delay in moving her to a special care unit . paediatrician dr haroon mansoori , a locum who had been at the hospital for just four days , told the inquest fleur appeared to be in ` good condition ' when he examined her . he said he was unaware of her low temperature , but had he been , would have admitted her to the special care baby unit . ` as a result of this little girl 's . death , it may well be that we will avoid and prevent similar deaths in . these circumstances in the future . the nhs is rightly cherished as a favourite institution of which mostly we can be proud . ' coroner tom osborne . paediatrician registrar dr ka fai sun was also said to be lacking ` basic skills ' to help when fleur went into the special care bay unit at around 5pm . by that time her oxygen saturation levels were low . and a consultant paediatrician was held up in traffic and did not arrive at the hospital until 6.30 pm - an hour after he was called . fleur died two hours later at 8.30 pm and pathologists were unable to determine her cause of death . tom osborne , the assistant deputy gloucestershire coroner , said hospital staff ` missed opportunities ' that might have saved the barecording a narrative verdict , mr. osborne said : ` she was not recognised as small for her gestational age and at high risk of hypothermia and hypoglycaemia - or that she had signs indicating she was unwell after delivery . ` these would have warranted an early paediatric review and admission to the special care baby unit for monitoring and investigation . ` this resulted in a lost opportunity to render further medical intervention . ` as a result of this little girl 's death , it may well be that we will avoid and prevent similar deaths in these circumstances in the future . ` the nhs is rightly cherished as a favourite institution of which mostly we can be proud . ` but unfortunately , as is evident from the death of fleur , there are rare occasions when a person under the care of the nhs is badly let down . ' mrs day , formerly of cirencester , gloucestershire , but now living in china , left the two-day hearing without comment .", "summary": " lucy day was ` badly let down ' by the nhs who missed opportunities that could have saved tragic daughter fleur , coroner rules .
