{"text": "thank heavens lorna fitzgerald found fame as an actress - she 'd have made her family 's life unbearable if she had n't . lorna , who plays abi branning in eastenders , says acting 's been her goal ever since she can remember . ' i was every relative 's nightmare - i 'd perform plays for them , ' she says . lorna landed her dream role at the age of ten - six years after her ambition began . ` at first it 's cute , but it would get to the point where mum would say ,  why do n't you go upstairs ?  she took me to a theatre show when i was about four , and i was in awe of everyone on stage . so then mum sent me to an acting school and it went from there . ' and now after eight years in albert square she 's involved in her biggest storyline to date , as the killer of tragic lucy beale is at large - and not even the eastenders cast know who it is . but if lorna did somehow find out , keeping it a secret would n't be a problem . for even after learning she 'd won her role on the soap when she was only ten , she managed to keep the news from her school friends . ' i was called out of class and my mum told me in front of the head , ' recalls lorna , of the moment she found out she was about to be a major child tv star . ` it blew my mind . eastenders is so big , and as a ten-year-old it was daunting , but i was so excited . but i could n't tell my friends for about three months ! i liked keeping the secret , though . i kept thinking ,  i know something you do n't !  ' lorna says that a highlight of being in eastenders is working with june brown who plays her on-screen grandmother - dot cotton . after being introduced in 2006 with on-screen dad max , mum tanya and older sister lauren , lorna , now 18 , has gone from strength to strength as abi . she 's been tipped as ` one to watch ' by the critics as her character has enjoyed the ups and downs of the soap roller coaster : abi 's been hit by deano wicks 's car , watched her parents ' marriage unravel , discovered trina johnson 's dead body , struggled with lauren 's drinking and had an on-off relationship with jay brown . her hard work was recognised in 2012 when she won the best young performance gong at the british soap awards . and now she 's in the thick of the action as the hunt for lucy beale 's killer continues . ` anyone could be in the frame for her murder , ' says abi . ` it could be me , but we 're all in the dark . that 's why there 's such a buzz . everyone wants to find out . the challenge of playing a killer would be great . but then , if it were me , i 'd probably have to leave . ' although relishing her prominent role on the soap , lorna says she struggled with the attention that comes with being in eastenders . ` it 's fine now i 'm used to it , but at first it was scary because i 'd be shopping and strangers would say stuff to me , ' she admits . and what 's next ? ' i love it here . i 've been very lucky , ' she says . ` but they could say i 'm leaving at any time . my dream is to win an oscar . you never know , i could be the first person to win one in walford - eastenders : the movie ! ' travel , asia or south america ? i 'd love to visit thailand . there 's a party scene and some culture too . fancy restaurant or greasy spoon ? greasy spoon -- i do n't have nice enough clothes to go to a fancy restaurant . i 'm in a tracksuit now ! drinks , cocktail or wine ? i love a cocktail . i do n't like the taste of alcohol , so the juice masks it . film , sliding doors or gladiator ? gladiator is my favourite film . it has action , fight scenes , a love story -- a bit of everything . music , dance or pop ? i listen to kiss fm because i like a bit of dance music , but my tastes are quite varied . gym or sofa ? sofa . i love slobbing out . i have a gym membership but it does n't get used very often !", "summary": " 18-year-old lorna has been in eastenders since the age of ten .   eight years on and she says she is still relishing every second .   here she discusses struggling adjusting to fame and lucy beale 's death .
