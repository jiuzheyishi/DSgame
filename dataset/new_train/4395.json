{"text": "tripoli , libya britain 's decision to expel moammar gadhafi 's diplomats from london ensures that the bloody test of wills in libya will grind on for weeks , if not months to come . barely 15 days ago , there was optimism from regime insiders here in tripoli that a deal was in the works to resolve the five-month conflict . perhaps this was because the muslim holy month of ramadan was fast approaching , and with it , an anticipated slow-down in fighting on the front-lines . also , the regime was engaged in talks on multiple fronts with its european , american , and libyan opponents . developments over the last two weeks appear to have killed those hopes . first , the united states joined the growing list of countries officially declaring the rebel council based in benghazi the  legitimate governing authority for libya .  a day after secretary of state hillary clinton made the announcement in istanbul , turkey , the message was personally delivered during a round of secret talks in tunisia . the americans said they had one message for the libyans ,  gadhafi must go .  at roughly the same time , the benghazi-based rebels mounted an attack on the eastern front , against the long-contested oil town of al-brega . gadhafi 's main spokesman accused the nato military alliance of assisting rebels in the assault . he also drew a rhetorical line in the sand around al-brega , declaring dramatically ,  we will kill , we will die for oil . you come to get our oil , we will destroy you .  since then , the rebel advance on al-brega has slowed , reportedly due to deadly fields of land mines . the rebels admit hundreds of their fighters were killed and wounded during a week of fighting around al-brega , which ibrahim grandiloquently re-branded  libya 's stalingrad .  meanwhile , the tripoli regime has been staging large rallies in support of its embattled leader . enthusiastic , flag-waving crowds thronged the central squares of different regime-controlled towns and cities . partisans swore allegiance to gadhafi and defiantly fired volleys of gunfire in the air . state tv provided blanket coverage of the events , labeling them  million man marches .  the size of the rallies has been the subject of heated debate between foreign journalists and government officials . but there is no question that tripoli has been shoring up popular support for the man who has ruled this country for more than 40 years . government officials argue that the rallies prove gadhafi is the democratic choice of the libyan people , a position that the rebels have fought and bled to refute . therein lies the main sticking point . the regime insists cease-fire first , then talks , while also adding that gadhafi 's position as  brother leader  is non-negotiable . benghazi and nato say no talks until gadhafi goes . in recent days , both the rebels and officials in paris , london and washington softened their demands . they indicated one possible way out of the stalemate could include gadhafi remaining in libya , rather than going into exile . but wednesday 's announcement by britain 's top diplomat marked yet another escalation against gadhafi and his cohorts . william hague announced he would hand over tripoli 's embassy -- as well as some of its frozen funds -- to the rebels in benghazi . gadhafi has never been this internationally isolated , even in the dark days of the eighties when ronald reagan famously labeled him  mad dog of the middle east .  turkey and even germany , which abstained from the u.n. resolution authorizing the nato operation in libya , have both pledged to hand over hundreds of millions of dollars worth of regime assets to the rebels . even tiny malta , long described as the  gateway to libya ,  has all but broken with the tripoli regime . this week , the united nations special envoy to libya seemed to kill all hope for peace . after yet another round of shuttle diplomacy between the rebels and the regime , abdul ilah al-khatib offered this grim assessment :  both sides remain far apart on reaching agreement on a political solution .  a senior muslim cleric told cnn that in the month to come , loyalist soldiers could break their daily ramadan to better fight against what the regime calls  the colonialist , crusader aggression .  ramadan begins in just a few days . expect libya 's holy month to be a bloody one .", "summary": " there was optimism recently from regime insiders in tripoli that a deal was in the works .   british move seen as escalation against gadhafi .   libya insists that a cease-fire must come first .   rebels and their western allies say gadhafi must go .
