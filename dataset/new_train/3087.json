' it was in spring of this year that ms mccormack contracted chicken pox . she was initially admitted to south tyneside district hospital and when her condition worsened was put into an induced coma . at the same time medical staff set about locating a free extracorporeal membrane oxygenation -lrb- emco -rrb- machine . this was to support her heart and lung functions and it was hoped it would improve her prognosis . despite one being located in leicester , her organs began to fail before it could be used . on may 11 , her family made the gut-wrenching decision to turn off her life support machine . ms muirhead said : ` liam has been so brave . i took him to see his mam and he held her hand and kissed it , then started talking to her as though nothing was wrong . even though he was only five at the time . ` he has been so brave . we miss stacey every single day but liam really has been the one who has kept me going .
