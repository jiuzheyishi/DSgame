{"text": "overhaul call : boa chairman chairman lord moynihan said it was ` unacceptable ' that more than half of team gb medallists at the 2008 beijing olympics came from private schools . the high proportion of privately-educated team gb medallists is ` unacceptable ' , the chairman of the british olympic association said yesterday . just 7 per cent of the population go to independent schools -- but more than half of britain 's golds in the 2008 beijing games were won by former private school pupils . so far , team gb has nine gold medallists in the 2012 games . four were privately educated , and a fifth went to school in germany . boa chief lord moynihan , himself a former public schoolboy , called for an overhaul of school sport policy to provide more chances for state pupils . ` it 's one of the worst statistics in british sport , ' he claimed . ` it is wholly unacceptable that over 50 per cent of our medallists in beijing came from the private sector . ` it tells you that 50 per cent of the medals came from 7 per cent of the population . ` there is so much talent out there in the 93 per cent that should be identified and developed . that has got to be a priority for future sports policy . ` i have spoken about it many times and i will continue to speak about it until there is not breath left in me . ' the conservative peer continued : ` the balance of professional football is that around 7 per cent of players come from the private sector , which is an absolute mirror image of society . ` that should be the case in every single sport , and that should be the priority in each and every sport , and that is something that every government should strive for . ' at the previous olympics , a third of team gb went to independent schools . they included multiple gold medallist sir chris hoy , who attended george watson 's college in edinburgh , and every equestrian medallist . non-state schools can afford to devote more time to sport . they usually have better facilities and often boast top-class coaches . champion : multiple gold medal cyclist sir chris hoy , pictured with his wife sarra after winning the men 's team sprint yesterday , was provately educated at george watson 's college in edinburgh . pledge : david cameron , pictured here watching the sprint cycling at the velodrome with prince william , said billions would be spent on state school sport over the next five years . the discrepancy is especially noticeable in sports whose basic entry costs are high , such as equestrian events and sailing . rowing . has already taken action to address the imbalance , with mo sbihi , who . won bronze in the men 's eight on wednesday , among the beneficiaries . the . start programme , launched more than a decade ago , has encouraged rowing . coaches to visit comprehensive schools and scout teenagers with the . necessary physique to become elite rowers . as a result , half of team . gb 's rowers at the london games are from state schools . when . asked if too many medals were being won by former public school pupils , . david cameron said : ` we need to spend on state school sport and we are . spending a billion pounds over the next five years . ` we need to make sure people have those opportunities . frankly , one of the best things will be the olympics and the legacy and the inspiration for young people to take part . ' tory mp charlotte leslie said the statistics were ` really , really worrying ' . she told bbc radio 4 's pm programme that state schools were often reluctant to promote competition . ` there 's a massive problem with sports and facilities in our schools , but it 's also a much deeper problem , ' she said . ` i wonder if it 's a problem to do with culture . the reason the private sector does well in education is that it 's very unapologetic about competition -- there are winners and there are losers -- and this is certainly not the case for all state schools .
