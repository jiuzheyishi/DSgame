{"text": "when a photo emerged of russell brand with his arm around the shoulders of a ` pick-up artist ' banned from britain , the comedian swiftly distanced himself from his vile techniques . but while brand declared himself ` wholeheartedly against ' julien blanc 's methods , he appeared to be on shaky ground yesterday when his links to another self-styled seduction guru came back to haunt him . blanc , 25 , who runs a company claiming to teach men how to make women ` beg ' for sex , had been due to conduct a seminar in britain this week until more than 136,000 people successfully petitioned for him to be refused a visa . scroll down for video . criticism : when this photo emerged of russell brand with his arm around the shoulders of julien blanc , a ` pick-up artist ' banned from britain , the comedian swiftly distanced himself from his vile techniques . brand , 39 , said he was ` 100 per cent ' against blanc 's methods and that any ` system for chatting up women is in itself questionable ' . however , questions have been raised about his stance after it emerged that he provided a cover quote for a seduction manual called the rules of the game by neil strauss . in it , the us author advises desperate bachelors to use techniques such as ` negging ' , in which a man tries to subtly insult a woman and undermine her self-confidence in the hope she will become desperate for his approval . emblazoned on the cover of the 2007 book is a quote from brand saying : ` neil strauss 's writing turned me from a desperate wallflower into a wallflower who can talk women into sex . ' he also discussed pornography and ` notches on the bedpost ' when he interviewed strauss several years ago on a bbc radio 6 music show , at one point saying : ` okay neil , teach us more . ' strauss , 45 , who calls brand a friend , has said the comedian ` does extremely well as a pick-up artist ... when i met him he was intuitively using the principles in the book . ' endorsement : brandprovided a cover quote for a seduction manual by neil strauss -lrb- pictured -rrb- . strauss 's devotees include us-based blanc , who said his interest in picking up women started when he read one of his books . critics say his methods , such as threatening to commit suicide and isolating women from friends , are abusive and controlling . footage has also emerged of blanc using racist language and grabbing women by the throat . one twitter post says : ` dear girls , could you please save me the effort and roofie -lsb- spike -rsb- your own drink ? #justkidding . ' after he was banned from britain , liberal democrat mp lynne featherstone said : ` julien blanc 's presence in the uk could have led to an increase in sexual violence and harassment . ' when a picture emerged online of brand and blanc together , the comedian claimed he had not known who he was posing with . he said : ` i never knew who that was . so many people come up to me all the time . ` i 'm against treating women in a disrespectful way . that whole pick-up thing ... seemed appealing to me when i was a kid . any system for chatting up women is in itself questionable . ` but any that 's sort of based on objectifying or undermining women i would never , never , never , never , never endorse . ` so just to be clear , if you 've got any questions about my attitude towards julien blanc or anyone that treats women or anybody disrespectfully , i 'm 100 per cent , wholeheartedly against it . ' blanc was also kicked out of australia earlier this month when his visa was cancelled after protests about his techniques . he had been due to hold seminars there until december . as the furore intensified last week , he finally apologised for his behaviour and insisted his ` intentions were never bad ' . ` i 'd like to apologise to anyone i 've offended in any way , ' he said . ` it was never my intention ... i 'm extremely sorry for everything that happened . ' outrage : critics of blanc , pictured , say his methods , such as threatening to commit suicide and isolating women from friends , are abusive and controlling .", "summary": " photo emerged of russell brand with ` pick up artist ' banned from britain .   brand declared himself ` wholeheartedly against ' julien blanc 's methods .   but the comedian provided a cover quote for seduction manual in 2007 .
