{"text": "james murdoch insisted tuesday that he knew little about the scale of phone hacking by people working for the news of the world , as he continued his fight to limit the damage the scandal does to him and his family 's media empire . underlings did not tell him how pervasive it was when he took over news corp. 's british newspaper publishing arm , he said . he agreed with a suggestion that the reason was because they knew he would put a stop to it .  i think that must be it , that i would say , ` cut out the cancer , ' and there was some desire to not do that ,  he told the leveson inquiry into press ethics . former murdoch employees testified earlier that they told him about the problem . he was testifying before an independent british inquiry into journalistic ethics prompted by phone hacking at the defunct news of the world , once the flagship british sunday tabloid of news corp. . the scandal has reverberated through the british political establishment , led to dozens of arrests on suspicion of criminal activity and forced news corp. to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds in compensation to the victims of phone hacking . tuesday 's hearing revealed the depth of the links between the murdoch family and british politicians , with murdoch saying he had had drinks with david cameron at a pub before cameron became prime minister and dined with him once he was in office . leveson inquiry lawyer robert jay pressed murdoch over the extent of his contact with politicians as the company moved to take full control of satellite broadcaster bskyb , a bid that collapsed because of the phone-hacking scandal . evidence published tuesday suggests that news corp. was getting inside information from the government minister with the power to approve or block the acquisition , culture secretary jeremy hunt . hundreds of pages of e-mails painted a picture of a back channel between hunt 's office and frederic michel , a top murdoch employee . michel told murdoch in january 2011 that he had gotten  absolutely illegal  information about government plans related to the takeover plan , the e-mails show . prime minister cameron has full confidence in hunt , his spokesman craig oliver told cnn after the murdoch testimony concluded . hunt 's portfolio includes the london olympics , which are now less than 100 days away . james murdoch and his father , rupert murdoch , have been hammered over the past year about what they knew about phone hacking by people working for them . rupert murdoch is scheduled to appear wednesday and perhaps thursday morning at the inquiry . the younger murdoch has already been called twice to testify before british lawmakers and resigned from a number of top management positions at british subsidiaries of his father 's media empire . he and his father have always denied knowing about the scale of phone hacking , which police say could have affected thousands of people , ranging from celebrities and politicians to crime victims and war veterans . james murdoch said tuesday that he had no reason to look into illegal eavesdropping by his employees when he took over the company 's british newspaper subsidiary in december 2007 . a news of the world reporter and a private investigator had been sent to prison that year for hacking the phones of the staff of princes william and harry , but murdoch said he had been assured that the problem went no further .  i was not told sufficient information to go and turn over a whole bunch of stones that i was told had already been turned over ,  he said .  i do n't think that , short of knowing they were n't giving me the full picture , i would 've been able to know that at the time .  the journalist who went to prison , clive goodman , had been saying that phone-hacking went beyond his case , leveson inquiry counsel robert jay said .  i was not aware of that ,  murdoch replied . he told the leveson inquiry on tuesday that he did not decide what went into the company 's british tabloids , the sun and the news of the world , relying on his editors to make the decisions . he was also pressed on his relationship with british politicians , including former prime minister tony blair and the current leader , cameron . he acknowledged meeting with them , but denied having lobbied them improperly about his family 's business interests . and he denied having made a  crass calculation  about how the sun 's endorsement of cameron 's conservative party before the 2010 elections would affect news corp. . dozens of people have been arrested in criminal investigations into phone and e-mail hacking and police bribery , and police asked prosecutors last week to charge at least eight people . the suspects include at least one journalist and a police officer , the crown prosecution service said , declining to name them . no charges have been filed , and the crown prosecution service said it did not know when a decision would be made about charges . the british government set up the leveson inquiry , the independent investigation that summoned the murdochs , in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal . two parliamentary committees also are looking into media conduct . james murdoch , 39 , resigned as chairman of british sky broadcasting this month , saying ,  i am determined that the interests of bskyb should not be undermined by matters outside the scope of this company .  rupert murdoch testified before lawmakers in july alongside his son . news corp. shut down its british sunday tabloid , the news of the world , last summer after public outrage at the scale of illegal eavesdropping its journalists did in search of stories . the british lawyer representing dozens of alleged news corp. phone-hacking victims was in new york last week , exploring options for a u.s. case against the company . attorney mark lewis said he is representing three or four new clients , one of whom is believed to be a u.s. citizen , who say their phones were hacked while they were on u.s. soil . there are also many other potential new clients , lewis said .  as i 've been traveling here ,  he said ,  i 've been contacted by many people who 've had , so they say , similar problems -- not just hacking but maybe being trailed or have fallen out with some american murdoch news corp. company and then found themselves , as they would say , at the wrong end of investigations , the wrong end of information gathered .
