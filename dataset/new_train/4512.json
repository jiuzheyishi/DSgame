{"text": "tehran 's police chief was deeply offended .  it 's obscene ,  he declared , and promptly arrested six young men and women who made a joyful fan video , dancing and lip-synching to the sound of pharrell williams ' huge hit ,  happy .  clap your hands if this sounds like one of the most ridiculous stories you ever heard . the six iranians , wearing colorful clothes , stylish sun shades and bright bandanas , dared to dance to the beat of  happy .  the women did not cover their heads with the required hijab . at times , the men and women danced together , which is forbidden and punishable under the law . but elsewhere -- when the police are n't looking -- iranian men and women dance together and see nothing wrong with it . but the police found it offensive . iran state media called it  vulgar .  the backlash against the arrests was forceful , and before long , the police released the dancers , although the director of the video apparently remains in custody . the group describes itself as  tehran pharell williams fans ,  which may strike the oversensitive authorities in the islamic republic as a highly subversive political affiliation . the nefarious motivation for making the video was revealed at the end of the clip , which reads ,  ` happy ' was an excuse to be happy . we enjoyed every second of making it . hope it puts a smile on your face .  as the opposition national iranian american council noted ,  the irony that the iranian youth were arrested for dancing to a song called ` happy ' seems to be lost on the iranian authorities . the iranian people can not be forced to live in a world where -lrb- nuclear -rrb- enrichment is a right , but happiness is not .  more than 100,000 people have viewed the iranian version of  happy ,  which stirred up a bizarre political storm . tehran police chief hossein sajedinia boasted of taking less than six hours to round up the evildoers and lock them up , but not before parading them before the television cameras , a stern warning to other young people who might be getting any crazy ideas in their heads ; no telling what may lurk in the minds of youngsters listening to williams ' lyrics . williams tweeted ,  it 's beyond sad these kids were arrested for trying to spread happiness .  iranian president hassan rouhani posted his own tweet , apparently quoting a statement he made more than a year ago ,  #happiness is our people 's right . we should n't be too hard on behaviors caused by joy . 29/6/2013 .  yes , it all seems incredible silly . behind the absurdity , ongoing tensions are shaping life in iran . there is a boiling over of frustration among a large part of the iranian population fed up with the restrictions imposed by the regime . the  happy  video showed defiance from two groups who are chafing under the limits imposed by the authorities : young people and women . from the moment the islamic revolution took power in iran , women , who had enjoyed western-style freedoms , started to endure new rules restricting their lives . the mandate to cover with a hijab stands as the most visible , ever-present and personally offensive of those rules . every year for the last 35 , the arrival of summer brings a battle between women pushing against the rules in the iranian heat and regime backers fighting against the loosening of restrictions . a few days ago , a facebook page went up called stealthyfreedom . in it , iranian women of all ages are posting pictures of themselves free from the restrictive clothing . the pictures show women dancing , smiling , with their arms extended , as if reaching for freedom , commenting on  the feeling of wind blowing through every strand of hair .  one wrote ,  i am a 68-year-old woman ... i want to be free and comfortable in my own skin .  another vows  we will get freedom of dressing , singing , dancing . ...  on friday , a counterdemonstration took to the streets of tehran , demanding that authorities crack down on dress code violations and enforce the code on women . protesters carried signs that showed a sexy red stiletto shoe with a red line across it . clothing connotes free expression to some , a grave threat to others . the battle over social freedoms mirrors the contest in the government , where more conservative members are pushing back against rouhani , who is considered a moderate by the islamic republic 's unique standards , and is trying to improve iran 's international relations and image abroad . the arrest of the dancers came just after rouhani gave a speech about internet freedoms in which he declared  we must recognize our citizens ' right to connect to the world wide web .  the president , who is not the most powerful leader in the country , asked  why are we so shaky ? why have we cowered in a corner ... lest we take a bullet in this culture war ?  the speech was supposed to be broadcast on national television , but it was not . one of rouhani 's aides reportedly blamed a former member of the revolutionary guard for blocking the speech from television . the revolutionary guard and the president both answer to the unelected supreme leader ali khamenei . there is no word so far on how khamenei feels about williams ' hit song and the dancers . no word , so far , on whether the supreme leader is happy .", "summary": " six iranians are arrested and later released for making a fun video .   frida ghitis : it is ridiculous they got in trouble for dancing to the hit  happy    she says the incident is a sign of frustration with the limits imposed by iran .   ghitis : for one thing , women should n't have to wear restrictive clothing like hijab .
