{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- american skier lindsey vonn clinched world cup victory number 62 sunday , equaling the all-time record which has stood for 35 years . in foggy conditions and on soft snow in the women 's downhill at cortina d'ampezzo , italy , vonn recorded a time of 1 minute 39.61 seconds , beating austria 's elisabeth goergl by 0.32 seconds . the victory tied vonn with austria 's annemarie moser-proell 's , who set the benchmark between 1970 and 1980 .  i was a little bit nervous in the start  , the 30-year-old said in an interview with the international ski federation website .  i thought i skied really well on friday , but it was tough conditions and i was n't able to be on top of the podium . today was kind of the same , the snow was soft but at least it was sunny . i just tried to keep my feet underneath me and not to push the skis against the snow too much and it worked out .  the victory marks an incredible comeback for vonn , who had been out with a serious knee injury for 18 months . in a desperate attempt to get fit for the 2014 sochi winter olympics , vonn aggravated her knee and needed a second operation . much of the talk since her comeback has concerned the world cup record , which has proved something of a distraction .  every time i 'm in the starting gate i 'm trying to win , whether it 's 60 , 61 , 62 or whatever it is , i just try to ski my best ,  she said .  so it was more frustrating just talking about this record in the media . but for me , mentally , it was the same as any other race . now i 'm happy we can stop talking about it .  although few will actually stop talking about it . vonn now has the chance to hold the record outright , with 63 wins , in monday 's super-g .  i 've surprised myself how far i come ,  vonn told cnn after her victory .  i 'm really excited for another race tomorrow . hopefully i can break the record tomorrow . i love what i do . i want to win as many races as possible . i have a lot more to give the sport .  the was one last question to ask : had she spoken to her boyfriend , tiger woods ?  yeah i talked to him and he said he 's really proud of me ,  she confirmed .  he was watching with his daughter early in the morning . i was sad he was n't here but he 's training . he 's a professional athlete too .  tina maze , the overall leader , took fifth place and increased her lead in the standings .", "summary": " lindsey vonn equals world cup win record in italy .   clinched win number 62 in the downhill .   can brfeak the 35-year record in the super-g monday .
