{"text": "a federal judge on friday ruled that michigan 's prohibition on same-sex marriage violates the u.s. constitution , ordering the state to stop enforcing the ban .  today 's decision ... affirms the enduring principle that regardless of whoever finds favor in the eyes of the most recent majority , the guarantee of equal protection must prevail ,  u.s. district judge bernard friedman wrote . michigan is the latest state in which federal judges have struck down state constitutional bans on gay marriage . similar rulings recently have been issued in texas , virginia , kentucky , oklahoma and utah , though in those cases judges have put off enforcement of the decisions until higher courts can weigh in . friday 's decision is different in that it opens the door for same-sex couples to get marriage licenses in michigan very soon . barb byrum , the elected county clerk for ingham county and a democrat , said she is eager and ready to do so once her office opens at 8 a.m. monday .  this is a wonderful decision ,  byrum said .  many michiganders have been waiting for equality in our great state , and i look forward to the opportunity to issue marriage licenses to all loving couples .  that day may not come so fast . michigan attorney general bill schuette , a republican whose term expires later this year , announced friday evening he 's filed an emergency request for friedman 's order to be stayed and appealed .  in 2004 , the citizens of michigan recognized that diversity in parenting is best for kids and families because moms and dads are not interchangeable ,  schuette said .  michigan voters enshrined that decision in our state constitution , and their will should stand and be respected .  he was referring to the year that voters in michigan , along with those in 10 other states , passed state constitutional amendments restricting  marriage or -lrb- a -rrb- similar union  to between one man and one woman . whether same-sex couples should be allowed to wed was a hot-button issue then and in subsequent years , with polls showing that most americans favored restrictions . but public opinion shifted over time . an abc news/washington post survey released earlier this month found that 59 % of americans favor allowing gay or lesbian couples to legally wed. . michigan 's amendment , specifically , states the rationale for its restrictions is  to secure and preserve the benefits of marriage for our society and for future generations of children .  friedman -- like federal judges in other recent , similar cases -- ruled michigan 's ban violates the equal protection clause in the u.s. constitution 's 14th amendment . he said ,  the court finds the -lrb- michigan marriage amendment -rrb- impermissibly discriminates against same-sex couples in violation of the equal protection clause because the provision does not advance any conceivable state interest .  the plaintiffs in the michigan case , april deboer and jayne rowse , sued in part because michigan law also  restricts adoptions to either single persons or married couples .  they had hoped to jointly adopt three children under their care . friday 's ruling , then , would seem to open the door to same-sex couples jointly adopting children , since now they could be legally married . in the ruling , friedman cited the supreme court 's landmark decisions last june rejecting parts of the defense of marriage act while ruling same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits . the justices did n't go as far as saying that all states must allow such marriages to take place within their borders , but a number of lower federal courts did subsequently step into the fray . in addition to united states v. windsor , friedman also pointed to loving v. virginia -- in which the supreme court ruled that virginia 's ban on interracial marriages was unconstitutional .  both the windsor and loving decisions stand for the proposition that , without some overriding legitimate interest , the state can not use its domestic relations authority to legislate families out of existence ,  the judge wrote . keeping their own family together is and was deboer and rowse 's no. 1 goal , they said .  jayne and i do want to get married , but this case is about the protection of our children ,  a joyful deboer said .  it is not about individuals , it is not about her or my relationship . it is about ensuring that our children will remain together no matter what happens to her and i.
