{"text": "malcolm has an intense gaze . he speaks haltingly , at times pausing , haunted by the memories of the past .  i used to try too hard to dress like a girl to impress people , but still they would ask are you a girl or a boy ,  he remembers .  i used to pray . i used to pray to god to change me .  malcolm is transgender . he was born female , but identifies more as male . god did n't change him , could n't help with his sexual or gender identity turmoil , but others decided they would .  it 's painful because it has been mostly done by my family ,  he says softly , staring off into the distance .  they wanted to teach me how to behave like a woman . they raped me .  malcolm was 17 at the time .  all the people i ran to were just blaming me . i thought maybe my dad would understand , but instead he said ' i have been telling you to behave , to behave like a woman . ' he was like maybe i deserved whatever i went through ,  he says , his voice cracking .  that experience made me hate my family . it made me leave them , and i went and stayed with my grandmother , but unfortunately she also died ,  malcolm says , dropping his head into his hands . his chest heaves , he cries softly .  i do n't want to talk about that . it 's so hard when the people you expect to be near you are just the people who are hurting you the most .  the pain of the memory , of the rejection , the isolation so deep it 's almost too much for him to bear . many are leading a double life . malcolm is not his real name . like the vast majority of uganda 's lgbt community , he leads a secret , double life . kasha nabagasera peers warily from behind the slightly cracked gate to her home .  people do n't know i live here ,  she explains , smiling half-heartedly .  i 've been kicked out of so many apartments , this is the longest i have stayed in one place , a year . it 's rented in someone else 's name .  nabagasera is one of the few gay rights activists who speaks in public in uganda , a deeply conservative christian nation that is rabidly homophobic . evidence of that is everywhere . at christmas mass a few hours earlier , anglican archbishop stanley ntagali praised the country 's parliament for passing the anti-homosexuality bill .  we love everybody . the homosexuals , the lesbians are children of god . we want them to repent .  he preached to the congregation as it broke out in applause , his voice growing increasingly animated .  but to say we accept and then tomorrow you begin to see a man bringing a man . can you imagine that ?  nabagasera , like many other members of the lgbt community , rarely goes to church , and it 's not because she 's lost her faith .  for me it 's about love , but now it 's about hate being preached in church ,  she explains . so she stays away and prays at home . nabagasera was just a small child when she received her first beating .  my class teacher is the one who told me about the word lesbian . i did n't know . it was a big word for me . i was 7 years old .  since then , she was repeatedly expelled from schools , and worse .  i escaped rape thrice . i 've been beaten on so many occasions i ca n't remember . i think my stubbornness helped me a lot to go through all of this .  she says . and she 's incredibly lucky . her family did n't shun her .  my family was there . most of my friends became school dropouts because their family would n't support them . but , sometimes , i would just sit in my room and cry a lot . why am i being told i have demons ? since i was a child i was told i have demons .  the widespread belief is that homosexuals are possessed by the devil , or victims of sexual deviance brought in by the west .  maybe in your country you understand ,  ntagali lectured us earlier .  here it is a new thing , a new idea that is not from here . someone is imposing it on us . another kind of colonialism .  the irony , gay rights activists say , is that it was a small group of american evangelicals who came to uganda speaking out against homosexuality , which was already illegal , that took the persecutions of the lgbt community to an entirely new level .  they said that the gay movement has a blueprint that has reached uganda , and if we are not careful we are going to take over the country ,  nabagasera recalls . but , she says , it did n't stop there .  they went to parliament and advised them to change the law . they went to universities and told students we are recruiting them into homosexuality , that we have a lot of money , that they should be careful ,  she says .  then they went to parents and told them that we are recruiting their children .  legislation drops the death penalty . the first draft of the anti-homosexuality bill included the death penalty for  aggravated homosexuality ,  defined as homosexual acts with someone who is hiv positive , a minor , or repeated homosexual acts with a consenting adult .  that was n't the only shock ,  nabagasera remembers .  the other shock was that some members of parliament said the death penalty by hanging was very weak . they proposed a firing squad . at one point , i posted on my facebook page and said maybe i am not really ugandan , because the uganda i have grown up in can not be this cruel . even if i have gone through hardships , it ca n't really reach to murder .  the bill that just passed through parliament drops the death penalty , replacing it with life in prison . it also makes anyone who is viewed as a promoter of homosexuality -- like nabagasera -- a criminal who can be jailed .  the aim is to protect the institution of marriage and stopping the promotion of homosexuality in our country ,  the architect of the bill , parliament member david bahati says . if homosexuality were to be eradicated in the process , it would be a good thing , he says .  i do n't think that homosexuality is a human right ,  he says . the bill , which is still waiting presidential sign off , has been heavily criticized by western governments and international organizations . the u.s. government has responded by saying ,  as americans , we believe that people everywhere deserve to live in freedom and equality -- and that no one should face violence or discrimination for who they are or whom they love . we join those in uganda and around the world who appeal for respect for the human rights of lgbt persons and of all persons .  amnesty international called it  a grave assault on human rights ... . it makes a mockery of the ugandan constitution .  the united nations said  if signed by the president , this new law would reinforce stigma and prejudice , and institutionalize discrimination .  that is already happening . nabagasera says she 's received an increasing number of threats , not taken lightly in a community where so many have a horror story of being beaten and abused . in recent years , ugandan tabloids have taken to  outing  homosexuals . in 2011 , after being named in a popular paper under a banner that read  hang them ,  david kato was bludgeoned to death . activists called it a blatant hate crime .  i would condemn him ,  kato 's mother says , saying she did n't know he was gay until he was murdered .  i would hate him , but i would counsel him .  despite that view , she 's stigmatized by society because of her son 's sexuality . ` our movement needs a face ' nabagasera says she would rather go to jail than be driven out of her own country .  i am not going to allow someone to push me out without a fight ,  she says .  the other thing is our movement needs a face . i do n't want them to think they have won because the battle is just starting now .  it 's not that i want just to stay here to be a hero . i want to stay here because my family is here . i want to stay here to visit my mom 's grave .  so many just want to be accepted for who they are -- by their nation and by their families -- no matter their sexuality . even malcolm , despite what he 's been through .  i hate him ,  he says of his father .  he only wants to talk to me when he wants money . sometimes i give it to him , when i have . i do n't know where i get that mercy of giving him money .  and malcolm is adamant that he is going to confront his father .  i want to tell him to accept me , but he needs to accept me not as a daughter , but as a son .  u.s. , richard branson slam uganda 's anti-gay bill . uganda official : homosexuality a threat .", "summary": " malcolm , who is transgender , say most pain was inflicted by his family .   lgbt activist says she 'd rather be jailed than forced out of uganda .    i would condemn him . i would hate him , but i would counsel
