{"text": "the white house late saturday issued a detailed synopsis , or  fact sheet ,  of the six-month deal regarding iran 's nuclear program . read the deal -lrb- . pdf -rrb- . below is a copy of the agreement 's details , verbatim from the white house : . halting the progress of iran 's program and rolling back key elements . iran has committed to halt enrichment above 5 % : . • halt all enrichment -lrb- above 5 % and dismantle the technical connections required to enrich above 5 % . iran has committed to neutralize its stockpile of near-20 % uranium : . • dilute below 5 % or convert to a form not suitable for further enrichment its entire stockpile of near-20 % enriched uranium before the end of the initial phase . iran has committed to halt progress on its enrichment capacity : . • not install additional centrifuges of any type . • not install or use any next-generation centrifuges to enrich uranium . • leave inoperable roughly half of installed centrifuges at natanz and three-quarters of installed centrifuges at fordow , so they can not be used to enrich uranium . • limit its centrifuge production to those needed to replace damaged machines , so iran can not use the six months to stockpile centrifuges . • not construct additional enrichment facilities . 20 questions about the deal . iran has committed to halt progress on the growth of its 3.5 % stockpile : . • not increase its stockpile of 3.5 % low enriched uranium , so that the amount is not greater at the end of the six months than it is at the beginning , and any newly enriched 3.5 % enriched uranium is converted into oxide . iran has committed to no further advances of its activities at arak and to halt progress on its plutonium track . iran has committed to : . • not commission the arak reactor . • not fuel the arak reactor . • halt the production of fuel for the arak reactor . • no additional testing of fuel for the arak reactor . • not install any additional reactor components at arak . • not transfer fuel and heavy water to the reactor site . • not construct a facility capable of reprocessing . without reprocessing , iran can not separate plutonium from spent fuel . fareed zakaria : what critics are getting wrong about the iran deal . unprecedented transparency and intrusive monitoring of iran 's nuclear program . iran has committed to : . • provide daily access by iaea inspectors at natanz and fordow . this daily access will permit inspectors to review surveillance camera footage to ensure comprehensive monitoring . this access will provide even greater transparency into enrichment at these sites and shorten detection time for any non-compliance . • provide iaea access to centrifuge assembly facilities . • provide iaea access to centrifuge rotor component production and storage facilities . • provide iaea access to uranium mines and mills . • provide long-sought design information for the arak reactor . this will provide critical insight into the reactor that has not previously been available . • provide more frequent inspector access to the arak reactor . • provide certain key data and information called for in the additional protocol to iran 's iaea safeguards agreement and modified code 3.1 . one agreement , wildly different reactions . verification mechanism . the iaea will be called upon to perform many of these verification steps , consistent with their ongoing inspection role in iran . in addition , the p5 +1 and iran have committed to establishing a joint commission to work with the iaea to monitor implementation and address issues that may arise . the joint commission will also work with the iaea to facilitate resolution of past and present concerns with respect to iran 's nuclear program , including the possible military dimension of iran 's nuclear program and iran 's activities at parchin . limited , temporary , reversible relief . in return for these steps , the p5 +1 is to provide limited , temporary , targeted , and reversible relief while maintaining the vast bulk of our sanctions , including the oil , finance , and banking sanctions architecture . if iran fails to meet its commitments , we will revoke the relief . specifically the p5 +1 has committed to : . • not impose new nuclear-related sanctions for six months , if iran abides by its commitments under this deal , to the extent permissible within their political systems . • suspend certain sanctions on gold and precious metals , iran 's auto sector , and iran 's petrochemical exports , potentially providing iran approximately $ 1.5 billion in revenue . • license safety-related repairs and inspections inside iran for certain iranian airlines . • allow purchases of iranian oil to remain at their currently significantly reduced levels -- levels that are 60 % less than two years ago . $ 4.2 billion from these sales will be allowed to be transferred in installments if , and as , iran fulfills its commitments . • allow $ 400 million in governmental tuition assistance to be transferred from restricted iranian funds directly to recognized educational institutions in third countries to defray the tuition costs of iranian students . opinion : iran deal a risk worth taking . humanitarian transactions . facilitate humanitarian transactions that are already allowed by u.s. law . humanitarian transactions have been explicitly exempted from sanctions by congress so this channel will not provide iran access to any new source of funds . humanitarian transactions are those related to iran 's purchase of food , agricultural commodities , medicine , medical devices ; we would also facilitate transactions for medical expenses incurred abroad . we will establish this channel for the benefit of the iranian people . putting limited relief in perspective . in total , the approximately $ 7 billion in relief is a fraction of the costs that iran will continue to incur during this first phase under the sanctions that will remain in place . the vast majority of iran 's approximately $ 100 billion in foreign exchange holdings are inaccessible or restricted by sanctions . in the next six months , iran 's crude oil sales can not increase . oil sanctions alone will result in approximately $ 30 billion in lost revenues to iran -- or roughly $ 5 billion per month -- compared to what iran earned in a six month period in 2011 , before these sanctions took effect . while iran will be allowed access to $ 4.2 billion of its oil sales , nearly $ 15 billion of its revenues during this period will go into restricted overseas accounts . in summary , we expect the balance of iran 's money in restricted accounts overseas will actually increase , not decrease , under the terms of this deal . kerry : israel is safe under new deal . maintaining economic pressure on iran and preserving our sanctions architecture . during the first phase , we will continue to vigorously enforce our sanctions against iran , including by taking action against those who seek to evade or circumvent our sanctions . • sanctions affecting crude oil sales will continue to impose pressure on iran 's government . working with our international partners , we have cut iran 's oil sales from 2.5 million barrels per day -lrb- bpd -rrb- in early 2012 to 1 million bpd today , denying iran the ability to sell almost 1.5 million bpd . that 's a loss of more than $ 80 billion since the beginning of 2012 that iran will never be able to recoup . under this first step , the eu crude oil ban will remain in effect and iran will be held to approximately 1 million bpd in sales , resulting in continuing lost sales worth an additional $ 4 billion per month , every month , going forward . • sanctions affecting petroleum product exports to iran , which result in billions of dollars of lost revenue , will remain in effect . • the vast majority of iran 's approximately $ 100 billion in foreign exchange holdings remain inaccessible or restricted by our sanctions . • other significant parts of our sanctions regime remain intact , including : . -- sanctions against the central bank of iran and approximately two dozen other major iranian banks and financial actors ; . -- secondary sanctions , pursuant to the comprehensive iran sanctions , accountability , and divestment act -lrb- cisada -rrb- as amended and other laws , on banks that do business with u.s.-designated individuals and entities ; . -- sanctions on those who provide a broad range of other financial services to iran , such as many types of insurance ; and , . -- restricted access to the u.s. financial system . • all sanctions on over 600 individuals and entities targeted for supporting iran 's nuclear or ballistic missile program remain in effect . • sanctions on several sectors of iran 's economy , including shipping and shipbuilding , remain in effect . • sanctions on long-term investment in and provision of technical services to iran 's energy sector remain in effect . • sanctions on iran 's military program remain in effect . • broad u.s. restrictions on trade with iran remain in effect , depriving iran of access to virtually all dealings with the world 's biggest economy . • all un security council sanctions remain in effect . • all of our targeted sanctions related to iran 's state sponsorship of terrorism , its destabilizing role in the syrian conflict , and its abysmal human rights record , among other concerns , remain in effect . president obama 's legacy moment on iran .", "summary": " the white house issues a statement
