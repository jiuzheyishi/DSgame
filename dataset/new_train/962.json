{"text": "china 's bayan obo mine produces around half the world 's supply of the 17 ` rare earth ' metals - metals crucial to high-end electronics such as mobile phones , telephones , hi-tech cars and weaponry . few western journalists have ever visited the open-cast mine in china 's inner mongolia - and with reason . it spews out 420,000 cubic feet of toxic gas for every ton of rare metal mined , along with acidic waste water and radioactive material . nasa 's terra satellite has captured the growth of the secretive facility over five years - as china aims to stockpile rare earths to gain an economic advantage against the west . -lsb- caption . rare-earths are so-called because when they were first discovered in the 19th century in sweden , they were believed to be some of the most uncommon elements.but through further scientific discovery , rare-earths have been found to be relatively abundant in the earth 's crust . however , the high cost of extraction means that only areas with rich deposits are worth exploiting.rare-earth metals are typically malleable . they also have high electrical conductivity.they are often extracted from minerals through a process that involves dissolving elements in different liquids - usually water and a solvent.there are 17 rare-earths and their purposes include being used in shielding for nuclear reactors , fibre optics , flatscreen displays and earthquake monitoring equipment . in 2008 , china supplied 139,000 tons worldwide , 97 per cent of the world 's total rare-earth production . the architect of modern china , deng . xiaoping , realised the significance of the elements lurking in the arid . wastes of inner mongolia almost 20 years ago when he said : ` there is oil . in the middle east but there is rare-earth in china . ' with names like cerium , lanthanum , and ytterbium , rare earth elements are n't exactly household names . but the consumer products they are used in - such as magnets , camera lenses , and batteries - certainly are.there are 17 rare earth elements in all , but these key metals are n't as rare as the name suggests . -lrb- in fact , some are relatively abundant in earth 's crust . -rrb- . the vast majority of rare earths -- 96 percent of the market -- come from china . china has a stranglehold on the . global supply of 17 rare earth materials essential for making high-end . goods such as hybrid cars , camera lenses , mobile phones and weapons . about half come from bayan obo , a single mine . on july 2 , 2001 -lrb- below -rrb- and june 30 , 2006 -lrb- above -rrb- , the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer -lrb- aster -rrb- on nasa 's terra satellite acquired these false-color views of the mine in the nei mongol autonomous region.vegetation appears red , grassland is light brown , rocks are black , and water surfaces are green . two circular open-pit mines are visible , as well as a number of tailings ponds and tailings piles . use the image comparison tool to see how the mine has grown larger since 2001 . according to a u.s. geological survey -lrb- usgs -rrb- report , china produced about 81,000 tons of rare earth metals in 2001 ; the number jumped to about 120,000 by 2006 . such an intensive mining operation has a definite impact on the surrounding environment . according to the chinese society of rare earths , 9,600 to 12,000 cubic meters -lrb- 340,000 to 420,000 cubic feet -rrb- of waste gas -- containing dust concentrate , hydrofluoric acid , sulfur dioxide , and sulfuric acid -- are released with every ton of rare metals that are mined . approximately 75 cubic meters -lrb- 2,600 cubic feet -rrb- of acidic wastewater , plus about a ton of radioactive waste residue are also produced . around 100 miles south of baiyun obo , . larger rare-earth refineries sit around the banks of the world 's largest . tailing lake , baogang - seven square miles of evil-smelling toxic waste . that shows the shocking extent of this industry 's impact . a nasa terra satellite image -lrb- captured july 2 , 2001 -rrb- of china 's bayan obo mine located in china 's nei mongol autonomous region , showing two circular open-pit mines , a number of tailings ponds and tailings piles . vegetation appears red , grassland light is brown , rocks are black , and water surfaces are green . according to a usgs report , the united states has enough rare earth elements in the ground to meet global demand for decades to come . but until california 's mountain pass mine recently reopened , few of these minerals were being mined in the u.s.", "summary": " one single mine produces half the world 's supply of ` rare earth ' metals .   seven-mile lake of toxic waste captured by nasa 's terra satellite .   two pictures captured five years apart show huge growth of mine facility .   few westerners have ever visited mine for metals crucial to electronics .
