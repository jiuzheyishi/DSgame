' giles moir , development management manager at east dorset district council , said : ` every applicant is dealt with in exactly the same way . lallana commissioned the large area to be built in the garden of his home in hampshire . but council officers discovered the height of the multi-use games area , in particular the basketball hoops and back boards , was beyond permitted development rules and required planning consent . brian riley , who lives next door to mr lallana 's # 1.5 million five bedroom house said he is concerned about the prospect of noisy sports matches . ` our enforcement team have been in contact with the agent and we anticipate an application for the multi-use games area very soon . ' mike hirsh , a planning consultant acting for mr lallana , said : ` the area of hard standing to be used as a knock-about pitch has been agreed by east dorset district council as ` permitted development ' and does not need planning permission . ` the majority of the fencing is two metres or less in height and also does not need planning permission . ` over the small goal areas fencing has been raised to support a basketball hoop . technically that part needs planning permission as it is more than two metres in height . star in the making : lallana broke into the england side after impressing for southampton . ` my client went around to the neighbour and apologised and has asked a landscape architect to mitigate the visual impact of the hoop .
