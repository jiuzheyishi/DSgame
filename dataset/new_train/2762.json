{"text": "ariel sharon , the former israeli prime minister who died saturday at age 85 , made a name for himself as a military and political leader who put israel 's security above all else . it was a position that earned the controversial figure the nickname  the bulldozer  as a fearless leader who got things done . to many israelis , he was a hero . to some in the arab world , he was a killer . here are five things to know about sharon : . 1 . some saw him as a war hero : . sharon , who rose through the ranks of the israeli defense forces , first gained hero status among israelis during the 1967 six day war that saw israel attack egypt , jordan and syria to counter what they saw as an impending attack by the arab nations . under sharon 's command , israeli troops routed egyptian forces during a nighttime battle to capture um cataf , a crucial crossroads in the sinai . that victory is considered a major factor in egypt 's loss of the sinai to israel . during the 1973 yom kippur war , sharon earned the nickname  the lion of god  among israelis for surrounding egypt 's third army and , defying orders , leading 200 tanks and 5,000 men across the suez canal -- roughly 100 miles from cairo . israelis mourned the death of ariel sharon . 2 . others accused him of war crimes . during the lebanon war in 1982 , sharon -- a former army general then serving as israeli defense minister -- was held indirectly responsible by an israeli inquiry in the 1983 massacre of palestinians by a lebanese christian military at the sabra and shatila refugee camps . the inquiry -- which led to sharon 's prompt resignation -- found he did nothing to stop christian militiamen allied with israel from entering the camps , despite fears they might seek to avenge the killing of their leader the previous day . many in the arab world dubbed sharon  the butcher of beirut ,  and palestinians attempted to bring war crimes charges against him in european courts . 3 . he made a provocative visit to an important mosque . sharon long insisted that a controversial visit to the al-aqsa mosque in jerusalem , one of islam 's most holy sites , in 2000 was not a provocation . but it is considered among many to be one of the flashpoints that sparked the second intifada , a palestinian uprising that followed a failed round of peace talks with israelis . during the visit , sharon walked through the mosque 's compound . within hours , protests over his visit turned violent . the mosque and its compound sits on temple mount , a holy site for jews , that is known to muslims as haram al sharif ,  the noble sanctuary .  at the time , according to published reports , sharon said his visit was intended as a message of peace . but critics have said sharon , already considered a possible contender for israeli prime minister , knew the visit to al-aqsa would spark violence . ariel sharon : a life on front lines of war and politics . 4 . he removed settlers from parts of the west bank and gaza late in his career : . sharon , who early in his political career promoted the establishment of settlements on occupied land , appeared to do an about face in 2005 when he ordered the israeli withdrawal from 25 settlements in the west bank and gaza . under sharon 's order , the military dragged settlers from their homes . the move was part of sharon 's plan to pull israeli troops from gaza , ending nearly four decades of control . while considered an essential move for peace talks , sharon 's right-wing likud party was outraged . it lead sharon to break with his party and form a new one -- kadima , hebrew for  forward .  5 . he suffered strokes , spent years in a coma . sharon was serving as a prime minister when suffered a small stroke in december 2005 . that was followed by a massive stroke in january 2006 that left him on a respirator and in a comatose state . immediately after he fell ill , his power was transferred to vice premier ehud olmert . in april 2006 , israel 's cabinet formally ended his term as prime minister after declaring him permanently incapacitated . the former prime minister 's health fluctuated during the time he was in a coma . in january 2013 , doctors said testing on sharon indicated some brain activity when he was shown photos of his home and heard his son 's voice . cnn 's alan duke and greg botelho contributed to this report .", "summary": " former israeli prime minister ariel sharon is dead at 85 .   sharon had been in coma for past 8 years after suffering massive stroke .   israelis saw him as war hero , but many in arab world see him as a villain .
