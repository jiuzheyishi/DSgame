{"text": "iain duncan smith has launched an incendiary attack on the bbc for ` adopting the language of the labour party ' by branding a key welfare reform a ` bedroom tax ' . in a letter leaked to the daily mail , the work and pensions secretary accuses the corporation of helping to alarm hundreds of thousands of people in social housing who will be unaffected . in the strongest attack on its coverage by a minister since the coalition came to power , he says there has been ` persistent use ' of the term ` bedroom tax ' by bbc correspondents and on the bbc 's news website , despite the phrase being ` innately political and indeed factually wrong ' . iain duncan smith slated the bbc for using the ` innately political ' and ` factually wrong ' term . under the government 's housing benefit reforms , which come into effect in april , working-age claimants in social housing who have more bedrooms than they require will see their handouts reduced . tenants affected will face a 14 per cent cut in housing benefit for the first excess bedroom , and 25 per cent where two or more bedrooms are unused . the government , which estimates the average affected household affected will lose # 14 a week , says the policy will save taxpayers # 500 million a year from the massive housing benefit bill . it will also encourage people to move into smaller properties to relieve pressure on stock , helping families crammed into homes that are too small , ministers say . mr duncan smith says the government is simply cutting what he calls a ` spare room subsidy ' , but labour has mounted a fierce campaign to oppose the move , branding it a ` bedroom tax ' . in a letter dated march 7 , to fran unsworth , the acting head of bbc news , the work and pensions secretary insists : ` it is not a tax and it is wrong to describe it in this way . a tax , as the oxford english dictionary makes clear , is a  compulsory contribution to state revenue , levied by the government on worker 's income and business profits or added to the cost of some goods , services and transactions  . ' fran upsworth is acting head of bbc news and was sent the letter after duncan smith became enraged . he goes on : ` what this policy does it reduce some social housing tenants ' benefit if their home has one or more spare bedrooms . this can not in any way be described as a tax . the bbc gas a duty to inform the public . we believe that the bbc is failing in this duty and confusing members of the public on whether they might be  taxed  . ` this is a public disservice . in using the word tax , the bbc has helped to worry those not in social housing that they might be taxed when this is not the policy . ` it is also a term continually used and promoted by the labour party . ' mr duncan smith says that the government has complained about the unquestioning use of the term before and been led to believe that the bbc , which has a statutory duty to be politically unbiased , accepted it was political and should not be used . but correspondents continue to use it , sometimes with the addition of the words ` critics call ' or ` it 's been called ' , he complains . the work and pensions secretary said he accepts the bbc is right to report that the labour party is calling the policy a tax , but insists its correspondents should make clear that the term is factually incorrect and innately political . ` we do not believe it is the job of the bbc to use misleading terms and promote the views of the labour party , ' he adds . ` rather than doing this , you might care to devote some time to explaining what the government is trying to do -- i 'm sure your audience would value this . ' he points out that on bbc breakfast , moneybox presenter paul lewis talked about how the policy might impact disabled people and foster carers ` without even mention there is millions in support ' for those groups . foster carers and parents of serving armed forces personnel have since been exempted from welfare deductions . ` nor have we heard any of the facts given to you by the department about the thousands of families in overcrowded accommodation or on waiting lists for a home , ' mr duncan smith adds . ` this is not simple debate about the  branding  of a policy . it is about factual accuracy , ensuring the public are properly informed , and being clear about the political nature of terminology that has gained common currency at the bbc . ` the public expects you to do better . ' a bbc spokesperson said :  we can confirm that we have received a letter from iain duncan smith and we will respond directly in due course .  a yougov poll showed that 49 per cent of the public support the government 's reforms , compared to 38 per cent against . labour has opposed the welfare reform , but yesterday there was confusion as one shadow minister suggested it would support it when claimants refused to move to smaller properties . shadow culture minister helen goodman said : ` we have said that the bedroom tax should only apply if people have been offered a smaller place to live and turned it down , because obviously it 's better to use housing stock more efficiently . ' a labour spokesman insisted : ` we strongly oppose the bedroom tax and continue to do so .
