{"text": "house speaker nancy pelosi called president bush  a total failure  on thursday , among the california democrat 's harshest assessments to date of the president . house speaker nancy pelosi says  i disapprove of congress ' performance in terms of ending the war .   god bless him , bless his heart , president of the united states -- a total failure , losing all credibility with the american people on the economy , on the war , on energy , you name the subject ,  pelosi told cnn 's wolf blitzer in an exclusive interview . the comments came two days after the president sharply criticized congress over what he described as relative inaction over the course of the legislative term . at the white house on wednesday , bush noted that there were only 26 legislative days left in the fiscal year and said congress would need to pass a spending bill every other day to  get their fundamental job done .   this is not a record to be proud of , and i think the american people deserve better ,  bush said . watch pelosi respond to criticism of congress from the president  in the interview , pelosi said the president was in no position to criticize congress and brushed aside the criticisms as  something to talk about because he has no ideas .   for him to be challenging congress when we are trying to sweep up after his mess over and over and over again -- at the end of the day , congress will have passed its responsibility to pass legislation ,  she said . ireport.com : why is n't impeachment on the table ? but pelosi 's comments come as a new gallup poll registers the lowest level of congressional approval among americans in the polling organization 's 30-year history of conducting that survey . that poll showed that its approval rating had reached an anemic 14 percent , while more than 70 percent of those polled said they disapproved of the job congress is doing . the house speaker said she does n't consider those numbers a negative referendum on the democrats in charge , saying she thinks they stem largely from congress ' failure to end the war in iraq .  everything i see says this is about ending the war -- ' i disapprove of congress ' performance in terms of ending the war , '  she said .  in the house , we , of course , have over and over , five or six times , sent to the senate legislation for a time certain to reduce our deployment in iraq and bring our troops home safely , honorably and soon . we have n't been able to get it past the senate or the president of the united states . ireport.com : why have n't democrats done more ?  so , on the basis of that , count me among the 70-some percent ,  she continued .  but that is one measure . the other measure that i 'm more interested in is the one that talks about what is their view of democrats . and the generic , who do you prefer to run the country on all of these issues ? we 're in double digits in any poll that you can take .  republican national committee spokesman alex conant derided pelosi 's comments as  the sort of partisan politics that democrats once decried and promised to change .   rather than personally critique others , speaker pelosi should reconsider her own out-of-touch stance against oil exploration ,  he said .  with americans paying record prices at the pump and congress in gridlock , this is no time for the speaker to only offer personal attacks .  in the wide-ranging interview , the entirety of which will air sunday on cnn 's  late edition with wolf blitzer ,  pelosi also reiterated her longtime opposition to lifting a congressional ban on offshore drilling as well as opening up areas such as the arctic national wildlife refuge in alaska for oil exploration . bush and congressional republicans have pushed for those two policy changes . pelosi has long opposed drilling offshore , a popular policy position among californians , many of whom fear its environmental consequences along the state 's coastline . but a recent cnn/opinion research corp. poll showed that more than 73 percent of americans polled approved of lifting the 1981 ban , and the move holds support among many in pelosi 's own party , whose constituents are growing increasingly angry over rising gas prices . pelosi said the oil industry is not aggressively exploring large amounts of federal areas already leased to them and approved for drilling , including 33 million offshore acres and 68 million acres in the lower 48 states . she has sponsored legislation calling on oil companies to increase their production in those areas before they are allowed to go into the offshore areas currently banned .  thirty-three million acres offshore are allowed for leasing ,  she said .  and we 're saying to them , use it or lose it . you have the opportunity to drill there . when you have exhausted those remedies , then you can talk about something else .  she 's also calling on the president to release 10 percent of the more than 700 million barrels of oil housed in the country 's strategic petroleum reserve . bush said tuesday that he is against any release from the reserve , saying that stash is for emergencies only . he also disputed that it would have any effect on lowering gas prices .  what we are saying is , mr. president , free our oil from the strategic petroleum reserve ,  pelosi said .  we 're saying , let 's take 10 percent of that , which has been paid for by the american taxpayer , and use that to put on the market so that we increase supply , reduce price .   and when the price comes down , we can buy back the oil at a lower price , put it in the spr , use the spread for renewable energy resources .  the house speaker has faced heavy criticism from house republican leader john boehner , who is leading a congressional delegation to anwr this weekend and has said pelosi 's action does not adequately address the problem . he 's also said pelosi is leading the moderate faction of her party  off a cliff  by refusing to allow a vote in the house on offshore drilling .  just because john boehner , who is my friend , has my respect , says it does n't make it so ,  she responded , reiterating that she will block any vote to allow lifting the ban .", "summary": " house speaker says president losing all credibility with the american people .   pelosi says she wo n't bring offshore oil drilling to vote .   she says companies should drill in existing allowed areas first .   pelosi defends house 's record , says senate republicans stall legislation .
