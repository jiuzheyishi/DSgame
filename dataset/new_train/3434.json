{"text": "a curiously phallus-shaped prehistoric worm has provided a ` crucial missing link ' to understanding the evolution of certain marine creatures , scientists say . fossilised remains of the creature dubbed spartobranchus tenuis were unearthed in canada 's burgess shale fossil beds , in the yoho national park . the area is one of the most important fossil deposits for understanding the early evolution of life during an era of increasing biodiversity on earth known as the cambrian explosion , which started about 542million years ago . phallic : scientists say this newly described creature , dubbed spartobranchus tenuis , is a common ancestor to two related groups of marine invertebrates whose evolutionary link was previously a mystery . researchers from the university of montreal today published the first full description of the creature , found in an area thought to be about 505million years old , in the journal nature . the strange-looking invertebrate is thought to be a previously unknown ancestor of the acorn worm , or enteropneust , a seldom seen animal that thrives today in the fine sands and mud of shallow and deeper waters . ` unlike animals with hard parts including teeth , scales and bones , these worms were soft-bodied , so their fossil record is extremely rare , ' said study author dr chris cameron . ` our description of spartobranchus tenuis , a creature previously unknown to science , pushes the fossil record of the enteropneusts back 200million years to the cambrian period , fundamentally changing our understanding of biodiversity from this period . ' detailed analysis suggests . spartobranchus tenuis had a flexible body consisting of a short . proboscis , collar and narrow elongate trunk terminating in a bulbous . structure , which may have served as an anchor . the largest complete specimens examined . were 10cm long with the proboscis accounting for about half a . centimetre . it is thought they probably fed on small particles filtered . from seawater . ` crucial missing link ' : the strange-looking invertebrate is thought to be a previously unknown ancestor of the acorn worm , or enteropneust , and the sea stars and sea urchins , known as pterobranchs . enteropneusts , spartobranchus 's modern . day descendants , are themselves part of the hemichordates , a group of . marine animals closely related to today 's sea stars and sea urchins , . known as pterobranchs . since . their discovery in the 19th-century , some of the biggest questions in . hemichordate evolution have focused on the group 's origins and the . relationship between these two branches . the . cambrian explosion , or cambrian radiation , was the relatively rapid . appearance , around 530million years ago , of most major animal phyla , as . demonstrated in the fossil record . before . about 580million years ago , most organisms were simple , composed of . individual cells occasionally organized into colonies . over . the following 70 or 80million years , the rate of evolution accelerated . by an order of magnitude -lrb- as defined in terms of the extinction and . origination rate of species -rrb- and the diversity of life began to resemble . that of today . it ended with the cambrian -- ordovician extinction event , approximately 488million years ago . enteropneusts and pterobranchs look very different , yet share many genetic and developmental characteristics that reveal an otherwise unexpected close relationship . professor simon conway morris from the . university of cambridge , who also worked on the study , told the bbc : . ` enteropneusts look very different from pterobranchs in as much as the . former are worms , whereas the latter are tiny animals , live in tubes , . are colonial and have feeding tentacles . ' the . new insights into spartobranchus tenuis has shown that it was a common . ancestor of both groups , finally providing the missing evolutionary link . between these two groups , the researchers say . ` one . of the big punchlines from my graduate work , was molecular evidence . that enteropneusts and pterobranchs are closely related , ' added dr . cameron , who specialises in the taxonomy , evolution and biogeography of . hemichordates . ` it 's . astonishing how similar spartobranchus tenuis fossils are to modern day . acorn worms , except that they also formed fibrous tubes . ' modern day descendant : enteropneusts -lrb- pictured -rrb- and pterobranchs look very different , yet share many genetic and developmental characteristics that reveal an otherwise unexpected close relationship . a large proportion of these worms was . preserved in tubes , of which some were branched , suggesting the tubes . were used as a dwelling structure . ` the explosive radiation of . graptolites in the paleozoic planktonic ecosystems is known only from . the diversity of their tubes , ' said dr cameron . ` our . findings suggest that the tubes were lost in the lineage leading to . modern day enteropneusts , but elaborated on in graptolites and retained . to the present day in pterobranchs . ' hemichordates . also share many of the same characteristics as chordates -- a group of . animals that includes humans -- with the name hemichordate roughly . translating to ` half a chordate .
