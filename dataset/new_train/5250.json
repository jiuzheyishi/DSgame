{"text": "muhammed rahim al-afghani , who is being held with the most significant terrorism suspects in u.s. custody , has apparently gained extensive knowledge of western pop culture in guantanamo 's camp 7 . an inmate who is imprisoned alongside ` high value ' terrorism suspects in the most secretive of guantanamo bay camps has somehow learned about gangnam style , his lawyer has revealed . mohammed rahim al-afghani , an afghan man who became the last prisoner sent to guantanamo after he was accused of helping osama bin laden elude capture five years ago , has written a series of letters to lawyer carlos warner , revealing a startling knowledge about western culture . across the letters , he refers to howard stern , fox news and the global video hit of south korean singer psy - hardly what you 'd expect from a middle-age afghan who has never been to the u.s. ` dear mr. warner , ' he wrote . ' i like . this new song gangnam style . i want to do the dance for you but can not . because of my shackles . ' in another letter , the multilingual rahim . shows some familiarity with american slang . he tells his lawyer , most . likely in jest , that he has adopted a banana rat , a rodent commonly . spotted around the u.s. base in cuba . ` tell the guards to leave my . friend alone . they need to chillax . ' south korean rapper psy has become a global phenomenon with his signature song and dance , ` gangnam style ' the letters come as a surprise as little has been heard about rahim since his capture . he was interrogated at an undisclosed location then locked away in guantanamo 's camp 7 , a prison unit shrouded in secrecy that holds about 15 men who have been designated ` high value ' detainees . the letters suggest that the prisoners in camp 7 , a group that includes five charged with aiding and orchestrating the september 11 terror attack , are not completely isolated from the outside world . to warner , a federal public defender for the northern district of ohio , the letters humanize a man who he contends has been demonized by u.s. authorities , who allege he worked as a translator and assistant to bin laden and other al-qaida leaders . the lawyer says the letters demonstrate a surprising amount of resilience . ` it shows he 's different and he 's intelligent , ' warner said . ` just think that he 's doing this under all the restrictions that 's he 's under down there . he has an incredibly good sense of humor . ' there have been letters released to the media in the past from other detainees at guantanamo , often providing valuable information about the prison . muhammed rahim al-afghan said that he can not do psy 's signature moves because of his shackles . the justice department document says rahim began helping the taliban in the 1990s and that job morphed into working for al-qaida . it cites two other prisoners and an undisclosed source identifying rahim as a close associate of bin laden . rahim was captured in pakistan in 2007 and turned over to the cia , in whose custody he was subjected to prolonged sleep deprivation . he was transferred to guantanamo in march 2008 . in photos taken by the red cross at camp 7 , and obtained by the ap from the prisoner 's family in afghanistan , rahim has a long flowing beard . in one , he smiles broadly at the camera . it is unclear how the prisoner learned so much of western pop culture from cell 7 in guantanamo , located in cuba . the first letters from rahim released by warner were in june , including one in which he disclosed that majid khan , a former maryland resident who pleaded guilty to aiding al-qaida , had acquired a cat at camp 7 , which ap reported at the time . the pentagon and prison officials declined comment and said they could not discuss conditions of confinement for high-value detainees , although they added that prisoners are not permitted to have pets . rahim al-afghan was accused of helping the late osama bin laden go into hiding ; here , bin laden 's house in abbottabad , pakistan . the rest of the letters came during or after subsequent visits by warner , who had them cleared by the military before releasing them to the ap . none are more than a few sentences , and contain many typographical errors , which have been corrected for this story for the sake of clarity . in one , rahim returns to the theme of his fellow prisoner 's alleged cat . ' i want a dog , ' he writes . ' i will train my dog to chase majid khan 's cat . ' osama bin laden was killed in his home on may 1 , 2011 . in separate notes , he asks warner to appeal for help from radio personality howard stern . ` if he is the ` king of all media ' he can help me . ' in another , he criticizes fox news ' ` fair and balanced ' slogan , writing that if that were true the channel ` would not have to say it every five minutes . ' how he came by this information is not clear . a prison spokesman , navy capt. robert durand , wo n't discuss life in camp 7 but he says that  where satellite television and radio is available for detainees ,  they have access to a wide variety of channels in arabic , farsi , english , russian , spanish and other languages . the line-up , however , apparently does not include howard stern or fox . with no internet access , he could have picked up such information from other shows or through warner , who has spent hours with him and delivered magazines such as rolling stone , sports illustrated and the economist . the u.s. military will not say when or if rahim will be charged . his name does not appear on the list of detainees who have been cleared for release from guantanamo and his name was not among those mentioned as possible candidates for an exchange with the taliban as part of a peace deal .", "summary": " mohammed rahim al-afghani accused of helping osama bin laden elude capture and sent to camp 7 of high-security cuban prison .   written series of letters to his lawyer describing his knowledge of western pop culture .
