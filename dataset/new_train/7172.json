{"text": "late care : new government proposal could see schools staying open until 6pm , education and childcare minister liz truss said . the school day could be lengthened and parents drafted in to run after-hour clubs to reduce the burden of childcare on working mothers and fathers , the government is proposing . schools could stay open as late as 6pm under new plans to increase ` school wrap-around childcare ' which are expected to be announced ` shortly ' , childcare and education minister liz truss told a group of mothers yesterday . the proposals will set out plans for longer school days , which could see local childcare providers called in to look after pupils from 3pm or parents asked to run local school clubs , the minister said . michael gove , the education secretary , recently called for longer school days and a cut in the length of holidays to make life easier for working parents . ms truss said : ` we are hoping to have new proposals out shortly , particularly on schools-based childcare and how we 're going to enable more schools to offer that . ' when challenged by one of the mothers present on how it could work , ms truss said : ` this does n't mean teachers working longer hours . ` it can mean private sector nursery providers , voluntary sector providers or parents running an after school club . ' in her speech to about 50 working women , who are part of the networking group citymothers , the conservative minister said : ` we want more schools to be involved in childcare . ` it 's crazy in this country that we have so many schools open 9am-3pm and then empty afterwards , when they have brilliant facilities . many parents want to work longer than 9am-3pm . ` we 're doing work to enable schools to be able to offer more of those services . ` there are some very good examples of schools that already offer 8am-6pm provision , either using teaching staff , teaching assistants , local nursery staff . there are many ﬂexible ways it can be done . ' share the load : the later hours would see after school clubs run from 3pm-6pm by private sector nursery providers , voluntary sector providers or parents . ms truss , tipped for a promotion in a reshufﬂe next month , called on parents to be ` more demanding ' of schools to stay open longer and make the burden of childcare easier . ` in the case of schools they have an . opportunity to do more , ' she said . parental support : the proposal is set to ease the burden of childcare on working parents . ` as parents we need to be more . demanding of our system . ' under the proposals , the minister also wants school nurseries to be allowed to admit two-year-olds , in order to help parents return to work . currently nurseries have to seek permission and are only entitled to take on three to four-year-olds . during her speech , ms truss criticised the ` complex ' childcare system , where british childcare costs are the second highest in europe , behind only switzerland . ` our parents pay more than double what parents in france and germany are paying on childcare , ' she said , adding that government money put into the system does n't ` ﬂow through to the frontline ' as well as it should . ` at the moment we have a system that is n't working for parents . ' she also defended controversial changes to the childcare vouchers system , which at present is only available for a ﬁfth of employees . the new system will make tax breaks available per child , although it will be less generous to higher-rate taxpayers .", "summary": " government to announce plans to keep schools open until 6pm .   education minister liz truss promised longer hours in speech yesterday .   new plans could see parents drafted in to run after-school clubs .
