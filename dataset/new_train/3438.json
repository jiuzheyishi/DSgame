' fortunately , . his nine-year-old grandson alfie green saw the attack and raised the . alarm . but the bull refused to move until the downdraft from the air . ambulance 's rotors forced it away . alfie ran half a mile back to the family farmhouse and flagged down part-time farm worker andrew clark , who called for help . ` my granddad called me to stay with him but i knew he needed help so i ran as fast as i could , ' said alfie . mr . lawrence was airlifted to the royal lancaster infirmary where his . injuries prompted a transfer to the cardiac care and intensive care unit . at blackpool victoria hospital . surgeon , mr nidal bittar -lrb- left -rrb- , repaired mr haygarth 's ribs using plates and screws . the surgeon likened the procedure -lrb- demonstrated in theory in the image -rrb- to using meccano . surgeons said he was extremely lucky to have survived the attack . ` my lungs were filling up fast with fluid and i could hardly breathe , ' said mr haygarth . ` they just got to me in time .

' likening the procedure to a . ` meccano ' set , he added : ` we now have the technology to stabilise . fractures , pulling the ribs back into place using plates which are . attached to the bone with screws . ' until recently , the only treatment for broken ribs was to strap them up and take painkillers until they had healed . this . could take months and left the patient in danger of complications such . as breathing difficulties , pneumonia and chest deformity . the new technique , synthes rib matrix , sees patients undergo a 2 hour operation which is available both on the nhs and privately . during the surgery , tailor made plates are pinned to the broken bones to speed up recovery and alleviate pain . each plate is about half an inch wide and is shaped to match the contours of the ribs . the recovery time from the operation is only a few days . the plates are left in the body for the rest of the patient 's life .", "summary": " lawrence haygarth was attacked by his bull in a field near tebay , cumbria .   broke 11 ribs , dislocated a shoulder and his sternum and punctured a lung .   his nine-year-old grandson saved him by running half a mile to find help .   he has now recovered following ` meccano ' surgery using plates and screws .
