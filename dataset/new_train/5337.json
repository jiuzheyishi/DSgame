{"text": "grasping her mother 's hand tightly as she waited to go into yet another hospital appointment , it dawned on opera star camilla kerslake how alien the situation felt . of course , the clinical white walls and smell of disinfectant were unfamiliar but it was the role she was playing that suddenly struck her as so very odd . ` my mum has always been my rock , the first person i could turn to when i felt wobbly or vulnerable , ' says camilla , 24 . ` now i was the one reassuring and providing support , while at the same time being quite terrified myself . ' camilla 's feelings were entirely justified because this was n't a routine check-up . it was one of innumerable visits her mother had to make to the royal marsden hospital , west london , to monitor the cancer in her right breast . supporting act : camilla kerslake helped her mother deborah through breast cancer . deborah , 51 , a psychotherapist , was . diagnosed in june last year . it has been a difficult time but camilla , . her partner -- england rugby player chris robshaw -- and her family . believe they have come out of the ordeal closer and stronger . when . deborah was first given the devastating news , camilla 's diary was . crammed with tours , dates and public events . she had just completed a . whirlwind 18 months in which she 'd been nominated for a classical brit , . sang for the queen , had a bestselling debut album and performed at . twickenham and wembley in front of thousands . forthcoming appearances were due to earn her more than # 250,000 , fulfilling her dream of becoming a major music star . ` it . was a simple choice -- i just dropped everything , ' says camilla . ` my . agent said i was mad . we were supposed to be finalising a date i 'd been . asked to do , performing at the crown prince of saudi arabia 's wedding , . and there was an insane amount of money at stake . ` but . my priority was mum . i want to be successful , but what is fame and . money if you do n't have the people you love most in the world ? ' singing for strength : before her mother 's diagnosis , camilla , seen singing at twickenham stadium , was set to make a quarter of a million pounds in planned performances , but she gave it all up . indeed camilla , who shot to fame three years ago after being discovered by take that 's gary barlow , and her mother are incredibly close . the singer , who suffered with severe stage fright , credits deborah for getting her into the spotlight at the beginning of her career after giving her hypnosis . ` people ask me if i am proud of my daughter because of what she has achieved in the music business but what makes me really proud is what a lovely girl she is , ' says deborah . ` all she has ever wanted is a singing career and she was happy to throw it all away for me . i told her not to , her father told her not to but she refused to listen . ' the mother and daughter are speaking just before camilla performs in front of a small , exclusive audience at the grosvenor house apartments by jumeirah living overlooking london 's hyde park . it is the second time she has performed here -- she turned on their christmas lights earlier this month -- and both times , all money raised has gone to breast cancer charities . looking back at the diagnosis , camilla could see that her mother 's health had deteriorated but did not think it was anything serious . ` she had felt tired for the past year , but being fully immersed in her career we all thought she just needed a holiday . there was no history of breast cancer in the family -- she had n't developed any lumps -- so it never occurred to any of us , least of all her . ' team work : camilla says the support from her partner , england and harlequins rugby captain chris robshaw helped her through the tough times . deborah , 51 , a psychotherapist , was . diagnosed in june last year . it has been a difficult time but camilla , . her partner -- england rugby player chris robshaw -- and her family . believe they have come out of the ordeal closer and stronger . when . deborah was first given the devastating news , camilla 's diary was . crammed with tours , dates and public events . she had just completed a . whirlwind 18 months in which she 'd been nominated for a classical brit , . sang for the queen , had a bestselling debut album and performed at . twickenham and wembley in front of thousands . forthcoming appearances were due to earn her more than # 250,000 , fulfilling her dream of becoming a major music star . ` it . was a simple choice -- i just dropped everything , ' says camilla . ` my . agent said i was mad . we were supposed to be finalising a date i 'd been . asked to do , performing at the crown prince of saudi arabia 's wedding , . and there was an insane amount of money at stake . ` but . my priority was mum . i want to be successful , but what is fame and . money if you do n't have the people you love most in the world ? ' ` i had to help in any way i could . it 's not just about going to the doctor 's , it 's about being there , helping , lifting spirits . there are just three of us in my family and we 've helped each other through tough times . ` being so ill meant mum could n't work . my dad works in it and it was really important that he kept his job . then there was me . my job is singing . i do what i do because my parents have always supported me . i just felt this was going to be the most important thing i could do . ' perhaps one unexpected positive to have come out of the dreadful experience , says camilla , is that it brought her closer to chris , 26 . ` family is hugely important to him -- he lost his dad to a heart attack when he was five and he is extremely close to his mum . i 'd spend every day with my mum and then when dad returned from work i 'd go home to chris . he picked me up off the floor so many times . ' in october 2011 , deborah had a full mastectomy and reconstruction of the right breast . it took nine hours to remove and rebuild the area using tissue taken from her stomach . ` that was awful , ' says camilla . ` before that , i think everything had seemed unreal . but suddenly , it was really happening . ` dad and i waved goodbye to mum as she was wheeled through the doors into theatre . as they swung shut , i broke down . i thought that might be it . i ca n't think of that moment now without crying . ' the operation was successful , although there were minor complications with the reconstruction that required a follow-up procedure this february . and because the cancer had not spread to the lymph nodes , deborah did not require additional therapy to treat the condition . ` last christmas was difficult because , . although it was confirmed that the cancer was contained and that she . would not require chemotherapy , mum was still in an awful lot of pain , ' says camilla . ` she just did n't look like her usual strong self . ' but . 12 months on , there is now every reason to celebrate what the new year . has to offer . deborah was given the all-clear in july and now feels . almost entirely back to her normal self . ` i . was incredibly lucky that my cancer treatment and recovery have been . relatively straightforward , ' she says . ` i have discovered a strength i . never knew i had and i have n't had to deal with the trauma of losing a . breast because the day that i lost one , i regained one -- it even has a . nipple ! i think that was a real psychological help . ' mentor : camilla was discovered by gary barlow in 2009 at the age of 21 . nodding her head , camilla agrees : ` i look at mum now and see how much better she is . i appreciate how much more wonderful and beautiful she is than before . this past year has changed me as a person . i feel about ten years older . ' camilla has other reasons to be excited about the year ahead . she has signed a deal for a third album and there has been renewed interest in her career since singing with andrea bocelli last month . ` i had n't done any big concerts for a while but i received a last-minute call asking if i could sing with andrea . the girl he was due to perform with had fallen ill and they needed a replacement . this time i asked mum to help me and she rushed across town with a ballgown . within hours i was singing with him on stage . it was all so fast , i forgot to be terrified . ` it was a magical moment and andrea has now invited me to support him next year . i really did n't expect this huge interest all over again . i feel as if i have a second chance in my career . ' and while camilla is optimistic about her prospects , she admits she does have concerns about her breasts after seeing her mother go through such an ordeal . she has made an appointment to be tested for the brca-1 and brca-2 genes , the presence of which indicates a person is at high risk of developing breast cancer . ` i 've decided if i do have the genes , i will do what needs to be done , ' says camilla . ` i will be sad because i want children and to breast-feed . but it 's about carrying on with life , not vanity , and if it happens , i know i have the best people around me .
