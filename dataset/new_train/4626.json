{"text": "on thursday , dr. kent brantly thought he was going to die . it was the ninth day since the american missionary worker came down sick with ebola in liberia . his condition worsening by the minute , brantly called his wife to say goodbye . thankfully , the call was premature . brantly is back on his feet -- literally -- after receiving a last-ditch , highly experimental drug . another american missionary with ebola got the same . brantly 's and nancy writebol 's conditions significantly improved after receiving the medication , sources say . brantly was able to walk into emory university hospital in atlanta after being evacuated to the united states last week , and writebol is expected to arrive in atlanta on tuesday . on july 22 , brantly woke up feeling feverish . fearing the worst , brantly immediately isolated himself . writebol 's symptoms started three days later . a rapid field blood test confirmed the infection in both of them after they had become ill with fever , vomiting and diarrhea . it 's believed brantly and writebol , who worked with the aid organization samaritan 's purse , contracted ebola from another health care worker at their hospital in liberia , although the official centers for disease control and prevention case investigation has yet to be released . the experimental drug , known as zmapp , was developed by the biotech firm mapp biopharmaceutical inc. , which is based in san diego . the patients were told that the treatment had never been tried before in a human being but had shown promise in small experiments with monkeys . questions about this new ebola drug . according to company documents , four monkeys infected with ebola survived after being given the therapy within 24 hours after infection . two of four other monkeys that started therapy within 48 hours after infection also survived . one monkey that was not treated died within five days of exposure to the virus . brantly and writebol were aware of the risk of taking a new , little-understood treatment and gave informed consent , according to two sources familiar with the care of the missionary workers . in the monkeys , the experimental serum had been given within 48 hours of infection . brantly did n't receive it until he 'd been sick for nine days . the medicine is a three-mouse monoclonal antibody , meaning that mice were exposed to fragments of the ebola virus and then the antibodies generated within the mice 's blood were harvested to create the medicine . it works by preventing the virus from entering and infecting new cells . the ebola virus causes viral hemorrhagic fever , which refers to a group of viruses that affect multiple organ systems in the body and are often accompanied by bleeding . early symptoms include sudden onset of fever , weakness , muscle pain , headaches and a sore throat . they later progress to vomiting , diarrhea , impaired kidney and liver function -- and sometimes internal and external bleeding . the zmapp vials , stored at subzero temperatures , reached the hospital in liberia where brantly and writebol were being treated thursday morning . doctors were instructed to allow the serum to thaw naturally without any additional heat . it was expected that it would be eight to 10 hours before the medicine could be given , according to a source familiar with the process . brantly asked that writebol be given the first dose because he was younger and he thought he had a better chance of fighting it , and she agreed . however , as the first vial was still thawing , brantly 's condition took a sudden turn for the worse . brantly began to deteriorate and developed labored breathing . he told his doctors he thought he was dying , according to a source with firsthand knowledge of the situation . knowing his dose was still frozen , brantly asked if he could have writebol 's now-thawed medication . it was brought to his room and administered through an iv . within an hour of receiving the medication , brantly 's condition dramatically improved . he began breathing easier ; the rash over his trunk faded away . one of his doctors described the events as  miraculous .  by the next morning , brantly was able to take a shower on his own before getting on a specially designed gulfstream air ambulance jet to be evacuated to the united states . writebol also received a vial of the medication . her response was not as remarkable , according to sources familiar with the treatment . however , doctors on sunday administered writebol a second dose of the medication , which resulted in significant improvement . she was stable enough to be evacuated back to the united states . the process by which the medication was made available to brantly and writebol is highly unusual . world health organization spokesman gregory hartl cautioned that health authorities  can not start using untested drugs in the middle of an outbreak , for various reasons .  doctors without borders similarly weighed in on the side of caution .  it is important to keep in mind that a large-scale provision of treatments and vaccines that are in very early stages of development has a series of scientific and ethical implications ,  the organization said in a statement .  as doctors , trying an untested drug on patients is a very difficult choice since our first priority is to do no harm , and we would not be sure that the experimental treatment would do more harm than good .  zmapp has not been approved for human use and has not even gone through the clinical trial process , which is standard to prove the safety and efficacy of a medication . it may have been given under the u.s. food and drug administration 's  compassionate use  regulation , which allows access to investigational drugs outside clinical trials . getting approval for compassionate use is often long and laborious , but in the case of brantly and writebol , they received the medication within seven to 10 days of their exposure to the ebola virus . on july 30 , the defense threat reduction agency , an arm of the military responsible for any chemical , biological , radiological , nuclear and high-yield explosive threats , allotted additional funding to mapp biopharmaceutical due to  promising results .  american ebola patient ` seems to be improving '", "summary": " untested drugs ca n't be used in the midst of an outbreak , spokesman says .   ebola drug zmapp given to dr. kent brantly and nancy writebol .   experimental drug had only been tested in monkeys .
