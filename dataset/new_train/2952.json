{"text": "an eco-friendly building material might have saved some of the 80 homes destroyed in a recent wildfire in southern california . but it ca n't be used there . rajesh kanwar built his alpine , california , house out of aac after his previous house burned down . the masonry material , called autoclaved aerated concrete or aac , can withstand a 2,000-degree fire for four hours , according to underwriters laboratories ' test results .  i just think the material 's awesome . there 's nothing like it ,  said doug edwards , an architect whose edwards design group designs and builds green homes in the scottsdale , arizona , area .  it 's the best building material in the world .  aac is a mixture of sand , water , lime , portland cement and aluminum powder that is formed into blocks and cured in an autoclave , a sort of industrial pressure cooker . it has been used in europe , where it was invented , for more than 70 years . besides being fire-resistant , aac also deadens sound , is energy efficient , is impervious to termites , is bulletproof and waterproof , generates no waste in its creation , and can be recycled , its fans say . see aac survive a fire-and-water test  a sort of concrete bread , it 's full of tiny air pockets , making it one-fifth the weight of traditional concrete , which means more can be transported with less use of fuel . workers can cut it and shape it with hand tools , and its thermal qualities significantly lower energy use , experts say . exton quinn , an architect who fled her santa barbara , california , home as wildfires approached in early may , learned about the material at a green building seminar .  it 's a natural insulator , it 's completely nontoxic , it 's just absolutely fabulous ,  she said .  and with our homes going up here , we should be building with this . ... the idea that we ca n't build with a fireproof material , i think , is insane .  but in california , wildfires are n't the only concern . small earthquakes are part of daily life in many areas , and stronger ones occur fairly frequently . and that 's the regulators ' problem with aac .  autoclaved aerated concrete can not be used to resist seismic forces because it has not been seismically tested ,  said david walls , executive director of the california building standards commission in sacramento . the restriction is based on guidelines from the national earthquake hazards reduction program , he said . the next international building code , slated to take effect in 2011 , will permit use of aac in more places that have minimal seismic activity , walls said . but even under those somewhat relaxed standards , most of california would not qualify , he added . advocates for the product say california 's qualms are baseless -- and political .  we 've done all the testing , and the testing showed the material works fine in any seismic area ,  said felipe babbitt , a mesa , arizona , engineer who helped develop code standards for aac block .  it has not been approved by california not because it ca n't perform , but because they have not done a thorough review of the testing data and are not convinced that it performs .  california 's standards are no different from those of other states , walls insisted .  we base ours off the national model code . for the most part , for private buildings in california , we do not add any extra stuff ,  he said .  so it would be strictly based on what is the national standard .  that 's not entirely true , babbitt said . california is the only state that adopted the 2006 international building code without the companion housing code that includes acceptance of aac in seismic areas , he said . the two documents were meant to be applied in tandem , he said .  a lot of it 's politics ,  babbitt said .  everybody 's protecting their own interests . you 've got the wood industry protecting theirs , you 've got the steel protecting theirs , and the aac is just going up against all these people .  the aac industry has n't been around long enough yet to earn its place in the code , he said . wood , on the other hand , faces no challenge despite its obvious vulnerability to wind , fire , flood , pests , mold and earthquakes , he said .  each state has different code adoption laws and processes ,  walls responded by e-mail .  i can not explain what or why any other state makes their choices . i can tell you that california has never adopted a residential code .  another architect is n't satisfied .  what is baffling is this is a product that could be enormously beneficial in california ,  said michael mcdonough , a world-renowned new york architect who specializes in sustainable industry .  the testing standards they are rejecting are the testing standards that are used in 49 other states , and they 've been extant for 10 years .  therefore we believe it 's reasonable to assume there 's some other agenda than the standards ,  he said .  this stuff has been tested within an inch of its life .  walls denies that politics played a role .  i have been involved in the code adoption in california for more that eight years and i am not aware of any ` agenda ' in california ,  he wrote in an e-mail . mike quaka , vice president-general manager of manufacturer aercon florida in haines city , florida , defended his company 's product .  from all of our independent testing , it meets all the seismic zones , just as it does in europe ,  he said .  i think there 's a lot of external variables floating out there when we talk about california and aac . ... we can build anywhere else without a hiccup .  richard klingner , an expert in earthquake-resistant design at the university of texas at austin , conducted what the industry considers the definitive tests of aac in 2000 and found it more than adequate to handle seismic loading .  in my opinion , testing done by me and others has demonstrated that ductile shear walls of aac can safely be used anywhere in the u.s. ,  klingner said in an e-mail from venezuela , where he was giving a lecture on the seismic resistance of masonry . ductile shear walls are walls that flex slightly to resist lateral force , the main cause of damage in earthquakes .  i do not know why aac has not had wider acceptance in california ,  he wrote .  it may be a combination of lack of familiarity , caution , and ` not invented here . ' that 's too bad , because aac offers many advantages .  a few houses made of aac are scattered around california , built before restrictions were put in place . one is in alpine , built by rajesh kanwar and lori ende after their previous house burned down in the 2003 cedar fire , which killed 13 people and destroyed more than 2,000 homes .  when our home burned down , i looked into materials that were less likely to burn down ,  said kanwar , who runs a small business .  before i went to the material , i did a substantial amount of ground work to make sure i was n't doing something which was going to come back and bite me ,  he said .  so when i looked into that , i did n't just look into the fireproof aspect of it , i also looked into the seismic aspect of it , because i was really concerned about that .  and from everything i learned ... it has done very well under earthquake conditions .  aercon 's quaka admits to being a little discouraged by the long struggle for acceptance in california .  you beat your head against a door so many times , your head gets sore . and we 're not there yet with california , but our heads are pretty bloody .
