' mr mistry said : ` he did tell me that , yes . ' mr myerson continued : ` is it the case mr bates said  do n't worry about service - we are going to put a radio announcement out  ? ' ` absolutely not , ' mr mistry replied . ` procedure is procedure . ' on hearing about the reported sighting of the levis , mr mistry said : ` if it was concrete we would have acted upon it . ' the lawyer told the court he did not instruct the relevant people to serve the legal papers as he wanted to keep legal costs down for mr bates and leeds united . in 2009 , mr levi successfully sued mr bates for libel over articles written in the programme , and the leeds chairman was ordered to pay # 50,000 damages plus costs to mr levi . the court has heard that yorkshire radio broadcast an announcement during leeds ' home match against leicester city on boxing day 2010 , asking anyone who knew mr levi 's whereabouts to contact the club . mr levi 's witness statement said : ` i understand from people i have spoken to who were listening to the broadcast that an announcement was made before the match and again at half time asking if anyone knew of my whereabouts and , if so , to contact the club who wished to serve me with legal papers . ` i am told by people at the match that a similar announcement was made over the club tannoy system during and/or before the home match against middlesbrough on january 1 , 2011 . ` the people who i have spoken to who heard the announcement have said they assumed i was some sort of fugitive .
