{"text": "probe : mark thompson becomes ceo of the new york times . company next month - but a scandal at his former employers , the bbc , hangs . over him . a growing scandal at britain 's public broadcaster , the bbc , over allegations of sexual abuse at the hands of a once-beloved tv host has cast a shadow over the arrival of the new york times ' new boss . mark thompson left his position as the bbc 's director general to take up the role of the times company 's chief executive , but now a police inquiry into the accusations could force him to answer tough questions as he begins the job in november . in a case that has been referred to as ` britain 's sandusky scandal ' , a group of alleged victims - some as young as 13 - have claimed that late tv host jimmy savile abused them over six decades - during which time he was employed by the broadcaster . savile was the eccentric host for bbc favourites , including jim 'll fix it , where he granted children 's . wishes over its 20-year run , and top of the pops , a popular chart music show that aired for . more than four decades . savile , who was knighted in 1990 , died last year at the age of 84 after a visit to hospital with pneumonia . now , . scores of men and women have stepped forward to claim he abused them . when they were young after rival broadcaster itv reported on the . allegations earlier this month . much . of savile 's career involved working with children , including visiting . schools and hospital wards , and many of his victims have claimed he . seized these opportunities to molest them . the . metropolitan police in london has confirmed they are investigating 40 . cases involving incidents across the country dating back to 1959 , yet . they have received a total of 340 lines of inquiry . host : savile hosted bbc show jim 'll fix it , on which he granted wishes to children , for two decades . long-serving : savile also hosted top of the pops , a chart music show which ran between 1964 and 2006 . while he was interviewed by police in his lifetime , allegations were dropped due to lack of evidence . former bbc executives admitted there had been rumors about savile , but dismissed suggestions they had turned a blind eye to the indiscretions of celebrities . some of the alleged abuse is believed to have taken place on the bbc premises . on sunday , times ' former executive editor bill keller wrote a column drawing a parallel between savile and penn state football coach jerry sandusky , sentenced to life in jail for molesting children . ` whether the bbc fell short in its reporting and missed the story or had the story and lacked the nerve , it is a significant embarrassment , compounded by the hard question of why the widespread rumors of savile 's behavior were ignored for so long , ' keller wrote . the allegations mean that thompson , who joined the bbc as a trainee in 1979 , will not be able to leave the job behind just yet , as he may become embroiled in the police and parliamentary inquiries . scandal : the case has been likened to that of former penn state football coach , jerry sandusky , who has been jailed for the rest of his life for sexually abusing children . colleagues failed to report the abuse . thompson quickly rose up the ranks at . the broadcaster , working on shows such newsnight , a nightly current . affairs program known for its analysis and examinations of the country 's . politicians . in fact , newsnight had worked on its own investigation into the savile allegations in december last year but cancelled it , leading to accusations of a cover up . the bbc has denied this and is currently investigating the matter and cooperating with police . newsnight 's . editor , peter rippon , said they had shelved the program after public . prosecutors dropped their case due to a lack of evidence . an . article in the new york times on saturday noted thompson was at the top . job at the bbc when the newsnight investigation was dropped . thompson , 55 , . said in a statement : ' i was not notified or briefed about the newsnight . investigation , nor was i involved in any way in the decision not to . complete and air the investigation . television stalwart : saville was knighted by the queen in 1996 . he died last year , aged 84 . scandal : the london police are now investigating 40 allegdations of sex abuse at the hands of savile dating back to 1959 . some incidents allegedly took place on bbc premises . earlier this month , itv , a rival network to the bbc , aired a documentary , exposure : the other side of jimmy savile . on the program , which was researched by a former police detective , several women claimed they had been molested by the long-serving tv host after he obtained access to them through his shows and charity work . ex-bbc staff said bosses had ` turned a blind eye ' to his behaviour and that it had been an ` open secret ' . a revered advocate of child protective services , esther rantzen , said she had heard rumours that he was inappropriate with children . and one bbc radio boss , douglas muggeridge , called for an investigation into the allegations in 1973 as he feared them coming out in the press - but did not make full inquiries as ` he felt they lacked weight ' . it also emerged that current affairs program newsnight had planned to air an investigative report into the allegations in december 2011 , but later dropped it . bosses denied a cover up , instead insisting they shelved the program after public . prosecutors dropped their case due to a lack of evidence . following the documentary , an investigation was launched and other victims - both men and women - started coming forward . witnesses to the alleged incidents , including a hospital worker who claimed she saw savile molest a brain-damaged patient in 1971 , also spoke out . police said they are investigating 40 . cases dating back to 1959 , yet . they have received a total of 340 lines of inquiry . savile , who died last year aged 84 , was interviewed by police in his lifetime but investigations were dropped due to lack of evidence . ' i . have no reason to doubt the public statement by the program 's editor , . peter rippon , that the decision not to pursue the investigation was . entirely his , and that it was made solely for journalistic reasons . ` during my time as director general of the bbc , i never heard any allegations or received any complaints about jimmy savile . ' there is no evidence to suggest that thompson knew about the decision to axe the program or about savile 's alleged behaviour . colleagues insist he had nothing to do with the editorial process of newsnight . ` the chances that mark interfered in the . decisions of newsnight as to whether or not they were going to broadcast . the story are precisely zero , ' said mark damazer , a long-time colleague . at the bbc . in the years when their careers overlapped , thompson was in the news and current affairs area of the company rather than in its entertainment arm where savile worked until retiring in 1994 . george entwistle , who took over as director general from thompson , said the allegations have ` truly shocked ' him . he added : ` if there are lessons we can learn then we must do so to ensure that the mistakes of the past should never be repeated . ' a representative for the new york times would not comment on the bbc investigations . yet the situation is far from ideal for thompson or the new york times , kelly mcbride , a senior faculty member for ethics at the poynter institute , a journalism school and media think tank , told reuters . ` it really depends what else comes out and how closely he can be tied to the scandal at the bbc , ' said mcbride . ` if it 's just guilt by association most of the time organizations are fine with that . ' thompson was named ceo of the new york times co in august , capping an eight-month search for an executive to lead the company after chief executive janet robinson was abruptly ousted last year . he was hired by the times co in part . because of his extensive experience in video and digital , and because of . his skills in corporate diplomacy . shaky start : thompson was named as ceo of the new york times company in august and starts in november . while at the bbc , thompson helped develop the digital iplayer , which enables viewers to catch up on missed programs online for free . it was considered a huge hit among those viewing the olympics . he has been lauded for guiding the public broadcaster through morale problems , assaults from rupert murdoch 's media empire and threats to its funding by the british government . indeed , news corp chairman rupert murdoch , whose own company 's u.k. phone-hacking scandal has been covered extensively by both the bbc and the new york times , seized on the opportunity to jab at his rivals on twitter . ` look to new ceo to shake up nyt unless recalled to bbc to explain latest scandal , ' murdoch tweeted .", "summary": " mark thompson joins new york times co. in november following role as director general of britain 's public broadcaster , the bbc .   bbc embroiled in sex scandal involving late tv host , jimmy savile .   savile ` abused children and young people he met through his shows '   fifteen police forces across the uk are investigating claims from 40 ` victims '   colleagues ` knew of the abuse but did not report it ' "}
