{"text": "last night 's shooting rampage at a movie theater in aurora , colorado , was a nightmare . authorities have already arrested a suspect . four weapons were recovered in the shooting scene , including a shotgun and two handguns . twelve people have been killed , with many more injured . according to law enforcement officials , the weapons were purchased legally by the suspect in the last six months . the shooting was senseless . and it makes us think once again about how we can address the horrific problem of gun violence in america . the first task is conceptual -- can we figure out what will work ? the second task is political -- can plausible solutions be implemented legislatively ? opinion : gun control wo n't stop mass murder . the conceptual problem is immensely difficult , especially in a society that is already as gun-saturated as america is today . the political problem borders on the impossible . gun policy in this country is made by the national rifle association , and no serious effort at gun control can currently get past its veto . even when legislation passed during the clinton years in the form of the brady bill , requiring background checks at the time of gun purchases , or the assault weapons ban , the nra succeeded in injecting gaping loopholes into the laws . who needs to go through a background check at walmart when you can get your gun without one at the local gun show or from some shady figure on a street corner ? the assault weapon ban only prohibited the manufacture of new guns -lrb- it grandfathered in a huge cache of pre-existing weapons -rrb- and gun manufacturers easily redesigned their guns to circumvent the ban . the nra then trumpets how  gun control  does n't work . but it can . commenters debate guns , ` what if ' consider what happened in australia after a crazed gunman killed 35 people in port arthur , tasmania , in 1996 . the australian federal government persuaded all states and territories to implement tough new gun control laws . under the national firearms agreement -lrb- nfa -rrb- , firearms legislation was tightened throughout the country . national registration of guns was imposed and it became illegal to hold certain long guns that might be used in mass shootings . the gun ban was backed up by a mandatory buy-back program that substantially reduced gun possession in australia . ireporter : ` ak-47 a weapon for war ' the effect was that both gun suicides and homicides -lrb- as well as total suicides and homicides -rrb- fell . importantly , while there were 13 mass shootings in australia during the period of 1979 -- 96 , there have been none in the sixteen years since . in 1996 , then-prime minister john howard stated that the  whole scheme is designed to reduce the number of guns in the community and make australia a safer place to live .  the australian attorney general praised the cooperation and responsibility of australian firearms owners with the gun controls and buy-back , saying ,  they have been paid cash for their firearms - giving our nation a welcome christmas gift by removing unnecessary high-powered firearms from the community . it offers all of us the real chance of a safer festive season and new year .  opinion : can we feel safe in a crowd anymore ? of course , the australian gun control law in 1997 enjoyed an extremely high level of public support and was not hampered by any domestic gun industry -lrb- since australia did not have any -rrb- . such would not be the case in the united states where pro-gun political views and nra power create a very different climate . in the wake of another tragic massacre of innocent lives , we should look carefully at the australian experience to see if the american public will ever rise up as one against gun violence . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of john j. donohue .", "summary": " a gunman went on a shooting rampage in a movie theater in colorado .   john j. donohue : our gun policy is made by the nra .   look to australia in formulating an effective gun control policy , he says .   donohue : the question is , will our country ever unify against gun violence .
