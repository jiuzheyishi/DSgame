{"text": "the goce satellite , also known as the ` ferrari of space ' , is expected to make a fiery fall to earth sometime between the end of this month and the start of november . with a sleek , aerodynamic design responsible for it being dubbed the ` ferrari of space ' , goce has mapped variations in earth 's gravity with extreme detail . after more than four years on its mission , the one-tonne goce satellite will fall rapidly through the atmosphere , burning up as it descends . scroll down for video ... with a sleek , aerodynamic design responsible for it being dubbed the ` ferrari of space ' , goce has mapped variations in earth 's gravity with extreme detail . full name : gravity field and steady-state ocean circulation explorer . launched : 17 march 2009 . number of instruments : 3 . nominal life : 20 months . mission cost : $ 350 million -lrb- # 295 million -rrb- . orbit : about 260 km altitude , polar , sun-synchronous . mass : 1100 kg . size : 5.3 m long , about 1m body diameter . this is the first uncontrolled re-entry of a european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- satellite since 1987 . at a height of 224km , goce 's orbit is so low that it experiences drag from the outer edges of . earth 's atmosphere . the satellite 's streamline structure and use of . electric propulsion system counteract atmospheric drag to ensure that . the data are of true gravity . while most of goce will disintegrate in the atmosphere , esa expects that around 25 per cent might reach earth 's surface . when and where these parts might land can not yet be predicted , but the affected area will be narrowed down closer to the time of re-entry . taking into account that two thirds of earth is covered by oceans and vast areas are thinly populated , the danger to life or property is very low . about 40 tonnes of manmade space debris reach the ground per year , but the spread and size mean the risk of an individual being struck is lower than being hit by a meteorite . the gravity field and steady-state ocean circulation explorer -lrb- goce -rrb- has been orbiting earth since march 2009 at the lowest altitude of any research satellite . during its mission , it has produced a unique model of the ` geoid ' , which is essentially a virtual surface where water does not flow from one point to another . during its mission , goce has produced a unique model of the geoid , which is essentially a virtual surface where water does not flow from one point to another . the colours in the image represent deviations in height from an ideal geoid . the blue shades represent low values and the reds/yellows represent high values . around mid-october , the mission will come to a natural end when it runs out of fuel and the satellite begins its descent towards earth from a height of about 224km . re-entry is expected to happen about three weeks after the fuel is depleted . an international campaign is monitoring the descent , involving the inter-agency space debris coordination committee . the situation is being continuously watched by the european space agency 's space debris office , which will issue re-entry predictions and risk assessments .", "summary": " goce has spent four years mapping earth 's gravity with incredible precision .   it 's return will be the first uncontrolled re-entry of an esa satellite since 1987 .   the risk of an individual being struck is lower than being hit by a meteorite .
