{"text": "in late may 2011 , mitt romney made his first campaign jaunt to south carolina , a primary state that bedeviled him during his first presidential campaign and would prove just as vexing in his second . romney 's difficulties with the conservative base are now well-documented . but among his many problems on the right , immigration was n't one of them . on that may afternoon in south carolina , romney , his sleeves rolled up and shirt tucked neatly into bluejeans , came prepared to answer a range of tough questions . he delivered a defense of his health care law and equivocated on a controversial medicare plan being debated in congress . he did n't expect to have to talk about immigration , but one activist who felt like a party crasher in the small , hand-picked audience wanted to know if romney backed amnesty for  illegals .  romney said no , matter-of-factly outlined his positions , and the voter departed seeming satisfied . the point is this : even if immigration fails to register as a top issue in the polls -- only 3 % of americans called it the country 's  most important problem  in a recent gallup survey -- the topic continues to burn white hot as a litmus test among a passionate and vocal slice of the gop primary electorate . opinion : big surprise ahead on immigration . even when immigration reform is not on the calendar in congress -- and it was n't during the 2012 campaign -- it routinely bubbles up in republican primary campaigns , popping up in town hall meetings , on talk radio and online . and it 's not just the dreaded  comprehensive  immigration reform effort that roils grassroots activists ; for a defiant portion of the gop base -lrb- looking at you , steve king -rrb- , any kind of reform is non-negotiable . despite efforts by top republicans in washington to improve the party 's miserable image among hispanic voters , not much has changed since the 2012 primary campaign , when gop voters tore down texas gov. rick perry for telling a debate audience that they did n't  have a heart  if they opposed in-state college tuition for young illegal immigrants . undocumented immigrant lawyer speaks out . a sweeping senate immigration bill is stalled in the house , effectively dead and nailed into its coffin by its own republican co-sponsor , sen. marco rubio , who now opposes it . house speaker john boehner says he is open to passing a series of smaller fixes . at the same time , numerous elected gop officials made intemperate comments about hispanic immigrants . this is the party that new jersey gov. chris christie , who will ceremonially sign a new jersey version of the dream act this week , must face if he decides to seek the republican presidential nomination in 2016 . and at first glance , his support for the bill , which allows undocumented immigrants who have attended new jersey high schools for three years to pay in-state college tuition rates , is problematic . christie reaches immigration deal with new jersey democrats . having won re-election last november with a majority of hispanic voters , christie 's support for the so-called tuition equality bill is another notch in his belt as he cultivates an image as a republican who can appeal to independent voters and nontraditional constituencies . he is , his supporters believe , a gop candidate who can actually win a national election . but in the hothouse context of a republican primary , which he must win to get to a national election , signing the tuition bill seems like yet another example of christie unfurling a giant middle finger to the very voters whose support he will need once the presidential race begins in earnest this november . the biggest sin conservatives point to when discussing christie is symbolic : his arm-in-arm tour of the new jersey coastline with president obama after hurricane sandy , lending the president a veneer of bipartisan street cred just days before the 2012 presidential election . there are other apostasies : gun control measures signed in trenton , a gushing buddy-buddy appearance with bill clinton at a policy conference in chicago last summer , and his spirited defense of the country 's surveillance and drone efforts , a position that rankles libertarians . brandon patterson , a 23-year-old student at the pat roberston-founded regent university in virginia , summed up the prevailing conservative attitude toward christie at last summer 's faith and freedom coalition conference in washington .  he is not very popular here ,  patterson said .  nobody is excited to support him at all . nobody that i know of . he 's a moderate .  talk to any strategist backing his potential gop opponents , and you 'll hear a similar take on christie 's decision to sign the dream act : supporting tuition breaks for illegal immigrants burnishes his reputation with the amtrak corridor pundit class , but it cements christie 's status as persona non grata at the pizza ranches of western iowa and diners of new hampshire .  this amnesty bill is just another in a really , really long list of reasons why republican primary voters do n't trust christie ,  said a national gop operative working for a likely 2016 rival .  from guns , to sandy spending , to hugging obama , he 'll have a tough time winning any early state primaries . unless , of course , ` morning joe ' holds an early state republican primary that i 'm unaware of .  but there 's another way to look at it : the conservatives who despise christie for signing the tuition bill probably would n't support him anyway . they might not like him , but he does n't need them , either . let those conservatives flock to ted cruz and rand paul and rick santorum . the silent plurality of republican primary voters -- the blue hairs , the country clubbers , the rotarians -- do n't garner the kind of media attention ginned up by tea party groups and outspoken pastors , but they vote . after all , mitt romney , that squishy scion of the hated  establishment ,  lost the iowa caucuses by only 34 votes . and whatever failings christie may have , few dispute that he has natural political talents and a rapport with voters that romney never had . reid says boehner will compromise on immigration reform . the dynamics of the 2012 race were different than they will be in 2016 ; a fiscal conservative like wisconsin gov. scott walker could clog christie 's lane in the business community . but early state operatives sympathetic to christie are hopeful that there will be even more space in 2016 for a candidate who wants the party to expand its popular appeal . tim albrecht , a republican operative in iowa and former adviser to gov. terry branstad , pointed out that the iowa house passed a version of the dream act way back in 2004 . -lrb- the bill , however , did not become law . -rrb- .  led by a republican majority , the iowa house unanimously passed the dream act in 2004 ,  albrecht said in an e-mail .  iowa has been ahead of the curve on this issue , and republicans value fairness . while there will be a vocal minority speaking out against immigration reform , a majority of republicans and caucus-goers will not take issue with gov. christie 's position on the dream act , and in growing circles it will gain him support .  and for those without long memories , one only needs to look back to 2008 to find a republican candidate who bucked the party faithful on a range of issues , including immigration , and won the presidential nomination . john mccain ran for president while the immigration overhaul he backed was collapsing in congress . his campaign fell apart in the process , but mccain recovered and mounted a remarkable comeback , facing questions about immigration all the while . in a crowded republican field , he even won south carolina , that conservative bastion , by courting the party establishment and cobbling together a coalition of coastal newcomers , moderate suburbanites and national security hawks in a state loaded with military families and veterans . ever since the barry goldwater wipeout of 1964 , no republican candidate has won the republican nomination without having at least one foot planted firmly on the establishment side of the party divide . this is the bet christie is making , so do n't expect him to back away from signing the tuition bill , or any of piece of legislation , once he makes his barely concealed presidential campaign official . as long as christie is up front about where he stands , his positions may not hurt him as much as the right claims , said robert cahaly , a longtime republican operative in south carolina .  it 's running over a political speed bump , not into a brick wall ,  cahaly said of christie 's support for the tuition bill .  he 's got to do what he thinks is right and not apologize for it . sort of his schtick .   now is as good a time as any to get it out of the way ,  cahaly said .  it 's kind of like that fight you 've got to have with your bother over that lawnmower he wrecked . do n't put it off all summer . it 's better for the thanksgiving table . south carolina gop voters have forgiven and forgotten much more . ask john mccain . ", "summary": " immigration reform remains a litmus test among gop primary voters .   possible 2016 candidate chris christie will sign new jersey 's version of the dream act .   bill allows undocumented immigrants who attended high school to pay in-state rate .   gop operative says as long as christie is up front about his position , it might not hurt him .
