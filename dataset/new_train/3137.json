{"text": "thought you 'd waved goodbye to spots in your teens ? think again . adult acne is on the rise , with one recent study revealing that more than a quarter of women in their 40s and 15 per cent of women in their 50s suffer from embarrassing and painful break-outs . acne is caused when an excess of the skin 's natural oil -lrb- sebum -rrb- combines with dead skin cells to block the pores . these blocked pores can then become infected by bacteria that feeds on sebum . in just the same way that hormones wreak havoc on our skin during the teenage years so , too , are they the main culprit as we hit middle age . this is because testosterone triggers higher sebum production , and as we get older , we produce less oestrogen to balance our body 's production of testosterone . cue unsightly blemishes . scroll down for video . adult acne is on the rise , with one recent study revealing that more than a quarter of women in their 40s and 15 per cent of women in their 50s suffer from embarrassing and painful break-outs . indeed , leading dermatologist and acne specialist dr stefanie williams says : ` adult acne is at epidemic levels . increased stress caused by the pace of work and modern life , can all cause or aggravate acne . ' but there are also many other , lesser known , triggers that help unwelcome spots to appear . here , leah hardy unmasks the hidden skin saboteurs . bugs on yoga mats . problem : your workout is great for your body , but could be terrible for your skin , especially on your back , chest and shoulders . this is because of ` acne mechanica ' or ` friction acne ' as it 's otherwise known , which occurs when tight clothing or straps hold sweat against the skin . the irritation increases sebum production in pores , which leads to whiteheads , blackheads and pimples . ` acne mechanica ' or ` friction acne ' as it 's otherwise known occurs when tight clothing or straps hold sweat against the skin . put a clean towel over your gym or yoga mat when you work out . so the helmet you 've worn while you 're cycling ; your sports bra strap or even your tight gym top could all be making your skin break out . also watch out for your yoga mat . bacteria from the floor , feet and sweat can accumulate and transfer to your face . in a 2012 study from the new york university school of medicine , gym surfaces were found to be infected with a bacterium that can cause acne , boils and folliculitis . folliculitis is an infection of the hair follicles which causes a nasty acne-like attack of red spots . in a 2012 study from the new york university school of medicine , gym surfaces were found to be infected with a bacterium that can cause acne , boils and folliculitis . solution : first , put a clean towel over your gym or yoga mat when you work out . wipe down equipment before use . ensure your gym kit is clean and made of breathable ` wickable ' materials that hold moisture away from your body such as nike 's dri-fit or adidas climacool . if you prefer natural fabrics , look for bamboo and cotton mixes which do the same . make sure nothing 's too tight so sweat does n't get trapped and the skin is n't irritated . have several sports bras of different styles and use a different one each time so you do n't get rubbing in the same place . afterwards , always shower to remove sweat and bacteria , and put on clean clothes . if your acne is painful , see your gp . if it is itchy , ask for anti-fungal treatments and use an anti-dandruff shampoo as a body wash in the shower . oily shampoos . acne caused by oily shampoos , conditioners and styling products is so common , it has its own name : ` pomade acne ' problem : acne caused by oily shampoos , conditioners and styling products is so common , it has its own name : ` pomade acne ' . cosmetic dermatologist dr rachael eckel says : ` as they are rinsed out in the shower , oily , rich shampoos and conditioners drip over the forehead , shoulders and back , causing acne . ` they can also cause folliculitis , the itchy , acne-like outbreak of spots , on the upper back . ' greasy hair-styling products can do the same as they tend to transfer from the hair to the skin , especially around the hairline , blocking pores and irritating skin . this is even more likely if you have a fringe , perhaps cut to cover spots in the first place . solution : wash and condition your hair at the beginning of your shower and rinse immediately . then tie your hair up and wash your face and body to remove any oil left behind . ` i encourage patients who are breaking out in new areas , like the forehead or temples , to double-check their haircare products for oily and pore-clogging ingredients like coconut oil , and eliminate them , ' says cosmetic surgeon dr sam bunting . avoid hair oils completely if you are acne-prone . try a light , oil-free shampoo such as neutrogena t/gel shampoo -lrb- from # 4.99 -rrb- . for the body , try neutrogena body clear wash -lrb- # 8.95 -rrb- . anti-ageing creams . problem : the pressure to stay looking young means skincare creams can be too intensive , too rich or too unsuited to many women 's skin . ` women today are much more concerned about anti-ageing , ' says dr williams . ` however , often these creams are far too heavy for their skin type and end up blocking pores and causing acne . ' solution : if you have oily skin or acne , avoid putting anything with oil on your face , especially almond oil , apricot kernel oil and oleic acid -- a fatty acid found in olive and grape seed oil . beware of heavy , pore-blocking -- and , therefore , acne-causing -- ingredients such as lanolin and cocoa butter particularly if they 're one of the main ingredients . and beware of the moisturising agent isopropyl isostearate and isopropyl myristate , which makes cosmetics feel creamy . try lotions which tackle both ageing and acne such as triacneal by avene -lrb- # 23 -rrb- and effaclar duo + by la roche posay -lrb- # 15.50 -rrb- . drinking skimmed milk . if you ave swapped full-fat milk for skimmed , you could be damaging your skin . problem : if you eat a lot of bread and pasta and have swapped full-fat milk for skimmed , you could be damaging your skin . ` as you hit your 40s and 50s , you can become insulin-resistant , which means your body is less able to metabolise sugar , ' says dr williams . ` starchy foods such as bread and pasta are broken down in the body so they are indistinguishable from liquid sugar . high blood sugar stimulates insulin which can worsen inflamed acne . ' milk may also be troublesome . while all types of milk are linked with increased acne , a 2007 study found skimmed is the worst . women who drank the equivalent of two or more glasses of skimmed milk per day were 22 per cent more likely to develop ordinary acne , and 44 per more likely to develop cystic acne , which causes painful , large and deep spots that do n't come to a head . why ? nobody is sure , but it is likely to be because milk contains hormones which can cause an imbalance in human hormones . the key culprit may be insulin-like growth factor-1 , or igf-1 , a natural hormone which seems to increase skin cell growth in the lining of the pores , which then become blocked . it 's thought that processing milk by removing fat may remove the hormone oestrogen which is stored in fat and protects against the male hormones that cause acne . solution : stick to a low gi diet -- which is rich in high-fibre foods which release sugar slowly into the blood stream , thereby keeping blood glucose levels steady . also switch to unsweetened almond milk which does not contain hormones . ` i recommend cutting out sugar and all starchy , grain-based foods , including bread , pasta , and breakfast cereals . instead , eat unprocessed protein such as fish , meat and eggs , lots of vegetables and fruit in moderation , ' says dr williams . the natural process of fermentation in yoghurt breaks down igf-1 , so full-fat yoghurt is less likely to trigger acne . washing your face too much . when prone to break-outs , many women try to desperately scrub away oil and sebum build-up . but this can make matters worse . problem : when prone to break-outs , many women try to desperately scrub away oil and sebum build-up . but this can make matters worse . cosmetic doctor mervyn patterson says the wrong cleansers will dry the skin , causing acne . this is because healthy skin is protected by the ` acid mantle ' , a fine , slightly acidic film on the surface . acne-causing bacteria can not thrive in an acid environment , but if the skin surface is disrupted by excessive cleansing , the skin becomes alkaline , allowing the bacteria to flourish . this is a particular problem for older women because collagen loss makes their skin thinner , more fragile and naturally less acidic . ` alkaline soaps and harsh cleansers can easily disturb older skin 's natural barrier , ' explains dr patterson . ` frequent exfoliation either with abrasive scrubs or harsh acid peels are also damaging and make skin inflamed and sensitive . ' this means that the kind of acne treatments teenagers use to banish their blemishes may simply cause inflammation , redness and soreness in older women . solution : avoid soap and foaming cleansers containing sodium lauryl sulfate or sodium laureth sulfate , ingredients that break down oil , but can also damage the skin barrier . instead , use a gentle wash off cleanser such as la roche posay physiological cleansing gel -lrb- # 12 -rrb- . cosmetic dermatologist dr rachael eckel recommends : ` wash your face no more than twice daily for about 40 to 60 seconds , which is enough time to ensure it is clean without stripping it . ` cleanse at the end of your usual shower as the warmth and moisture will help soften dead skin cells so they exfoliate easily .
