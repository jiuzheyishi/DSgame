{"text": "when it comes to the gender pay gap , the cynics have used smoke and mirrors to deny the truth while congress continues to come up short on critical legislation . so now , the president is not waiting another minute to make real progress . he is taking action . on tuesday , president barack obama continued his  year of action  by signing two new executive orders to strengthen enforcement of equal pay laws where congress has so far failed to act . he also challenged the senate to  start making this right  by passing the paycheck fairness act when it comes up for a vote on wednesday . the senate has tried twice , but the act was blocked by a handful of stubborn republicans . but even before the ink was dry on his executive orders , wage-gap deniers were trotting out the same old tired arguments we 've heard for years . rationalizing or outright denying that pay inequity exists , and dismissing the equal pay push as a political ploy designed to distract from other ,  real  issues . yet for millions of women struggling on the brink of poverty , the wage gap is all too real . despite increasing education and greater professional success , women in the aggregate still make less than men : on average , 77 cents on the dollar , and even less if you are black or latina . this persistent pay gap has real implications for women and their families , especially when 40 % of our nation 's households with children rely on women as a primary or sole source of income . that 23-cent disparity means a yearly wage gap for women of more than $ 11,000 . and what does that translate into ? on average , working women in the united states can afford 91 fewer weeks of food for their families , 13 fewer months of rent , and more than 3,000 fewer gallons of gas per year as compared to men . it 's not surprising then that polls rank equal pay for equal work as a top issue for women across the country . more people prefer a male boss , but gender gap is narrowing . but like a bad magician , the naysayers are trying to use smoke and mirrors to fool us into believing the problem is just an illusion . they say the wage gap is a myth , based on anecdotes , not data . they say there 's no need for new laws , because it 's already illegal to discriminate . any differences that remain , they say , can be explained away by personal choices . while it 's true the wage gap is due to a combination of factors , study after study has shown the wage gap -- as much as 40 % of it -- holds true even when we control for factors such as education level , profession or position . it can not be fully explained by personal choices , and can be attributed in some measure to overt or unintentional gender-based discrimination . the gap manifests out of the gate and only widens over time . a 2012 report from the american association of university women ,  graduating to a pay gap ,  made an  apples-to-apples  comparison of college-educated women and men working full time one year out of school . after controlling for college major , occupation , hours worked per week , economic sector , and other factors , women still made 7 % less than what their male counterparts made . and in an earlier report , the association found that 10 years after graduation , the unexplained pay gap widened to 12 % . indeed , women 's wages are lower in nearly all occupations -- doctors , lawyers , even low-wage workers . and this is true regardless of whether the job is one performed predominantly by men , predominantly women , or an even mix of both . what millennial women want now . that 's why we still need congress to act , to pass the paycheck fairness act to ensure that all employers are held to the standards embodied in tuesday 's executive actions . this week congress has an opportunity to go from its standing ovation for equal pay at the state of the union to really standing up for women . when the rubber meets the road , let 's hope we move beyond the rhetoric to acting on real solutions . do n't make the president take out his pen again , unless it is to sign the new law . join us on facebook.com / cnnopinion .", "summary": " maya harris : president obama had no option but to sign orders on equal pay .   congress , she says , now must pass the paycheck fairness act .   wage-gap deniers , she says , are trotting out the same old tired arguments .
