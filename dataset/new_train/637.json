' i feel i was rewarded for the dozens of early mornings i 've had that produced no images . i could see that the clouds were breaking up and that the lake was still , so my hopes were rising . ' i kept looking behind me , checking for a hole in the eastern horizon that the sun might break through . ` what is unusual about this shot is that the sun managed to find its way through clouds to illuminate grinnell peak , but little else . ' i could n't see the cloud break where the sun came from , but was certainly glad it made it through . ` normally , i would have expected and hoped that the clouds and surrounding peaks would turn the same brilliant orange but that never happened . ` the peak glowed for maybe a couple of minutes , and then the sky fizzled to grey . in the end , this is what makes the shot unique since the peak stands out from the rest of the landscape and becomes a real focal point .
