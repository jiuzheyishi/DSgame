{"text": "want to elevate your home without taking on a complete overhaul ? interior decorator nick olsen -- diy whisperer and master of the cheap trick -- reveals the little tweaks that make the biggest impact . real simple : how did you get started in this field ? nick olsen : right after getting my architecture degree , i read about the designer miles redd in a magazine . i was so blown away by his bold aesthetic and everything he 'd accomplished by the age of 35 that i wrote him a letter asking for a meeting . two weeks later , i had my first full-time job , as his assistant . it was fate ! real simple : 3 decorators give readers ' rooms makeovers . real simple : what 's one quick change that will improve any room ? olsen : lower the artwork . people tend to hang it too high ; it should be at eye level . and do n't worry about having something on each wall . it 's better to cluster art in one or two spots than to spread it out . real simple : decorating a huge room can be intimidating . how do you deal with soaring spaces ? olsen : my philosophy is to fill them with large-scale furniture and art . if you 're a less-is-more type , go for one massive piece , like an amazing painting over the sofa . real simple : suppose you ca n't afford art that big ? olsen : buy a blank canvas and paint it yourself . pick the most interesting color in the room -lrb- as long as it 's not already the dominant color -rrb- and just cover the canvas in that shade , using the same paint you 'd use for walls . there 's no way to mess this up , and it costs next to nothing . google -lsb- famed abstract artist -rsb- ellsworth kelly for inspiration . he has pieces like this hanging in the whitney museum . real simple : 21 ways to enhance an entryway . real simple : any tips for jazzing up a minuscule space ?

olsen : fiercely edit the undone rooms . get rid of the junk ; keep only essentials . you 'll be poised to redecorate when the time comesâ $  and until then your rooms will feel calmer . tell visitors you 're experimenting with minimalism . real simple : 40 living room decorating ideas . real simple : what do you always want to fix when you go into someone 's living room ? olsen : the floor plan and lighting ! real simple : break that down for us . olsen : a good living room needs a comfortable place to sit , a place to rest your drink , and a place to read a book . but people default to the school-dance arrangement , where everything is pushed back against the walls . so i start by moving the furniture closer together , toward the center of the room . then i fill out the arrangement with occasional chairs and tables to create functional seating areas . it makes the space feel so much more intimate and conversational . real simple : 20 low-cost decorating ideas . real simple : and for the lighting ? olsen : if we 've learned anything from the movie gremlins , it 's that bright light is the enemy . install dimmers , or change your bulbs to extra-soft white 40-watt bulbs . that $ 30 investment makes a huge difference . real simple : what if you have a room that just feels blah ? olsen : a common feature of boring rooms is a lack of color . start there , and think from the ground up . buy a patterned rug you love : here 's your palette . go for a geometric dhurrie if you like modern , or multicolored stripes if you 're more traditional . you can pull the wall and furniture colors from the rug , then pick up its accent tones in pillows and other accessories . real simple : 23 decorating tricks for your bedroom . real simple : speaking of color , are there any surprising shades you 're really into right now ? olsen : i think fuchsia should be the color of the year . it 's so rich and chic , it 's like red 's hipper sister . i 'd use benjamin moore 's gypsy pink on walls in a room with neutral furniture and gray trim . or just do the ceiling -lrb- use high-gloss for that -rrb- . real simple : one piece of advice you 'd shout from the rooftops ?
