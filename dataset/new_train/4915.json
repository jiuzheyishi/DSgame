{"text": "the purse was by designer baby phat , and it was only $ 5 . but when elizabeth deiter bought it at the thrift store where she works , she immediately had to run over to the bank and deposit money to avoid running a negative balance . she and her husband only recently caught up on their rent , after four or five months , and deiter has close to 100 purses already , but she still went for the bargain . in thinking about this and other splurges on things she did n't need , deiter has begun to consider herself a compulsive shopper .  i am ashamed of it ,  says deiter , 22 , of reading , pennsylvania .  i 've screwed up a lot . i know i should stop .  with holiday season discounts running rampant online and in stores , it 's especially easy to fall into the trap of overspending this month , especially if you have a problem with impulse control at the mall . but beyond carelessness with finances , compulsive shopping is a mental disorder that psychologists recognize , although it has not been studied extensively . for compulsive shoppers , buying something creates a feeling related to the euphoria that alcohol induces , said bonny forrest , a psychologist in san diego . as with alcoholics , it 's hard to keep away from that rush of pleasure . about 6 % of women and 5.5 % of men are compulsive buyers , according to a 2006 study from stanford university in the american journal of psychiatry . the mental disorder has not been studied extensively , but it is thought to be an impulse control disorder . april lane benson , new york psychologist and author of  to buy or not to buy : why we overshop and how to stop ,  estimates that between one third and one half of compulsive buyers eventually turn into hoarders , but some just buy a lot of items and get rid of the old ones . where does compulsive shopping come from ? sometimes , people acquire objects as a way of dealing with chaos and feeling out of control , benson said .  you buy something , you 're in control of it ,  she said . it may also be related to childhood . parents may have given presents instead of time and attention , leading a child to grow up wanting to get more material possessions . other people may have grown up with a lot of emotional or financial deprivation , and when they 're able to afford shopping for themselves , they overbuy as a way of not going back to the way things were . another theory is that  we buy as a way of trying to deal with our fears of death and the inevitability of death ,  benson said . compulsive shopping sometimes goes hand in hand with alcoholism and eating disorders , forrest said . it 's not currently a separate diagnosis in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders , the  bible  by which mental health professionals identify conditions . psychologists usually view it as an issue of impulse control rather than a sign of obsessive-compulsive disorder ; ocd medications do not tend to work for shopping problems , forrest said . there 's no hard line between treating yourself to a pair of shoes on a bad day and being a compulsive shopper -- it is a spectrum . when shopping causes distress in your relationship or if shopping is the only way you can deal with negative feelings , it can be a real problem , forrest says . compulsive shoppers might have continued arguments with their spouses over money and ca n't afford basic necessities , she said . deiter can relate to this .  when i 'm upset , it happens more often . i get into an argument with my husband or my day is not going right , i definitely spend more ,  deiter said . when her husband asks her what happened to the other $ 400 that was supposed to be in their bank account , she honestly does n't know -- she does n't remember what she spent it all on . and she says her husband has threatened to end the marriage if her spending puts them behind in the bills again . shopping addicts are especially vulnerable right now because retailers play up the hysteria of limited chances at bargain prices . someone with feelings of low self-esteem might equate having a good holiday with buying things . especially given the slumping economy of the past few years , consumers are made to feel that , with regard to making certain purchases , it 's now or never .  think of a car 's brakes . if you do n't have brake fluid you ca n't stop ,  forrest says .  with the impulse to gamble , drink , shop , you ca n't put the brakes on .  deiter remembers her buying habits started small , with snacks . then she moved on to five and below , which she thought would be cheap , but ended up spending $ 140 at once there . two months ago , she bought $ 80 worth of beads to make jewelry ; the beads are still in a box .  i always end up finding a way to pay the bills ,  she said .  then , i 'll fall into old patterns .  deiter learned about the phenomenon through the movie  confessions of a shopaholic ,  but she only stopped to think about herself that way a couple months ago . she has joined an online support group , but the meetings happen while she 's at work , and she does n't have enough money for a therapist . she has n't found any meetings in her area , either . she wrote about her problem on the blog secret regrets . one strategy that helps some compulsive shoppers curb their habits is to pay in cash , so they see how much they 're spending , forrest said . they also can try going shopping with other people who can act as a check , making sure they do n't overspend . online , they might want to avoid storing credit card information , so that it 's harder to make a purchase before thinking about it . forrest recommends waiting 24 hours before actually buying something you do n't really need , to give yourself time to reconsider . another source of help might be an online support group , such as debtors anonymous . benson has a whole program planned out for compulsive shoppers . it begins with examining why they impulsively overshop and what are triggers and consequences of that behavior . she helps her clients examine the costs and benefits of spending in this way , .  i have them really think through the vision of what they want to be true in their lives , so that they can project ahead and see whether the way they 're living their lives now is likely to get them to where they want to be ,  benson said . motivation to change comes from recognizing the disconnect between who they want to be and who they are right now , benson said . she then takes them through the nitty-gritty of finances : how much did they spend and how much did they want to spend ? how much could they have saved by not buying so much ? this is a nine-week process . clients also create a  shopping self-portrait ,  in which they envision themselves buying something they later regretted purchasing . what needs are they fulfilling by shopping ? love and affection , belonging , self-esteem , the esteem of others , and autonomy are all needs that the client may wish to consider fulfilling in different ways , instead of going to the mall .  the underlying rubric of the whole thing is to really get in touch with what it is you really need , and how to get that ,  benson said .  it 's not that sixth pair of black boots .
