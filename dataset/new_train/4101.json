{"text": "coronado , california -lrb- cnn -rrb- wisconsin gov. scott walker portrayed himself as a battle tested warrior who has successfully beat back successive attempts by powerful democratic-aligned organizations to try and defeat him , during a campaign style speech thursday night to members of the republican national committee . walker , who is considering a run for the republican presidential nomination , used his remarks to sharply criticize washington and hillary clinton as he argued that republicans should look to the states for a presidential nominee in 2016 . while not outwardly saying he would run , it was clear walker was making the point to these state party leaders and activists that he has the record and the experience to be the next gop nominee .  i want to share a vision , i think we have a unique opportunity going forward , not only for the good of this party , but more importantly for the good of the country , to find a new fresh leader out there who can take big bold ideas , take ideas that come from of outside of washington , from the states all the way down to the grassroots ,  walker said .  we need someone who hopefully has the backing and the track-record of success , of showing that commonsense , commonsense conservative reforms can work not just in wisconsin , but they can work all across america .  walker reiterated a common theme throughout his remarks that it is a time for a  fresh new approach  -- an apparent reference to mitt romney and jeb bush , both of whom have strongly signaled they will seek the republican nomination . as he was leaving the ballroom following his speech , walker was asked about romney , to which he replied  good man  as he walked away . in his speech , he noted it was critical for the gop to offer voters a contrasting vision and experience in governing in the next election .  for us going forward , if we are going to be up against particularly , hillary clinton , we got to offer a new fresh approach , and ideally it comes from the states ,  he said .  the reason for that , the reason we mentioned last week in our inaugural address is the states is the place where he actually gets things done . that matters .  walker was a top target for national democrats last year , but he won re-election by more than five points . he survived a recall election in 2012 . walker also emphasized that he enjoyed campaigning and meeting voters -- an important trait for a presidential candidate who endures grueling hours on the road away from family and friends . he told the audience that the reason he was motivated to run for governor in 2009 was because of his sons .  we were afraid that the state was not as great as the wisconsin we grew up in ,  walker said of the decision he made with his wife to seek the governorship . walker then followed by saying that since taking office ,  because of our reforms in our great state of wisconsin , they are growing up in a state that is better , even better than the state i grew up in .  he later added ,  i look at our country i am worried about our country the same way i was worried about my state in 2009 .
