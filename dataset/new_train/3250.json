{"text": "x-ray images of an unopened cardboard box have revealed a treasure trove of christmas tins sent to british soldiers on the western front 100 years ago . a collector , who bought the unremarkable-looking box at auction on a hunch it may contain gift tins , did n't want to damage the box by opening it . so instead , he decided to x-ray it - with the scans revealing hundreds of tins stuffed with goodies such as chocolate , cigarettes and sweets inside . during the war , the tins were made in their thousands then shipped off by the royals to soldiers fighting in the trenches over the first christmas of the war in 1914 . hidden treasures : 81 bronze tins stuffed with cigarettes , pencils and sweets that was due to be sent to the troops on the western front in 1914 have been found in a sealed cardboard box by a collector -lrb- pictured -rrb- . gift : thousands of tins , similar to this one pictured , were sent to troops in 1914 . the five-inch boxes were paid for by the sailors and soldiers christmas fund - organised by george v 's daughter princess mary . but one box never made it to its intended destination - and is now up for sale 100 years on for almost # 30,000 . the five-inch long tins were paid for by the sailors and soldiers christmas fund - a nationwide appeal for donations organised by george v 's daughter princess mary . it is thought that more than 355,000 were sent to troops in 1914 , although due to the pressures put on the postal service some soldiers did not get theirs until 1916 . by the end of the war the fund had raised # 200,000 and had sent out 2.5 million boxes . mystery surrounds the box for sale , which was bought by a collector of first world war memorabilia several years ago after he spotted it at auction . the collector , who was told the box had been found in ireland , suspected the box had christmas tins inside so had it x-rayed as he did n't want to open it . inside : the collector , who bought the box at auction on a hunch it would contain the tins , did n't want to open the box - so he had it x-rayed -lrb- pictured -rrb- to see what was inside . hidden treats : the scan showed the box was stuffed to the brim with the christmas gift tins , pictured , which contained a christmas card , sweets and chocolate . it will be opened for the first time by lady emma kitchener , great-grandniece of military great lord kitchener , at the chalke valley history festival near salisbury , wiltshire , later this month . a select amount of tins will be sold at the festival for # 300 to # 350 with the rest being auctioned in onslows ' great war sale in dorset on july 9 . a proportion of the proceeds will be donated to a services charity . patrick bogue , from onslows auction house in blandford , said : ` with christmas 1914 approaching , george v 's daughter princess mary came up with the idea for a fund which would pay for presents for soldiers and sailors fighting on the front lines . 100 years : the box will finally be opened later this month by lady emma kitchener at the chalke vallye history festival in salisbury . a number of the tins will be auctioned off for # 300 - # 350 during the event - with the proceeds going to charity . at the start of the conflict , british soldiers were allowed 10oz of meat and 8oz of vegetables per day . however , this was soon reduced as supply lines were disrupted due to naval and land blockades across europe . two years later in 1916 , the meat ration was down to 6oz a day . towards the end of the conflict , soldiers were lucky to get meat once every nine days . some sources suggest the troops ate horse meat from animals killed on the front line . some soldiers reportedly grew their own vegetables in the trenches - but few were successful . instead , nettles and weeds were used in stews . other goods provided included tea , bacon , cheese , jam and meat stews - all of which were tinned . flour was scarce also , so ground-up vegetables were used as a substitute . in terms of equipment , every soldier was issued with a 1908 pattern webbing for carrying personal items . it included : a wide belt , left and right ammunition pouches each stocked with 75 rounds and an entrenching tool head . a water bottle carrier , a small haversack - including a knife and unused rations - and large pack were also supplied . a mess tin was contained inside a cloth buff-coloured khaki cover . ` she had wanted to do her bit and the campaign was very successful . ` it . was common belief that the war was going to be very quick and so . hundreds of thousands of these little tins with gifts inside were put . together . ` it was meant to be a one off but as we know now the war lasted a lot longer than anticipated . ` the fund continued to grow and so the boxes were sent to others helping the war effort such as young soldiers and nurses . ` there were a few types of box - the initial ones contained a packet of cigarettes and a pencil made from a shell casing while others got sweets and chocolate . ` the box was found in ireland but we do n't know any more about its history . ` it is a complete mystery as to whether this box was simply surplus to requirements or if there is another reason why it never made it to the front line . ` its seal is still intact which would suggest it has never been opened which is incredible in itself because the tins potentially have packets of cigarettes in them . ` the box has been x-rayed and it confirms these are the tins with the shell cartridge pencils inside . ` it is amazing to think they have spent the last 100 years undisturbed . ' chalke valley history festival runs from june 23 to 29 . the box will be opened on june 28 .", "summary": " 81 bronze tins containing cigarettes , pencils and sweets found by a collector .   tins been sealed in an unremarkable-looking box for over 100 years .   collector did n't want to open it - so had it x-rayed to see what was inside .   thought the box , worth around # 30,000 , got lost during shipping in 1914 .   christmas gifts were sent out in their thousands to troops on western front .   paid for by sailors and soldiers christmas fun - organised by princess mary .
