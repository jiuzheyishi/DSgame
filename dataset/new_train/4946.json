{"text": "the washington redskins find themselves under -lrb- deserved -rrb- fire for their name , which many native americans and others find to be a racial slur . previously the target of protests and opprobrium , the redskins have now lost their federal trademark registration for the name , as it was deemed too disparaging to remain protected . there are two issue to consider here : one is technical and the other is one we should all find troubling . the first : this case was about a trademark , and the primary purpose of trademark law is to protect the public so that the public can accurately know the source or origin of goods and services . but headlines that say the redskins lost their trademark are inaccurate . all they lost was their trademark registration , not the right to use the racist term to identify their team -- and that is a key point . in the united states , trademark rights flow from an organization using the trademark ; technically , you do n't need to register a trademark in order to have trademark rights . -lrb- in other countries , you need a registration -rrb- . with its common law rights intact , the team is free to continue to call itself the  redskins .  moreover , it can still sue you for selling counterfeit washington redskins gear , and it can still block someone from starting a washington redskins dodgeball team . the washington redskins still have trademark rights , and strong rights at that . if the team owners still have rights in the trademark , why is losing the registration a big deal ? what does a registration give you ? it gives you a few statutory presumptions in the event that you go to court over enforcement of your trademark . it gives a presumption of ownership and validity . in simple terms , the cancellation only means that if there is a trademark infringement lawsuit , the washington redskins team is going to have to pay a bit more in attorneys ' fees to win its case . opinion : is end near for redskins ? it 's about time . but nobody can seriously argue that dan snyder 's football team is not the owner of the still-intact trademark rights , nor that the public associates his team with the racist name . the second issue : there is something even more offensive than the team 's name : the fact that this case happened at all . the decision , i believe , has first amendment implications that we should n't ignore . i do not care whether you like or dislike the washington redskins ' name . i think it 's a pretty dumb thing to call a football team . if native americans believe that  redskin  is offensive to them , then it is . most people agree that it is about as offensive as using any other ethnic slur . i respect their position and their argument . seattle times gets rid of ` redskins , ' joins rising tide against name . nevertheless , here are my criticisms of this decision : section -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- a -rrb- of the trademark act bars the registration of any trademark that is  immoral   scandalous  or  disparaging .  in other words , a civil servant executing the registration is allowed to be the arbiter of morality . do we really want that ? trademarks propose a commercial transaction . when you see or hear a trademark , you immediately receive information in a short-hand way that communicates where the products come from , or what level of service you can expect . trademarks are first amendment protected expression . there should be no issue with limiting their use to mislead the public . after all , what point do they serve if they do not propose a truthful association with their owner ? and what rational governmental purpose does it serve to deny a benefit to a business because it might be deemed  immoral  by someone ? and why are we even arguing the point ? the government should not be in the business of deciding what is moral , immoral , or offensive . this section of the trademark act is a leftover from victorian times , and is used now primarily to promote social agendas with coercive censorship . to justify such censorship , the government must demonstrate that the harms it seeks to address are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to a material degree . in addition , the courts have found , such a restriction  may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the government 's purpose .  these mandates are  critical ,  for otherwise  -lsb- the government -rsb- could with ease restrict commercial speech in the service of other objectives that could not themselves justify a burden on commercial expression .  in this case , what is the governmental purpose in depriving the redskins of their trademark registration ? is it that the government is serving as a morality teacher ? is it choosing a favored position , and then enforcing it by only giving government benefits to companies that agree with that orthodoxy ? do you trust any government to tell you what your morality should be ? if so , do you trust this government to do that ? remember , even if you 're one of the well-intentioned many who think that the name is disgusting , do you want to surrender your first amendment rights to the next group who might find your morality to be outside the norm ? i do not . while i think that dan snyder should change the name of his football team , i think that the government should remain neutral in the matter .", "summary": " marc randazza : redskins lost trademark registration for name . news leaves 2 issue to consider .   but redskins still have trademark rights , can sue infringers , keep using racist term to identify team .   case raises first amendment issues ; why is trademark office arbiter of morality ?
