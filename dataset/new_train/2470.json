{"text": "kids having sex on prime time broadcast tv ? must be sweeps month . it 's so predictable , it 's almost laughable . almost . that is , it would be if it were n't for the fact that there are real-world consequences for these brazen , ratings-boosting publicity ploys . fox 's soapy , teen-targeted  glee  tried to boost sagging ratings this week by showing not one , but two teen couples having sex for the first time -- one gay , the other straight . show co-creator ryan murphy and the folks over at  glee  are spinning this as a  teachable moment  for teens and their parents , an opportunity for dialogue about safe sex and responsible choices . the problem is ryan murphy wants to have his cake and eat it , too . hollywood loves to defend teen sex story lines by insisting ,  kids are having sex ! we 're reflecting the real world !  but the truth is much more sobering and complicated . yes , there are and always have been sexually active teens , but never before have depictions of premarital teen sex been so widespread in the media . today , you are more likely to see sexualized teens than adults in sexual situations . by presenting teen sex as common , the media marginalizes teens who choose to remain abstinent while increasing the pressure teens are already feeling to become sexually active . television is a  sexual super peer ,  according to jane brown , a professor of journalism and mass communication at the university of north carolina . the phrase  peer pressure  is used to describe the influence a peer group can exert on a teen 's decisions . television amplifies that peer pressure by making the entire realm of television , and all the characters in it , part of the teen 's peer group . when television portrays attractive , popular teenage characters as sexually active , it sends a powerful message to young viewers that there is an expectation that they , too , should be sexually active and , in fact , there might be something wrong with them , if they are n't . teens are also aware that television influences their behavior . according to one survey , a third of youths age 12 and older say the media encourages them to have sex by making it seem like  everybody does it .  and why should n't they get that impression ? beyond making teen sex the norm , researchers have found heavy television viewing to be predictive of positive attitudes toward  recreational  or casual sex and negative attitudes toward remaining a virgin . studies have also found the more a teenager identifies with the characters they see on prime time tv shows , the more likely they are to be sexually experienced and to expect higher levels of sexual activity among their peers . at least half a dozen studies in the past few years have documented a strong correlation between exposure to adult media content as children and the early onset of sexual activity among teens . one study even found that viewing of sexual media content was predictive of teen pregnancy . if that is n't enough , why exactly do parents and teens need to sit down and watch a tv show that glamorizes teen sex in order to have a conversation about it ? let 's hope most parents pass on hollywood 's attempt to help them out with the visuals and simply have an honest conversation with their teenagers . if history is a predictor of future behavior , we can expect this trend to continue . a season or two into murphy 's show  nip/tuck  on the fx network , he was interviewed for a bravo network documentary about breaking sexual taboos on television . murphy stated ,  it 's tough to get that sexual point of view across on television . hopefully i have made it possible for somebody on broadcast television to do a rear-entry scene in three years . maybe that will be my legacy .  this , ladies and gentlemen , is the self-styled sex-ed teacher to america 's teens . the worst thing parents can do is step aside and let hollywood do the teaching . the opinions in this commentary are solely those of melissa henson .", "summary": " this week 's  glee  showed two teen couples -- one straight , one gay -- having sex for first time .   melissa henson says young viewers could feel that they , too , should be sexually active .   henson : never before have depictions of premarital teen sex been so common in the media .   worst thing parents can do is step aside and let hollywood do the teaching , henson says .
