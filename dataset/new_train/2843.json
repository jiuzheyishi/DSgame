{"text": "the picture of yahoo ceo marissa mayer tilted on a lounge chair , hair flowing above her and shot from above has sparked a mini-firestorm among women . a significant number of women , feeling not too distanced from the days when women ceos were just a fond hope , much less an aspiration , were less than thrilled at the idea of one of the few women of real power still needing the affirmation of a vogue fashion shoot . the fact that it was kind of sexy added just a little gasoline to the fire . but to be fair , the reaction was far from uniform ; other women slammed back and said ,  why not ?   she 's earned the right to do anything she wants , and why not be sexy and a ceo ? we do n't have to wear the same uniform men do , we can do it our way  . well , i am teetering towards the middle but coming down on the side of the disappointed . on the one hand , marissa mayer ca n't avoid the fact that she 's a role model , even if she did n't start out to be one . her picture seems to say to us ,  here 's a real me that 's just as important as being a ceo . look at how pretty and sexy i am !  now any woman can understand that . sexed up and smart : women debate marissa mayer 's vogue photo . posing for the camera is always a narcissistic act , and i dare say , most women 's first reaction to seeing themselves in a photo that surfaces in a newspaper , or in a private family shot , is  how do i look ?  i plead guilty . but still , here 's a woman who has made it to the top because of her brains , does she still need to self-validate by having a beautiful fashion gig ? what does that say to all the women who would never be beautiful enough to do that , but might be brainy enough to have her job ? should they feel  less than marissa  because they ca n't qualify for the vogue slot ? could n't marissa just take pictures that show her as a stylish and good-looking ceo rather than as a babe who is showing her great legs in $ 1,000 shoes ? but then there is the other side . we all do love to look great and be admired . we understand the impulse . and why should she be denied her one month of being a famous fashonista ? she 's worked hard to gain the prominence she earned , and some girls , even very smart girls , do , just like the song says ,  just want to have fun  ... at least occasionally . mayer turns heads with photo shoot . i get it , and i get why she did it . but she has to take note of how pained a lot of women are about this fashion photo . not just a few women felt hurt looking at the mayer layout , wondering silently or out loud if acquiescing to this kind of shot means that for mayer , and perhaps for other women , that  making it  and  having it all  needs to include being publicly admired for one 's allure . that 's a depressing thought for many talented women who are not beautiful or not sexy . they do not have that card to play and this layout could certainly make them wonder if selection for the top job requires being lovely . we women would like to feel that for at least some of us , sheer competence would make looks a non-issue in our lives . we would like to think that a brainiac like marissa mayer would n't need , perhaps would not want , to have a very public glamor shot as a career capstone . unfortunately , it is not an exaggeration to say that marissa mayer is kind of saying , even though i am sure she did not mean to , that to have it all , sure , you have to be smart , but , let 's face it , you also need to be beautiful . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of pepper schwartz .", "summary": " yahoo ceo marissa mayer posed for stylish vogue fashion shoot .   pepper schwartz : some women wished mayer did n't need affirmation of such a spread .   she asks if mayer could n't have gotten credit for her brains rather than her looks .   schwartz : the unintended message is you have to be smart and beautiful .
