{"text": "the percentage of american men who work or are actively searching for work is at an historic low . men between the ages of 25 and 54 now participate in the workforce at only around 88 percent . in 1956 , 98 percent of american men were active in the workforce . due to a changing job marketplace , the great recession , male imprisonment and other factors , a fewer percentage of men are now working than ever before . vanishing act : men aged 25 to 54 who participate in the american workforce are at an all-time low according to bureau of labor statistic data . among the less educated , reports cnn , men have been increasingly left behind as employment opportunities require more skill or a level of education beyond a high school degree . pair that with a widening dearth of well-paid manufacturing jobs and men with lower education levels are at an even greater disadvantage . college educated men are also vanishing from the workplace . analysts report that men 25 and up with a bachelor 's degree participated in the workforce at 80.2 percent in may 2012 , an over 7 percent drop from ten years ago . even in boom years , like those that . preceded the great recession , men 's participation rate continued to fall . despite unemployment reaching a 30-year low in the early 2000s . going down : men 25 to 54 now account for less of the american workforce than ever before . male participation rates have dropped steadily for decades , and the descent quickened with the onset of the great recession . changing places : men with lower levels of education are increasingly choosing not to work at all instead of taking labor jobs that once paid much more . meanwhile , women continue to make up more and more of america 's workforce . the rate of workforce participation in america -- that is , those who are working or searching for work -- has decreased for men aged 25-54 for decades for several reasons . education : fewer jobs exist for those with only a high school education and many men who could once hold well-paid manufacturing jobs , for example , now choose not to work at all instead of taking less desirable , and lower paid , blue collar work that still exists . imprisonment : incarceration rates have increased exponentially in recent decades . 1 in every 100 americans are now in prison , over 90 % of whom are male . disability : with the great recession came a large influx of application for disability benefits and few of those who subsequently received them have since weened themselves off . and the great recession itself exacerbated the problem . as the crisis grew , men 's workforce participation dipped below 90 percent for the very first time . and it has continued to drop since , despite an improving economy . another factor is the number of men behind bars . an astonishing 1 out of every 100 americans are imprisoned and over 90 percent of inmates are men . and , perhaps even more than lack of education , a criminal record can make finding a job in the afterlife of incarceration challenging . challenging enough , perhaps , to make men just stop trying . which is another growing group of non-participators . workforce participation accounts for employed people as well as those seeking employment . it does not , of course , account for those who 've stopped trying to find work altogether , such as those collecting unemployment or other benefits . ` the proportion of guys doing nothing has risen , ' gary burtless , a senior fellow at the brookings institution , told cnn . after unemployment rates rocketed as a result of the recession , many men began to rely on unemployment benefits . they also , increasingly , began relying on the federal disability system . cnn . reports that 1.9 percent of working age men received disability . benefits in 1982 . in 2012 , that number had reached 3.1 percent . and only 2.2 percent of those enrolled quit the program by the start of 2013 . there . are still jobs out there , of course , even in a harsh economic climate . so who 's taking them in the absence of male applicants aged 25 to 54 ? economic woes : with the great recession came a great deal of lay-offs and though numbers have bounced back somewhat , the male workforce participation rate hit 90 percent for the first time and has continued to drop ever since . women , according to mit economics professor david autor . female college enrollment rates have helped boost their ability to gain employment in sectors that are growing , ones that require higher education degrees . according to autor 's research , women born in 1975 were roughly 17 % more likely than their male counterparts to attend college and nearly 23 % more likely to complete a four-year degree . ` women 's persistence and enrollment rates have given them a real edge over men , ' said burtless .", "summary": " in 1956 , 98 percent of males 25-54 participated in the american workforce .   in 2012 , that number had dropped to 88 percent and it is n't improving any time soon .
