{"text": "sharon shoesmith has said she is on benefits and is unemployable after being blamed for the baby p case . the social services chief whose team failed to save the life of baby p has revealed that she is on the dole and unemployable . sharon shoesmith lost her job as haringey council 's director of children 's services in the fallout over care given to peter connelly , who died aged 17 months after suffering horrific abuse despite being seen by social workers and doctors 60 times . she has waged a long battle to be cleared of any personal responsibility for the child 's death in 2007 . and now she has revealed how criticism over her handling of the affair saw her consider suicide , and how she is so scared of revenge attacks she rarely ventures out . mrs shoesmith , 59 , also suggests that too many ` at-risk ' children are taken into care -- and that they would be better left with their parents , despite concerns . evidently still angry at her treatment , she suggests that inquiries into failures by social services should not be conducted in the public glare . she claims it was only social workers who faced disciplinary action over the case , apparently ignoring the fact that two doctors were investigated . mrs shoesmith was sacked from her highly-paid job in 2008 amid mounting public uproar over the death of baby peter in august 2007 at the hands of his mother tracey connelly , 31 , her sadistic paedophile boyfriend steve barker , 36 , and his brother jason owen , 40 . the senior social worker launched an appeal claiming unfair dismissal and eventually won . despite reports she was due # 1million in compensation , she says she has not yet received the payment , and that she faces huge legal bills . speaking to public servant magazine , mrs shoesmith said : ` what i did n't know before , but i have learned over the past four years , is that you do n't recover from this -- it stays with you . your entire past is just wiped away and your future is utterly gone . baby peter died in august 2007 at the hands of his mother tracey connelly , her lover steven barker and their lodger , barker 's brother jason owen . ` there was a sense of ,  if we hit her hard enough , she will never stand up again  , and i nearly did n't . it is very hard to understand what that feels like . ` people i used to know ask me what i 'm doing now , and they 're shocked when i say  nothing  . ` they ca n't quite grasp that my life has n't moved on at all in the past four years -- that i ca n't find any work and i 'm living on benefits . ` i used to have a # 130,000-a-year job running my own department and was a national reference point for ofsted for special educational needs , but no organisation will take the risk of employing me because of who i am . ' baby p 's mother tracey connelly , left , and her boyfriend steven barker , right , were jailed , along with barker 's brother jason owen for the death of the 17-month-old . reports blaming her for peter 's death drove her to consider suicide , and even to question whether she had murdered him herself , before seeking counselling . ` i was certainly no softy , but being held directly responsible for the brutal murder of a child was something that i found impossible to live with , ' said mrs shoesmith . ` i remember turning to my two grown-up daughters in tears and asking them ,  did i murder him ?  i was in such a state that i actually believed i had killed him . ' she added that four years after her sacking she is still scared of being recognised and abused in public , and claimed police warned her she could be pushed in front of a tube train . mrs shoesmith maintains that social workers do a good job and should not be vilified because of the ` very small number of children who are murdered ' . ` we are so desperately fearful of getting it wrong that we can not calibrate our own success , ' she said . ` we have to get back to supporting social workers to use their professional skills to make reasoned judgments . ` then the crucial next bit , where no one wants to go , is that we have to accept mistakes happen . ` the big dilemma for local government is that no one knows what to do with child homicide and whether social workers should be held responsible . it will happen and we can not prevent it . ' after implying that inquiries into social services failings should not be conducted in the public eye , and claiming that only social workers faced disciplinary action over baby peter 's death , she suggested more ` at-risk ' children should be left at home . ` there is political pressure to take more children into care earlier to prevent them being harmed , ' she said . ` but if the figure rises , is that a success or a failure ?
