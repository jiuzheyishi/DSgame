{"text": "new delhi national elections in the world 's largest democracy are always a mind-boggling spectacle . the election commission of india estimates some 788 million people are eligible to vote in 2014 -- an electorate that 's more than double the population of the united states . how the country conducts this mammoth exercise every five years never ceases to amaze observers . what makes 2014 even more significant is the likelihood of an epic battle between the ruling indian national congress and its allies versus the bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- with the controversial hindu nationalist narendra modi at its helm . the indian national congress has been in power for the past decade under the leadership of the italy-born sonia gandhi and her son rahul , heir to the nehru-gandhi dynasty . in an era of coalition politics , the rise of regional leaders and local political parties is also crucial . while it 's difficult to predict winners when there are numerous unknowns , here are five factors bound to influence indian voters in 2014 . 1 -rrb- corruption . it 's so ingrained in almost every aspect of daily life that most indians have long tolerated and gotten used to small-scale corruption . however , after a series of multimillion - and even billion-dollar scams , brought to light by an unrelenting media , the fight against corruption has reached a tipping point in india . in new delhi 's recent state assembly polls , the stellar performance by a brand new political party founded on an anti-corruption platform was unprecedented . both houses of the indian parliament subsequently passed landmark legislation in december to create an anti-corruption ombudsman with the power to investigate graft at the highest levels . how it will be implemented is yet to be determined , but without a doubt , the prevailing anti-corruption sentiment will continue to have major ripples in 2014 . 2 -rrb- youth . much is said of india 's untapped and vast youth potential . in 2014 , first-time voters will account for almost one-third of the electorate . these young adults grew up in an india reveling in near double-digit growth rates . a recent economic downturn is shaking things up politically , although the influence this will have on youth voters remains unclear . what moves indian youth to act is unpredictable , as manifested in the stunning outpouring of support for the victim of a vicious gang rape in new delhi in 2012 . but increasingly , young people appear to be shedding their indifference to politics , and this crucial voting block can not be ignored in 2014 . 3 -rrb- religious violence . in september , india had the worst case of religious violence since the gujarat riots in 2002 . more than 60 people , mostly muslims , were killed and tens of thousands displaced along religious lines in muzaffarnagar , a district about 130 kilometers north of new delhi . in a country founded on the principles of secularism , there 's growing fear over what the re-emergence of religious tensions could mean for the country 's politics . with the rising popularity of the opposition 's candidate for prime minister , the hindu hardliner narendra modi , there are concerns he 'll adopt a polarizing strategy to win votes . analysts say political tensions could also mount as political groups opposed to modi try to paint him as a radical . the long-running election strategy of dividing communities for political gain could be an ongoing political tactic in 2014 . 4 -rrb- inflation . india 's economic slide may have bottomed out and growth is conservatively expected to rise to around 6 % in 2014 , but the common man continues to be deeply affected by inflation . for most of 2013 , consumer inflation hovered around 10 % . the outcome of the recent state elections in which the ruling party suffered a massive blow was partly on account of rising prices . the chief of india 's central bank has made taming inflation his top priority , but the impact of recent monetary tightening measures may not be felt in the short term . inflation , then , could remain a critical factor in the national elections . 5 -rrb- rise of states and regional parties . india 's economy slowed in 2013 , but one of the main reasons the economy has n't come to a standstill is that growth in several of india 's 28 states continues to rise at unprecedented levels . in the once impoverished state of bihar , for instance , the economy grew at 14 % in 2012-13 , in madhya pradesh 10 % and odisha 9.14 % . these states were never india 's engines for growth . economic power translates to political clout , and as the central government is becoming weaker , the states are becoming stronger . this shift is so substantial , states and regional parties can now dictate national and international policies . how these regional parties fare and which coalitions they choose to join will have a massive influence on the national elections .", "summary": " india 's election takes place with some 788 million eligible voters .   cnn 's sumnima udas in delhi lists five factors to influence the upcoming elections .   showdown looming between ruling indian national congress and bharatiya janata party .
