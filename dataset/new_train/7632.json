{"text": "out : andrew cooper was once a pivotal figure in no10 advising david cameron . the architect of david cameron 's policy on gay marriage is leaving downing street after losing a power battle with the prime minister 's new election supremo . andrew cooper , mr cameron 's personal polling guru and a key modernising figure at no 10 , is returning to his private business after being usurped by outspoken australian ` fixer ' lynton crosin contrast , mr crosby , who took charge of the tory campaign machine in january on a # 200,000-a-year deal , specialises in ` dog whistle ' tactics -- subtle appeals to voters ' underlying prejudices over issues such as immigration -- which are designed to appeal to core conservative voters . defiant mr crosby denies using ` dog-whistle ' tactics to send surreptitious messages , saying : ` it was more like a foghorn . ' he is understood to have been critical of mr cameron 's policy on gay marriage for alienating grassroots supporters . mr cooper , co-founder of the populus polling company , helped persuade mr cameron that while gay marriage would lose votes among older party supporters in safe seats , more importantly it would attract votes in marginal constituencies . when mr crosby 's appointment was announced , mr cooper denied threatening to resign . however , he is to leave his downing street post to return to populus , though he is expected to do some part-time work for tory hq . last night , a tory source said : ` there was never going to be room for both andrew and lynton . andrew is a fully paid-up conservative moderniser and believes that the party will never win a governing majority again unless it distances itself from its thatcherite past . lynton is an old-fashioned thatcherite who thinks traditional values and policies are more important than modern fads . ' success : lynton crosby was formerly campaign chief for london mayor boris johnson . mr cooper 's critics claim he places too much reliance on new labour-style focus groups . his supporters say the same techniques helped tony blair win three elections and insist it is ` totally unfair ' to blame him for the so-called ` omnishambles ' -- the series of u-turns -- which followed last year 's chaotic budget . electoral dynamite : lynton crosby helped john howard in australia win four elections . mr cooper warned mr cameron that it would be ` toxic ' to cut the top rate of income tax from 50p to 40p , following focus group findings that the prime minister and his chancellor were seen as ` posh ' and ` out of touch ' characters from tv period drama downton abbey . in the end , the government compromised by cutting it to 45p . mr crosby was dubbed the wizard of oz after winning four terms for former australian pm john howard and is billed as one of the most brilliant , though provocative , strategists of his generation . in one notorious campaign ploy in 2001 , he seized on the news that a refugee ship , packed with afghan asylum seekers , had entered australian waters . mr howard , on mr crosby 's advice , refused the passengers entry amid claims that they were trying to blackmail their way in by throwing children overboard . the allegations turned out to be false but the controversy boosted mr howard 's ratings and he gained more credit when , shortly afterwards , islamic extremists attacked america on 9/11 . four years later , mr crosby had moved to britain to advise michael howard , whose 2005 general election campaign was noted for highlighting immigration . although mr howard was beaten by mr blair , mr crosby was credited for avoiding a third landslide defeat . he went on to mastermind boris johnson 's two victories in the london mayoral elections and mr johnson urged mr cameron to do ` whatever it takes ' to hire mr crosby to run the tories ' 2015 election campaign . ` push the boat out , break the piggy bank , kill the fatted calf , ' said the mayor . however , not all of mr johnson 's advisers were so impressed . the mail on sunday revealed last year how some were shocked when mr crosby said mr johnson should stop focusing on ` f *** ing muslims ' . shift : lynton crosby wants david cameron , left , to focus on traditional values like margaret thatcher , right . admirers have hailed his appointment to mr cameron 's team for bringing ` discipline , clarity , toughness and populism ' to conservative hq . however , the party 's former deputy chairman lord ashcroft , a long-standing political and business rival of the australian , said mr cameron had made a mistake and called mr crosby ` a distracting influence ' . a no 10 source played down mr cooper 's resignation and said : ` andrew always planned to return to his business around this time and will carry on doing some work for the conservative party .
