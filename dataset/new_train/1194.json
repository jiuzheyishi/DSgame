{"text": "a leading scientist has said that life may still exist on mars , despite curiosity rover 's inability to find methane gas on the planet 's surface . the president of the mars society , robert zubrin , told cnet that methane - a gas produced by living things - may still exist because the rover has only analysed a relatively small area of the red planet . last week , nasa said that it was unlikely that microbes capable of producing the gas were living below the planet 's surface after curiosity failed to find the gas . scroll down for video ... the president of the mars society , robert zubrin , has said that methane - a gas produced by living things - may still exist because the curiosity rover -lrb- pictured -rrb- has only analysed a relatively small area of the red planet . but mr zubrin criticised nasa 's lack of direction claiming that the space agency ` does n't have a goal ' . the criticism follows a discussion of curiosity rover 's findings presented at the european planetary science in london earlier this month . the conference highlighted some of curiosity 's most brilliant finds before the rover began its journey to mount sharp in july . data collected by the curiosity rover at this time suggested the red planet 's atmosphere once had more oxygen in it than earth , giving serious weight to the theory it could have previously harboured alien life . in july , data collected by the curiosity rover suggested the red planet 's atmosphere once had more oxygen in it than earth . a team of nasa scientists said that a change in the ratio of two different kinds of argon gas was evidence that the atmosphere has been stripped away . nasa 's dr chris webster said : ` as mars became a planet and its magma ocean solidified , catastrophic outgassing occurred while volatiles were delivered by impact of comets and other smaller bodies . ` solar wind , and the possible impact by a pluto-sized body is thought to have stripped much of the initial early atmosphere from the planet , and since then the atmosphere has developed as a balance between volcanic injection and loss to space . ' only a month earlier , powerful evidence that water good enough to drink once flowed on mars was found by the ageing vehicle . evidence of water on mars had previously been indicated by a succession of discoveries - but all had suggested flows of sulphuric acid . this was the first time water has been found in a form that is likely to be drinkable . scientists also discovered pebbles on mars , showing that a stream had flowed on the planet . the rounded pebbles could only have formed when they were carried through water over long distances , according to researchers . scientists had previously discovered pebbles on mars , showing that a stream has flowed on the planet - giving more weight to the theory that it was once able to support life . in april , the $ 2.5 billion rover found evidence that as much as 90 per cent of the original atmosphere there had dissipated into space over the planet 's lifetime . curiosity also revealed further details of its life on the surface - with evidence of dust storms and whirlwinds . the conference focused heavily on a the tintina pebble crushed under the curiosity mars rover 's wheels which split open to reveal a dazzling white interior - a sign that it contained hydrated minerals , formed when water flowed through it . curiosity is now on a long journey to mount sharp , which rises 3.4 miles into the martian sky from gale crater 's center . the rover will take monthly readings of the martian atmosphere during the road trip , expected to last almost a year . ` curiosity rover can do all kinds of things . it could find fossils . it has imaging capability , a telescope for microorganisms , ' said mr zubrin in his interview with cnet . ` maybe a puff of methane will come and it will be detected later . there 's lot for curiosity to look for . '", "summary": " curiosity rover has found no sign of methane , which is produced by life .   robot has spent a year on red planet scanning its surface and atmosphere .   robert zubrin claims inability to find methane may be because rover has only explored a relatively small area .
