{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- boko haram 's murderous tactics have descended to a new barbaric low . last saturday , a bomb strapped to a schoolgirl exploded in the center of maiduguri in borno state , killing at least 20 people . then , on sunday , two girls simultaneously blew themselves up in a market in potiskum in yobe state , killing three and injuring more than 40 . it is clear that girls as young as 10 are being lined up as suicide bombers to further boko haram 's cause . and these new bombings come as boko haram has also caused outrage around the world with its indiscriminate massacre of innocent men , women and children in the towns of baga and doron baga . indeed , new photographs obtained by amnesty international show the devastation of more than 3 , 700 homes , local shops , local churches and their local schools . nothing , it seems , is sacrosanct . daniel eyre , nigeria researcher for amnesty international , said this was the  largest and most destructive  boko haram assault his organization has ever seen . the nigerian government estimated 150 people were killed , but some widely reported private estimates put the figure as high as 2,000 . days earlier , on january 4 , 40 boys and young men , ages 10 to 23 , were abducted from a village in the nigerian state of borno . this willful destruction of even the most innocent of lives destroys any illusion that boko haram will try to shield any civilian , however young or however frail , from its attacks and killings . as a result , this year is poised to be a year of infamy that could exceed the horrors of the last one . in november , for example , at least 120 people were killed in a bomb attack on a central mosque in kano , the principal city of northern nigeria . a few weeks earlier , the terror group kidnapped at least 97 people , including many children , during raids on villages in borno state . when earlier in the year they invaded the northern village of izghe , boko haram militants went door-to-door , killing any man , woman or child they came across . and perhaps most infamously , last year some 220 girls were abducted from chibok by boko haram . sadly , there has been no news on their whereabouts , meaning none of these families know whether their daughters are safe . no one knows if his or her daughter has been married off , raped , violated or even whether she is alive or dead . every waking hour remains a nightmare for these families . boko haram 's ever more violent and ever more vicious abuse of children as weapons of war -- as victims , as slaves and as suicide bombers -- must be addressed , because the threat is only likely to grow . after all , the group 's leader , abubakar shekau , who has a $ 7 million bounty on his head , was seen last week in a video praising the jihadists who killed 17 people in the paris attacks . the terrorism research and analysis consortium has described shekau as a  religious intellectual , yet also a gangster and vigilante as well as a mad leader .  with all this in mind , i am urging the international community to step up its pursuit , exposure and surveillance of boko haram and to do more to coordinate action against their cross-border incursions into nigeria , chad , cameroon and other countries . following the kidnapping of more than 200 schoolgirls in chibok , a special initiative for children was launched -- the safe schools plan . it was in response to the news that children , fearful of further terrorist attacks , had been staying away from school . the idea behind this is admirable -- the notion of safe schools and a universal call for every child to have the right to education , free of fear and intimidation . this plan is being put into place , and steps are being taken to fortify and guard schools , to improve security and to create a line of communication between schools and police and army . these new initiatives are backed by the safe school guidelines , passed by the united nations to stop the use of schools as military targets and to ensure that they are havens free from exploitation by terrorist groups . just as hospitals are regarded as protected under international law , so should schools . while better fortifications will of course not ultimately stop the carnage if a terrorist group is hellbent on an attack , the deterrent effect of enhanced security measures offers at least a first line of defense . and it also sends the important message to parents that everything possible is being done to make schools safer for their children . over the last few weeks , $ 23 million has been raised for safe schools from the international community , and in the last few days the united states and britain have announced further help for the initiative . but we are calling on all aid agencies to support this innovative plan , one that could , if applied round the world , help children worried about the threat to their schools , in countries from pakistan to lebanon . it is hard for many of us in the west to imagine what it is like to be scared even to travel to school , yet too many children around the world confront that fear every day . it is time for that to change .", "summary": " gordon brown : boko haram 's tactics have hit a new barbaric low .   boko haram 's abuse of children is growing more vicious , he says .
