{"text": "there are things that i admire about rupert murdoch . he has maintained a lifelong commitment to newspapers , long after it became clear that they were no longer profitable . he has a feistiness at 81 , when he could be happily sitting on a yacht somewhere . he now spews his opinions on that newfangled social network called twitter , and since he 's the undisputed kingpin of news corp. , who 's going to stop him ? but over the weekend , murdoch sent out a tweet that went beyond outrageous to offensive , truly offensive . he played off the worst kind of historical libel against jews . and while he later tweeted a semi-apology , it 's not clear he understands the magnitude of his hurtful words . watch : murdoch 's ` jewish press ' rant -- more ceos spewing on twitter . the subject was the violence flaring in the middle east , with israel mounting airstrikes in gaza after a long series of rocket attacks by the hamas government . the message : .  why is jewish owned press so consistently anti-israel in every crisis ?  that 's right , he said jewish-owned press , reviving the old canard about jews controlling the media . who , exactly , is he talking about ? watch : petraeus overkill or permissable pandering ? well , there 's the jewish heritage of the sulzberger family , which owns the new york times and murdoch sees as a rival . beyond that , most major media outlets are owned by public companies : comcast -lrb- nbc -rrb- , viacom -lrb- cbs -rrb- , disney -lrb- abc -rrb- , time warner -lrb- cnn -rrb- , tribune -lrb- chicago tribune and los angeles times -rrb- , gannett -lrb- usa today -rrb- . the graham family , which owns the washington post , is n't jewish . and is n't there something rich in a complaint about media ownership by the man who controls fox news , the fox broadcast network , 20th century fox , the new york post , the wall street journal , the times of london , the sunday times , sky news , harpercollins and other properties ? beyond that , it 's hard to take ethical lectures from a man who presided over a phone-hacking scandal in london that -- whatever his knowledge of it -- prompted him to close the longstanding news of the world tabloid and has led to the arrests of several of his former lieutenants . watch : orgy of advice on getting away with petraeus-like affair . what 's more , murdoch has never been shy about interfering in his newsrooms -- cozying up to politicians ranging from ed koch to margaret thatcher and tony blair -- so maybe he expects others to shape news coverage in the same way . murdoch 's fox news portrayed mitt romney as a more viable candidate than he turned out to be . but the heart of murdoch 's indictment is far more troubling . he is suggesting that jewish americans have a hidden agenda in which their religion trumps their commitment to journalism . since murdoch finds these outlets allegedly dominated by jews to be anti-israel , perhaps he thinks they are of the self-loathing variety . in a tweet on sunday , murdoch seemed to defend his use of the phrase :  ` jewish owned press ' have been sternly criticized , suggesting link to jewish reporters . do n't see this , but apologise unreservedly .  the wording is too cryptic to know for what exactly he 's apologizing . watch : why romney 's ` gifts ' comments diminish him . earlier , murdoch had tweeted that israel 's position was  precarious ,  adding  watch cnn and ap bias to the point of embarrassment .  media mogul or not , he 's entitled to criticize other coverage as he sees fit . but it 's hard to evaluate his complaints since his 140 characters contain not a single example of questionable reporting . the middle east is a minefield for even the most scrupulous journalists . a photo of a wounded palestinian often brings complaints that israel is being treated unfairly and its casualties not highlighted . a story on israelis wounded by hamas rockets often causes grumbling that the palestinian plight is being unfairly minimized . murdoch is obviously strongly pro-israel , which may mean he bristles at any coverage that does n't sympathize with benjamin netanyahu 's government . one thing , however , is clear : murdoch has undermined his own credibility by lashing out at what he calls jewish-owned organizations . he should follow the advice that editors routinely give employees : think hard before you tweet , for words , like weapons , can wound .", "summary": " howard kurtz : rupert murdoch tweeted asking why jewish owned press is anti-israel .   he says suggesting jews have hidden agenda , where religion trumps journalism , is offensive .   kurtz : it 's hypocritical from man who controls fox news , wsj , ny post , other news organs .   kurtz :  apology ' tweet cryptic ; murdoch 's slam of reporters ' ` biased ' coverage gives no proof .
