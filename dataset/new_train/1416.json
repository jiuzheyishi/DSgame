' mr miliband told mr cameron : ` you 've taken millions from tax exiles and tax avoiders , your party has never paid back the money from asil nadir -- and they 're just the people i can talk about in this house . ' treasury select committee chairman andrew tyrie said : ` the treasury committee strongly recommends that any review into the co-op bank be conducted by an independent person . ` the authorities can not be seen to be marking their own work .
