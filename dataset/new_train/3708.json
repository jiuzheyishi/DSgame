' he added : ' i have over 15 years worth of experience as a wildlife photographer i have never seen this happen before . ` the crocs are all over the place patiently waiting for an opportunity , you could sit there for hours and the crocs would just float motionless . ` we were just lucky to be at the right place at the right time .
