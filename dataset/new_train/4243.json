{"text": "a global travel alert issued friday by the state department warned al qaeda may launch attacks in the middle east , north africa and beyond in coming weeks , a threat that prompted sunday 's closure of 21 embassies and consulates . the u.s. government 's actions are in response to growing intelligence that shows a potential for attacks in yemen and elsewhere in the middle east as well as north africa , said u.s. officials who spoke to cnn on condition of not being identified .  the threat appears to be much worse than it has -lrb- been -rrb- in a long time ,  said a senior national security official in yemen , where the government is  on high alert against possible attacks in the days to come .  various western targets -- not just those tied to the united states -- are under threat , according to two u.s. officials . according to three sources , the united states has information that al qaeda in the arabian peninsula members are in the final stages of planning for an unspecified attack . one of the sources said that such preparations appeared to have increased in recent days with the approaching end of the muslim holy month of ramadan . in particular , sunday is laylet al-qadr , or the night of power , which is one of the holiest moments on the muslim calendar . said one u.s. official :  it all leads us to believe something could happen in the near future .  based on intelligence , u.s. officials said , there was particular concern about the u.s. embassy in yemen between saturday and tuesday . president barack obama -- who , amid regular updates on the situation , has directed officials to take all appropriate steps to protect americans -- praised yemeni president abdo rabu mansour hadi for his country 's efforts following a meeting thursday at the white house . photos : attacks on u.s. diplomatic sites . still , it 's unclear whether the apparent plot targets that arabian nation or one elsewhere -- which is why the travel alert applies so broadly , and why embassies from bangladesh to libya are being closed . the expected time of an attack also is n't known , with the u.s. travel alert noting the threat extends through the end of august .  terrorists may elect to use a variety of means and weapons and target both official and private interests ,  the alert states .  u.s. citizens are reminded of the potential for terrorists to attack public transportation systems and other tourist infrastructure .  new york rep. peter king , a member of the house intelligence committee , called the information  the most specific i 've seen .  while the principal attention is on the arabian peninsula , he stressed to cnn 's wolf blitzer that  we ca n't rule anything out .   we are focused on the middle east , but it 's a potential series of attacks that really could be almost anyplace ,  said king . 21 embassies , consulates ordered closed . the state department made public friday a list of 21 embassies and consulates that will close sunday , which is normally the start of the work week in the countries affected . the 17 affected u.s. embassies are in afghanistan , algeria , bahrain , bangladesh , djibouti , egypt , iraq , jordan , kuwait , libya , mauritania , oman , qatar , saudi arabia , the united arab emirates , sudan and yemen . the u.s. embassy in israel will be closed as normal sunday . see the whole list . consulates in iraq , saudi arabia and the united arab emirates are also being shut down for the day . embassies and consulates in the region typically close their doors or operate with minimal staff on fridays and saturdays . the shutdowns could extend beyond sunday , a senior state department official said . retired gen. james mattis -- who until earlier this year was head of u.s. central command , responsible for a 20-country area that includes the middle east -- said the decision to close the embassies shows the reality of the threat and the wisdom of u.s. policymakers . u.s. embassies have been targeted before in places such as yemen , turkey and tanzania , he pointed out . moreover , al qaeda in the arabian peninsula is one of the terrorist network 's most active and most destructive branches .  we have to remember that we 're up against an enemy who kills indiscriminately -- whether it be women , children , diplomats -- and our embassies ... have been one of the targets ,  mattis told cnn on friday .  they are showing some proactive discretion here , making certain that we do n't give the enemy an opportunity that we can deny them .  questions , concerns after benghazi . house leaders have been briefed on the situation , democratic leader nancy pelosi told reporters , adding that the travel alert and embassy closings provided  some understanding of the seriousness of the threat .  king , who has also heard such briefings , applauded the government 's decision to close its diplomatic missions .  i give them credit ,  the republican said of the obama administration .  i think the government is doing exactly the right thing here .  such bipartisan agreement in washington come at a time politicians are still pushing to seek answers regarding the september 11 , 2012 , attack on the u.s. consular compound in benghazi , libya , which killed four americans , including ambassador christopher stevens . since then , republicans have been pressing president barack obama 's administration for answers , with some accusing officials of covering up what happened in benghazi and not doing enough to track down the attackers . eight gop lawmakers are asking that incoming fbi director james comey brief congress within 30 days about the investigation . they say the administration 's inquiry thus far has been  simply unacceptable ,  according to a draft letter obtained by cnn . earlier this week , vice president joe biden and senior state department officials went to congress to discuss embassy security . biden also briefed congressional leadership , key committee chairmen and ranking members about the latest threat concerns , a source who attended the meeting said . another official said the recent intelligence might not have warranted such a response before the benghazi attack , given the political firestorm it created for the obama administration . on thursday , state department spokeswoman marie harf said the agency was taking the steps at diplomatic sites out of an abundance of caution . cnn found embassy attack suspect before fbi .", "summary": " the state department issues a global travel alert on possible al qaeda attacks .   sources say al
