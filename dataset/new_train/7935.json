{"text": "nick clegg today tore into coalition plans to allow nurseries to look after more children , warning it will have no impact on cutting costs for parents . he said any adult would struggle to care for six two-year-olds at once , as he lifted the lid on a long-running government row about the risks to child safety . tory minister elizabeth truss launched a strong defence of her plans in the commons , but labour said the chaotic policy put child safety at risk . deputy prime minister nick clegg could block flagship tory childcare reforms . the deputy prime minister has horrified . tory colleagues by threatening to block flagship government reforms of . childcare just weeks before they are due to be implemented . mr clegg said parents groups , experts and childcare providers had warned the reforms - championed by tory education minister elizabeth truss - would not work in an official consultation . he said : ' a lot of people basically got back in the consultation and said this is n't going to work , particularly for very small children , it is n't necessarily going to be passed on in terms of cost savings to parents . ' miss truss has designed radical . reform of the system to improve the quality of staff , while reducing . costs by lowering the stipulated adult/child ratios . she wants to raise the qualifications . required of nursery staff and , in return , allow the establishments to . increase ratios -- for instance four rather than three . under-two-year-olds per adult , and six toddlers rather than four . childminders will be able to have two babies in their care rather than one and four under-fives rather than three . but mr clegg said on his weekly radio phone-in : ` having six under-twos instead of four is quite a challenge for the adult . ' i think four is already quite a handful , just imagine if they go up to six . this is not a great ideological thing , this is just about getting it right for parents up and down the country , ' he told lbc 97.3 . ` when the last government changed the so-called ratios and allowed an adult to look after more young children , they did it for three and four-year-olds , it had almost no effect in reducing the cost for parents whatsoever . ` so you do need to be led by the evidence and that is what i will continue to do in the debate .  ` in a nutshell this debate is about : can you raise quality and quantity at the same time . we have got to get the balance right . we owe it to parents who want quality childcare . ' he said the behind-the-scenes row had been going on ` for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks ' . and he told lbc host nick ferrari : ' i will challenge you to spend a morning looking after six two-year-olds - i think you will find it quite a challenge . ' ratio reform : education minister elizabeth truss has championed changes to the number of children nurseries can look after . tory ministers want to relax the rules on carer-to-child ratios , to bring them more in line with other european countries . mr clegg insisted the row will not . affected the rest of the government 's wide-ranging childcare package . which also includes # 1,200 tax breaks on childcare for working parents . in the commons today , miss truss insisted the reforms would help to cut costs for parents while allowing childcare staff to be paid more . ` the current system of childcare is not working for parents , ' she told mps . ` too many parents in the uk are . struggling to juggle their work and childcare arrangements . families in . england pay some of the highest costs in the world - 27 per cent of . their income goes on costs , compared to 11 % in countries like france . ' she . said that in ireland and germany , the ratio for two-year-olds was six . to one , in france each member of staff could look after eight . youngsters , while in denmark and in sweden there were  no national . staff ratios at all ' . shadow education secretary stephen twigg said ratios should not be relaxed because it will not cut costs . ` our proposals will allow nurseries who hire high-quality staff to able to exercise professional judgment . it is exactly the same concept that we have used in academies , giving high-quality institutions the autonomy to make decisions for themselves and to be able to exercise professional judgment . ` these ratios are not compulsory . this is about professionals in the childcare sector being able to exercise their judgment and being able to deliver an affordable , high-quality service to parents . ' but labour 's shadow education secretary stephen twigg said the row was proof of a government in chaos . writing for mailonline he said : ` all this gives the impression of a government that runs on the basis of chaos and confusion . this creates real fear amongst parents who need some reassurance on the quality and affordability of childcare . ` the truth is this is a government with no plan to help hard working families with the costs of childcare , which have spiralled under this government . ` it 's not just the experts of course , as any parent will tell you , young children are demanding and they need lots of attention , so while a childminder can have the very best qualifications , they still only have one pair of hands . ` labour have been campaigning on this issue for months , warning that the changes would risk the quality of care and even child safety . ' in . january miss truss unveiled a major overhaul of the rules on who can . look after children , the qualifications they need and the ratios of . staff to children with the aim of having fewer , better-qualified staff . but government advisor , professor helen penn , said : ` the figures she gives seem to me to be rather grotesque . ' professor . penn , an expert in early childhood , co-wrote a report for the . government on the reforms with professor eva lloyd last year . however , . a leaked copy revealed it warned allowing childminders and nursery . workers to care for more children would lead to a ` deterioration ' of the . quality of care . in an interview with the daily mail last month , miss truss said too many childcare settings were ` chaotic ' with children ` running around ' and ` no sense of purpose ' . a spokesman said : ` nick remains to be persuaded that this is the right thing to do for very young children ' but in government meetings over recent days , mr clegg has made clear he can no longer support the reforms of ratios . ` the . question that needs to be answered is will this drive down costs , ' said . a lib dem source . ` if it does n't then that defeats the object of doing . it . ' another whitehall source said the lib dems appeared to have been ` spooked ' by the negative reaction of some childcare providers . the prime minister will now have to begin ` horse-trading ' with the lib dems . a . spokesman for the deputy prime minister said : ` the delivery of good . quality , affordable childcare is one of nick clegg 's biggest priorities . nick remains to be persuaded that this is the right thing to do for very young children . ` or , crucially , to be persuaded that this would actually help families with high childcare costs . ' in one survey , conducted by the national children 's bureau , out of 341 staff interviewed , 95 per cent said they were concerned about the policy . ` the government 's own adviser on childcare , professor cathy nutbrown , said the ratio plans ` make no sense at all ' . neil leitch , chief executive of the pre-school learning alliance , said : ` thousands of parents and practitioners , as well as some of the country 's leading early years academics , are against these changes , which will lower the overall quality of childcare in this country . ` we trust the deputy prime minister will listen to what parents and the sector have to say about these proposals , which we believe are a huge mistake . ' the department for education refused to comment .", "summary": " deputy prime minister says reforms will not reduce nursery fees .   row has been running for ` weeks and weeks ' , he reveals on radio show .   tory education minister elizabeth truss pushed reforms allowing nurseries to care for more children .   labour says policy is in ` chaos ' and demand urgent debate in parliament .
