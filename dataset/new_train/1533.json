{"text": "nidal hasan collected nearly $ 300,000 of his military salary while awaiting trial for the 2009 shooting rampage at fort hood , texas , but his victims will not see any of it . hasan 's attorney said nearly all of the money has been given to charity -- likely making it impossible for his victims to get any of it . but civil attorney , john galligan , would n't disclose any information about the charities or proof that donations had been made . seeking compensation : alonzo lunsford describes one of his wounds from the 2009 fort hood shooting rampage , at his home in lillington , n.c. . he is suing the government . an army spokesman said the military ca n't get back the money because hasan , like any other service member charged with a crime , continued to receive his military salary until he was convicted last month . ` the great bulk of his income has been donated to charity , ' said galligan , who also once represented hasan in the criminal case . ` there 's really virtually no money in any bank that i 'm aware of . there 's really no property holdings . ' the money would likely only be a fraction of what hasan 's victims and their relatives still need . some have struggled to find jobs or pay medical bills since hasan killed 13 people and wounded more than 30 others when he opened fire inside a crowded building on the texas military base on nov. 5 , 2009 . payments : nidal hasan -lrb- pictured -rrb- collected nearly $ 300,000 in his military salary while awaiting trial for the 2009 shooting rampage at fort hood , texas . but his salary carries symbolic value . ` it 's not about the amount . it 's about principle , ' said retired staff sgt. alonzo lunsford , who was shot seven times by hasan and testified at his trial . ` during this time the man was incarcerated , he was still drawing full military pay , full military benefits . that money was spent on him , and we were denied -- still -- certain benefits . ' lunsford wants hasan 's salary to go into a scholarship fund for victims ' children . he also is among the victims suing the government , in a lawsuit that also names hasan , in an effort to get the shooting characterized as a terrorist attack rather than workplace violence . the designation would make them eligible for more benefits and recognition that they say they deserve . victim : retired u.s. army staff sgt. shawn manning still carries two bullets in his body from the attack . but whether they can get any money from hasan is unlikely , according to the military , galligan and a lawyer for the victims . along with a lack of bank accounts tied to hasan , fbi agents found little more than a table , a folding chair and a prayer mat in his apartment after the shooting . given his rank as major , hasan collected more than $ 7,000 a month in salary , according to the army . that salary was subject to federal taxes , but texas does n't collect a state income tax . his paychecks were revoked 14 days after he was sentenced to death last month , per army regulations . but his case had dragged out for nearly four years , in part because he was forbidden to plead guilty to charges after prosecutors refused to take the death penalty off the table . hasan 's expenses after the attack were limited , according to galligan . secretary of defense robert m. gates -lrb- right -rrb- speaks with police sgt. kimberly munley at a hospital in fort hood , texas , after the attack in november , 2009 , left her wounded . about $ 10,000 was spent to hire a medical specialist to assess hasan 's life expectancy . hasan was paralyzed from the waist down after being shot in the back by a fort hood police officer during the rampage . hasan represented himself at his trial , and although he told the judge the shootings were necessary to protect islamic and taliban leaders from u.s. troops overseas , he presented no evidence or witnesses . the american-born muslim had government-funded defense lawyers to help him , and galligan said he has worked for hasan mostly for free . wounded soldiers arrive for the start of the memorial service that president obama and michelle obama attended for the thirteen victims of the shooting rampage in november 2010 . army spokesman lt. col. s. justin platt said the military ca n't get back the money hasan was paid while behind bars . hasan 's sentence included a dismissal from the army and a forfeiture of all pay and allowances . galligan said hasan 's paychecks were not deposited in a bank , but he declined to say how hasan handled them . he refused to hint at the type of charities hasan allegedly helped . reed rubinstein , an attorney helping victims sue the government , said he was exploring ways to get any money or assets he could out of hasan . but he acknowledged that those efforts might not succeed . ` we have no way of knowing what he did with that money , ' rubinstein said . ` it 's quite possible and likely that the money is long gone .
