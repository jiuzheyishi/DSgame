{"text": "for 19 years , the cold case of two slain prostitutes weighed heavily on the small military town of oak grove , kentucky , especially after the brothel 's madam publicly accused two allegedly corrupt police officers of the killings . because the madam 's accusation was boldly made during a city council meeting three years after the deaths , everyone in town has long known of the suspicions , but local police and the christian county sheriff 's office were unable to crack the case . now , a seven-year investigation by the kentucky state police has resulted in charges against the two police officers , both of whom have since left the force , and a third man . one of the former officers was a detective who appeared at the crime scene with other officers to investigate the killings , said one former officer who was first on the scene . for now , oak grove , adjacent to the u.s. army 's fort campbell , is feeling relief from the tantalizing mystery , but the town 's mayor said wednesday he suspects the case could become even bigger .  i think this is just the tip of the iceberg . i think there are more arrests coming ,  said dan potter , who was n't mayor when the killings occurred in 1994 .  would n't the other police officers know ?  one of the former officers , leslie duncan , 50 , already is serving a three-year prison sentence after pleading guilty in september to tampering with physical evidence in the case , state police said . duncan , of central city , kentucky , was charged this month with two counts of complicity to murder , police said . former officer edward t. carter , 43 , of somerset , kentucky , was charged with two counts of murder and is being held by the warren county , ohio , sheriff 's office pending his extradition to kentucky , said kentucky state trooper stuart recke said . it was not immediately clear if carter has retained an attorney . a third man who was never a police officer , frank j. black jr. , 39 , of gadsden , alabama , also was charged with two counts of murder and is being held by alabama authorities pending extradition to kentucky , recke said . black 's father , frank sr. , told cnn that his son -- who was living in nearby clarksville , tennessee , at the time of the killings -- is innocent and says he is n't sure how his son came to be associated with duncan and clark -- or if they were at all . carter and black are being held in lieu of $ 1 million bail , recke said . duncan 's attorney , stephanie ritchie , said his client  maintains his innocence and denies being involved in the murders or intentionally doing anything to cover up or conceal the identities of the murderer or murderers .   mr. duncan pled guilty in september of this year as a result of his mishandling of the police investigation immediately following the murders in 1994 ,  ritchie said .  he expressed remorse and regret to the victims ' families and to the court for his inadequacies as a young inexperienced detective with too much responsibility on his shoulders ,  ritchie said . the charges against all three men stem from the 1994 killings of candace belt , 22 , and gloria ross , 18 , who worked as prostitutes at the new life massage parlor , police said .  needless to say , since it 's an open and active investigation , we ca n't get too much into the details ,  recke said this week .  the kentucky state police got the investigation back in 2006 . our investigators , once we get an investigation from another agency , we start from square one and go through all the information available with a fine-tooth comb .  a fellow officer 's suspicions . former officer bob combs , who was first to arrive at the scene of the killings , recalled his suspicions of carter and duncan at the time .  i suspected that they may have been involved , but did n't have evidence ,  said combs , who had joined the force only a year before . belt , a mother of two ,  was still alive  when he arrived , combs said ,  but she died on the way to the hospital .   once duncan got there , he was the detective , so it became his scene ,  he said . in an interview this week with cnn , combs claimed duncan disturbed crime scene evidence .  duncan ran in there and messed up the scene . the phone was off the hook when i arrived , but then after duncan was in there , the phone was back on the receiver ,  combs said .  no one had ever asked me -- the first officer on the scene -- anything about this case . no one ever asked me anything until the state police took over -- years after it happened .  combs , who went on to be a city councilman and served until last year , said he and duncan had been friendly back then .  he could be a nice guy , but he could have a real temper ,  combs said . ex-madam : ` they knew we had stuff on them ' three years after the killings , then-councilwoman patty balew announced that she , too , was a former prostitute at the massage parlor . she and other prostitutes gave police sexual favors at a discount or at no cost , she alleged .  if they were police officers , that 's what we had to do whether we wanted to or not , which we did n't like ,  balew told cnn in 1997 . this week , combs recalled the city council meeting in 1997 when tammy papler , the massage parlor 's madam , dramatically accused the police officers of extortion and murder . papler could n't be reached by cnn for comment this week . but in a 1997 interview , papler alleged of police :  they were n't getting any more money from us , and they knew we had stuff on them . the only way to keep us quiet is to kill the girls and put us in jail .  papler made further accusations in the cnn article that year , when she had already quit being a madam .  i did what they told me to do ,  she said .  if they needed new police lights , i bought new police lights . if they needed birthday money , i gave them birthday money . if they needed money for a trailer to be moved ... basically anything they told me they needed , i gave them the money for it .  belt and ross were shot in the head , and their throats were slashed , papler said .  it was devastating to us ,  papler said in 1997 .  they both had babies . one was breastfeeding her ba taken : the coldest case ever solved . a pall in the aftermath . also in 1997 , the christian county sheriff 's department said crime scene evidence was botched by police , and then-sheriff thomas scillian said carter was a prime suspect . he had been at the scene 30 minutes before the slayings , according to authorities .  there 's other information that we have that leads us to believe that carter would be a good suspect ,  scillian said . then-mayor bobby mace said the killings cast a pall over the small town :  there 's a cloud hanging over us right now and there 's no rain ,  he said .  let 's get it to either rain or let the wind blow the cloud out and let 's get moving forward to the future .  in 1998 , a federal court in kentucky ruled in favor of ross ' husband and her two children in their lawsuit against tammy and ronnie papler , who owned the massage parlor business , court papers show . the court issued a default judgment against the paplers for failing to respond to , or defend against , the ross family 's lawsuit , which accused the paplers of negligence in ross ' death . a u.s. district court judge , however , dismissed the rosses ' negligence claims against louise seawright , the owner of the building where the massage parlor was located . texas man arrested 45 years after pennsylvania slaying .", "summary": " ex-cop jailed for evidence tampering  denies being involved in the murders ,  attorney says .   for 19 years , kentucky residents wondered who killed two prostitutes .   a seven-year state police investigation finally charges the 2 ex-cops and a third man .   investigations into the case had been thwarted by tampered evidence .
