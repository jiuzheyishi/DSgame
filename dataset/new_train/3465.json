{"text": "a country life may sound idyllic , but experts have found a possible link between rural living and parkinson 's disease . analysis of more than 100 studies from around the world shows that exposure to pesticides , bug and weed killers and solvents is associated with a higher risk of developing parkinson 's disease . study author , dr emanuele cereda , said : . ` due to this association , there was also a link between farming or . country living and developing parkinson 's in some of the studies . ' exposure to chemicals associated with country has been linked to an increased risk of parkinson 's disease . researchers from the irccs university hospital san matteo foundation in pavia , italy , reviewed studies that looked at weed , fungus , rodent or bug killers , and solvents in relation to the risk of developing parkinson 's disease . proximity to these chemicals , due to country living , occupation and drinking water were also evaluated . the research found that being exposed to bug or weed killers and solvents increased the risk of developing parkinson 's disease by 33 to 80 per cent . in controlled studies , exposure to the weed killer paraquat or the fungicides maneb and mancozeb was associated with twice the risk of developing the disease . parkinson 's is a chronic neurological disorder due a to deficiency in dopamine . dr cereda added : ` we did n't study whether the type of exposure , such as whether the compound was inhaled or absorbed through the skin and the method of application , such as spraying or mixing , affected parkinson 's risk . ` however , our study suggests that the risk increases in a dose response manner as the length of exposure to these chemicals increases . ' parkinson 's disease is a chronic neurological disorder , characterised by a deficiency of dopamine . this affects the way the brain co-ordinates the movements of the muscles in different parts of the body . the disease mainly develops in the over 50s . about 5 in 1,000 people in their 60s , and about 40 in 1,000 people in their 80s have the condition . the main symptoms are slowness of movement , stiffness of muscles and shaking . these tend to slowly worsen with time although the rate varies from patient to patient . there is currently no cure . the research appears in the journal neurology .", "summary": " italian researchers looked at studies involving exposure to weed , fungus , rodent or bug .   killers and solvents .   results showed risk increased by 33 to 80 per cent .   study suggests the risk is dependent on the dose and length of exposure to certain chemicals .
