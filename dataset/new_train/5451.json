' an attorney for knight said the decision , the first of its kind in iowa , is a victory for family values because knight fired nelson in the interest of saving his marriage , not because she was a woman . but nelson 's attorney said iowa 's all-male high court , one of only a handful in the nation , failed to recognize the discrimination women see routinely in the workplace . nelson insisted she was never interested in knight romantically , regardless of his own feelings . ` absolutely not , ' she said . ` i 'm happily married .
