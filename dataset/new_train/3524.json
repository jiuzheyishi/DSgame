{"text": "for most men , giving a father of the bride speech is one of the proudest moments of their lives . but after it consultant irving caplan was paralysed in a cycling accident , he feared he may have to address guests at his daughter 's wedding from a wheelchair . however , thanks to the latest in robotic technology , the 55-year-old walked across the dance floor of a wedding venue last month and delivered his speech standing up . scroll down for video . tetraplegic irving caplan shocked guests at his daughter 's wedding by crossing the floor using bionic legs and standing to make his father of the bride speech . his daughter joanne said it was the ` moment of the wedding ' after mr caplin borrowed the device for the day . mr caplan , from stanmore , middlesex , broke three vertebrae when he collided with a lorry in edgware , north-west london on his morning cycle to work two years ago . after undergoing a series of operations and spending 12 days in intensive care , he was left tetraplegic and needing a wheelchair to get around . when his daughter joanne announced she was to marry fianc√© mike beaumont , mr caplan feared he would be unable to walk his daughter down the aisle or deliver his speech standing up . but after he and wife karen , 57 , met a representative of rex bionics at an exhibition of technologies for the disabled , he was lent the robotic suit to allow him to stand and walk . the legs contain 29 computer processors which communicate 3,000 a messages a second to each other . the motors can carry a person weighing up to 15 stone have been used by 50 people , clocking up 4,000 hours of walking . they are currently estimated at costing # 97,000 but makers believe they can get the price down to # 40,000 . the benefits are not confined to the mobility of users , as the upright position also reduces the risks of users developing other health problems . they are currently being tested by the us military in rehabilitation centres for wounded servicemen . he told mailonline : ` the guests were gobsmacked when i walked out . it was the usual speech , thanking everyone for coming and hoping everybody had a good evening , but i certainly surprised them all with my entrance . ` it was n't possible for a number of reasons for me to walk joanne down the aisle , but i was able to do my speech standing up . ` it is quite an issue when you end up in a wheelchair , being at the wrong height compared to everybody else . but being able to speak to everybody from the right height did make quite a difference . ` it made a difference to me in the sense that i was doing it from the right perspective . ` the day was wonderful . it was everything you would hope your daughter 's wedding day to be . unfortunately i could not do everything i would have wanted to do , but this certainly helped . ' mr caplan made the three-minute , 30-pace walk across the hall of sopwell house , st albans last month to gasps from guests , who had no idea what he had planned . joanne , 29 , said : ' i knew what he was going to do but the only times he had tried it before , i had been at work , so it was still very emotional to see him walk across the room . ` it was important to him to be able to do as much at the wedding as he would have been able to do before he had the accident , so it was amazing . ` most of the guests knew him pre-accident and post-accident and for them it was pretty emotional too because it is nice to see him upright and at the same level as you . ' wedding organisers played a soundtrack of walking on the moon , walking back to happiness and you 'll never walk alone , and mr caplan said : ` there was n't a dry eye in the house ' . mr caplan said the bionic legs made a huge difference to his experience of his daughter 's big day . the ` exoskeleton suit ' , which is controlled by a joystick and a series of computers and motors , was lent to mr caplan for the day . mr caplan added : ` there are a number similar technologies being developed and they are all in very early stages . ` it is worth about # 97,000 so it is not something i could just stick on the credit card or be able to afford any time soon , but it made a big difference . ' brian carlin , of charity aspire , who mr caplan supports , said : ` irving caplan has been a supporter of aspire since he was paralysed by a spinal cord injury in 2012 and we would like to congratulate him and his family on his daughter 's wedding . ` one of our services is to provide adapted houses for spinal injured people to live in whilst they find suitable accessible accommodation . irving caplan lived in an aspire house in london from april 2013 to march 2014 and since then has been a supporter of the charity , raising over # 2,000 .
