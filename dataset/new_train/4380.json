{"text": "as the fallout continues from the release of thousands of diplomatic cables on the wikileaks website , turkey 's prime minister is threatening to file a lawsuit over comments made about him in one of the messages by the u.s. ambassador to his country . recep tayyip erdogan says he plans to sue over remarks from then-ambassador eric edelman in 2004 suggesting that the prime minister concealed his wealth in swiss bank accounts . visibly angry , erdogan told an audience in ankara , turkey , wednesday that he wanted the u.s. administration to take action against the diplomats who had  slandered  him .  the united states should ask its diplomats to make an explanation because no diplomat can accuse a country with slanders and misinterpretations ,  he said .  this is the united states ' problem , not ours ... those who have slandered us will be crushed under these claims , will be finished and will disappear ,  erdogan said later , according to turkish media reports . in a cable dated december 12 , 2004 , the u.s. ambassador in ankara at the time wrote a less-than-flattering profile of erdogan , who had recently become prime minister amid anxiety among western governments about his  islamist tendencies .  the note sent to washington by edelman said the new prime minister 's  hunger for power reveals itself in a sharp authoritarian style and deep distrust of others .  erdogan 's advisors were characterized as  sycophantic -lrb- but contemptuous -rrb-  in the missive . the cable also spoke of the prime minister 's  susceptibility to islamist theories .   he indulges in pronounced pro-sunni prejudices and in emotional reactions that prevent the development of coherent , practical domestic or foreign policies ,  the cable added . cnn calls to edelman for comment were not immediately returned . the cable then discussed the alleged bank accounts . while apparently offering no evidence they existed , it continued :  we have heard from two contacts that erdogan has eight accounts in swiss banks ; his explanations that his wealth comes from the wedding presents guests gave his son and that a turkish businessman is paying the educational expenses of all four erdogan children in the u.s. purely altruistically are lame .  erdogan vowed to resign if it could be shown he had bank accounts in switzerland .  i do n't have a god 's penny in swiss banks to prove . now , i am telling the leader of the opposition and others , if such a thing would be proven , i would not stay in this position , i would not remain a parliamentarian .
