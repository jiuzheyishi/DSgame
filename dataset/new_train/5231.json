{"text": "new role : dan stevens is to play a guardian journalist in an upcoming film . the death of dashing matthew crawley broke the hearts of millions of downton abbey fans on christmas day . but dan stevens , the actor who played him , already has his next job lined up -- playing a guardian journalist in a new hollywood film about wikileaks founder julian assange . he will appear alongside his friend benedict cumberbatch , of sherlock fame , who has landed the lead role of the controversial whistleblower . stevens , who is currently on broadway in the play the heiress , told the mail on sunday in new york that ` we 're in negotiations ' about the movie . assange had a turbulent relationship with the guardian when they collaborated over the release of 250,000 secret us diplomatic cables last year . stevens 's character , who is called ian , is based on guardian deputy editor ian katz . steven spielberg 's dreamworks studio , which is making the film , has struck a rights deal with the guardian , although a spokesman insisted that neither katz nor editor alan rusbridger had personally benefited from the arrangement . filming will take place next year -- at the same time as the fourth series of downton is shot , which may explain why stevens had to quit the itv period drama . he has previously said : ` there are some very exciting opportunities . downton was a very monopolising job . i have n't done as many films as i would have liked . ' swedish beauty alicia vikander , 24 , has also signed up for the film , which may be called the man who sold the world . it is not being made with the blessing of wikileaks . but the studio has bought up the rights to two biographies of assange -- one by former wikileaks spokesman daniel domscheit-berg and another by guardian journalists david leigh and luke harding . the studio behind the film has bought the rights to two biographies of julian assange -lrb- pictured -rrb- who is currently hold up in the ecuadorian embassy . monopolising : dan stevens said that his role in downton abbey -lrb- cast pictured -rrb- did not allow him to do as many films as he would have liked . all of the authors have fallen out with assange , who is currently holed up in ecuadorian embassy in london to avoid extradition to sweden to face sexual assault charges . wikileaks spokesman kristinn hrafnsson said : ` if the film reflects what is written in those books , it will provide a negative view of wikileaks with limited impartiality . hollywood is not exactly the best reflection of contemporary history . ` i do n't believe wikileaks or julian has been contacted by dreamworks , but i do n't expect any courtesy from any organisation within hollywood . ' last year , at least five film versions of the wikileaks story were said to be in development . in the downton christmas episode she played edna , a flirtatious housemaid whose clumsy attempt to seduce a topless tom branson , the former chauffeur who has married into the crawley family , led to her being dismissed from service . but such antics are tame compared with what myanna buring gets up to in bbc1 crime drama ripper street , which begins tonight . set in 1889 in the aftermath of the jack the ripper murders , it stars the swedish-born actress , 28 -- who played a vampire in two of the twilight films -- as long susan , a feisty brothel-keeper who is on the run from the law in america . scarlet woman : myanna buring with charlene mckenna -lrb- left -rrb- in ripper street . clumsy : myanna buring played edna , a flirtatious housemaide whose attempt to seduce a topless tom brason , led to her being dismissed from service . susan and her ex-lover homer jackson , a renegade former us army surgeon -lrb- adam rothenberg -rrb- , have a tempestuous relationship and are forever arguing . the situation is n't helped by the fact that jackson , a drunk and a gambler , is now sleeping with rose , a prostitute played by charlene mckenna . viewers first see buring 's character as she watches through a peephole as jackson makes love to rose . in another risque storyline , jackson discovers susan has hired out rose to a man who may be a murderer . downton abbey will thrive despite the controversial death of matthew crawley , the show 's writer julian fellowes has insisted . lord fellowes said the character 's demise shortly after he had become a father would mean a pivotal role for his widow lady mary in the fourth series of the itv drama next year . ` mary is back on her own , establishing her rights as the guardian of her baby son , fighting to get the estate through the dark days of the twenties , struggling to re-find her own life , ' said lord fellowes .", "summary": " he will star alongside benedict cumberbatch who will play the lead role .   his character , called ian , is based on guardian deputy editor ian katz .   steven spielberg 's film studio has struck a rights deal with the guardian .   it has bought the rights of two biographies of whistleblower julian assange .
