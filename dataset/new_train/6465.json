{"text": "they are the backbone of church fetes , village fairs and jumble sales all around the country . but the thousands who regularly sell their home-made jam , marmalade or chutney in re-used jars may have to abandon their traditions after a warning that they are breaching european health and safety regulations . legal advisers to britain 's churches have sent out a circular saying that while people can use jars for jam at home or to give to family and friends , they can not sell them or even give them away as raffle prizes at a public event . glass warfare : the women 's institute is warning its 210,000 members about the european regulations . take note : the written circular from the churches ' legislation advisory service . the circular from the churches ' legislation advisory service , which is chaired by the bishop of exeter , . is pointedly headed : ` please take note : this looks like a spoof but it 's . not . ' the advisers say the . rules that are being breached are the snappily-titled ec regulations . 1935/2004 and 2023/2006 , which prevent containers being re-used unless . they are specifically designed for that purpose . the . women 's institute said it was offering similar advice on the re-use of . jam jars to its 210,000 members . a spokesman said the news could send ` a . tremor through middle-england ' and the organisation was braced for a . flurry of inquiries . the . food standards agency said the rules had been introduced because there . was a risk of chemicals leaching out of old containers and contaminating . food , though it added that it was not aware that re-used jam jars . were a safety hazard . ` daft ' : the news will alarm a growing number of jam-makers . the agency said it was up to local authority environmental health officers to enforce the regulations , and penalties can reach a maximum of a # 5,000 fine , six months ' imprisonment , or both . the news will alarm the growing number of jam-makers inspired by model kate moss , who makes damson jam out of fruit from her cotswolds estate , and the duchess of cambridge , who keeps pots to give away to friends . mary berry , the star of the bbc 's the great british bake off , said : ` this is absolutely stupid . it is just going too far . ` we . are encouraging people to save money by using fruits to make chutneys . and jam , and if they have to buy new jars it will become much too . expensive . it 's daft . ' the rules are also causing . consternation in churches that rely on the hundreds of thousands of . pounds raised from fetes and bazaars . the rev derek williams , a spokesman . for the diocese of peterborough , said enforcing the rule ` would be a . blow to fundraising events for all sorts of voluntary organisations ' . he added : ` it 's quite ridiculous , as . selling home-made jams and chutneys has always been a traditional and . important part of fundraising for church groups and others . ` older people in particular , or those not terribly well-off , have never been shy of making a few pots and giving that away . ` people will offer their home-made jam when perhaps they ca n't give anything else .
