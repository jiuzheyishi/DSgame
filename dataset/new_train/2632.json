{"text": "there was the news that made the headlines . and then there were the personal stories that made a lasting impact on only a few people , but touched the lives of millions . this year , cnn invited people to share their personal essays with the world , and they delivered . dozens of ireporters had the courage to pour out their hearts with unforgettable stories of pain , loss , joy , courage and anger , many of which were published on cnn.com . parenting was a huge topic this year . gun control and frustrations with government were also on people 's minds . as 2013 comes to a close , here 's a look back at some of the best stories we received and the people who shared them . the mother raising her kids without religion . deborah mitchell stirred intense debate on cnn.com in early january when she posted seven reasons  why i raise my children without god .  readers who disagreed with her view flagged the ireport as inappropriate so many times that we had to put a note on it asking people to stop . mitchell , a mother of two teenagers in texas , said she simply wanted people to stop fearing atheists .  i do not want religion to go away ,  she wrote .  i want my children to be free not to believe .  her story drew more comments than any other ireport story to date and resulted in a book contract for mitchell . her memoir ,  growing up godless : a parent 's guide to raising kids without religion ,  comes out this spring . the woman whose son taught her oscar pistorius was just a man . cynthia falardeau had always searched for a role model for her 10-year-old son , whose right hand was amputated at birth . the first time she saw south african runner oscar pistorius run on his carbon fiber blades , she was ecstatic . but wyatt calmly told her ,

learn how to best educate their kids ,  she wrote in an essay for cnn .  i work with a lot of other mothers and a lot of them are shocked that i was taught how to shoot . i understand because i was
