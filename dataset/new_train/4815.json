{"text": "the anti-apartheid message was serious and heartfelt , but the song that alerted many around the world to the injustices of the south african regime could not have been more upbeat .  free nelson mandela  by the special aka was a top 10 hit in the united kingdom in 1984 , and it instantly became the unofficial anthem and slogan for the international anti-apartheid movement . the song 's eponymous subject rose to prominence in the 1950s as a radical young member of the african national congress , the main opposition movement to the segregationist south african government . as an advocate of guerrilla attacks , mandela was frequently arrested and eventually convicted in 1964 , along with other anc leaders , for sabotage . he received a life prison sentence , and spent 27 years in a cell , mostly on robben island , off the south african coast . while mandela languished in jail , an anti-apartheid movement slowly developed in the west , starting with sporting sanctions against south africa and later an artists ' boycott of performances in the country . the writer of  free nelson mandela ,  jerry dammers -- the founder of the multiracial english ska-punk band the specials , later renamed the special aka -- admits he knew little about mandela before he attended an anti-apartheid concert in london in 1983 . that concert gave him the idea for the song .  i 'd never actually heard of nelson mandela , although i knew a lot about the anti-apartheid movement and he was becoming a figurehead for the whole movement ,  dammers told cnn . the keyboardist , who also wrote  ghost town ,  the seminal specials song against the policies of great britain 's prime minister at the time , margaret thatcher , may not have known much about the imprisoned anti-apartheid figurehead , but his lyrics brought mandela 's struggle to the attention of a wider audience . the song 's relentlessly upbeat feel certainly helped push it up the charts .  it ends with the thing of ` i 'm begging you ' and then ` i 'm telling you , '  dammers said .  it is a demand but in a positive way , it brought some sort of hope that the situation could be sorted out .  some of the lyrics : . free nelson mandela . 21 years in captivity . shoes too small to fit his feet . his body abused but his mind is still free . are you so blind that you can not see ? i said ... free nelson mandela , i 'm begging you . free nelson mandela . veteran dj and broadcaster paul gambaccini said the song was effective in educating people about mandela , whose reputation was low in the west at the time .  now we have this sainted vision of mandela , but at the time thatcher treated him as a terrorist . so to release a record about someone whom your pm considers a terrorist is quite brave .  the song helped to change perceptions about mandela , according to gambaccini , a presenter on leading uk station bbc radio 2 .  it did educate people about apartheid an incredible amount , because they certainly were n't going to learn about mandela from conventional sources . the word on him from on high was very bad , so it was up to musicians to take a leading role in rehabilitating his reputation .   free nelson mandela  was also an extremely effective protest song , he added , a view echoed in 2010 by left-leaning current affairs magazine new statesman , which included it in a list of the top 20 political anthems of all time .  ` free nelson mandela ' was effective for two reasons ,  gambaccini said .  it 's a good pop record in that it 's catchy and sounds good . and you immediately know what it 's about , because the first three words are ` free nelson mandela . ' and secondly , it had a clear message that the audience agreed with .  and the fact that the specials were at the time a  top 10 band  meant the audience took note .  if the specials say it , there must be something to it ,  as gambaccini noted . four years later , in 1988 , dammers and the band simple minds helped organize the nelson mandela 70th birthday concert at london 's wembley stadium , featuring acts such as dire straits , george michael and sting . peter gabriel played  biko  about another anti-apartheid activist , while steven van zandt performed his influential song  sun city .  the event was watched by a global television audience of 600 million and is credited with hardening popular opposition internationally to the apartheid regime . gambaccini is proud of his contribution to the event , for which he was one of the tv presenters .  the concert was an incredible success ,  he said .  it had the biggest tv audience to date , and put mandela in topic a position around the world . but it might never have happened without the song ` free nelson mandela , ' because this inspired some of the artists who appeared at wembley to be there .  as the impact of the concert rippled around the world , the south african government was secretly holding talks with mandela . these meetings culminated in his release on february 11 , 1990 . four years later , he succeeded f.w. de klerk to become the republic 's first black president . mandela never forgot the debt he owed to supporters in the united kingdom . in 1996 he used a speech to both houses of parliament in london to give his thanks :  we take this opportunity once more to pay tribute to the millions of britons who , through the years , stood up to say : no to apartheid !  in 2008 , singer amy winehouse joined dammers for the finale to a concert in london 's hyde park marking mandela 's 90th birthday . the song 's message had long since been realized -- and indeed the by-then-frail elder statesman appeared onstage -- but it was received as warmly as ever .", "summary": "  free nelson mandela ,  by the special aka raised awareness of the jailed anc figurehead .   songwriter jerry dammers said it had a message that situation could be resolved .   it was performed at 1988 concert in london that increased pressure on south africa .
