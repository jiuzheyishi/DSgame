{"text": "new york a new york judge dismissed sexual assault charges against former international monetary fund chief dominique strauss-kahn at the prosecutor 's request tuesday . a grand jury indicted strauss-kahn in may over allegations he sexually assaulted hotel housekeeper nafissatou diallo in his new york hotel suite . but in july , prosecutors began to back off the case , asking judge michael obus to release strauss-kahn from house arrest after information surfaced that they said called diallo 's credibility into question . on monday , prosecutors asked obus to dismiss the charges entirely , while diallo 's attorney filed a motion asking that manhattan district attorney cyrus vance be disqualified from the case and that a special prosecutor be appointed . obus rejected the request from diallo 's attorneys and then , at a hearing tuesday morning , approved the request to dismiss charges . he had stayed implementation of the order to give diallo 's attorneys time to appeal his decision on the special prosecutor . the new york supreme court rejected the appeal tuesday afternoon , according to court attorney lauren holmes . diallo 's attorney , kenneth thompson , decried the decision .  district attorney vance has abandoned an innocent woman and has denied an innocent woman a chance to get justice in a rape case ,  he said . vance , in a news release tuesday , said prosecutors had no choice because they were  not persuaded -- beyond a reasonable doubt -- that a crime has been committed , based on the evidence we have .  he said diallo 's testimony  was fatally damaged , for several key reasons .  in a statement , strauss-kahn -- who has always denied the charges -- thanked his attorneys and obus for his decision .  these past two and a half months have been a nightmare for me and my family ,  he said , adding that he was  obviously gratified that the district attorney agreed with my lawyers that this case had to be dismissed .  later , speaking to reporters outside his house , he said ,  i am thankful for my wife , my children , my friends , and those who supported me during this period . i look forward to returning to my country , but i still have some things to do before i leave . i will explain more fully when i return .  strauss-kahn 's attorneys said in a statement monday after prosecutors filed their request that it vindicated their consistent claim that their client is innocent .  mr. strauss-kahn and his family are grateful that the district attorney 's office took our concerns seriously and concluded on its own that this case can not proceed further ,  attorneys william w. taylor and benjamin brafman said in a statement . in a paris news conference before the hearing , one of diallo 's attorneys said dismissing the charges would be a travesty .  for the district attorney to now dismiss this case or seek to dismiss this case and turn his back on this victim because of so-called credibility issues is an affront not only on ms. diallo but an affront on all victims and sexual victims who come forward in the future ,  attorney douglas wigdor said . prosecutors filed a  recommendation for dismissal  in the case monday , noting more questions about diallo 's credibility .  the nature and number of the complainant 's falsehoods leave us unable to credit her version of events beyond a reasonable doubt , whatever the truth may be about the encounter between the complainant and the defendant ,  the document states .  if we do not believe her beyond a reasonable doubt , we can not ask a jury to do so .  prosecutors voiced concern that the case appeared to rest exclusively on the housekeeper 's account , predicting her  falsehoods  would be  devastating  if revealed during a trial . they claim she  has not been truthful in matters great and small ,  including lying about a  gang rape , as well as other details about her life in -lrb- her native -rrb- guinea .  diallo lied about the specifics of her whereabouts after the incident and past details of an asylum application and information on tax forms , prosecutors said . she also admitted lying on the asylum application about having been a victim of a gang rape , even providing details of an attack and later admitting it never happened , according to prosecutors . in their court filing , prosecutors said that dna testing indicated semen on her dress matched strauss-kahn and shows there was a sexual encounter . there was  no trauma to her body or oral cavity  and  scrapings from underneath her fingernails ... yielded no results .  moreover , prosecutors claim diallo 's current story of her  prompt outcry to her first supervisor is inconsistent with certain aspects of that supervisor 's account .   all of the evidence that might be relevant to the contested issues of force and lack of consent is simply inconclusive ,  wrote the prosecutors . thompson said strauss-kahn 's power and prestige played a role in the outcome of the case , saying prosecutors would not  run from dna evidence  if strauss-kahn  was a plumber .  in paris before the hearing , wigdor disputed almost every aspect of the prosecution 's claim , saying a medical examination following the alleged rape showed bruises on diallo 's vagina and that she suffered a  tear  on her shoulder and rips in her stockings . a  mountain of physical evidence  points toward a violent sexual assault during a nine-minute period inside strauss-kahn 's new york hotel suite in may , wigdor told reporters in france , where he is gathering evidence for a civil lawsuit against the french citizen and onetime contender for that nation 's presidency . diallo quickly reported the incident to five co-workers and was visibly upset after the incident , shaken up , spitting and nearly vomiting , wigdor said . he rejected explanations by strauss-kahn 's attorneys that any sexual encounter that may have occurred was consensual , questioning how he could persuade a woman he had never met before to have sex during a nine-minute encounter .  there is no other plausible explanation  but sexual assault , wigdor said . a crowd of protesters gathered near the courtroom in new york in support of diallo , carrying handwritten signs reading  no impunity 4 rapists in power  and  nafissatou we believe you ,  among other things . in tuesday 's news release , vance said ,  as prosecutors , we do n't work in a world where we expect or require perfect witnesses . the tens of thousands of victims who come to our office each year come from varied and often difficult circumstances , and sometimes with imperfect pasts . if we are convinced they are truthful about the crimes committed against them , and will tell the truth at trial , we will ask a jury to consider their testimony to prove a crime . if we are not convinced , we can not , should not and do not take the case to a jury .  he asserted that  seeking justice for sex crimes victims , and protecting immigrants , are among the highest priorities in this office ,  but  we have to judge each case by its own unique set of facts .  attorneys for diallo said claims that diallo told a friend in prison that she was going to cash in on the incident were untrue and accused the district attorney 's office of treating diallo like a criminal defendant and not an alleged victim . in their now-rejected motion to have vance removed from the case , diallo 's attorney cited allegations of  abuse of confidence , unfair treatment and bias and prejudices  by vance that they say disqualify him from the case .  are we telling -lrb- sexual assault victims -rrb- that if they dare to name a powerful , politically connected man as their abuser , they will see their whole life laid out to be judged publicly ?  asked new york city councilwoman letitia james .  what does it take for a low-income immigrant -- a woman of color -- to publicly name one of the most powerful men in europe as a sexual abuser ?  cnn senior legal analyst jeffrey toobin said before the hearing that strauss-kahn should now be able to breathe easier and  return to some semblance of his former life .  but he said that no one involved in the case  comes out of it looking very good .   this is a case that looks like it has nothing but losers -- the alleged victim , the defendant , and the prosecutor ,  toobin said .  the conclusion is likely to be entirely satisfying to no one .
