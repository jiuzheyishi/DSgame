{"text": "seventy one years ago -- december 22 , 1942 -- congress got the united states out of what had turned into an unexpectedly embarrassing situation . it concerned the pledge of allegiance -- specifically , something called the bellamy salute . most people today have likely never heard of it , but the bellamy salute was once a constant part of the country 's life . until 1892 , there was no such thing as a pledge of allegiance . daniel sharp ford , the owner of a magazine called youth 's companion , was on a crusade to put american flags in every school in the country . he sensed that the u.s. needed a boost of patriotism . keep in mind : not even 30 years before , the civil war had still been raging . national unity was a fragile concept . as part of the campaign , sharp gave an assignment to a member of his staff : francis j. bellamy , who was an author , a minister and an advocate of the tenets of christian socialism . sharp asked bellamy to compose a pledge of allegiance to the flag . bellamy wrote it , and it was published in the magazine . it did n't take long for the pledge to become wildly popular , even omnipresent . at schools , at campgrounds , at public gatherings , in congress , people routinely faced the flag and pledged their allegiance to it . because , inherently , there is something physically awkward about people simply standing in place , their arms hanging limply by their sides , staring at a flag and reciting a pledge , it was decided that devising a salute would be appropriate . instructions for carrying out the salute were printed in the pages of youth 's companion . the gesture came to be called the bellamy salute , in honor of the pledge 's author . the bellamy salute consisted of each person -- man , woman or child -- extending his or her right arm straight forward , angling slightly upward , fingers pointing directly ahead . with their right arms aiming stiffly toward the flag , they recited :  i pledge allegiance ...  for a while , the salute was n't especially controversial . but , as world war ii was forming in europe , and italians and germans began saluting benito mussolini and adolf hitler with extended-armed  heil hitler !  - style gestures ... well , perhaps you can see the problem . in the united states there was a growing feeling of discomfort that , when people within the nation 's own borders pledged their right-arms-extended allegiance to the flag , they might be construed as inadvertently showing solidarity with the fascist regimes across the ocean . richard j. ellis , in his book  to the flag : the unlikely history of the pledge of allegiance ,  wrote that  the similarities in the salute had begun to attract comment as early as the mid-1930s .  newsreels and still photos were regularly depicting rallies in europe 's dictatorships , with thousands of people showing their fealty by extending straight-armed salutes . in the united states , the general unease about it --  the embarrassing resemblance between the ` heil hitler ' salute and the salute that accompanied the pledge of allegiance ,  in richard ellis 's words -- was combined with the fear that scenes of americans offering the bellamy salute could be used for propaganda purposes . it would n't be terribly difficult to crop the american flag out of photos of u.s. citizens reciting the pledge of allegiance ; without the flag in the shots , the photos could be mischaracterized as proof that americans were expressing support for the ideologies of hitler and mussolini . thus , on december 22 , 1942 , congress , just before its christmas break , took care of it . on that day , the amended flag code was passed , section 7 of which decreed that the pledge of allegiance should  be rendered by standing with the right hand over the heart .  and with that , it became official : those millions of extended right arms were brought down . the stiff-armed salute was for other people , in countries far away . it was purely symbolic , of course , but symbols are powerful . over the years , there have been various disputes about the pledge of allegiance , the most basic of which is the question of whether citizens should even be expected to publicly pledge their allegiance to their country . the united states was founded on ideals of freedom , and freedom includes not being forced , or cajoled by peer pressure , into publicly declaring any belief . the exact wording of the pledge has changed several times since francis bellamy wrote it ; each change was reflective of contemporaneous concerns about the meaning . for example :  i pledge allegiance to the flag  was originally  i pledge allegiance to my flag .  the  my  was dropped out of worries that recent arrivals from other nations might be seen as pledging their loyalty to the flag of the country of their birth . the most significant change in the wording came in 1954 , when -- with the enthusiastic support of president dwight d. eisenhower -- the phrase  under god  was added just after  one nation .  eisenhower declared :  in this way we are reaffirming the transcendence of religious faith in america 's heritage and future ; in this way we shall constantly strengthen those spiritual weapons which forever will be our country 's most powerful resource in peace and war .  the wording of the pledge of allegiance may or may not be changed again in centuries to come , but it 's a pretty safe bet that the bellamy salute is never coming back . once ubiquitous and unquestioned , it has become a faded and mostly forgotten bit of u.s. history . all because , 71 decembers ago , a solution to a quandary -- a quandary no one could have anticipated when the pledge was written -- was formalized : . lower those stiff arms . bend those elbows . direct those palms inward . and take them to heart .", "summary": " after the pledge of allegiance was written , a stiff-armed salute was developed to accompany it .   bob greene writes that its meaning got clouded when fascist movements used similar salute .   after outbreak of world war ii , congress passed legislation to replace the salute .   greene : 71 years ago , the practice of placing your hand over the heart was adopted .
