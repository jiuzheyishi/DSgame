{"text": "debbie benzine lost her first husband to heart disease when he was 44 . his death left her to raise a young child alone . for 16 years , she stayed single because ,  going through it once was enough for me .  when she met dale benzine , he weighed around 300 pounds but was in pretty good physical shape . yet over time , she watched as the former football player started taking pills for his high cholesterol and high blood pressure , more for anxiety and gout , and insulin shots for his type 2 diabetes .  his girth got bigger , as did his neck , which caused sleep apnea ,  she remembers . after the atlanta couple got married , she found herself buying him bigger and bigger clothes . when her insurance company announced that bariatric surgery , or weight-loss surgery , would be covered under the couple 's plan , she told her husband about it .  i knew he had to do something , but i was n't sure he was ready for something so drastic ,  she says . he was . the doctor had flat-out told benzine :  lose weight or die .  he was tired of taking so many medications and not having enough energy to simply live life .  one day ... you find out that you 're 56 years old and if you want to see 66 you better do something about it ,  he says . there are several types of bariatric surgery . with gastric bypass , a new stomach about the size of a golf ball is created by cutting across the top of the stomach and connecting the smaller pouch with the intestines . another type involves placing an adjustable band around the upper portion of the stomach . the device can be tightened or loosened at subsequent doctor 's visits . it can help patients feel fuller faster and eat less . unlike gastric bypass , adjustable gastric band procedures can be easily reversed . benzine decided to do the gastric bypass surgery . although doctors are n't sure why , studies have shown gastric bypass puts type 2 diabetes into remission in most obese patients . dale also did n't want to have the option of reversing the surgery .  in the back of your mind you can always take the band off ,  he says of the lap-band procedure .  i did n't want to be able to go back .  getting approved for the surgery was more difficult than he expected . many people who have bariatric surgery gain the weight back , so insurance companies are often wary of paying for the procedure . benzine saw his primary care physician , a nutritionist , a cardiologist , a pulmonologist , a gastroenterologist and a psychiatrist -- all of whom had to sign off . the psychiatrist told benzine he rejected upward of half his patients because they were n't prepared to make the necessary life changes after the surgery . benzine admitted that 10 years ago he would n't have been ready either .  i 'm from wisconsin ,  he says .  i enjoyed my beer , brats and cheese too much .  but kids and grandkids  changes things .  he was ready . he eventually got the go-ahead . the day of his surgery , his wife recalls she was an emotional wreck .  i tried to dissuade -lrb- him -rrb- from having it . what if they made a wrong cut ? what if he did n't wake up ? what if he had a heart attack on the table ?  the surgery was a success , but he was far from the ideal patient . shortly after surgery he ate a popsicle too fast and starting throwing up . when he got home , he continued his trial-and-error period , getting sick as he learned his limits .  imagine after you eat your big thanksgiving dinner -- times 10 ,  he says of overeating with his smaller stomach .  and you ca n't do anything about it . you 're just so miserable and it 's either got to come up or go out .  he started out on a liquid diet , then pureed his food . slowly he introduced solids .  we did n't go to happy hour or dinner with friends because he was uncomfortable ,  debbie benzine says .  i started hiding out to eat because i felt guilty .  it was like being a baby and learning to eat all over again , benzine says . he realized that meat -- steak , chicken , turkey -- was too tough for his stomach to handle . but popcorn went down easily . he developed 10 rules for himself , and other bariatric patients , and the weight began to fall off . in six months , he had lost more than 125 pounds . the hardest thing for him was filling time . he had to learn to reward himself with activities instead of food . he now smokes a cigar instead of eating a bag of chips , or plans a big weekend getaway to celebrate a work success . he orders an appetizer instead of an entree when he goes out to play cards with friends during the week . his daily diet routinely consists of greek yogurt , protein bars , soup , popcorn , cheese and crackers . he does n't eat large meals , just smaller portions whenever he 's hungry . in some ways , his wife has had to alter her lifestyle to fit his . it has n't been easy , the couple says , but it has been worth it .  i 'm 57 going on 37 ,  benzine says with a laugh .  no pun intended -- i 'm like a kid in a candy store .  he plans to attend his 40th high school reunion in june with pride :  i know i 'll be one of the only people who can say they weigh less at that reunion than they did in high school .  more importantly ,  i will have my husband and best friend around for a long time ,  his wife says . follow dale 's '10 commandments ' of bariatric surgery . 1 -rrb- set your goals early , both in pounds to lose and the date by which you want to achieve this loss . keep a daily log or scorecard of your weight loss . 2 -rrb- trial and error of foods and liquids will be necessary , but painful . blueberries were terrible for me , but butter-free popcorn worked . go figure . hint : keep your anti-nausea pills close by -- you will definitely need them in the beginning . 3 -rrb- find a high-protein breakfast and lunch that you can live with each day . -lrb- mine was greek yogurt for breakfast and smoothies with strawberry , banana and chocolate protein . -rrb- also , stay true to your vitamin regimen , especially vitamin b12 , vitamin d and calcium . 4 -rrb- concentrate on changing your daily eating habits from three large meals per day , plus snacks , to five to six small meals . 5 -rrb- stay hydrated ! it 's very important that you avoid getting dehydrated , so avoid intake of caffeine , carbonated sodas , beer and alcohol . 6 -rrb- move more while you are eating less . start out walking 30 minutes , four to five days a week . build up to walking farther and faster , and more often , while adding weight lifting two to three days per week . you will be amazed how fast the weight will start dropping once you get into this routine , plus your dog will love it even more than you ! 7 -rrb- start rewarding your new body with activities instead of food . reward yourself by going to see a favorite performer if you hit a weight loss goal . join a card club , start reading again , or make a movie date with your significant other each week . replacing your  going out to eat  time with activities will arguably be the best move you will make during this whole journey . 8 -rrb- it 's ok to leave food on your plate ! regardless of what your mother said growing up , children in africa , india or china are n't going to be affected if you leave food on your plate when eating at home or away . people will ask why , but trust me , you wo n't be hurting their feelings if you just say you 're full . 9 -rrb- order an appetizer as your main meal when eating out . you will be amazed how full you will be after eating the smaller servings and your pocketbook will also thank you . 10 -rrb- and last , but definitely not least , welcome and embrace your support network , be it a wife , friend , business colleague , etc. . you will have good days and a few bad ones and the unconditional love and support these people will show you will help you push through the bad and be there to help celebrate the good ! have you lost weight ?
