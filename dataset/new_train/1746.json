' the bird has since been handed over to a local rspca bird sanctuary to be rehoused . mrs bacchas added : ` of course we were . attached to charlie as you are with a pet but he had to go when we . found out he was affecting mum . there was no other option , by then it . just had to be done .

' she added that her mother rarely spent time in the loving room where the bird was kept but had to walk past it to get into other rooms . the inquest was told that mrs kershaw had been treated for lung disease and congestive heart failure . she also had panic attacks and became scared and frightened saying she could n't breath and had to be taken into the fresh air for walks . mrs kershaw became reliant on oxygen for 18 months before her death and was referred to a chest physician at the pennines acute hospital in 2010 because of the breathlessness . after breaking her collarbone , a . frail mrs kershaw was admitted to the royal oldham hospital on november . 1 in 2011 where she rapidly deteriorated . she died on november 13 last . year . dr georges ng man qwong , who diagnosed . her with the condition before her death , told the inquest that she had . had an allergic reaction in her lungs because of contact with the dust . and protein emitted from the bird . he . said : ` bird fancier 's lung is an uncommon condition and we do not see . it very often and a gp may only see a case once every 10 years . ` it . is caused by the exposure to a bird 's protein in the feathers or . excrete . we do not know why people get it , but if they inhale the . protein there can be an allergic reaction in the lungs . employment : it was initially thought that mrs kershaw 's death may have been linked to her previous employment in oldham 's cotton mills , before the rare disease came to light . deteriorated : mrs kershaw was admitted to the royal oldham hospital in november 2011 after breaking her collarbone . her health rapidly deteriorated and she died on november 13 last year . ` contact with the protein and dust from the bird can happen when cleaning out the cage , the dust can become airborne and can be breathed in . ` if you are exposed it can cause illness even a few hours after cleaning the cage you can feel quite breathless . if you are exposed to the protein over time it can cause a reaction and it is seen as progressive breathlessness . ' dr ng man qwong added that the diagnosis was supported by blood tests , ct scans and said that she was put on steroid therapy and exposure to the bird was to be reduced . rochdale coroner mr simon nelson said it was the first time in 10 years he had come across such an occurrence of bird fancier 's lung . he said : ` it was sadly and unbeknown to her at . the time of her exposure to dust and protein emulated by charlie that . brought about her death . ` it would be an unnatural occurring . disease process , the only factor to bear in mind is whether she was . particularly susceptible , i do feel that her death was by reason of the . lung disease bird fancier 's lung .
