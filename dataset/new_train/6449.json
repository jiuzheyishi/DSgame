{"text": "and daily mail reporter . there is ` no compelling medical reason ' for u.s. armed forced to ban transgender americans from serving , according to a report released on thursday . the independent commission led by a former u.s. surgeon general also concluded that president obama could lift the decades-old ban without approval from congress . as long-term soldiers share their stories of being kicked out of the forces , the report says the current regulations - which are designed to keep transgender people from joining or staying in the military on the basis of psychological and physical unfitness - are outdated . one former soldier , army reserve capt. sage fox , 41 , was put on leave after taking female hormones following a deployment to kuwait . scroll down for video . battle : army reserve capt. sage fox , pictured , began taking female hormones and living as a woman after being deployed to kuwait . but after notifying her battalion commander , fox learned she had been placed on inactive status . in november , with her hair getting long and her voice higher , she . notified her battalion commander , whom she said expressed support . at . drill time , an announcement was made to 400 colleagues at the b.t. collins reserve center in sacramento . for a few days , fox thought she might escape the ban . but then she was informed she had been placed on inactive status . ` when . i transitioned , i was n't just a good officer , i became a better officer . because i did n't have to deal with that conflict anymore , ' she said . fox also wrote a blog post . about the incident , explaining that she had repeatedly been recognized . as a good soldier , but after she revealed her desire to transition , ' i . received no disability , no compensation , no handshake , no . thank-you-for-your-service ' . ` in the days and weeks that followed an anger grew within me , ' she wrote . ` not just at the way i was treated , but at the way my fellow trans service-members are cast out of the services they 've given so much of their lives and devotion to . we are not broken . we are not diseased or disordered . ' new life : fox , pictured left , and right before her hormone treatment , said living as a woman made her a better soldier because she was no longer in conflict but she said did not even get a thank you for her service . about 15,500 transgender personnel are currently . serving , nearly all under their birth genders and not transitioning in . an appearance-altering way , according to the williams institute , a think tank . dr. joycelyn elders , who served as . surgeon general during bill clinton 's first term as president , and rear . adm. alan steinman , a former chief health and safety director for the . coast guard , led the report that was released on thursday . ` we determined not only that there is no compelling medical reason for the ban , but also that the ban itself is an expensive , damaging and unfair barrier to health care access for the approximately 15,450 transgender personnel who serve currently in the active , guard and reserve components , ' it said . the panel , convened by a think tank at san francisco state university , said the ban has existed for several decades and apparently was derived in part from the psychiatric establishment 's consensus , since revised , that gender identity issues amounted to a mental disorder . the ban also appears based on the assumption that providing hormone treatment and sex reassignment surgeries would be too difficult , disruptive and expensive . but the commission rejected those notions as inconsistent with modern medical practice and the scope of health care services routinely provided to non-transgender military personnel . ' i hope their takeaway will be we should evaluate every one of our people on the basis of their ability and what they can do , and if they have a condition we can treat we would treat it like we would treat anyone else , ' elders said in an interview with the associated press . report : former surgeon general dr joycelyn edlers , left , and rear admiral alan steinman , right , led a report released on thursday that said the law about transgender military personnel was outdated . at least a dozen nations , including australia , canada , england and israel , allow military service by transgender individuals . transgender rights advocates have been lobbying the pentagon to revisit the blanket ban in the u.s. since congress in 2010 repealed the law that barred gay , lesbian and bisexual individuals from openly serving in the military . ` at this time there are no plans to change the department 's policy and regulations which do not allow transgender individuals to serve in the u.s. military , ' said navy lt. cmdr. nate christensen , a defense department spokesman . the commission argued that facilitating gender transitions ` would place almost no burden on the military , ' adding that a relatively small number of active and reserve service members would elect to undergo transition-related surgeries and that only a fraction might suffer complications that would prevent them from serving . it estimated that 230 transgender people a year would seek such surgery at an average cost of about $ 30,000 . decisions : congress would not need to be involved in changing the rules , according to the report , and obama could instead issue an executive order instructing the department of defense to amend its regulations . retired brigadier general thomas kolditz , a former army commander and west point professor on the commission , said he thinks allowing transgender people to serve openly would reduce gender-based harassment , assaults and suicides while enhancing national security . but center for military readiness president elaine donnelly , whose group opposed the repeal of the ban on openly gay troops , predicted that putting transgender people in barracks , showers and other sex-segregated could cause sexual assaults to increase and infringe on the privacy of non-transgender personnel . ` this is putting an extra burden on men and women in the military that they certainly do n't need and they do n't deserve , ' donnelly said . the commission recommends the president issue an executive order instructing the department of defense to amend its regulations so transgender people are no longer automatically barred . the pentagon then would need to develop rules for assigning service members who are transitioning , said palm center executive director aaron belkin , whose san francisco state-based think tank commissioned the report . the palm center , which previously researched ` do n't ask , do n't tell , ' is funded in part by a $ 1.3 million grant from jennifer pritzker , a billionaire former army lieutenant colonel who came out as transgender last year . sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article .", "summary": " army reserve captain sage fox began taking female hormones and her battalion commander expressed support .   but days later , she was served inactive service papers .   a report led by a former u.s. surgeon general has said there is ` no compelling medical reason ' for the outdated ban .   15,000 transgender personnel are serving in the armed forces and most are living under their birth genders and not changing their appearances .
