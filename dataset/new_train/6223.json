{"text": "follow @@ samcunningham . adam lallana : # 30million . this is the fee being demanded for a 26-year-old who was playing in league one just three years ago . southampton are playing hardball in liverpool 's pursuit of their star player , but is he really worth that much money ? andrei shevchenko went to chelsea from ac milan for # 30m . ronaldo , the original one , went to real madrid from inter for # 30m . rio ferdinand went from leeds to manchester united for # 30m . strength to strength : liverpool are tracking southampton midfielder adam lallana , but may have to pay # 30m . # 30m men : manchester united and chelsea respectively spent big on rio ferdinand and andrei shevchenko . at the time -- the fees of course being relative to the economic climate when the transfers were made -- these players were at the pinnacle of their respective positions . does lallana deserve to follow at such a high price ? well , yes , actually . i was handed the assignment of following southampton when they won promotion to the barclays premier league back in 2012 and have bore witness to a player who has gasped the opportunity presented to him in the top flight and torn it to shreds . the truly remarkable thing is how the club managed to keep hold of him all this time . i once covered a southampton game when they visited dagenham and redbridge in january 2011 , on their way to winning promotion from league one . a certain alex oxlade-chamberlain , 17 at the time , was almost on his way to arsenal and would join them that summer , but lallana was also lighting up the league . he scored that game . jinking and weaving : lallana is set to become a real asset for roy hodgson 's england at the world cup . pitch-side after the match , i asked then-manager nigel adkins if he was confident he could realistically keep hold of lallana as well . he looked at me like it was the most ridiculous suggestion he had heard all season and insisted his star central midfielder was going nowhere . i did n't believe him at the time , but somehow , for so long , they managed to keep lallana on the south coast . the player has undoubted technical ability which only the top percentile of professional footballers possess , but what lallana has developed over years of encouragement at southampton is a positivity in his play to run opposition players ragged . he is strongest through the middle , but roams freely on either flank , and plays with utter selflessness.take his assist for rickie lambert against tottenham at st mary 's last december as an example . lallana had broken free on the right inside the box and had just the on-rushing hugo lloris to beat.with a seemingly supernatural sensory perception he took one touch before cutting the ball back behind him to lambert , leaving the goalkeeper stranded , for a tap-in . he did it without even looking , so aware of his surroundings that he knew lambert was running in behind . true grit : former saints boss nigel adkins managed to keep hold of his star man for longer than expected . redefining : lallana has reinvented the legendary cruyff turn , the brainchild of holland great johan . many players would claim to be able to play with equal strength on either foot , but very few actually can . lallana is one who actually can . he scores with his left foot , his right foot , from inside the area , outside the area , with neat finishes from tight angles to pile drivers from distance . lallana has reinvented the cruyff turn . it is a skill which has become so common it is used ineffectively by any average joe in sunday league games up and down the country every weekend . but lallana does a proper cruyff turn . one which leaves one or two defenders for dead , thus providing southampton with an extra man going on the attack . and he does this several times a game . following the big man ? lallana could move to anfield after rickie lambert completed his deal at the weekend . it is n't flash , it 's not showing off , it is expertly unlocking opposition sides . his ability to dribble past opposition players , to swerve and shimmy and shift the ball from right to left like it is magnetised to his feet is mesmeric . the goal he scored against hull last november , when he slalomed past four players , carrying the ball into the box on the left before accurately finding the far right corner from the tightest angle , was one of the goals last season . liverpool will only hope they can get the negotiations finished before the world cup starts , when lallana will have the opportunity to showcase his talents on the biggest stage of all . he is more than ready for the step up .", "summary": " lallana is a genius at picking holes in defences .   southampton captain could be a key man at the world cup in brazil .   rickie lambert joined liverpool at the weekend .
