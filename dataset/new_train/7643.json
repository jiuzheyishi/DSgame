{"text": "the ongoing row over john sweeney 's undercover documentary on north korea has been blown out of all proportion . i was one of the students who travelled to pyongyang with the bbc panorama reporter and i was fully aware of the risks . did the bbc exploit us as students ? i do n't think so . the ramifications of what mr sweeney was doing and what might happen to us were outlined to me -- and i believe to us as a group -- as soon as we signed up to the trip . i was aware that a journalist was coming , and i was aware our organiser worked for the bbc . we knew the dangers -- potential detention , arrest , or deportation and blacklisting . and i believe that i , as a 21-year-old student in international relations , am in a position to give my informed consent , even though the london school of economics -lrb- lse -rrb- says otherwise . backing : lse student mila akimova says the bbc was right to infiltrate the trip to north korea and insists students knew undercover reporter john sweeney was with them . in truth , the trip was organised neither by the lse , nor by the student society that advertised it . the lse was merely a medium through which a group was formed . it was not involved in any other way . the college must have had its reasons for intervening , but in allowing the issue to become a nationwide media sensation , it has attracted unwanted attention to the matter . the trip to north korea was an invaluable experience for me . when we read about the country in our university library , there was a temptation to remain sceptical , perhaps to think that critical analysis is coloured by western ideas that equate simple lifestyles with suffering . but there is a huge difference between reading and first-hand experience . when you land in pyongyang , you take those doubts with you . you notice the barren landscape and think many countries have similar geography and remember that it 's still the end of winter . then you meet your minders , and they seem perfectly normal people . they even let me keep my phone . and then things go steadily downhill . everywhere you see the faces of the kims , the world 's only communist dynasty . you note the fact that the country is ruled by its dead president , asleep in a spotless mausoleum , celebrated with millions of pounds ' worth of gifts , while the rest of the country starves and shivers . you see empty universities , hospitals , barren farms and factories long out of use ; barbed wire surrounding what was meant to be a spa resort . a people stunted by malnutrition and living in fear , and yet still managing to seem jovial and good-humoured , waving and smiling to us from the streets . it is harrowing to realise that you could easily have been in their place -- they , too , have families , hopes and dreams , their jobs and everyday lives , and yet they do not have so many things that we take for granted . it is true that we were not attacked , shot at or threatened ; and yet , even my grandmother 's accounts of the stalinist regime she grew up with in russia did not lessen the impact of being within that prison state . as tourists , we stayed in luxury hotels -- by north korean standards . we were driven around in a bus and yet you feel the isolation . you feel restricted . then , as the days roll by , you begin to feel patronised . suffocated . imprisoned . when we finally escaped the country and our air koryo plane landed in beijing , we felt liberated , even though china is hardly a beacon of human rights . in queuing up to attack the bbc , mr sweeney 's critics have served only to portray journalistic endeavour in an entirely negative light . they have forgotten about the big picture : that the panorama film aimed to expose the reality of life under the north korean regime . the film raised a very important point , that the country is seen as a communist state and yet , despite its initial alliance with the ussr and mao 's china , it has evolved to be a far-right state much closer to hitler 's germany , complete with genocide against its own people , who are slowly starving to death . called the ` hermit kingdom ' , it lives up to its name . there is no mobile network . no internet . no news from outside its heavily guarded borders . when one enters , one enters a social tundra . the doctrine of self-reliance and making one 's own destiny , juche -- the north koreans ' brand of communism -- has been twisted and distorted by the totalitarian government , turning the country 's borders into prison bars and the ideology into a sordid farce that upholds its regime . the critics , too , belittle the benefits to the students of witnessing the work of an undercover journalist , the difficulties they face and the difficult choices they have to make . i believe it was a priceless contribution to my education . the north korean authorities would certainly not have welcomed a journalist aiming to disclose the dark secrets of their rogue state . i hope that as the temperature cools , more focus will be placed on the film and less on the ill-informed sideshow about the so-called ` exploitation ' of me and my fellow students .", "summary": " lse student mila akimova says bbc did not exploit her and fellow undergraduates .   students were aware journalist was accompanying them .   insists ` harrowing ' trip right to be shown on panorama .
