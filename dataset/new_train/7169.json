{"text": "queen of shops mary portas has condemned the government over a decision to allow tesco to build a vast new supermarket on the seafront at margate . the retail guru , who was hired by david cameron to find ways to rescue dying town centres like margate , described the decision as ` a very sad day ' . she has become an outspoken champion of small retailers and fought to try and revive town centres ravaged by the impact of large supermarkets . battle : retail guru mary portas has been hired to revive britain 's ailing high streets . however , she has effectively been overruled by the equally combative eric pickles , the secretary for communities and local government , who has approved the margate scheme . the new tesco , which had been fought by local residents and traders , will be a massive 82,000 square feet and sit on what is a key site on the seafront . the news will confirm suspicions that the original decision to hire portas was more of a publicity stunt than a genuine attempt to help struggling high streets . for her key recommendations , which included cutting business rates and putting a brake on new shopping centres , have both been rejected . threat : mary portas argues that places like margate need to be protected from the impact of large supermarkets so that small businesses have a fighting chance . rather a penny-pinching and lack lustre funding scheme , called the portas pilots , has been set up to give small grants to a few town centre committees to support things like local markets . last night , she condemned mr pickles ' decision to back the scheme , saying : ` this is a sad day for margate . ` the time , energy and genuine care the people of margate have put into rebuilding their high street is being completely undermined by the secretary of state , eric pickles mp who has signed off an 82,000 square feet edge-of-town tesco development . ` if government really believes in town centre first , how can they do this ? ' she was selected by the prime minister to front a review of high streets on the strength of her record as a channel 4 tv presenter , where she was shown helping small independent traders turn around failing businesses . overruled : secretary of state for communities eric pickles mp has signed off an 82,000 square feet tesco development in margate despite miss portas ' protestations . however , it is clear that she has been left disappointed by the outcome of an initiative that has been dismissed by retail industry experts as mere window dressing . ` i did this in between running a business , in between filming and having a family . you try your best ... i just wish i had been better advised , ' she said . in april , miss portas accused the former tesco boss , sir terry leahy , of talking ` crap ' when he described the rise of supermarkets as progress . she said : ` that 's absolutely crap . what happens is that 50p of every pound is spent on food . if you take that off the high street and put it into a 40,000 ft out-of-town store and you provide free parking and everything under one roof , then you start to take away not only the food shops , but also the chemist , the fashion shops , the butcher ... you start to displace the whole high street . ' one episode of her channel 4 tv series ` mary queen of the high street ' involved focusing on margate and breathing new life in to its shopping streets . last year , she told residents she was keen to help their fight against tesco , saying she was ` passionate ' about the effects of big stores diverting business away from high streets . expertise : david cameron hired miss portas to be his retail expert back in 2011 , charged with tackling the decline of towns all around britain . miss portas wrote to mr pickles last year urging him to reject the tesco plan which she described it as a ` disturbing threat ' to margate . retail expert , bill grimsey , the former chief executive of wickes , described the news on twitter as a ` slap in the face for portas ' . local trader robin vaughn-lyons , former chairman of the margate town team , said he feared a lot of smaller businesses could end up closing as a result of the new tesco . ` i do n't think it 's good for our seafront at all ... i 'm sure it 's going to take business away from coffee shops , local cafes , and things like that , ' he said . designer wayne hemingway is at the forefront of a campaign to redevelop margate 's seafront around a heritage-themed amusement park . the new tesco store would sit alongside this and could , in theory , wreck the design . regeneration : designer wayne hemingway is also supposed to be saving margate 's town centre with a heritage-themed amusement park . mr hemingway said he hoped tesco could be persuaded to give its store a vintage feel . ` we will kick them in the b ******* until they say they will , ' he said . a letter to the developers from mr pickles ' department said the supermarket plan was ` acceptable ' and ` would perform the economic , social and environmental roles of sustainable development towards which it aims ' . while the government has given its approval , the application is still at the centre of a judicial review supported by residents which could overturn the decision . tesco said : ` tesco is a tenant in this developer-led project . the developer 's application is now subject to a judicial review . we look forward to the outcome .
