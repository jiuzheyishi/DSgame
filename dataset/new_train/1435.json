{"text": "giving prisoners the right to vote will do nothing to stop them reoffending chris grayling insisted today . the justice secretary claimed having a job and somewhere to live after leaving jail were more important factors in preventing them returning to a life of crime . and he vowed that the british parliament would be ` sovereign ' in deciding whether to implement a controversial ruling from the european court of human rights that inmates should be able to take part in elections . justice secretary chris grayling insisted there was no evidence giving prisoners the vote would stop them reoffending when they were released . european judges have ruled that the britain 's blanket ban on votes for those behind bars is a breach of their human rights . in february 2012 the commons called for the ban to be maintained by an overwhelming margin of 234 to 22 , despite repeated warnings from strasbourg . since then ministers have published a draft bill on the issue , while stressing that the uk parliament is ` sovereign ' and it was up to mps to decide whether or not to comply with echr rulings . the government has sought to kick the issue into the long grass , by investigating a raft of options including allowing prisoners to vote during the last six months of their sentence . mr grayling admitted the plan would be difficult to implement , because it is not always known so far in advance when a prisoner would be released . mr grayling repeatedly told the justice select committee : ` parliament is sovereign in these matters ' giving evidence to the justice select committee , mr grayling repeatedly rejected the idea that being allowed to vote in elections from behind bars would do anything to prevent them committing a crime again after release . labour mp paul flynn pointed to south africa , where he claimed prisoners were given the vote ` as a process of giving them some small responsibility ' . but mr grayling said : ` i have not seen any evidence that suggests to me that introduction of votes for prisoners would have any material effect on reoffending rates . ` my experience is that a house and a job are much more important . ' the prisoner voting row has been running since 2005 , when strasbourg judges ordered britain to give the vote to convicted prisoners , who have historically been considered to have removed themselves from the electorate . despite overwhelming votes in favour of maintaining the law in the commons , the european judges have continued to repeat their instructions . a string of tory mps - led by the prime minister - are resisting demands from the european court of human rights for some inmates to be granted the right to vote . in 2010 , david cameron said it makes him ` physically ill ' to even contemplate having to give the vote to anyone in prison . in december last year the prime minister insisted britain ` damned well should n't ' be forced to comply with the european judges . the government insists it is complying with the rule of law , despite delaying attempts to respond to the ruling . mr grayling added : ` the worst thing we could do is implement a change inappropriately . parliament is sovereign in these matters . ` if we are to introduce votes for prisoners , it will have to be with the consent of parliament . ' there are concerns that 2,300 compensation claims from prisons banned from voting have be reactivated by the ruling , costing the british taxpayer tens of thousands of pounds . but mr grayling said : ` the court has started that the process in a small number of cases . we do n't intend to play an active part in the court . we do n't believe that any compensation will be payable in the judgement , whatever the outcome . '", "summary": " chris grayling rejects the idea of using votes as part of rehabilitation .   claims there is no evidence letting inmates take part in elections will help .   argues having somewhere to live and finding work is more important .   european court of human rights ruled against blanket ban on voting .
