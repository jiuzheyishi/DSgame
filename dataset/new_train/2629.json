{"text": "the women of the year helped bring the economy back from the brink , worked against tyranny , and championed equality , education and justice . most of all , they helped open our eyes to how much remains to be done . malala yousafzai . if 2012 was the year most of us first heard about the 14-year-old pakistani girl , it was 2013 when we learned nobody could silence her , especially not the cowardly taliban men who tried to kill her . malala had become a vocal advocate of the right of all girls to an education , a frightening prospect for the taliban . in october 2012 , machine-gun toting extremists walked onto a school van , asked for malala , then shot her in the face . instead of intimidating her , the taliban turned her into their own worst nightmare -- a powerful girl more admired and articulate than ever . this year we found that malala 's impact is just beginning . as a leading candidate for the nobel peace prize , her advocacy for girls inspires hope around the world . and she 's just getting started . nadezhda tolokonnikova of pussy riot . what is it about macho politicians who get so scared of brave women ? in russia , president vladimir putin 's suppression of the political opposition spurred an unlikely force , the defiantly named punk rock group pussy riot . the female band protested putin 's increasing authoritarianism . when five of them broke out into an anti-putin song ,  punk prayer ,  at moscow 's main orthodox cathedral , two of them -- nadezhda tolokonnikova and maria alyokhina -- were arrested and put in prison . why did putin decide to free them before their sentence was finished ? because pussy riot has become synonymous with the harshness of the putin regime . the group 's outspokenness raised an international outcry so strong that even the russian president , normally impervious to global public opinion , started to feel the pressure . tolokonnikova sent out letters describing the brutality of prison life and went on a hunger strike . on her release from prison , tolokonnikova fearlessly shouted ,  russia without putin .  she and alyokhina dismissed the release as a public relations stunt by a president trying to improve his image ahead of the upcoming olympic games in sochi , russia . that 's exactly what it was . delhi rape victim . as 2012 was coming to an end , a horrific gang rape occurred in the indian capital , capturing the world 's attention over the following months and , more importantly , awakening the indian people to the crisis of violence against women . the delhi rape victim , a 23-year-old physiotherapy student , was gravely injured , and she died of internal wounds in 2013 . her tragic case galvanized indian women and men to fight the epidemic of rape in india , a battle that continues in the face of even more brutal attacks . angela merkel . when the european union nearly fell into the economic abyss , there was one leader who held it together , standing up to criticism and holding firm on a controversial austerity program despite vilification and recrimination . the policy may not have been the best route to recovery , but in the chaos it was merkel who saved the union . forbes named her the world 's most powerful woman , as it has for eight of the last 10 years . germans re-elected her to a third term earlier this month . she emerges from the crisis as the undisputed leader of the european union , and a key player as the u.s. and europe struggle to maintain their political and economic pre-eminence in the face of a rising china and a chaotic middle east . hillary clinton . when malala spoke in the u.s. this fall , hillary clinton was sitting in the audience as the young activist declared ,  even in america people are waiting for a woman president .  endless speculation about whether clinton will run for president in 2016 is underpinned by the belief that she has a very good chance of becoming the next president of the united states . to a large extent , she stands as a symbol of the incomplete pursuit of equality . but if she becomes president , her impact would become more than symbolic . she would have more power than anyone on earth , and with it the opportunity to truly reshape the world . whatever she decides , nobody doubts her abilities . she has already answered the question ,  is a woman qualified to be president of the united states ?  with an emphatic ,  you are crazy to even ask !  michelle bachelet . in 2006 , voters in chile elected michelle bachelet to a four-year term as president . this year , they voted her back into office . during the last few years , the former political prisoner and pediatrician became the first head of u.n. woman , working for global gender equality . bachelet comes from latin america , the land that gave us the word  machismo .  but her tenure has proven to latin america that charisma and skill have no gender . can a woman be a good president ? the voters have said yes twice . janet yellen . here 's a name you 're about to start hearing a lot more often : janet yellen . the brilliant economist was nominated by president barack obama to become the world 's most powerful banker , heading the u.s. federal reserve . yellen is uniquely qualified for the job . she has a slightly more growth-oriented approach than her predecessor , and that 's good news for the unemployed , still struggling despite a booming stock market and modest economic growth . the highly respected soon-to-be first female fed chief will get to work and tackle some of the challenges facing america 's economy . lucky country ! sheryl sandberg . in what many people believe is a post-feminist era , women are pursuing careers and families and blazing their own trails without looking back . sheryl sandberg , the chief operating officer at one of the world 's most successful social media companies , facebook , took time to stop and examine the landscape . it 's time , she urged , for women to push a little harder . in her best-seller ,  lean in ,  she exhorted women to lean in to their ambitions . equality is not yet here , she said , inspiring post-feminist women to break barriers . sandberg may yet make feminism cool once again . opinion : for women , missteps to learn from . beyonce . there was a time when women artists were the playthings of businessmen and corporations . today , many of the most successful women entertainers have taken control of their careers and carved their own paths . there are many examples , but perhaps none as impressive as beyonce , whose career continues to reach new heights . she has amassed a huge fortune -- estimated at $ 300 million -- delighted her fans , and managed to stage dazzling surprises . at the end of 2013 , the 32-year-old unveiled a  visual album ,  an online album recorded and filmed while she was traveling the world on an enormously successful concert tour . when major corporations decried the unorthodox marketing of the new release , she unabashedly took them on , shocking walmart buyers by showing up in person and paying for their christmas shopping . beyonce may be revolutionizing the music industry . the saudi drivers . remember the arab spring ? much of it unraveled in 2013 . it had never quite made it to the kingdom of saudi arabia , where the concept of democracy is so distant that women are in many respects treated as children . among the many restrictions they face is the particularly crippling law that bans them from driving cars . despite repeated arrests , saudi women activists are doggedly demanding their right to drive , a symbolic and practical necessity . they have staged repeated acts of civil disobedience , and plan to keep doing it until they succeed . they may yet start their own quiet revolution . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of frida ghitis .", "summary": " frida ghitis : the women of the year helped open our eyes to how much remains to be done .   ghitis : a candidate for the nobel peace prize , malala yousafzai advocates for girls ' rights .   she says punk rocker nadezhda tolokonnikova was brave to speak out against putin regime .   ghitis : could beyonce be revolutionizing the music industry ?
