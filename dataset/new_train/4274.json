{"text": "in an old office building at nasa 's ames research center in mountain view , california , there 's a room stacked high with plastic containers of synthetic urine . researchers dip small white paddles into the liquid , wait for a grid of squares to change colors , and snap a photo with a custom smartphone app . it 's all part of a futuristic self-diagnosis kit from startup scanadu , which is competing to be the future of diy health care . scanadu is one of 10 teams taking part in the qualcomm tricorder x prize contest to create an affordable , handheld device that consumers can use to diagnose their medical conditions at home . the goal is to make a working version of  star trek 's  tricorder , the television show 's fictional diagnostic device . in the series , the ship 's doctor would wave the portable black box over a patent 's body and immediately know if a person had broken bones , a disease or if they were going to die . the real-life tricorder must weigh less than 5 pounds , monitor five vital signs and detect 15 medical conditions . it should let people measure their own blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , oxygen saturation and respiratory rate . each system will be able to diagnose common health conditions including diabetes , anemia , sleep apnea and pneumonia .  we 're asking teams to put together an aggregation of technologies that 's never been done before ,  said dr. erik viirre , the technical and medical director for the tricorder x prize .  we 're spurring things to market faster , better and cheaper .  the multiyear contest is run by x prize , a nonprofit organization that attempts to accelerate major technological advances . last week , the judges narrowed down the field of 41 teams to 10 , which now have until april to create working prototypes for consumer tests . the three groups that make the most successful tricorders will split a $ 10 million prize . in 2005 , walter de brouwer 's 5-year-old son jumped out of a window and fell 36 feet to the ground . after a year in emergency rooms , operating rooms and the icu , de brouwer had a whole new perspective on hospitals . he saw firsthand how powerless patients often were . inspired by the less invasive medical devices from science fiction , he moved to silicon valley and started scanadu .  ` star trek ' was not tv , it was a business plan ,  said 57-year-old de brouwer . scanadu is already close to having working prototypes of its tricorder system . in addition to the scanaflo -lrb- a single-use urine test -rrb- the company has created the scanadu scout , a palm-sized disc you press to your forehead or temple for 10 seconds to take vital signs , including blood pressure , temperature , heart and respiratory rate . the readings are imported to a smartphone , analyzed and tracked over time . de brouwer 's vision is to have a constant collection of data that creates a baseline for each user . that information will allow the scanadu app to detect issues early , even before there are noticeable symptoms . these types of devices are not meant to replace doctors , but to fill in when in-person medical care is not available , affordable or necessary . every day , dr. basil harris sees patients who have waited too long to seek treatment , often because they lack insurance or a primary care giver . there 's a steady stream of them at the chicago emergency room where he works , showing up days after the first symptoms of serious illnesses . harris , who also has a ph.d. in engineering , leads the tricorder x prize finalist team final frontier medical devices . his tricorder combines a regular tablet computer with a separate bluetooth gadget that takes vitals and runs other tests . the companion tablet app walks the patient through the same types of questions harris asks every patient who comes into his er .  it does everything you would expect a normal physician to do ,  said harris .  what an er doctor does is make diagnoses . doing that is somewhat an art and somewhat science .  his team is also working on a novel approach to a neurological exam . using the tablet , they can test users ' vision , picking up on subtle defects caused by illness . for example , if a person has suffered from a hemorrhagic stroke , they might lose some vision on just one side . the tests could detect the issue and tell the person to seek medical help immediately , cutting down on the chance of permanent disability . inventing a new medical device is only the first step to getting it into the hands of real people . perhaps even more useful than the money is how the x prize is working with the food and drug administration . getting regulatory compliance for a new product is notoriously difficult and expensive , and it requires clinical trials . but the fda is working closely with the x prize organization . the x prize will also manage the vigorous final tests that determine which devices will win . each team must produce 30 working prototypes of their tricorders for consumer testers . they 'll be used and reviewed by people who have one of the conditions the tricorders are required to detect . the final teams hail from six countries . they include doctors , engineers , undergrads , entrepreneurs and researchers , and all have unique approaches to the technology . many , like scanadu , final frontier and slovenian team mesi simplifying diagnostics , are creating small gadgets that work with existing mobile devices . some are taking a more traditional approach with things like blood pressure cuffs and finger pricks . the danvantri team from india is working on a low-cost device worn around the neck specifically for developing countries . one thing they all agree on is that this technology 's time is now .  this device , whether it 's mine or someone else 's , is coming ,  said harris .  it puts the information in the hands of the consumer where they can make actionable decisions . it really levels the playing field . ", "summary": " contest seeks a real tricorder that can measure vital signs and detect illnesses .   they are part of the $ 10 million tricorder x prize challenge .   many use smartphones , tablets to create mobile self-diagnostic devices for consumers .   the gadgets could give people more control over their own health care .
