{"text": "scientists have revealed a series of three mysterious impact craters on the surface of the moon . dubbed the ` three amigos ' by experts operating the lunar reconnaissance orbiter camera which took the images , experts believe the craters formed within minutes of each other - but have no idea how . they believe the bizarre arrangement may have been caused by a meteorite or comet breaking up - or three separate impacts occuring in a unique coincidence . the ` three amigos ' spotted on the surface of the moon , with debris sprayed upto 1km away . ` these three craters , located at 9.665 ° s , 7.646 ° e , appear to have formed more or less at the same time , certainly within a few minutes of each other , ' the researchers say . ` the southwest crater is 180 m diameter ; the center crater is 150 m ; and the northeast crater is 125m across . ` from the northeast crater center to the southwest crater centers , they cover about 450 m. ' the team has calculated that the projectiles were traveling from the east-northeast -lrb- the right side of the frame -rrb- and probably struck the surface at a relatively low angle , as indicated by the dust and other material they threw up - which extends as much as 1 km from the crater center . the same scene as above in afternoon lighting . the low sun accentuates the subtle topography associated with the impact craters , researchers say . ` the morphology of the craters suggests that the southwest crater formed first , followed by the other two , ' the researchers who analyse data from nasa 's lun . the southwest crater may only have formed a few seconds or a few minutes before the other two , the team believe . the shape of the two northeast craters -lrb- the low northwest-trending ridge between the craters -rrb- suggests that the projectiles hit the surface at the same time such that the excavation process of the two craters interacted , forming the ridge . the three craters were formed withing minutes of each other , causing the unique ridges between them .", "summary": " unique triple craters were spotted by a nasa craft imaging the lunar surface .   impact spread material 1km away .
