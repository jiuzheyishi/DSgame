{"text": "it might seem like common sense that it 's better to make important decisions after you 've eaten . but a study has claimed the exact opposite - that we actually make better decisions on an empty stomach . researchers found that people who were hungry made better snap decisions and could also appreciate future big rewards better than those who were fully fed . researchers at utrecht university in the netherlands say people make better decisions when they are hungry , including in activities such as gambling -lrb- stock image shown -rrb- . in studies they found participants could better appreciate short and long rewards on an empty stomach . the research was carried out by scientists at utrecht university in the netherlands . in the study participants were asked to fast for a night , and when they arrived at the laboratory the next day some were given food and some were not . they were then given a variety of tasks to simulate decision making . in two of the three tasks participants took a psychological test known as the iowa gambling task -lrb- igt -rrb- , which is said to simulate real-life decision making . the iowa gambling task -lrb- igt -rrb- is a psychological test to simulate real-life decision making . it is widely used in research of cognition and emotion . in the igt participants are presented with four virtual decks of cards on a computer screen . depending on the card drawn , some will win game money , some will lose money and some also carry a penalty . some of the decks are ` bad decks ' and some are ` good decks ' , and it is down to the participant to work out which decks are best to selecting winning cards from . by testing a group of participants the test can be used to show how certain factors affect decision making . however , some critics of the igt say it is not as accurate as thought . the first study involved 30 university students participating in the igt in exchange for money , while the second was similar but involved 50 students . the results of these two studies indicated that people were better at making quick decisions while operating on an empty stomach . in the third study , which involved 46 students , the participants were presented with 27 questions requiring them to choose between being given a small amount of money in the present or a larger amount of money in the future . in this study , the participants who had not eaten were more likely to choose the latter option , and vice-versa for those who had eaten . overall it was found that the participants who were hungry made more advantageous decisions in the task than those who had eaten . hungry people also had a better perception of future big rewards . this suggests that making decisions in a ` hot state ' is actually beneficial . a ` hot state ' is what psychologists call the moment when high levels of emotion can cause you to make quickly and sometimes irrational decisions . the results challenge the thought that being hungry leads to rash decisions . this is known as a ` hot state ' , when emotions influence actions . the researchers say not eating -lrb- stock image shown -rrb- may actually allow us to make better decisions . and they also say quick decisions may not be as bad as thought . ` these studies for the first time provide evidence that hot states improve decision making under uncertain conditions , challenging the conventional conception of the detrimental role of impulsivity in decision making , ' the researchers write . they conclude that the pre-conceived notion that people make irrational decisions on an empty stomach is not necessarily true . ` it may be that hot states in general , and hunger and appetite in particular , do not necessarily make people more impulsive but rather make them rely more on their gut feeling which benefits complex decisions with uncertain outcomes , ' they add . ` alternatively , it may be that hot states do increase impulsivity but that impulsivity is not necessarily bad .
