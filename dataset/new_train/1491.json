' the policy , drawn up by bradford teaching hospitals nhs foundation trust , which runs bradford royal infirmary and st luke 's hospital , states : ` to ensure effective communication , clothing which covers the face -lrb- veil/niqab -rrb- is not permitted for any staff in contact with patients , carers or visitors or for staff in other roles where clear face to face communication is essential , for example , training . ' staff who wish to wear a veil when they are not working -- such as in breaks , or during their lunch , or walking around the buildings -- are told they may do so . however they should be prepared to remove their veil if asked to check their identity against their id badge , according to the guidance drawn up last year . wrightington , wigan and leigh nhs trust , which runs three hospitals in the north west says face coverings should not be worn when delivering patient care in order to aid communication and minimise infection risks . dr sarah wollaston , the conservative mp for totnes in devon and a former gp , said : ` i think the same rules should apply to everyone : if i chose to wear a balaclava to work that would not be acceptable . ` there are many areas -- the courts , schools and hospitals -- where the veil is simply not appropriate because you need clear communication . debate : boris johnson said it was ` totally wrong ' for muslim schools to force pupils to wear veils and burkas . yesterday , the mayor of london said it was ` totally wrong ' for muslim schools to force pupils as young as 11 to wear veils and burkas . boris johnson said they should not be compulsory , adding : ` i do n't think it can be classed as any kind of uniform . that is against my principles and it 's against the principles of liberty that london should stand for . ' a row broke out after it was claimed that some independent secondary schools order girls to wear burkas outside school and headscarves in class . two london schools , the # 3,000-a-year ayesha siddiqa girls school in southall and the # 1,900-a-year madani girls school in whitechapel , were both said to enforce strict muslim uniform policies . but teachers at madani last night said the rules had been misinterpreted and that pupils were not forced to wear full-face veils .", "summary": " nhs staff , including doctors and nurses , have been told the can not wear a niqab - a full veil which covers the face - around patients .   ministers have called for ` face-to-face ' contact between staff and patients .   the government has ordered a review of all health service policies on workers ' uniforms .
