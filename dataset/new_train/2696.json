{"text": "charles smith insisted sunday that the former nba players who went to north korea for a basketball diplomacy trip , led by dennis rodman , were n't paid by the repressive regime .  absolutely not . i think i am astute enough to understand the dynamics , especially collecting monetary dollars from north korea . no , we did not get paid from north korea at all ,  he told cnn in a lengthy exclusive interview on  new day sunday .  smith , who retired from the nba in 1997 after nine seasons , said an irish online betting company and a documentary film crew paid expenses for the ex-players turned hoops ambassadors . however , last month the irish company , paddy power , said it had disassociated itself from rodman 's project after the execution of kim 's uncle and top aide , jang song thaek . speaking by satellite from beijing , smith said it was n't about the money . he saw it as an opportunity to go to a reclusive country and exchange cultural information with other athletes and citizens . but he did n't see it as a birthday present for north korean leader kim jong un .  that 's the date that was set . i did n't know it was his birthday ,  he said in the half-hour interview .  and it did n't matter to me once i found out that it was his birthday .  smith said he felt for rodman , who asked for his help organizing the trip and who really seemed to want to pull off a big event .  i saw the pressure mount . i saw him change , and it was very difficult keeping him and everyone together -lrb- once controversy began over traveling to north korea -rrb- ,  he said . the trip also met with criticism because north korea still holds kenneth bae , a u.s. citizen who was arrested in november 2012 , convicted last spring by pyonyang of  hostile acts  intended to topple the government , and sentenced to 15 years in a labor camp . some questioned whether the players would advocate for his release , but they did n't -- at least not publicly .  we did n't go there for that . we went there to do what we normally do , and that 's to be cross-cultural ambassadors and use the game of basketball as a bridge for exchange ,  he said . smith said the difference between this trip and other sports exchanges was that the players were n't sent as representatives of the united states .  we 're athletes doing it ourselves ,  he said . when celebrity meets brutality . smith said he has no regrets about going . he said he was able to meet some north korean citizens and even came across one man who winced before shaking the hand of the first african-american he had ever met . smith said the man told him they did n't have a very good view of african-americans . the man rubbed his hand as if the color would come off , smith said . rodman appears to bow , sings ` happy birthday ' to north korea 's kim .  then the next day after we talked for a while , he came up to me and said he was sorry ,  smith said . the former nba player , who now travels frequently as a basketball ambassador , said he did n't go to any areas where people are hungry . smith also swapped sports stories with north korea 's sports minister and basketball players from the national team . he thinks that will be a positive outcome from the trip .  we accomplished a relationship on the sports side in north korea ,  he said .  where it goes from there , i do not know at this point in time . but we established a relationship . they 've asked us to come back . whether we go back or not , i 'm not sure . i do n't know . but there was a relationship established between a group of individuals in two different countries that do n't communicate .  rodman apologizes for north korea outburst , says he 'd been drinking .", "summary": " new : smith says players were n't acting as political liaisons .   players were  absolutely  not paid by the north koreans , charles smith tells cnn .   in 30-minute interview he says he felt for dennis rodman , who put a lot of pressure on himself .   smith says he did n't know the date of the contest was the birthday of north korea 's leader .
