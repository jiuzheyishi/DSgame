{"text": "according to a new report from the centers for disease control and prevention , prescription drug overdose deaths in florida are up a staggering 265 % since 2003 . but it 's not just the deaths that have florida officials worried ; it 's the births .  we saw the number of crack babies that died , and this is just another version of that ,  broward county sheriff al lamberti said .  we all need to be concerned .  according to state health records , nearly 1,400 florida babies were born suffering from drug withdrawal syndrome in 2010 , a fourfold increase since 2003 . the state does not track the specific drug the babies are hooked on , but south florida doctors and neonatal nurses believe the increase is due to a sharp increase in pregnant women addicted to prescription drugs .  they go through withdrawal symptoms ,  said mary osuch , the head nurse at broward general medical center 's neonatal intensive care unit .  they 're crampy , miserable . they sweat . they can have rapid breathing . sometimes , they can even have seizures .  according to the white house office on drug control policy , prescription drug abuse is the nation 's fastest-growing drug problem . marsha currant , who runs the susan b. anthony recovery center near fort lauderdale , says prescription drug addiction overtook crack in 2009 as the main problem afflicting the pregnant women who are treated there .  in the very beginning , it was really 100 % crack cocaine ,  said currant , who started keeping track of drug trends in 1995 .  we see a lot more prescription drugs now .  currant says new mothers who are hooked on prescription drugs are often reluctant to seek help for fear the authorities will take their babies from them .  we wanted to have a place where women did n't have to chose between getting treatment and having their children go into foster care ,  she said . compounding the problem , women who are addicted to prescription drugs and find themselves pregnant can not safely go off the drugs without medical supervision . they need to be weaned off slowly , or the baby will go into withdrawal in the womb . at the susan b. anthony center , one mother who became hooked on prescription drugs after her husband died says she felt her baby suffering while she was getting clean .  i know that i 'm going through stuff getting off the pills . so what 's she going through ? she ca n't talk . she 's just a baby ,  jessica said . thanks to the center , jessica was weaned off oxycodone before her baby , casey , was born . but she fears the long-term effects of her drug abuse on her daughter , who has been suffering from respiratory problems .  i want to make sure that she does n't hurt anymore ,  jessica said .  she does n't deserve that , because she 's a princess .  jessica graduated from the center 's recovery program last week .", "summary": " hundreds of florida babies have been born addicted to drugs .   infants  go through withdrawal symptoms ,  nurse says .   government says prescription drug abuse is nation 's fastest-growing drug problem .   mothers are often reluctant to seek help .
