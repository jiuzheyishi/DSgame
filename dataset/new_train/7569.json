{"text": "britain is sitting on a # 1.5 trillion shale gas bonanza that could be worth more than the remaining north sea gas . the amount is bigger than previously thought and would potentially bring energy price stability and independence from imports for decades . although only about ten per cent of the gas is in unpopulated areas suitable for extraction , it would still be worth # 150 billion . boost : britain is sitting on a # 1.5 trillion shale gas bonanza that could be worth more than the remaining north sea gas . it is hoped shale gas can transform the economy in the way north sea oil did in the eighties and nineties . the level of untapped shale gas will be confirmed next month in a study by the british geological survey , commissioned by the department of energy and climate change , according to industry sources . ministers are then likely to give the go-ahead for drilling , hoping the enormous economic benefits can win over environmental concerns . but critics say the environmental cost is too high for ` fracking ' -- or hydraulic fracturing , the controversial method of extracting gas by forcing water , sand and chemicals at high pressure 6,000 ft underground . pilot wells caused two earthquakes in lancashire last year and green campaigners warn the method could contaminate the water supply . us research also says that homeowners within two miles of a fracking site can expect property prices to plummet by almost a quarter . sources close to energy secretary ed davey said he was ` quite excited about the prospect of a new domestic resource and probably wants to be able to exploit it , but it is quite a disruptive process and we need to go in with our eyes open ' . although the shale gas reserves are unlikely to mean a fall in gas prices , there could be enough to prevent expected big increases for years . oil and gas experts are also hopeful about the high concentration of gas in uk rocks , which is richer than even us shale deposits and would require fewer wells . the coalition hopes that shale gas can transform the economy in the way north sea oil did in the eighties and nineties . david cameron has chaired a seminar to which he invited shale gas experts to come to downing street . meanwhile the chancellor is considering a ` generous new tax regime ' for drilling companies . energy minister john hayes is expected to give the go-ahead for drilling , which has been suspended for the last year because of safety and environmental concerns . last year , cuadrilla resources suspended its drilling operations after fracking caused two small earthquakes near blackpool . a senior industry source with intimate knowledge of the bgs survey said : ` when the survey announces the size of the reserve , it will be an enormous figure . the potential is that it will be a bigger number than the total recovery from the north sea . ' hopeful : sources close to energy secretary ed davey said he was ` quite excited ' about the prospect of a new domestic resource . substantial recoverable gas could enhance britain 's energy security , offset declining north sea output and reduce import dependence . about 70 per cent of the north sea gas and oil reserves have been used up and in 20 years britain will be dependent on gas from abroad -- mainly norway and qatar . however , only about ten per cent of the shale gas is available for commercial exploitation because much of it has been found in heavily populated areas , such as the north west , north wales , isle of man , south cumbria , east midlands and the north east . many of these areas have already suffered a property price collapse , and so fracking would be likely to provoke fierce opposition . an icm poll last month showed 67 per cent of homeowners would rather have a wind turbine near their home than a fracking well . but cuadrilla claims the estimated 200 trillion cubic feet of shale gas in the bowland basin in the north west could create 5,600 jobs . pro-frackers say the landscape is disturbed for a few months during initial drilling and that the ground can be returned to its former use . but friends of the earth claims that the longer-term effects below ground could be catastrophic . andrew pendleton , of the charity , said : ` our objection to shale gas is there are risks of water contamination by methane and chemicals , and the process involves very high use of water anyway . then there 's the risk of earth tremors . ` we do n't think shale gas would even stop the rise in gas prices anyway and it is another fossil fuel creating carbon . plus there is the risk methane will leak out , and it is a very powerful greenhouse gas .
