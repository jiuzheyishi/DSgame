' ms glynn said ocean died on august 2009 having contracted the h1n1 virus the previous month , but by that time she was already severely ill - following the shaking more than two years beforehand . in april 2007 , when she was three and a half months old , she had sustained serious neurological injuries inflicted on her by her father , ms glynn said . these included injuries to the brain and eyes . ` these injuries were so bad that they left ocean disabled with severely delayed development , functionally blind and suffering from seizures -lrb- which -rrb- the doctors found difficult to control . ' she could not sit up on her own , walk or clear secretions from her respiratory system ` which caused her to suffer from coughs , colds and pneumonia ' . ocean was aged two and a half when she died . ocean 's mother : lisa elliott , now 29 , had started her relationship with curtis in 2005 , and there was disharmony . ms glynn added : ` it is clear , and . accepted in the plea , that the shaking in 2007 was a significant . contributory factor to the cause of death . ' curtis pleaded guilty at the start of his trial in february 2008 to assault , and jailed for 20 months . he said ocean was crying and screaming , he lost control momentarily and shook her about four to five times back and forth . he was tired and frustrated and had no intention to cause serious harm . the judge told curtis : ` like most babies , she cried . you picked her up and shook her four or five times . you may have been tired . you may have been uncertain as to how to placate ocean . ` you may have been cross with your partner . but none of that is any excuse whatsoever for your loss of temper and mistreatment of that ba' the judge said he acknowledged that curtis ' actions had no intentional malice to the baby . he added : ` consequences matter and when the consequences become the more serious they can lead , as in your case , to more serious charges . ' he would make a reduction in the sentence for the fact that curtis had been prosecuted already for the same wrongful act . the judge said that if curtis had . contested the present charge , he would have given him three years , but . because of curtis 's plea of guilty , he would reduce it to two . ms glynn had told the court that ocean 's mother lisa elliott , now 29 , had started her relationship with curtis in 2005 , and there was disharmony , with each adult enduring violence from the other . ms elliott had signed an agreement with social services that she would not leave her daughter on her own with curtis . but she did not comply with this , including on the evening of the assault . she left the address where they were living in woking , surrey , to go to bingo with a friend . vincent coughlin qc , defending , had told the court : ` we accept the defendant must return to prison . ' he said it had been pointed out in a report that curtis in 2008 had taken responsibility for his actions ` and would do anything to turn back the clock ' . sentencing : curtis - who had already served 20 months in prison for assault , imposed before ocean died - was told by mr justice nicol at guildford crown court -lrb- pictured -rrb- that the results of his shaking were ` catastrophic ' he was of low intelligence , and presented as an individual vulnerable in his own right . ` where is the justice ? two years is n't long enough , what will he serve , a year of that ? i would have preferred five years ' lisa elliott , ocean 's mother . ms . elliott said on leaving court : ` where is the justice ? two years is n't . long enough , what will he serve , a year of that ? i would have preferred . five years . ` at least then he would serve two and a half years - about the same time that ocean had to live . she 's a child , babies cry . the only reason i left him that night was because i knew there was going to be world war three between us , i thought by going out it might defuse it . ` if i for one second had known that he would lay his hand on my child , i would never have left her .
