' i decided to make the most of having a super stylist at my disposal first thing -lrb- kenna 's most recent instagram post before our trip featured him and supermodel client jourdan dunne -rrb- and as well as having hair that stayed glam for 24 hours i demanded to look like sarah jessica parker , who has been my hair idol since the carrie bradshaw days . ` these days , ' kenna , ghd 's styling ambassador , told me , ` we call these kind of long , loose , lovely curls  la waves  . ' whatever , kenna . i loved what he did with the wand and asked the london-born brooklyn boy to move in with me about 30 minutes into my mini break makeover . a very good start to my good hair day . ' 9am : boutique hotel breakfast at das stue then off on our travels around the city . ` berlin 's first boutique hotel seemed a fitting place to prepare for our glamorous day trip . as i foraged around the breakfast buffet a small child actually waved at me , well , at ` the hair ' . i felt a bit like cheryl cole -lrb- although chezza probably would n't have wolfed two croissants and a cheese selection so early in the morning -rrb- .

' 11am : taking in some culture at the cfa -lrb- contemporary fine arts gallery -rrb- in mitte . 1pm - experiencing secret berlin at blub , an abandoned aqua complex in neukölln . ` we got a glimpse into the secret side of berlin with a trip to an abandoned swimming pool complex hidden from sight and slowly falling into beautiful decay . originally the aqua centre featured pools , slides , waterfalls , saunas , turkish baths ... but now it 's mostly used as a skate park/hangout by berlin 's cool kids . spooky . fabulous . a must-see and a total health hazard ... and i was entirely over-styled and overdressed for the occasion but it made a great backdrop for some hot hair pictures . ' 1pm - experiencing secret berlin at blub , an abandoned aqua complex in neukölln . 1pm - experiencing secret berlin at blub , an abandoned aqua complex in neukölln . 3pm - lunch at parker bowles in moritzplatz . this was my first chance to swish the hair at hot berliners as we late lunched at the very hip parker bowles , named - of course - after our beloved camilla . i 'm sure the duchess of cornwall would have approved of the pulled pork burgers served with piles of pickle jalapeños , the homemade lemonade cocktails and definitely the handsome baristas . 3pm - lunch at parker bowles in moritzplatz . 5pm - a history lesson at the east side gallery in friedrichshain-kreuzber . after lunch it was time to learn a bit about the city as the curls battled with blustery conditions next to the river spree . the east side gallery is a memorial built on a section of the berlin wall and it 's the largest open air gallery in the world featuring bright , bold murals remembering the city 's history and celebrating its future . 7pm - back at das stue getting ready to hit the town . back at the hotel it was time to ramp up the eyeliner and start breathing in as i donned a bodycon dress . no need to 're - zhujh ' the hair though , i just threw my head upside down , gave it a quick ruffle and walked out the door . massive result and serious time saving points for those of us who like to get to the bar as early as possible . 7pm - back at das stue getting ready to hit the town . 9pm - drinks at the monkey bar at the 25hours hotel bikini berlin . the monkey bar got it 's name because drinkers have a direct view into the monkey enclosures in the berlin zoo below . there was a lot of interesting wildlife around the rum-themed bar too , which was packed even on a tuesday night and a perfect place to put ` the hair ' - dropping slightly but still still going over 12 hours in - to the test with a quick smirt on the balcony outside . 11pm - paleo dinner at sauvage berlin in neuköll . berliners do n't really do diets ... but they wo n't argue with an eating plan that guarantees more energy to stay out partying . paleo - aka eating like a caveman - is hot right now in this city and sauvage is the leader of the pack . it helps that boris the owner resembles a male model -lrb- that no sugar , no dairy , no processed regime obviously works -rrb- . we feasted on steak tartare , monkfish , and dairy-free fondant and drank too many of the brilliantly named homo-eruptus cocktails , with ` the hair ' scoring a second round on the house . 11pm - paleo dinner and drinks at sauvage berlin in neuköll -lrb- right -rrb- . sauvage 's menu emerged from boss boris leite-poco 's personal experience of transforming his body through the paleo diet . according to fans of this way of eating , adjusting your eating habits to paleo principles means feeding your body as nature intended , resulting in noticeable health benefits because the unprocessed and/or raw ingredients used have high nutritional value . chef , author and restaurateur boris leite-poco is spearheading the trend for paleo eating in berlin . the paleo brownie -lrb- flourless chocolate and beetroot brownie -rrb- . combine the beets and honey in a sauce pan , and cook on medium-low heat for 10 minutes , or until beets are soft . in the mean time , combine in a bowl the eggs , fats , vanilla , cardamom and cocoa and whisk well . preheat the oven to 135 °c . remove beets from heat , transfer to a food processor , or blend using a hand blender until completely pureed . combine both mixtures , add walnuts and a pinch of salt . lay the mixture on a greased square oven dish -lrb- or lined with baking paper -rrb- and bake for 30 minutes or until firm . 1am - cool cocktails at geist im glas in neukölln . a trip to berlin is n't complete without stumbling across a secret bar . and this smoky speakeasy was the perfect place to deconstruct our day and plan the rest of our night . the back shelves here were filled with dangerous-looking bottles of home-flavoured spirts and there was no main cocktail menu , instead the -lrb- only slightly intimidating -rrb- bar staff created bespoke cocktails based on what we felt like drinking and doing -lrb- my tipple was an incredible tequila , rosemary and coffee concoction which acted as the perfect pick-me-up -rrb- . 3am -lrb- and onwards -rrb- - dancing at chalet in kreuzberg . kreuzberg is the place to be after the clock strikes 12 any day of the week in berlin . there 's a cheap bar , outside space , secret rooms and a great dj line-up -lrb- even on a tuesday -rrb- . this was the final push for the curls , could they last spinning around a smoky , sweaty dance floor ? they did . longer than i could in fact as i headed home around 6am with them still bobbing behind me . it 's probably for the best that no pictures were allowed . 1am - cool cocktails at geist im glas in neukölln and 3am -lrb- and onwards -rrb- - dancing in kreuzberg . 7am - time to call it a night back at das stue . after watching the sunrise from our pretty balcony it was time for bed . my hair certainly smelled like it had been out for 24 hours -lrb- and the rest -rrb- after partying with the city 's smokers but it managed to look quite a bit fresher than i felt . 7am - time to call it a night back at das stue . verdict : sold.the magic wand lived up to its 24 hour claim . yes , it helps having a hair superstar styling your ` do to begin with , but kenna did n't do anything groundbreaking to my barnet , he just prepped it really well using more product than i usually would , blow-dried it properly -lrb- which i never bother to do -rrb- and then spent time working patiently through all sections of the hair . it did n't take as long as it looks like it should have . it did include a lot of hairspray . and it did put a bounce in my step all day and night . having taken some tips from the hair guru and learned not to spend my evenings scraping my hair up and down according to temperature issues i will be taking my ghd curls out on the town again as soon as my liver allows .", "summary": " writer spent 24 hours drinking in the sights and soaking up the nightlife of berlin to come up with a whirlwind guide to the city .   activities included galleries , clubbing , cocktails and paleo dining .   ghd claim new curve collection tongs will keep curls in for 24 hours .
