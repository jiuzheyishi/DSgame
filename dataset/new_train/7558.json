{"text": "collector phil green suspected there was something extraordinary about a green rock he found in his backyard six years ago - but he had no idea it was out of this world . the massachusetts man recently received confirmation from nasa that the mud-covered rock he pulled out of the merrimack river , which runs behind his amesbury home , was a segment of the mir space station . space rock : amesbury resident phil green found a green rock from a nearby river six years ago which nasa confirmed was a piece of the russian space station mir . out of this world : amesbury resident phil green found this mud-covered rock in a river behind his house , and recently discovered it was a piece of a russian space station . after a year-long analysis , the space agency sent him a letter saying they were 87 per cent sure his rock was a remnant of the soviet spacecraft according to whdh.com . green , a custodian at amesbury elementary school , told the eagle tribune he found the rock while searching for arrowheads near the river , and it stood out to him . ` the river gets scoured really well by the ice in the wintertime , so you would n't expect to find a small rock sitting on top of what 's almost like pavement and granite , ' green said . ` so i went over and picked it up . ' he said the rock was a burnt shade of green with a distinctive glassy structure after he washed away the mud . one side had ` about a hundred tiny pores ' , most commonly seen in volcanic rock . using a metal detector , the unique item collector found that it had no traces of metal in it . not sure what to do with it , he left the rock outside for about five years until a friend came over and suggested it could be a meteor . not long later , his sister-in-law , a newburyport teacher , saw the rock and sent it to nasa to be analyzed , according to the eagle tribune . after waiting about a year , green had given up hope of ever hearing anything about the mysterious rock . then a couple of weeks ago , he received a package in the mail from nasa containing his rock , a plaque and a letter from nasa analysis engineer george leussis confirming that the rock had indeed fallen from space . the ` rock ' phil green found in a riverbed near his home was actually a chunk of the mir space station , pictured . the letter confirmed that while the rock originated on earth , it had definitely been subjected to a fall from low earth orbit , which was the reason for the rock 's green color and strange properties , according to the eagle tribune . ` the material shows a composition similar to that used as ballast by the soviet space program starting in the mid 1980s , ' leussis wrote . ` this places its most likely origin as mir , or one of the progress-m class russian resupply vehicles , that had undergone a tps failure . ' mir was a russian space station that operated in low earth orbit from 1986 to 2001 . when it fell to earth in march 2001 , most of it landed in the south pacific ocean .", "summary": " amesbury resident phil green found a green rock in a riverbed six years ago , and kept it in his yard .   nasa testing revealed it is 87 per cent likely to be a piece of russian space station mir .
