{"text": "rory , a keen footy player , was diagnosed with the rare tumour just days before he was due to fly out to disneyland with his family . a sydney family has described the incredibly cruel impact cancer has had on their life following the double diagnosis of a father and son just eight months apart . in a heart-wrenching interview aired on channel nine 's 60 minutes program , the williams family revealed the devastating moment cancer took hold of the youngest boy , 11-year-old rory , before illness also struck his 44-year-old father grant just eight months after . the avalanche of bad news began to tumble downhill after rory 's diagnosis in november , just days before the family were due to fly out on a dream holiday to disneyland . rory 's parents took the keen footy player to hospital when they noticed his stomach began to swell significantly . ` my mum thought that something was wrong but dad 's like ` you 're probably eating too much maccas , ' rory said . it turned out his diet had nothing to do with his stomach 's ballooning growth , but everything to do with the football-sized tumour hiding inside . ' i think our life prior to this was a very average suburban day-to-day life . . very solid and happy , ' mother leanne said . first rory , then grant williams was told he too had a cancer in a cruel blow to the family which were still dealing with the news of the 11-year-old 's diagnosis . his father had joked he 'd been eating too much fast food - but doctors discovered a football-sized tumour -lrb- right -rrb- when rory was taken to hospital . the grey matter below the doctor toby trahair 's finger show the extent of the foot-ball sized tumor which was too big to be cut from rory 's stomach . ` now i feel like we have the same life but instead of living on solid ground we are on the edge of a precipice . ' it meant rory 's long-awaited trip of a lifetime to visit disneyland was put on hold indefinitely . the news - enough to reduce his parents to tears . ` you talk about going from the penthouse to the basement , ' mr williams said . ` for an 11-year-old kid to think he is about to get on a plane to disneyland and then get told he 's got cancer the next day , is just mind boggling . ' rory 's mother and father both broke down during the heartfelt interview with ben fordham who is a close friend of the pair and the godfather of the 11-year-old . despite the intensity of the situation , rory williams remained incredibly upbeat during the interview . at times , the 11-year-old was joking with interviewer ben fordham saying the reason behind his ballooning stomach was his poor diet . the mind-boggling news was made worse after hearing that doctors were unable to operate on the tumour . too big , the family knew despite hoping otherwise , that rory 's cancer was serious . ` all i remember him saying to me is , ` am i going to die ? ' mr williams said . ` that took all i had to say ` mate of course you 're not going to die ' and not cry myself . ' knowing chemotherapy , radiation and surgery would n't work , there was only one hope of bringing the watermelon-sized growth to it 's knees and that was a shot of a therapy drug called crizotinib . the untested drug which had only been trialed in a small sample of pediatric cases and adults with lung cancer , had amazing results . rory had four ct scans , the last of which showed remarkable trials that a drug had removed a large portion of the cancer in his stomach . rory , the youngest in the family , is pictured with sister gemma . months on and four ct scans later the doctors at randwick children 's hospital revealed the remarkable change in rory 's condition . oncologist dr toby trahair said the the tumour 's reduction in size was ` almost a miracle . ' ` but it is also important to be optimistic on the one hand and realistic on the other . ' meanwhile as rory 's condition started to improve , his father received the gut wrenching news that a cancer had begun to grown inside his own body just eight months after rory 's diagnosis . ' i found out last thursday . i 've got prostate cancer , ' mr williams said . ` the way i look at it is , rory 's got a tumor that is sort of a one in a million tumor . ` when the prostate cancer was diagnosed it was kind of like we 've already had the shark attack this is just a mozzy bite . ' when the family found out about rory 's condition , grant williams sent a text message to family and friends telling them of rory 's diagnosis . he told 60 minutes he could n't believe what he was writing in the message was true . the size of the cancer , in red , was as big as a football when it was at full maturity inside rory 's stomach . but months of target treatment using the the trial of a cancer therapy drug reduced it to the size of a golf ball . ` it is almost a miracle . ` it 's almost a miracle ' oncologist dr toby trahair said . nonetheless , mr williams admitted it was still incredibly tough news to take . ` how do the two boys in the family get cancer at the same time ? , he said . ` it 's just ridiculous . ' knowing his family were n't the only ones with a young child battling cancer , mr williams said they also wo n't be the last . ` you ca n't sit back and think do n't worry about it it 's not our caper ... that wo n't happen . ` well , it 's happened to us . ' he said he wanted people to pledge their support to the annual gold telethon fundraising event for sydney children 's hospital in randwick . it raises funds to buy life-saving equipment , fund research and deliver vital services to help young patients . ` that 's probably the only reason we told this story . these kids are just plain unlucky , they 've done absolutely nothing ... there 's nothing but bad luck involved and we need to save these kids it 's as simple as that .
