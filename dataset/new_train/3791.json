' the head of mi6 instructed that the traitor be brought to gibraltar , and the frenchman was subsequently lured to the british embassy as ` action gibraltar ' got underway . lablache-combier was knocked out and sedated with morphine before being bundled into a diplomatic car by a team of secret service operatives and driven away under cover of darkness . all went smoothly until the spy regained consciousness and began shouting for help from the back seat of the car , and a struggle is believed to have ensued as the kidnappers tried to avoid attracting attention . at some point the spy was hit on the head with a revolver and killed . his body was taken on to gibraltar and ` quietly disposed of ' - most likely buried at sea . an authorised history of mi6 refers to the doomed spy by his cover name and includes a coded telegram sent by the secret service reporting his death . it said : ` consignment arrived completely destroyed owing to over attention in transit ... salvage being quietly disposed of tonight ... damage regretted but i submit it is for the best .
