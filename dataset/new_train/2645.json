{"text": "even as last month 's events in benghazi , libya , become clearer -lrb- it was a terrorist attack -rrb- , the aftermath of benghazi on american politics and on american policy is far from settled . the immediate question is why did it take so long to characterize accurately what happened there ? writing in the daily beast , respected diplomatic observer leslie gelb answers that question by reverting to a well-used theme when he blames current policy and political problems on the quality of the intelligence . commenting on ambassador susan rice 's serial talk-show assertions that the benghazi attack was  spontaneous ,  he opines that rice 's  mistake was taking the initial intelligence at face value .  gelb reinforces his point by saying that he made the same mistake in his own op-ed by relying on  what the intelligence briefers told me .  odd that he would receive an intelligence briefing . equally odd , his assertion presumes that policymakers are simply passive clients of their intelligence officers . did anyone challenge the video-inspired , spontaneous-event narrative with information like that reportedly revealed to congress by ambassador pat kennedy soon after the attack : that this was a complex and synchronized assault ? what we know about the libya attack . this theme of intelligence shortcomings was carried over by multiple government officials cited in a lengthy wall street journal piece that outlined  shifting views within the intelligence community  as one source of the administration 's problems . according to the journal 's sources , early intelligence reports of an al qaeda connection to the benghazi attack were discounted by the white house , following the lead of the director of national intelligence .  the intelligence community made me do it  defense is a bit peculiar given the aftermath of the flawed 2002 national intelligence estimate on iraqi weapons of mass destruction . the outcome of that episode was a commitment by the intelligence community to give policymakers the benefit of the range of views within the community and to attach confidence levels to assessments . one wonders what level of confidence -lrb- low , medium or high -rrb- the intelligence community attached to its judgment that the benghazi attack was related to an anti-islam video and spontaneous and how already emerging dissenting views arguing the attack was preplanned were presented to senior officials . in any event , given the administration 's existing narrative about its success against al qaeda and the inherent attractiveness of the spontaneous attack plotline -lrb- a spontaneous attack would be neither predictable nor preventable and therefore less likely to invite blame for a lack of sufficient security -rrb- , there were likely strong instincts in the white house to accept and publicize the original director of national intelligence assessment regardless of confidence levels or competing analysis . strong instincts , but not necessarily good instincts . first of all , on a political level , the early story seemed to confirm earlier criticisms of administration wishful thinking in the face of similar events . sen. susan collins , for example , criticized the pentagon for labeling as  workplace violence  the 2009 killings of 13 u.s. soldiers at fort hood . the army officer charged in the rampage had communicated with a known terrorist and was shouting  allahu akbar  during the shooting . similarly , the man in an attempt to down an aircraft near detroit on christmas day 2009 , the final turn of one in a series of complex plots launched by al qaeda in yemen , was prematurely labeled an  isolated extremist  before all the facts were in . even more importantly , if wishful thinking can sometimes create political problems , it could take a far more important toll on the development and implementation of actual policy . the decision to intervene in libya , though wrapped in a u.n. security council resolution to protect innocent life , was also a decision to overthrow the libyan government , and u.s. / nato airstrikes continued until that goal was achieved . with that  victory ,  libya was predictably thrown into chaos : no central government , no institutions of civil society , fractious armed militias , a budding jihadist movement in the east , lingering regionalism and tribalism elsewhere . predictable consequences were not confined to libya . awash with weapons and fleeing mercenaries , northern mali was broken off from the center and became a haven for a strengthening al qaeda in the islamic maghreb . how prepared were we for these predictable consequences ? clearly ambassador chris stevens threw his heart and soul and ultimately his life into trying to shape a positive future . but were the full government 's efforts adequate to the task we helped create ? although we were less immediately responsible for the overthrow of regimes in egypt , tunisia and yemen , we will be no less affected by the outcome in those states . the same will hold true for syria when the day of reckoning comes for bashar al-assad 's regime . what level of effort is the united states prepared to exert ? we should n't fool ourselves . our influence will often be far from decisive . but neither will it be trivial . and surely , in a time of global challenges and fiscal pressures , we will have to pick our investments and  interventions  carefully . but that will require a realistic rather than a wishful appreciation of events . over the past year the administration has repeatedly emphasized that  the tide of war is receding  and that  it 's time to do some nation-building here at home .  many have read this as advertising an american retrenchment from commitments abroad . some may think that wise and are prepared to live with the consequences . one only hopes that the calculation of the consequences has been carefully done , based on hard realities , and not on the kind of wishful thinking that would turn a complex , synchronized terrorist attack into a kind of jihadist flash mob . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of michael v. hayden .", "summary": " michael hayden says intelligence briefers are being blamed for confusion over benghazi attack .   hayden says reforms require briefers to cover full range of intelligence theories .   the incorrect description of the attack fits pattern of wishful thinking on terrorism , he says .
