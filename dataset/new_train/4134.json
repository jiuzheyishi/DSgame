{"text": "a u.s. army infantryman who lost all four limbs in a 2009 roadside explosion in iraq has undergone radical transplant surgery that may help him regain use of his arms . last month , the 26-year-old infantryman had successful surgery -- a rare double arm transplant -- at johns hopkins hospital in baltimore .  it feels amazing ,  marrocco told reporters wednesday .  it is something that i was waiting for for a long time , and now that it happened , i do n't know what to say , because it is such a big thing for my life .  the last thing marrocco remembers before being hit by an explosion in 2009 was that he was driving an armored vehicle . when he woke up at walter reed medical center in washington , marrocco was alive , but missing all four of his limbs .  when it happened , i did n't remember too much ,  marrocco said .  i was still alive , so that 's really all that mattered to me at the time .  marrocco is one of only seven people in the country to successfully undergo the surgery , and the first quadruple-amputee soldier , according to johns hopkins . the surgery , which took 13 hours and 16 orthopaedic and microvascular surgeons from five hospitals -- was also the first bilateral arm transplant performed at johns hopkins . all of the surgeons volunteered their services ; the surgery and rehabilitation costs were paid by the department of defense 's armed forces institute of regenerative medicine and hopkins . the team of surgeons rehearsed the procedure on cadaver arms four times over the past 18 months , said lead surgeon dr. w.p. andrew lee , director of the department of plastic and reconstructive surgery at johns hopkins .  on his right side we did an above-elbow transplant by connecting the bone , muscles , blood vessels , nerves and skin between the donor and recipient ,  lee said . on marrocco 's left side ,  in order to preserve the elbow joint , we transplanted the entire donor forearm muscles over his remaining tissues , then rerouted the nerves to the new muscle .  while marrocco is doing well , his recovery will be long and risky , the doctor said .  the nerves regenerate at the maximum speed of 1 inch per month . the therapy will continue for a few years , first at johns hopkins , then at walter reed . the progress will be slow , but the outcome rewarding .  marrocco is taking anti-rejection medication , which can lead to side effects like infection and organ damage . but he 's received an infusion of the donor 's bone marrow cells to further prevent rejection of his new arms . that infusion allows him to take only one anti-rejection drug instead of the usual three-drug cocktail . doctors call his recovery so far remarkable . watch : mom eyes double arm transplant .  now , i can move my left elbow ,  marrocco said .  this was my elbow , the one i had before . i can rotate a little bit . this -lrb- right -rrb- arm is pretty much not much movement at all -- not yet at least . hopefully , we are hopeful for the future to get some pretty good function out of it , out of both of them .  doctors said rehabilitation therapy is an integral part of the healing process .  the next two to three years , brendan 's full-time job is doing hand therapy , six hours a day , every single day , once nerves grow in ,  said dr. jaimie shores , clinical director of hand transplantation at johns hopkins .  he 's going to be working very hard .  marrocco said he 's up to the task . the thing he 's looking forward to most ?  driving . absolutely , driving . i used to love to drive and it was a lot of fun for me . so , i am really looking forward to getting back to that . and just becoming an athlete again . one of my goals is to hand-cycle a marathon .  lee hopes the new anti-rejection regimen performed on marrocco will become the new standard of care for limb and face transplants . marrocco will participate in a anti-rejection regimen study that 's being funded by the armed forces institute of regenerative medicine . for his family , the surgery means moving forward with their lives .  our lives have been on hold for the last almost four years waiting for this surgery , getting him through walter reed and getting to the point where he was pretty independent ,  said mother michelle marrocco .  and now he will be independent , and when he comes home , he 'll be the brendan we 've all been looking for .  marrocco 's message to other 's facing similar challenges ? do n't give up hope .  life always get better . you 're still alive ... just be stubborn . work your ass off .  lee agreed .  advances in medicine are being made every day in different areas , whether it 's tissue transplantation or tissue regeneration ,  he said .  research is being performed throughout the world with different ways of regenerating tissues and replacing arms , so they should be optimistic , as we are that there will be new treatments and modalities currently not available .  marrocco said he 's is very optimistic about his future .  i just want to get the most out of these arms and just as goals come up , knock them down , and take it as absolutely far as i can . so really , i just want to get to the point that i can be completely on my own and just get back to enjoying life .
