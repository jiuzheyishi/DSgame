{"text": "today , the day after the tragic shootings near milwaukee , the fog will begin to lift . just as after columbine and aurora , we will hear the names of the suspect and victims . we will learn more about the motive and imagine the nightmare that unfolded within those walls . in the past , hearing these horrific details would be enough to bring us together in national unity . but that will not be enough today . today , we are called to do more . we are called to do the hard work of listening . if we really want to unite in response to this national tragedy , we need to know whom we are embracing . for many , this means learning about sikh americans for the first time -- and listening closely to what 's at stake . for me , the mass shooting is not just about how to keep guns out of the hands of a murderous few . it 's also about my community 's sacrifice in the struggle to live as free and proud americans . as a sikh american whose grandfather sailed by steamship from punjab , india , and settled in california 100 years ago , my family 's story spans the struggle of sikhs in america . donning a turban and long beard , my grandfather tamed the hard floor of the central valley on a john deere tractor in the early 1900s . sikh pioneers such as my grandfather could not own land or become citizens because of the color of their skin , but they stayed and farmed , weathering race riots and decades of second-class treatment until the law permitted their children and grandchildren to become citizens . like many sikhs , i grew up with deep roots in america and also fell in love with the heart of the sikh faith : devotion to one god , who requires us to uphold equality between women and men and all peoples , and perform seva , service to our community as an expression of our faith . our house of worship is called a gurdwara , where we recite and sing the poetry of our sacred scriptures.Ã‚ many sikhs wear five articles of faith , including kesh , long uncut hair that most men and some women wrap in a cloth turban . nearly every person who wears a turban in america is sikh . tragically , the turban meant to represent a commitment to service and justice has since marked sikh americans as targets in hate violence . our family , alongside sikh families who arrived in a wave of immigration after the 1960s , became american in law but not necessarily in the eyes of our neighbors . i was old enough to remember racial slurs and shattered windows after the iran hostage crisis , the first gulf war and the oklahoma city bombing . still , none of this could prepare me for 9/11 . in the hours and days after 9/11 , turbaned sikh americans became automatically suspect , perpetually foreign and potentially terrorist -- confused with muslims , and so immediate targets in anti-muslim violence . hate violence swept the country , and on september 15 , 2001 , a sikh man was gunned down in front of his gas station in mesa , arizona . my family knew balbir singh sodhi ; it felt as though an uncle had been murdered . but the killing was not broadcast widely on national news . a few days later , i grabbed my camera , left college and began a journey across america that would last a decade , capturing on film the stories of sikh americans profiled , beaten , stabbed , shot but persevering in faith and resilience . the fbi reported a 1,600 % increase in anti-muslim hate crimes in the year after 9/11 . over the last decade , i became part of a new generation of sikh americans who organized and became lawyers , artists , journalists and elected officials , in part to advocate on behalf of a community repeatedly swept up in waves of anti-muslim rhetoric , violence and racial profiling . in a poor economy and critical election season , we have recently watched ideologues use anti-muslim bias to turn a profit in dollars and votes . when discontents can easily access guns , many of us feared more hate violence . whether or not the shooting in a milwaukee suburb is a hate crime , the news has reverberated through every sikh american home . we saw our own gurdwara on the television screen ; we imagined our own aunts and uncles , brothers and sisters , caught in the gunfire . and we shared an all-too-familiar sense of helplessness , grief and the sadness of a community that has long struggled to live , work and worship peacefully in this country . but this time , something new happened : the whole nation paid attention . thousands of people posted messages of love and support in the face of unspeakable tragedy . they knew that the sikh community gathered to pray on a sunday morning just like millions in churches across the country . they knew that the terrible loss of life so recently after the shootings in aurora shocks the conscience and violates our deepest values . they knew that this is not a sikh tragedy but an american tragedy . today and in the days to come , i believe americans are hungry for the next step . we are ready to come together in a groundswell of healing , hope and renewed commitment to a world without violence . we are ready to come together in true national unity , we are ready to listen . there is a sikh gurdwara in nearly every city in america . come this sunday morning . listen and be with us . americans ' support -- every candle , every prayer -- will be felt by sikh americans across the country . together , we can all be sikhs ; we can all be americans -- and know what that means . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of valarie kaur .", "summary": " valarie kaur 's sikh grandfather faced discrimination when he came to u.s. 100 years ago .   sikhs could not be citizens then , she says , and have struggled to live as free americans .   kaur : turban shows commitment to god and service but marks sikhs for hate crimes .   kaur : americans are not ignoring violence against sikhs and are rallying in support .
