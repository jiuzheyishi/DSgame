{"text": "billionaire petro poroshenko declared victory sunday in ukraine 's presidential election , following preliminary exit polls that suggested he got 56 % of the vote . his closest challenger , former ukrainian prime minister and leader of the batkivshchyna party yulia tymoshenko , conceded the election after exit polls showed her with 13 % of the vote . poroshenko , a candy tycoon known as the  chocolate king ,  is also a seasoned politician . the election took place sunday despite a recent wave of deadly violence in the east and threats by pro-russia separatists to prevent citizens from casting their ballots . voters were picking a successor to ousted pro-moscow president viktor yanukovych in a country torn apart by russia 's takeover of ukraine 's crimea peninsula and bloody conflict with pro-russia factions . the unrest has centered in the donetsk and luhansk regions , where separatists have claimed independence following a disputed referendum earlier this month -- and many there did not get to cast ballots sunday . as of 3 p.m. -lrb- 8 a.m. et -rrb- , some 528 polling sites out of 2,430 were open in the donetsk region , the regional administration said . local officials said there was 11.8 % turnout at these polling stations . outside the country 's restive east , voting was progressing more normally . the central election commission put voter turnout at nearly 38 % as of 3 p.m. local time , not including the donetsk and luhansk regions , ukraine 's official ukrinform news agency reported . in the city of donetsk , the regional capital where pro-russia militias are concentrated , there were no open polling stations , local officials said earlier . a cnn team driving through the city sunday morning was not able to see a single polling station in operation . however , there were signs some voters were trying to go to polling stations in areas west and south of the city . besides the presidential race , candidates are also running in municipal elections in some cities . the organization for security and co-operation in europe deployed 900 observers for the election -- the largest such mission in its history . oleksandr turchynov , ukraine 's acting president , called the polls open and transparent .  the voting was free , without artificial restrictions and administrative pressure ,  turchynov said in a statement . u.s. president barack obama congratulated ukrainians for casting their ballots sunday and criticized russian-backed separatists , whom he accused of trying to block voting .  despite provocations and violence , millions of ukrainians went to the polls throughout the country , and even in parts of eastern ukraine , where russian-backed separatist groups sought to disenfranchise entire regions , some courageous ukrainians still were able to cast their ballots ,  he said in a written statement .  we commend the resolve of all those who participated , as well as the efforts of the ukrainian government to conduct these elections in the face of those threats .  intimidation in eastern ukraine appears widespread . increasing violence in the east has led the authorities in kiev to accuse russia , which they say is backing the armed separatists , of seeking to disrupt the vote . russia denies having direct influence over the militants , and russian president vladimir putin has said he will respect the ukrainians ' choice . amid heightened tensions , instances of intimidation in eastern ukraine appear widespread . a large separatist rally was held in a central donetsk city square around lunchtime . the protesters , who chanted pro-russia slogans as they were addressed by separatist leaders , were joined by a substantial number of militants on trucks , some firing guns into the air . on the back of some of the trucks were armed men who appeared to be chechen . two told a cnn team they were from the chechen capital , grozny , and one indicated that he was formerly a policemen in chechnya and was in donetsk to serve the russian federation . the men , who as chechens are russian citizens , said they were there as  volunteers .  but if their accounts were true , their presence in donetsk would appear to indicate some kind of acquiescence by the russian government at the least . residents of ukraine 's southeastern city of mariupol saw new billboards on the streets sunday urging them not to cast their ballots . the billboards were not at those locations the night before , residents said . also in mariupol , people talked on social media about being asked by local russia supporters to boycott the election . the city is one of several where deadly clashes have erupted in recent weeks . the self-declared mayor of rebel stronghold slovyansk , vyacheslav ponomaryov , has said that anyone who tries to vote there will be arrested . also , an italian journalist was killed saturday near the flashpoint town , the italian foreign ministry announced sunday . the man , named as andrea rocchelli , was killed along with a russian citizen , the ministry said . reports suggested there had been mortar fire in the slovyansk area . ukraine 's ` chocolate king ' aims for top job . opinion : free elections good for ukraine , but could be bad for putin . putin 's 48 hours in st. petersburg .", "summary": " obama accuses russian-backed separatists of trying  to disenfranchise entire regions    billionaire petro poroshenko leads in exit polls , declares himself the winner .   batkivshchyna party concedes defeat .   fewer than a quarter of polling stations were open in donetsk region , officials say .
