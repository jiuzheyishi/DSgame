after his court martial began . it is the first time gibbs has publicly presented his version of what happened with the platoon he led from the army 's 5th stryker brigade . he is the highest-ranking

served a tour in iraq , gibbs was on his second tour in afghanistan when he took over the brigade 's 3rd platoon . its previous leader lost a leg in a roadside bombing , an attack that gibbs said adversely affected his morale and others .  i should 've been on the truck that day ,  he testified friday . soldiers from his platoon testified during the court martial for gibbs -- who stands 6 feet , 4 inches tall and has told investigators that his six skull tattoos are to track his kills in iraq and afghanistan -- that he called afghans  savages ,  talked about how he killed civilians in iraq

against other soldiers as part of a plea deal with prosecutors . gibbs ' attorney said morlock and other soldiers who have testified against gibbs did so to save themselves from longer jail sentences

am embarrassed .  defense attorney phillip stackhouse showed a photo of gibbs and two other soldiers posing with the body of a different afghan man . gibbs has been charged with shooting that man in february 2010 in cold blood and planting an ak-47 near the body to make it look as if the man was an insurgent . morlock , who is also in the photo , testified previously that gibbs fired the weapon to make it look like they had come under attack first . on friday , gibbs maintained the man had fired on the three soldiers as they patrolled a village in kandahar province , insisting he shot back to protect himself and fellow soldiers .  he got the drop on me ,  gibbs testified .  he engaged me with two to three rounds  before the man 's weapon malfunctioned . the staff sergeant admitted to using shears to cut off this man 's finger after killing him , saying ,  that was the finger he tried to kill me with , i was pretty pissed off about it .  speaking in a calm , steady voice throughout his day-long testimony , the staff sergeant denied testimony from fellow soldiers that he goaded his men into targeting civilians and employed  off the books  weapons . he also denied murdering a third man -- the mullah of a village , who two fellow soldiers have testified gibbs killed with a grenade -- in march 2010 . yet gibbs acknowledged he cut off out one of that man 's fingers .  i compared it to keeping antlers off a deer ,  the staff sergeant testified , saying he agreed to let his soldiers take their own  trophies .   i did n't want to disappoint them . i did n't want to come across as a pussy , which i am not .  gibbs also admitted friday to taking part in the beating of pvt. justin stoner , who complained about other soldiers smoking hashish in his room . for good measure , gibbs said he showed stoner several dead men 's severed fingers and told him ,  better not to talk .  but stoner did talk , telling investigators that gibbs ' platoon had begun making up their own missions and selecting their own targets . military judge lt. col. kwasi hawks said the case -- to be decided by a five-person panel including three military officers and two enlisted personnel -- should be over by the end of next week . if convicted on all counts , gibbs could face a life sentence in military prison .  i am terrified ,  the staff sergeant said friday , when asked
