{"text": "the global surge in adhd diagnosis has more to do with marketing than medicine , according to experts . diagnosis rates and prescriptions of stimulant drugs are soaring compared with five years ago , but experts say adhd is ` more of an economic and cultural plague than a medical one ' . after examining the growth of adha in the uk , germany , france , italy and brazil , they concluded there are five trends which contribute to its growth . the global surge in adhd diagnosis and treatment with drugs has more to do with marketing than medicine , and in years to come we may regret treating children with drug , experts warn in a paper -lrb- file pic -rrb- . they blame the rise on lobbying from drug companies , who have spurred some countries to relax the restrictions put on stimulants like ritalin , the most well-known drug used to treat adhd . psychoanalytic treatment of the condition , usually with talking therapies , is slowly being eroded in favour of treating the problem with drugs , they said . more psychologists and psychiatrists are now adopting the american diagnostic and statistical manual -lrb- dsm -rrb- standards , which are broader and have a lower threshold for diagnosing adhd , they added . there has also been a rise in vocal advocacy and support groups for the condition , who often work closely with pharmaceutical companies to promote treatment with drugs . lastly , the rise in internet use makes finding information on the condition , and diagnosing oneself , easy . this prompts people to ask their doctor for drug treatment , they said . adhd is a group of behavioural symptoms that include inattentiveness , hyperactivity and impulsiveness . use of the extremely common adhd medication ritalin can cause dangerously long-lasting , unwanted erections with long-term use . the food and drug administration said it has updated its advice on ritalin to include a warning about priapism , a condition that can permanently damage a patient 's penis . the stimulant drug in ritalin , methylphenidate , is also found in the brand names daytrana and concerta -- an extended release version often prescribed to adutls -- among many others . the agency warned people to talk to their doctors before halting the drugs and said priapism has only occurred from use of methylphenidate in rare cases . it has come under much controversy in recent years , with some health professionals voicing concerns that diagnosing such a cluster of symptoms as one overarching disease means we are medicalising normal human behaviour . in the paper , researchers cited websites promoting adhd drugs , offering checklists with questions like ` do you fidget a lot ? ' , ` is it hard yfor you to concentrate ? ' , ` are you disorganised at work and home ? ' and ` do you start projects and then abandon them ? ' writing in the report , professor peter conrad , of brandeis university , u.s. said : ` these checklists turn all kinds of different behaviors into medical problems . ' ` the checklists do n't distinguish what is part of the human condition and what is a disease . ' the researchers said in the u.k. , diagnosis of adhd in school-age children grew from less than one percent in the 1990s to about five per cent today . in germany , prescription adhd drugs rose from 10 million daily doses in 1998 to 53 million in 2008 . growth in italy and france has been slower , in part due to those countries ' more restrictive pharmaceutical drug laws . however , researchers said even those nations are now becoming more lax . in brazil , a rising number of adhd advocacy groups , many with close ties to the pharmaceutical industry , are raising awareness of the disorder . professor conrad voiced concerns about the rise of prescription treatment for adhd , which he believes may be socially constructed . ` call it an economic and cultural plague , but not necessarily a medical one . ' psychoanalytic treatment of the condition , usually with talking therapies , is slowly being eroded in favour of treating the problem with drugs such as the stimulant ritalin , researchers said . ` there is no pharmacological magic bullet . no drug can account for non-medical factors that may contribute to behavior . a fidgety student may be responding to the one-size-fits-all compulsory education system , he said , not a flaw in his brain chemistry . adhd continues a long history of medicalising behaviors , especially in the u.s. , he added . one example he cited was masturbation , which was considered a disease a century ago . men and women diagnosed with masturbatory insanity were institutionalised or subjected to surgical treatment . ' i think we may look back on this time in 50 years and ask , what did we do to these kids ? ' professor conrad concluded . the paper was published in the journal social science and medicine .", "summary": " adhd is ` an economic and cultural plague than a medical one '   diagnosis and treatment rates are soaring compared to five years ago .   experts said five key trends have contributed to adhd growth .   pharmaceutical companies lobby for drug treatment for the condition .   support groups often work with pharmaceutical companies .   treatment of adhd with talking therapies has eroded in favour of drugs .   u.s. guidelines with low thresholds for adhd diagnosis has been adopted .   web use makes self-diagnosis easy and people pester doctor for drugs .
