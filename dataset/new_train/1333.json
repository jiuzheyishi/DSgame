{"text": "the ice bucket challenge may seem cool if you live in a place which is usually quite hot , but for those who dwell in a cold climate the idea is probably less impressive . like if you lived in chilly russia , for example , the sensation of tipping a bucket of ice water over your head is probably not dissimilar to leaving the house on a rainy day . so it 's perhaps no wonder that it 's a russian scientist who has staged the most spectacular spin yet of the ice bucket challenge -- using minus 195 degree celsius liquid nitrogen . cool cat : russian scientist anton sharypov grabs a bucket and pours liquid nitrogen over his head . survivor : mr sharypov before and after the challenge , which appears to have been staged outside his work . a spectacular video shows anton sharypov , 34 , a physicist from krasnoyarsk , krasnoyarsk krai , as he grabs the bucket and pours the bitterly cold liquid over his head . seconds earlier he had taken a branch with some leaves from a nearby tree and plunged into the liquid nitrogen , freezing it instantly so it could be crumbled into shards in his hands . yet when he pours the liquid nitrogen over his head , instead of freezing himself solid , he simply shakes his head and indicates yes , it is cold , but i 'm still here . the video first appeared on the youtube channel of dmitry shilov as part of a project called ` what happens if we try this ... ' mr sharypov said before the challenge : ' i am putting my faith in the laws of physics , biology and mathematics and i hope nothing will go wrong . ' just to make sure he is not frozen solid after taking the liquid bath , his friend pokes him to check he is still soft as the intrepid scientist laughs into the camera . you still human bro ? mr sharypov is poked by his friend to make sure he 's not turned to ice . ice cold : before enduring the challenge mr sharypov had shown the effect of the liquid nitrogen on a leaf by dipping it in for a few seconds then crumbling it between his hands . it 's possible for liquid nitrogen to pass on top of human flesh without freezing , because when it is poured onto the human body , something called the leidenfrost effect comes into play . this is a phenomenon in which a liquid produces a layer of insulating vapour that prevents the liquid coming into direct contact with a surface significantly hotter than the liquid 's boiling point . that is to say , because liquid nitrogen has such a low temperature , when it comes in contact with human skin , the temperature difference causes the leidenfrost effect and it simply skims off the surface of the body . similar effects can be seen when water is sprinkled onto a heated pan that is above the water 's leidenfrost point . the water skitters across the pan and takes longer to evaporate because of the layer of vapour forming around the liquid . however , if you were to keep your hand in liquid nitrogen and it cooled down to below the leidenfrost point , it would be subject to the harmful effects of liquid nitrogen as we know it .", "summary": " the bitterly cold liquid has a temperature of minus 195c .   but anton sharypov , 34 , is unafraid to pour a bucket of it over his head .
