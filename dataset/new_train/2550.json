{"text": "valentine 's day evokes a variety of expectations . some look forward to a romantic dinner or a special gift , while others treat it like any other day . whatever the case , how you approach this nationally recognized  holiday  reflects your expectations within your relationship , experts say .  it varies from couple to couple , but usually the way you feel about it is a metaphor for your expectations of the relationship ,  said family psychotherapist fran walfish . if someone 's more easygoing and has low expectations , it says something about his or her ability to be flexible and adaptable , she said . on the other hand , if a husband expects the wife to surprise him with dinner at a restaurant he 's secretly dying to go to , it shows that he sets the bar high in the relationship and expects her to deliver , walfish said . it does n't hurt to use valentine 's day as an opportunity to step up your game and show you care , but do n't let the relationship live or die based on this day alone , she said .  the affirmation and declaration of love is not in a gift or in one day . it 's a 365-day year experience of feeling like your partner has an interest and desire to know your wants and comfort level .  what couples do also tends to evolve depending on the stage of the relationship . cnn 's team of feature writers and producers solicited feedback from facebook and beyond on how folks plan to observe valentine 's day , if at all , with bonus information on nontraditional relationships . young love . for new couples , valentine 's day is a good opportunity to set the record straight as far as expectations , with an open , honest discussion , which could help determine whether the relationship 's going to work , walfish said . among our facebook friends , that means dinner or drinks at a place they 've been dying to try . a card , candy , or a thoughtful gift might be involved to let your partner know you 're serious . if valentine 's day occurs early in the relationship , the female tends to expect more from the guy , and he 's probably stressing out over the situation , said blaire allison ,  the love guru ,  who coaches people in matters of the heart .  when you 're first starting a relationship , there 's always that fear factor involved because the guy does n't want to disappoint the girl , but he but does n't want to do something over the top that 'll scare her off ,  allison said . the dinks -lrb- double-income , no kids -rrb- . married or not , this ai n't their first rodeo , and they tend to know what they want out of the evening . plus , having no kids means more time , money and flexibility to do whatever you want . to us , it kind of seems like the best situation for doing something for the holiday , as it elicited the most diverse responses . for some , it meant date night at carnegie hall or steak frites and a night in a hotel . a friend who 's a vegan chef is making a special meatless meal for her sweetie , complete with chocolate cookies with raspberry jam centers . eatocracy managing editor kat kinsman says she and her husband buy each other scotch or madiran wine , and he cooks the same meal every year : steak -lrb- the first year , it was heart-shaped -rrb- , pattypan squash , hen of the woods mushrooms . another constant :  there is never a restaurant involved .  when money is tight , a bouquet of flowers does the trick , one friend said , as they 're  cheaper than jewelry and healthier than chocolate .  speaking of thoughtful and unhealthy , one person who flew home from a conference in chicago brought a deep-dish pizza back to her significant other . married with children . children might change priorities in a relationship , but that makes valentine 's day the perfect opportunity for a couple to reclaim some time just for themselves , walfish said .  many people who 've been married for a long time can get lazy and stuck in a rut and do n't want to take the energy and initiative ,  she said .  if there 's no time to get away , after the children go to sleep , plan to be together and not in pajamas and take the time to make good eye contact and commit .  things are a bit different for one friend now that he and his wife have a toddler . but he still writes a poem for his wife and they make handmade gifts for each other . another friend and her husband have cut back on dinners out since the birth of their daughter and purchasing a new home , but they still exchange cards . the long haul . eventually , the children grow up and leave the nest , if all goes according to plan . for some , it 's an opportunity to reclaim life as a couple . dinner and flowers are generally a part of the celebration , with special enhancements when possible , said a relative who lives in europe . in recent years , the couple have spent weekends in barcelona , spain , and oxford , england . the husband bought a picture for his wife of two people walking in a park together that reminded him of them .  all the more special since i gave it to her on valentine 's day ,  he said .  still my favorite picture .  nontraditional relationships . not every relationship fits into one of those categories , but that does n't mean nontraditional lovers do n't want to celebrate their relationships just like the rest . take , for example , polyamorous  families ,  which consist of multiple romantic partners , from as few as three to north of 20 in some instances .  each of my partners is like those in any monogamous relationships ,  said shara smith , a representative of the polyamory media association , which provides members of the press with information and spokespeople on how polyamory works .  there 's really no difference between how i feel about my current partners or how we relate to each other . the only difference is i did n't have to break up with one to start the other .  smith , her three male partners and their additional  metamors  are going out for dinner at a nice steakhouse in tampa , florida . all told , there will be six of them around the table .  i do n't personally observe valentine 's day , but my partners ' other partners do ,  she said .  the holiday 's not important , but making my loved ones feel that i care about them is important .
