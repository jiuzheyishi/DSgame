{"text": "it is easy to be confused by the welter of headlines and selective excerpts that have been leaked from former defense secretary robert gates ' upcoming book  duty : memoirs of a secretary at war .  -lrb- i have not yet read the book . -rrb- . gates asserts president obama lacked conviction about his own decision to put more troops in harm 's way in afghanistan . as described in the bob woodward summary of the book in the washington post , gates writes that the commander-in-chief was  skeptical if not outright convinced it would fail .  he also condemns what he saw as  suspicion and distrust of senior military officers by senior white house officials -- including the president and the vice president .  in one meeting about afghanistan in particular , gates said that after listening to the president , he concluded ,  the president does n't trust his commander , ca n't stand karzai , does n't believe in his own strategy and does n't consider the war to be his .  he is particularly brutal about vice president joe biden , who gates asserts  poisoned the well  against u.s. military leaders , and who he says  has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades .  gates also does n't mince words about top officials like former national security adviser tom donilon or key obama adviser lt. gen. douglas lute . at the same time , gates commends obama 's intelligence and character , his decision to go after osama bin laden , and in his concluding chapter , according to the new york times account of the book , as far as the president 's overall afghanistan strategy he writes ,  i believe obama was right in each one of these decisions .  he also has strong praise for former secretary of state hillary clinton mixed in with his lengthy expressions of frustrations with others in the administration and in washington , notably the dysfunctional crowd on capitol hill . compounding the apparent dissonance within gates ' narrative , there is another conflict to reconcile . gates is a man known for bipartisanship , discretion and keeping his own counsel , and yet he is blasting a sitting president that he served , and revealing details of private and off-the-record exchanges without apparent regard for confidentiality , and in a manner that is sure to be politicized . it might be easy to dismiss his account -- as some , seeking to defend the president , already have done on twitter and in the blogosphere -- as so contradictory as to not be credible . but that would be a mistake . gates is one of the most distinguished , most widely respected national security public servants the u.s. has produced in half a century . in addition to running the pentagon for both obama and president george w. bush , he ran the cia and was deputy national security adviser . he is exceptionally intelligent , committed and few can rival his experience or perspective . no , the contradictions in gates ' comments do not invalidate them . rather , they illustrate important facts . in the first place , they reveal washington and policy making as they are : very little is clear cut , and personalities and politics play as big a role in key decisions as do any objective analysis of the merits of any decision . people -- including presidents and secretaries of defense -- can be contradictory bundles of good and bad qualities , advocates for decisions that are both right and wrong . but on a deeper level , gates ' narrative is conflicted because he is writing about issues , such as afghanistan , in which there were literally no good answers . perhaps , in the very first phases of our engagement there , there was a  best possible path .  we could have gone in , sought retribution for 9/11 , attacked and killed our attackers and then gotten out . the problem became our desire to reduce in a much more sweeping and lasting way the threat posed by al qaeda , the taliban , extremists and instability in the region . this led to a long-term commitment in a place where there were no long term  solutions  -- indeed , the threats posed by extremists are problems that can not be  solved ;  they can only be reduced and managed , never eradicated . but once we were into afghanistan for anything but retaliation , we ended up debating two deeply flawed alternatives . either we committed significant numbers of troops indefinitely -- which would be costly , politically unpopular and unlikely to succeed in doing anything but moving terrorists elsewhere . or we would pull out and the situation would return to the chaos the region , becoming once again a petri dish for terror . as it turned out , we will end up demonstrating at great cost that neither approach could work . gates and the military were right that only an extended military presence could control our enemies on the ground . biden and his allies were right that getting out sooner would have the same effect as getting out in the medium term . and both will soon see that in afghanistan -- as in iraq today and in our war on terror more broadly -- our costly investment and that of our brave troops will not change the region for the better . indeed , right now it looks as if afghanistan and iraq are likely to end up worse than we found them , and the sway of al qaeda and extremists more widespread and powerful . all this is because before gates and obama got into office , a fundamentally wrong decision was made by their immediate predecessors . we overreacted to 9/11 , seeking not justice but to change the world and a volatile region in ways that were beyond our capabilities . and the battles and tensions revealed among good men and women in the gates account and others being written of the recent past are the legacy of that watershed error . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of david rothkopf .", "summary": " david rothkopf : new book by ex-defense secretary gates criticizes obama , others .   reports : gates writes that obama lacked conviction on own afghanistan policies .   he says gates also says obama  right  on afghanistan strategy .   rothkopf : gates narrative reflects intractable problem of u.s. overreach in region .
