{"text": "the southwestern united states has fifty percent change of suffering a ` megadrought ' that lasts 35 years , scientists have warned . they say they are ` not optimistic ' of the chances of avoiding huge droughts . they say global warming has meant the chance of a decade long drought is at least 50 percent , and the chances of a ` megadrought ' -- one that lasts up to 35 years -- ranges from 20 to 50 percent over the next century . scroll down for video . ault said that the west and southwest must look for mitigation strategies to cope with looming long-drought scenarios . in computer models , while the southern portions of the western united states -lrb- california , arizona , new mexico -rrb- will likely face drought , the researchers show the chances for drought in the northwestern states -lrb- washington , montana , idaho -rrb- may decrease . beyond the united states , southern africa , australia and the amazon basin are also vulnerable to the possibility of a megadrought . the study by cornell , university of arizona and u.s. geological survey researchers will be published in a forthcoming issue of the american meteorological society 's journal of climate . ` for the southwestern u.s. , i 'm not optimistic about avoiding real megadroughts , ' said toby ault , cornell assistant professor of earth and atmospheric sciences and lead author of the paper . ` as we add greenhouse gases into the atmosphere -- and we have n't put the brakes on stopping this -- we are weighting the dice for megadrought . ' as of aug. 12 , most of california sits in a d4 ` exceptional drought , ' which is in the most severe category . oregon , arizona , new mexico , oklahoma and texas loiter in a substantially less severe d1 moderate drought . ault says climatologists do n't know whether the severe western and southwestern drought will continue , but ` with ongoing climate change , this is a glimpse of things to come . ` it 's a preview of our future , ' he said . while the 1930s dust bowl in the midwest lasted four to eight years , depending upon location , a megadrought can last more than three decades , which could lead to mass population migration on a scale never before seen in this country . ault said that the west and southwest must look for mitigation strategies to cope with looming long-drought scenarios . ` this will be worse than anything seen during the last 2,000 years and would pose unprecedented challenges to water resources in the region , ' he said . researchers warn the west and southwest must look for mitigation strategies to cope with looming long-drought scenarios . in computer models , while the southern portions of the western united states -lrb- california , arizona , new mexico -rrb- will likely face drought , the researchers show the chances for drought in the northwestern states -lrb- washington , montana , idaho -rrb- may decrease . prolonged droughts around the world have occurred throughout history . ault points to the recent ` big dry ' in australia and modern-era drought in sub-saharan africa . as evidenced by tree-ring studies , a megadrought occurred during the 1150s along the colorado river . lake mead drops to it 's lowest water level ever as a 14 year drought continues throughout the us . pictured is the hoover dam , once know as boulder dam which lies on the border of arizona and nevada . the dam is at it 's lowest level dropping more than 130 feet . in natural history , they occur every 400 to 600 years . but by adding the influence of growing greenhouse gas in the atmosphere , the drought models -- and their underlying statistics -- are now in a state of flux . beyond the united states , southern africa , australia and the amazon basin are also vulnerable to the possibility of a megadrought . with increases in temperatures , drought severity likely will worsen , ` implying that our results should be viewed as conservative , ' the study reports .", "summary": " southwestern united states has fifty percent change of suffering a ` megadrought ' that lasts 35 years .   say california drought is ' a preview of our future '   drought could be worst seen for 2,000 years .   could lead to mass population migration on a scale never before seen in this country .
