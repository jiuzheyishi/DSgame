{"text": "looking straight at the camera , nasa 's curiosity mars rover seems to be looking almost inquisitively at its own robotic arm in the latest self portrait from the red planet . the image in the latest of a series of self portraits from the red planet , and comes as curiosity has been taking its first sniff of the planet 's atmosphere . engineers say the analysis could lead to a new understanding of how mars lost much of its original atmosphere . scroll down for video . curiosity 's latest self portrait , taken by its robotic arm . learning what happened to the martian atmosphere will help scientists assess whether the planet ever was habitable . the present atmosphere of mars is 100 times thinner than earth 's . a set of instruments aboard the rover has ingested and analyzed samples of the atmosphere collected near the ` rocknest ' site in gale crater where the rover is stopped for research . findings from the sample analysis at mars -lrb- sam -rrb- instruments suggest that loss of a fraction of the atmosphere , has been a significant factor in the evolution of the planet . initial results show an increase of 5 percent in heavier isotopes of carbon in the atmospheric carbon dioxide compared to estimates of the isotopic ratios present when mars formed . scientists theorize that in mars ' distant past its environment may have been quite different , with persistent water and a thicker atmosphere . nasa 's mars atmosphere and volatile evolution , or maven , mission will investigate possible losses from the upper atmosphere when it arrives at mars in 2014 . with these initial sniffs of martian atmosphere , sam also made the most sensitive measurements ever to search for methane gas on mars . preliminary results reveal little to no methane . a lab demonstration of the measurement chamber inside the tunable laser spectrometer , an instrument that is part of the sample analysis at mars investigation on nasa 's curiosity rover . methane is of interest as a simple precursor chemical for life . on earth , it can be produced by either biological or non-biological processes . methane has been difficult to detect from earth or the current generation of mars orbiters because the gas exists on mars only in traces , if at all . the tunable laser spectrometer -lrb- tls -rrb- in curiosity 's sam instrument provides the first search conducted within the martian atmosphere for this molecule . the initial sam measurements place an upper limit of just a few parts methane per billion parts of martian atmosphere , by volume , with enough uncertainty that the amount could be zero . ` methane is clearly not an abundant gas at the gale crater site , if it is there at all . ` at this point in the mission we 're just excited to be searching for it , ' said sam tls lead chris webster of nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory -lrb- jpl -rrb- in pasadena , calif. . ' this graphic below shows pieces of the tunable laser spectrometer instrument , one of three instruments in the sample analysis at mars instrument suite on nasa 's curiosity rover . curiosity ` sniffs ' the martian atmosphere using a tunable laser . as seen in the top graphic , the tunable laser spectrometer has two infrared lasers whose light is invisible to the human eye . from the fore-optics chamber , they . shoot beams into a type of measurement chamber called a multi-pass . herriot cell -lrb- shown in yellow in the middle -rrb- . mars air is pumped into this cell and out again with a vacuum pump . a detector , seen on the left of the graphic in gray , picks up the way these lasers are absorbed by the martian air . by this method , scientists can . measure concentrations of methane , carbon dioxide and water vapor and . different isotopes of those gases . at the bottom left is a picture of a . lab demonstration of the measurement chamber with visible lasers so . scientists can see how they bounce between the mirrors in the chamber . at bottom right is the flight . hardware showing the lasers and the plate to which they are mounted . also visible are the collimators , which are lenses that direct the . lasers into the cell . while we determine upper limits on low values , atmospheric variability in the martian atmosphere could yet hold surprises for us . ' in curiosity 's first three months on mars , sam has analyzed atmosphere samples with two laboratory methods . one is a mass spectrometer investigating the full range of atmospheric gases . the other , tls , has focused on carbon dioxide and methane . during its two-year prime mission , the rover also will use an instrument called a gas chromatograph that separates and identifies gases . the instrument also will analyze samples of soil and rock , as well as more atmosphere samples . ` with these first atmospheric measurements we already can see the power of having a complex chemical laboratory like sam on the surface of mars , ' said sam principal investigator paul mahaffy of nasa 's goddard space flight center in greenbelt , md. . ` both atmospheric and solid sample analyzes are crucial for understanding mars ' habitability . ' sam is set to analyze its first solid sample in the coming weeks , beginning the search for organic compounds in the rocks and soils of gale crater . analyzing water-bearing minerals and searching for and analyzing carbonates are high priorities for upcoming sam solid sample analyzes . if the atmosphere of mars contains methane , various possibilities have been proposed for where the methane could come from and how it could disappear . potential non-biological sources for methane on mars include comets , degradation of interplanetary dust particles by ultraviolet light , and interaction between water and rock . a potential biological source would be microbes , if microbes have ever lived on mars . potential sinks for removing methane from the atmosphere are photochemistry in the atmosphere and loss of methane to the surface . this graphic shows how the martian atmosphere may have changed . the latest self portraits from mars were created from 55 individual photos - and interest in the rover is so great that one amateur astronomer beat nasa releasing them . the image , above , combines 55 photos taken . with the rover 's mahli camera , which sits outstretched on the end of . curiosity 's arm . the probe moved the camera to different positions in . each image so the arm is n't visible . curiosity 's latest self - portrait , stitched together by a space fan from raw images sent back by the rover . nasa 's higher resolution version of the image . amateur astronomer and science . writer stuart atkinson stitched together the raw images that curiosity . beamed back to earth on oct 31 , tweeting the picture and telling followers ` it 's just a sneaky peek in advance of the official image being released by the msl guys . ' however , he admitted the best is yet to come - so far , the rover has only sent back the . smaller , thumbnail versions of these images , with the full-sized ones . arriving in the coming days . nasatoday released the high-res version . the space agency has been making every image from curiosity available to the public on a special web site , giving space fans an amazing insight into exactly what the rover is doing every day . a selection of the ` raw ' images that make up the self portrait . the rover has sent back several self portraits so far . engineers have been using the to check the rover 's systems are operational . they are also used to check its parts and moving correctly with barcodes on the rover that can be analysed to check it is the exact shape it should be . curiosity 's last self portrait was a black and white landscape shot . this image shows a ` bite mark ' where nasa 's curiosity rover scooped up some martian soil . the historic first scoop sample was taken from the ` rocknest ' patch of dust and sand on oct. 7 , 2012 , the 61st sol , or martian day , of operations . the ` giant scoop for mankind ' image released by nasa . a third scoop sample was collected on . oct. 15 , or sol 69 , and deposited into the chemistry and mineralogy . -lrb- chemin -rrb- instrument on oct. 17 , or sol 71 . this image was taken by curiosity 's mast . camera . scientists enhanced the color in this version to show the . martian scene as it would appear under lighting conditions on earth , . which helps in analyzing the terrain . during the two-year prime mission of the . mars science laboratory project , researchers are using curiosity 's 10 . instruments to investigate whether areas in gale crater ever offered . environmental conditions favorable for microbial life .", "summary": " nasa reveals amazing new high resolution self portrait - although was beaten to it by online space fans .   engineers also reveal the results of curiosity 's first sniff of martian air - and find little or no trace of methane .
