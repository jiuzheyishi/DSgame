{"text": "it 's not unusual for a british couple to escape the rat race by moving to france - but how about going back 75 years in time as well ? barry and caroline selwood have sunk every penny they have into creating their own shrine to the decades either side of the second world war . but it does n't end there , because the self-confessed eccentrics live as if it 's the summer of 1939 , complete with period clothes , furniture and a car all from the era . vintage style : caroline and barry drive a cream sunbeam talbot ten in celebration of a bygone era . unique time capsule : the couple have re-built a dilapidated riverside hotel in south west france . as it was : la belle epoque hotel in south west france as it first looked . blast from the past : barry and caroline , pictured in france , both enjoy dressing in vintage clothes . perfect spot : the hotel had been abandoned back in the 1950 's in the beautiful village of nanteuil-en-vallee . ' i guess they think we 're just that crazy english couple who run the hotel . ' it all started in 2002 when stationery salesman barry decided his life was going nowhere . he sold his home in stevenage , hertforshire , and headed for france where he 'd worked on yachts on the cote d'azur as a young man . he bought a tumble down farmhouse and set to work , but just a few months later on a trip back to england he met and fell for caroline from wokingham , berkshire . barry said : ` i 'd decided to give up on the rat race , i had a comfortable life as a salesman , but i wanted something different . ' i was working on my farmhouse which i loved , but i loved caroline too . luckily she made it easy for me and wanted to be with me in france . ' the couple found they both shared a passion for all things vintage . and , after a six-month-long distance relationship , caroline gave up working as a nanny in london and moved to france . they married five years ago . stepping back in time : the pair visited vintage events to find authentic items to decorate the hotel . ` we never really thought about how we 'd manage , ' caroline said . ` we were young , carefree and in love and had a new and exciting life ahead of us . ` the couple took seven to complete the renovation on the farmhouse . they knew their future lay in france and they loved their life in their home complete with swimming pool , but something was missing . ` we needed to find a property we could make into a business so we could support ourselves and live a sustainable life , ' said caroline . then four years ago they saw a dilapidated hotel which had been abandoned back in the 1950 's in the beautiful village of nanteuil-en-vallee in the charente . caroline said : ` it was love at first sight . it had been stood empty for four years and was derelict and forlorn . ` there were holes in the roof , water had been getting in for years and had taken a heavy toll . pretty unique : ` there is n't anything like it in the uk where vintage living is more popular ' , says caroline . ` we quickly realised we 'd spent a large amount of our savings on a pile of rotten timber , collapsed ceilings and mouldy walls ! ` and it soon became apparent the renovation budget we 'd scribbled down over a couple of bottles of wine was total fantasy . ' work started and for the first couple of years the couple felt like they were ` chipping away at a mountain with a toffee hammer ' . things ground to a halt when barry was installing a new staircase and he fell , shattering his arm , breaking his nose and a rib . despite the setback things eventually took shape and the pair knew what the hotel 's theme would be . they 'd visited vintage events in the uk whenever they could and had been hoarding items . ` but france was a fantastic hunting ground for furniture and paraphernalia , as were local brocantes , ' said barry . ` we trawled ebay for bits and pieces , some of which were perfect and some we got after auctions that ended at midnight . it became madness ! ' adding to the experience : the couple have just opened a tea room - and thankfully the bookings are coming in . blowing the budget : ` we really did n't want to compromise . we wanted the house to appear how it would to people staying here 80 years or so ago ' , says caroline . caroline added : ` we really did n't want to compromise . we wanted the house to appear how it would to people staying here 80 years or so ago . ` we found it really satisfying to put a piece of furniture bought a couple of years before in the place we 'd imagined it would go once we had finished the renovation . ` now it 's pretty unique thing in france and there is n't anything like it in the uk where vintage living is more popular . ' to help the business they 've just opened a tea room too , to add to the whole experience . and thankfully the bookings are coming in . ` if we could go back in time , would we do the same again ? absolutely yes ! ' said caroline . ` if we knew how much it would cost , then  no !  we 'd never have started . ` but our advice to anyone in similar circumstances is  go for it !  and if you happen to be installing a new staircase make sure it 's properly secured before you venture up it !
