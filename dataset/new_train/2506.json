{"text": "next to beyonce , the musical surprise of the 2013 holiday shopping season so far is the limited itunes release of  the beatles bootleg recordings 1963 .  it 's a potential gold-mine excavation : fifty-nine previously obscure tracks , unknown outside the subculture of obsessive collectors . over on the bookshelves , the recently published first volume of biographer mark lewisohn 's three-part  the beatles : all these years  takes up considerable space . titled  tune in ,  the first book offers 944 pages on the iconic group , concluding in 1962 -- before they were famous . beyond serving as baby boomer stocking stuffers , do these kinds of archaeological digs enhance the beatles ' legacy ? or is pop-culture nostalgia starting to scrape the bottom of the barrel ? never officially released and mostly known to hard-core collectors , the actual music on the  bootleg recordings  consists of outtakes , live versions and two demos of songs the beatles wrote for other artists . the motivation for its release is complex , extending beyond immediate sales considerations . due to a recent european union ruling , the copyright to this material would expire in 2014 if it remained unreleased . so the sudden appearance of  bootleg  on the marketplace may in part be a legal ploy for apple records , the company the beatles began in 1968 . but is there a sizable -- even insatiable -- audience for every bit of the scraps and marginalia of beatlemania ? overall , the numbers are somewhat surprising . turns out the fab four are still doing major business . in fact , recent profits suggest their customers ca n't only be co-members of the boomers ' aging demographic . according to forbes magazine , the two surviving members and the estates of john lennon and george harrison together and individually earned roughly $ 71 million in 2013 from record sales , royalties , merchandise and licensing . earlier this year , the uk trade publication music week reported the beatles ' apple corp. turned over 43.5 million pounds in 2013 , an improvement of 2 million pounds over 2012 . while archival releases are only drops in this plentiful bucket , the long-defunct group 's persistent popularity serves as a lifeboat for the perpetually struggling music retail business . the  bootleg recordings  -lrb- and  tune in  -rrb- could put beatlemaniacs ' devotion to the test , however . ten years in the research and writing , lewisohn 's doorstop tome has been hailed as a labor of love -- and digression . the author 's minute attention to detail matches the microscopic focus of  the beatles bootleg recordings ,  where the only arguable revelations are at best minor finds : lennon 's roughly sung demo tracks of two songs ,  bad to me  and  i 'm in love ,  later recorded by , respectively , billy j. kramer and the merseybeats . it 's hard to imagine the retrieved versions replacing the originals in anyone 's affections , but casual fans should be entranced by the behind-the curtains glimpses into the early beatles working process . even without producer george martin 's finishing polish , the group 's signature high energy and unstoppable melodies come through loud and clear . and in the absence of true surprises , there are plenty of eyebrow-raising moments such as two spunky versions of  one after 909  -lrb- eventually rerecorded on the  let it be  album -rrb- . apple records may be protecting the beatles brand by releasing these curios and preventing further substandard bootleg releases , but even fans may question the wisdom of serving up every leftover and prototype . even from geniuses . on the other hand , the latest -lrb- volume 10 -rrb- entry in bob dylan 's  bootleg series  came out this year to near-universal acclaim .  another self portrait -lrb- 1968-1970 -rrb-  retrieves obscurities and alternate versions from one of dylan 's most difficult periods . a bit of thoughtful pruning makes this unearthed archival treasure something more than another clearance sale . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of mark coleman .", "summary": " mark coleman :  bootleg ,  a release of obscure beatles tracks , is a holiday surprise .   he says group still earns millions and release may be tied to extending copyright .   with new 944-page book , too , he asks if beatlemania is scraping dregs of barrel ?   coleman : some leftovers can be appetizing such as dylan 's recent  bootleg series  release .
