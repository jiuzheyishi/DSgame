{"text": "manuel pellegrini has set the stage for today 's title showdown between chelsea and manchester city by telling diego costa to clean up his act , and rejecting claims from jose mourinho that there is a campaign against the barclays premier league leaders . chelsea , who were last night tying up the # 26.8 million signing of juan cuadrado from fiorentina , will be without costa at stamford bridge after he was given a three-game ban for stamping on liverpool 's emre can in the capital one cup semi-final . and pellegrini said : ` i know of diego costa from spain . his character is not an easy character . ' the chilean believes the striker has to curb his aggressive streak . ` i hope that this punishment will be a good thing for him to change in the future , ' he added . costa has been in excellent form this season , leading the premier league scoring charts with 17 goals . manchester city boss manuel pellegrini has urged chelsea forward diego costa to learn from his mistake . liverpool players react after costa stamps on emre can -lrb- number 23 -rrb- during the league cup semi-final . ` he does n't need to do it in that way because he is a very good player . but i am sure chelsea will not lose their next three games just because he is n't playing . big teams can not depend on just one player . asked if costa 's ban cancelled out yaya toure 's absence on duty at the africa cup of nations , pellegrini added : ` i do n't think it helps anything . i think that diego costa is an important player for chelsea and yaya is a very important player for us . but i do n't think they decide that both teams depend on just those players . ` so i think it is a very important miss for both teams but chelsea have other players to replace him . ` yaya is a very important player for us but i was not decided that , if he was eliminated from the africa cup , he would come and play here two days afterwards because i do not think it is the correct way to do it . we played without yaya in rome and qualified in the champions league and against bayern munich , so it is up to other players to demonstrate what they can do . ' costa 's ban means the striker will not feature in the blues ' potential title-decider with manchester city . champions city will fall eight points behind chelsea if they lose today but pellegrini refused to be drawn on his rivalry with mourinho . he refused to shake hands with mourinho over his antics when fernando torres scored a late winner in the corresponding fixture last season , and compared chelsea to stoke after their defensive tactics earned a 1-1 draw at the etihad in september . ` i wo n't talk about what mourinho might do , ' said pellegrini . ` i will shake hands with him before the game . and after ? yes , probably . ` it was a mistake to compare chelsea with stoke . chelsea can play in the way they want and we are going to continue playing in the style i think is best for this team . ' manchester city midfielder yaya toure -lrb- left -rrb- is currently on international duty at the africa cup of nations . pellegrini also dismissed mourinho 's claims that there is a ` campaign ' against chelsea within the premier league which is influencing referees ' decisions against the leaders . ` i hope that in the premier league they do n't have a campaign against anyone , ' he said . ` i hope the referee makes mistakes for all the teams exactly the same , that the fa make the fixtures in a fair way and the punishments . ` it is the best league in the world and i do n't think it has any strange things . because -lrb- if that is the case -rrb- then you are not competing -lrb- fairly -rrb- . after that , if you win the title , it 's not an important title , because it is all arranged . ' manchester city midfielder frank lampard spent 13 years as a chelsea player , winning three league titles . pellegrini , who revealed that samir nasri and eliaquim mangala are injury doubts , believes that frank lampard will be given a good reception on his return to stamford bridge where she spent 13 years as a player , whether the former england midfielder would celebrate a goal against his old club or not . he added : ` first i prefer him to score the goal . after that we will see if he celebrates or if he does n't celebrate . if he scores , i celebrate . ` i am sure that frank lampard will receive the best reception from their fans that they can do . he is a top player . he is maybe the most important in their history . he gave so many things to that club . if he could n't continue playing there , he can play here . that is not his fault . i am sure the fans will repeat the reception they gave here to frank in the first game . ' meanwhile , cuadrado will fly in from italy on chelsea owner roman abramovich 's private jet on saturday to complete his move to stamford bridge , with mohamed salah set to move in the other direction on loan . fiorentina coach vincenzo montella confirmed on friday a deal for the colombia winger had been agreed , saying : ` it was a sale that had to be done . i 'm happy for him because he is going to a big club . ' the clash between jose mourinho and manuel pellegrini 's sides could potentially decide the league title .", "summary": " manuel pellegrini says diego costa must accept his three-game ban .   costa was punished retrospectively for a stamp on liverpool 's emre can .   the striker has been one of chelsea 's key players this season .   he will miss the premier league clash with manchester city on saturday .
