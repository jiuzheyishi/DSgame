' he added that the claim by downing street that european courts would not be able to force religious groups into conducting same sex weddings ` carries little credibility with those of us who have watched similar assurances trounced in the past ' . dr fox also issued a coded criticism of mr cameron for pushing the reforms as a way of winning back floating voters . ` what makes the position worse is the way that the legislation increasingly looks as though it was made on the hoof to deal with the political problem du jour , ' he wrote . dr fox , who quit the cabinet in october 2011 over his close friendship with lobbyist adam werritty , delivered his warning in a letter to constituents who have inquired about his views on gay marriage . he said that as a medical doctor he believes that ` same sex relationships are a variant of the spectrum of human sexual behaviour ' and should be treated ` with tolerance and respect ' . however , he denounced proposals to ` change the definition of marriage for all ' , claiming that there is no ` clamour ' for the change from homosexuals . he also said plans to allow gay marriage in some religious denominations while exempting the church of england were ` anomalous and absurd ' . ` the idea of making certain practices illegal for one christian church , but not others , risks further weakening and splintering britain 's traditional religion at a time when many christians feel that they are under threat on a number of secular , political and cultural fronts , ' he continued . ` to fail to understand this is to risk an affront to a large stabilising and normally acquiescent section of this country which will sow completely unnecessary seeds of dissent . ' dr fox also issued a coded criticism of mr cameron for pushing the reforms as a way of winning back floating voters . dr fox rejected the charge levelled at mr cameron by some tories that he has deliberately pursued gay marriage to antagonise the right of the party as ` far-fetched ' , but concluded : ` i believe these proposals are divisive , ill-thought-through and constitutionally wrong . ` that is why i will vote against them in the house of commons . ' dr fox 's letter emerged as energy minister john hayes , who has also said he will vote against gay marriage , used a magazine interview to press his case . he told westminster publication the house that the best way to raise children is within a traditional union . ` the relationship between my parents and -lsb- the one -rsb- i have had with my parents was built around a long-term , secure set of commitments , bonds , ' he said . ` and it 's that secure environment which gives children the best chance of prospering . ' he added : ` society has a duty to create the circumstances in which those civil institutions can flourish . ' a spokesman for mr cameron said : ` the prime minister is a strong advocate of gay marriage and this does n't change everything . we 're going to press ahead with it as planned .
