{"text": "fisherman in siberia claim to have found the remains of a 150 million-year-old dinosaur or reptile in a river . their boat supposedly bumped into the head of the crocodile-like rock , which was apparently confirmed by scientists to be an ancient lizard or even a dinosaur . others are not convinced , however , with several professors telling mailonline it looks too good to be true and may be a hoax . scroll down for video . fisherman in siberia claim to have found remarkably intact remains of an ancient lizard -lrb- shown -rrb- . they supposedly found the crocodile-like head while on a fishing trip . and when they sent photos to experts they were told it was likely a lizard or dinosaur from 150 million years ago . the discovery was made by fisherman from the wild north fishing club were travelling by boat down the ruta-ru river in the yamal peninsula of northern russia . their boat struck something that they initially thought was a boulder , but on closer examination had a somewhat more familiar appearance . paleontologists are now heading to the river in siberia to verify the potentially significant discovery . club chairman yevgeny svitov said : ` it was hard to miss , because the boat driven by my colleague oleg yushkov had bumped against it . when he looked to see what it was he found this huge head . ' several theories have been put forward for what this crocodile-like rock might be . so far experts have suggested the rock is about 150 million years old . the fisherman originally said that moscow scientists informed them it was a mesosaur , but if the age is correct that would be impossible , as mesosaurs lived from 299 to 270 million years ago . according to komsomolskaya pravda it may have been a marine reptile called dakosaurus-maximus , which lived 161 to 100 million years ago , although more proof will be needed . other experts speaking to komsomolskaya pravda agreed that it was likely a sea lizard rather than a dinosaur . however , speaking to mailonline several professors and experts in paleontology have expressed their skepticism that the find is genuine , and say it might be a hoax . dr mark evans , curator of natural sciences at leicester arts and museums service said : ` in this case it does look suspicious , especially in the way it 's poking out of the river bed . ` it 's strange that it 's so much larger than the surrounding cobbles , which would suggest that it has n't been transported by the river . ` if it is in its original position , then it should have been eroded away to a greater extent by the cobbles . it is also hard to judge the size of it . it does look rather as if somebody has planted it there . ` although there is an overall impression of a skull with distinct tooth sockets , some of which have teeth in them , there would seem to be too many tooth positions for it to be dakosaurus , but that is assuming it is real , and at the moment that is far from certain . ' he said that they photographed it and when they got back they emailed the picture to the zoological museum of the institute of plant and animal ecology in the city of yekaterinburg , russia . their scientists came back to them to say that they believed it was the fossilised remains of a lizard that had lived about 150 million years ago , reports the siberian times . the institute 's head pavel kosintsev said that it was not the first report of fossil discoveries in the region but it was the first photographic evidence that the rumours were ` true ' . he said all the indications were that there is possibly a wealth of similar fossils in the area . ` we have dispatched an expedition there to investigate the remains and secure them for future study , ' he said . ` at this stage though it 's difficult to be precise about exactly what the find shows . ' the institute is confident that the remains have significant scientific value and they are hoping to recover them before the spring thaw washes them away . however , speaking to mailonline other experts expressed their scepticism that the find was real . ` if it looks too good to be true , it almost certainly is n't , ' dr tim palmer of the paleontological association tells mailonline . ` if it was genuine , old and reworked then it would n't be in the apparently good condition that the picture tries to suggest . especially in the pebbly and erosive bed of a river . ` my personal opinion is that someone has buried a stuffed crocodile - or even a large model - in a river bed in order to make some sort of mischief . ' and dr ivan sansom , senior lecture in palaeobiology at birmingham university , agrees : ` finding a fossil skull in the bid of a river is entirely feasible , but it would be a very lucky find to uncover a specimen as intact as illustrated , ' he says . the discovery was made by fisherman from the wild north fishing club were travelling by boat down the ruta-ru river in the yamal peninsula of northern russia -lrb- shown -rrb- . their boat struck something that they initially thought was a boulder , but on closer examination had a somewhat more familiar appearance . if true the find may have been a marine reptile called dakosaurus-maximus -lrb- illustration shown -rrb- . however speaking to mailonline several professors expressed scepticism that the find was real and say it may be a hoax , with one saying it was ` too good to be true ' dr richard butler of the school of geography , earth and environmental sciences at birmingham university says : ` without seeing an image of the specimen when it is not almost entirely covered with water it is impossible for me to determine if it is indeed a fossil - it may well turn out simply to be an odd shaped rock . ` what look very superficially like teeth could easily be plants growing on the rock for example ! ` at this stage i don ยน t think we can say anything about this and its potential scientific significance . i am skeptical as to whether it is even be a fossil . ' and professor of vertebrate palaeontology mike benton from bristol university was particularly skeptical of the veracity of the find . ` well , what can i say . it 's a fake , ' he claims . ` it looks a bit like the snout of a crocodile , maybe stuffed , maybe carved in wood , maybe fossil , set up in the pebbles on the bottom of the river and photographed as a student-style prank . ' meanwhile professor david martill , a reader in palaeobiology from the school of earth and environmental sciences at the university of portsmouth says : ` the picture of the skull is unclear because of the water running over it , but first impressions suggest it is something with a long snout and pointed teeth . thus a carnivore . it could be a bear . ` however , there is the possibility that it is is a much older fossil . ` siberia is rich in cretaceous strata which might contain any number of fossils reptiles from marine mosasaurs -lsb- a type of extinct marine reptile -rsb- to terrestrial dinosaurs . but he adds : ` why on earth the guys did n't haul it out of the water to get a better view is beyond me . perhaps it is a hoax .
