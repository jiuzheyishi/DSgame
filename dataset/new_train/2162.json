{"text": "for more than 20 years , actress christina applegate has kept audiences laughing .  it does n't feel the same , and it 's hard to carry your purse ,  christina applegate says .  i cry at least once a day .  during her teenage years , she lit up the small screen as kelly bundy on the hit sitcom  married with children .  after 11 hilarious seasons , christina 's career branched out to the big screen and broadway . in 2007 , christina landed the starring role on  samantha who ?  an acclaimed comedy series . after receiving emmy and golden globe nominations for her performance , it seemed that nothing could stop christina 's triumphant return to tv . then , in april 2008 , shocking news silenced the laughter . at 36 years old , christina was diagnosed with breast cancer . at first , christina says she lived quietly with the disease .  it 's hard to live quietly ,  she says .  i went through five weeks of work without telling anyone that this was going on in my life .  now , christina is going public with her personal battle to raise awareness among young women who may not think they 're at risk . as the daughter of a breast cancer survivor , christina says she 's been vigilant about getting regular mammograms since she was 30 years old . in 2007 , doctors recommended extra precautions .  my doctor said that the mammograms were n't enough for me because of the denseness of my breasts ,  she says .  he suggested that i get an mri .  christina went in for her first mri screening , which produced disturbing results .  they found some funky things going on -lsb- in one breast -rsb- ,  she says . doctors told her they needed to perform a biopsy . then , the excruciating waiting game began . christina continued to work and promote her sitcom , but the impending results were never far from her mind . a week later she says she got the phone call every woman dreads .  -lsb- the doctor said -rsb- , ` it came back positive , '  she says .  right now i 'm sitting here shaking remembering that moment .  doctors explained that the cancer was only in her left breast , and thankfully , they caught it at an early stage . christina says she held back her tears and immediately went into survival mode . the day after her diagnosis , christina says she went in to see an oncologist and a surgeon .  i 'm a sagittarius ,  she says .  we need things done now . so , for me , i had to get in now , and i wanted to have my surgery now .  within a week , christina had her first lumpectomy . doctors also did a biopsy of her lymph nodes to make sure the cancer had n't spread . since the cancer was caught early on , christina was told she 'd need six weeks of radiation instead of chemotherapy . then , she received more life-changing news . a test for the brca gene -- also known as the  breast cancer gene  -- came back positive . oprah.com : should you get tested for the gene ?  that sort of changed everything for me ,  she says .  radiation was something temporary , and it was n't addressing the issue of this coming back or the chance of it coming back in my left breast . i sort of had to kind of weigh all my options at that point .  christina was given two options ... go forward with the radiation treatments and continue testing for the rest of her life or have both breasts removed . christina made the dramatic decision to have a bilateral mastectomy .  it came on really fast . it was one of those things that i woke up and it felt so right ,  she says .  it just seemed like , ' i do n't want to have to deal with this again . i do n't want to keep putting that stuff in my body . i just want to be done with this . ' & i was just going to let them go .  before she went in for her surgery , christina says she staged her first -- and last -- nude photo shoot .  i made sure that i have close-up photographs of them from every angle so i can kind of remember them ,  she says . christina 's tears finally spilled over the day she met her surgeon .  i met with my doctor , and i told him that was my decision ,  she says .  he brought the surgeon in , and it was like it was the floodgates just opened up and i lost it .  oprah.com : going through a double mastectomy surgery . in july 2008 , christina went through with the surgery , which has left physical and emotional scars .  it can be very painful ,  she says .  it 's also a part of you that 's gone , so you go through a grieving process and a mourning process .  before she went under the knife , christina says the only mastectomy she 'd ever seen was the one her mother received .  -lsb- her surgery -rsb- was in the '70s , and they did n't do a very good job back then ,  she says .  so in my own mind i 'm thinking , ` my god , i 'm going to be butchered , and it 's going to be horrible . i 'm never going to love that part of me again . ' & but i did a lot of research , and they can make some pretty boobies .  currently , christina says she has saline expanders in her body , which will make way for the new implants . though she 's proud of her proactive decision , she says she 's reminded of her loss every day .  it does n't feel the same , and it 's hard to carry your purse ,  she says .  i cry at least once a day about it because it 's hard to overlook it when you 're standing there in the mirror . when you look down , it 's the first thing you see ... so you 're reminded constantly of this thing -- this cancer thing that you had .  on the bright side , christina says she wo n't have to wear a bra ever again . she also feels victorious in the fight against breast cancer .  i have taken a very progressive stance in the rest of my life ,  she says .  for that , i 'm really grateful .  days after her diagnosis , christina says she reached out to family and friends , including melissa etheridge , a grammy winner and breast cancer survivor . melissa shared the lessons she learned during the fight for her own life .  the first thing she said to me is : ` christina , this is a blessing that 's happened to you in your life . right now , you get to start over , and right now you get to change everything -- the way that you deal with things in life , the way that you react to things . fear can hurt you . stress can hurt you . this is the time that you have this opportunity to change the way you eat ... everything you do , '  christina says . christina now looks at her health scare as a blessing .  i am a 36-year-old person with breast cancer , and not many people know that that happens to women my age or women in their 20s ,  she says .  this is my opportunity now to go out and fight as hard as i can for early detection .  as she 's learned , early detection may not come from a mammogram . christina says she will fight for women to have access to mris and genetic testing , which many insurance companies wo n't pay for . christina says her health scare has shifted her priorities completely .  -lsb- there 's -rsb- this need and this desire to make every single day count ,  she says .  i used to say ... ` do n't sweat the small stuff -- not even the big stuff . ' at the end of the day , none of it matters but your own joy , your own spiritual journey that you go on , god , your loved ones , your friends , your animals . these are the things you 've got to cherish and love and embrace .  from  the oprah winfrey show   christina applegate : why she had a double mastectomy  © 2008 . subscribe to o , the oprah magazine for up to 75 % off the newsstand price . that 's like getting 18 issues free . subscribe now ! tm & © 2009 harpo productions , inc. . all rights reserved .", "summary": " christina applegate opens up about her decision to remove both breasts .   applegate stars in comedy series  samantha who ?    actress ' test results for brca gene --  breast cancer gene  -- were positive .    i have taken a very progressive stance in the rest of my life ,  she says .
