{"text": "james ford seale , a reputed former member of the ku klux klan convicted in the 1964 abduction and killings of two african-american teenagers in mississippi , has died in federal prison , the federal bureau of prisons said . he was 75 . seale died on tuesday in the federal correctional institution at terre haute , indiana , said bureau spokesman chris burke , but he did not provide further details . a jury in 2007 convicted seale , a former sheriff 's deputy , of kidnapping and conspiracy to commit kidnapping in the disappearances of charles eddie moore and henry hezekiah dee , both 19 . the bodies of both youths were found in a backwater area of the mississippi river . seale was serving three life sentences . seale was not tried for murder , but prosecutors alleged he and fellow klansmen conspired to abduct , beat and murder dee and moore in may 1964 . an indictment accused seale and his cohorts of picking up the two men hitchhiking and driving them into the homochitto national forest in southwest mississippi 's franklin county , where the teenagers were beaten and interrogated at gunpoint . dee and moore were then bound with duct tape , and weighted down by an engine block and a railroad rail , authorities said . the fbi alleged the two were still alive when they were thrown into the old mississippi river , where they drowned . their decomposed bodies were found two months later during a search for three other missing civil rights workers -- a case that would later be known as the mississippi burning case . the slayings were officially unsolved until seale was indicted in 2007 , although he had been long suspected in the case . he and another man were arrested in 1964 , but released on bond and never tried . the fbi turned the case over to local authorities , and the investigation was dropped after a justice of the peace said witnesses had refused to testify . the case was revived in 2007 after moore 's brother , thomas moore , discovered seale was still alive while visiting franklin county , where he was helping research the case for a canadian broadcasting corporation documentary . moore told cnn in january 2007 that he then gave the u.s. attorney for the southern district of mississippi the fbi files on the case , which he had obtained from a reporter . u.s. attorney dunn lampton helped form a task force that led to seale 's indictment . seale was the first and only person convicted in the moore and dee case , the justice department has said . seale 's conviction was overturned , then reinstated , by federal appeals courts amid a legal battle over whether the statue of limitations had expired for his crimes . the battle wound up at the u.s. supreme court , which in november 2009 let stand a lower court ruling that the statute of limitations had not expired . in his appeal , seale claimed the statute of limitations expired five years after the crime . the confusion arose out of the fact that kidnapping could be considered a capital offense in 1964 and had no time limit for prosecution . in 1968 , the high court eliminated the federal death penalty for that crime , and congress changed the law to reflect that ruling four years later . but lawmakers in 1994 reinstated kidnapping as being death penalty eligible . cnn 's dave alsup and bill mears contributed to this report .", "summary": " james ford seale was convicted in 2007 in the 1964 kidnappings .   the bodies of the two abducted teenagers were found in the mississippi river .   seale 's conviction was overturned , then reinstated .   he was serving three life sentences .
