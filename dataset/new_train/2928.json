{"text": "the turkish and egyptian governments engaged in a round of tit-for-tat diplomacy saturday , with egypt first expelling ankara 's ambassador and turkey reciprocating . cairo blamed its decision to declare turkish ambassador huseyin avni botsali  persona non grata  -- or unwelcome -- on ankara 's interference in its domestic affairs , turkey 's anadolu agency news outlet said . turkey accused egypt of not respecting  the will of the people ,  downgraded its diplomatic relationship with cairo , and declared its ambassador unwelcome . cairo had lowered its diplomatic representation in turkey to the level of charge d'affaires and withdrew its ambassador in august . the diplomatic spat is the latest sign of a worsening relationship between the two nations and one that an analyst said vividly illustrated turkey 's  growing isolation in the middle east .  the relationship between the countries went sour after the egyptian military in july ousted president mohamed morsy and his government . morsy , a muslim brotherhood leader , had close ties with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and his justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- . after it toppled morsy , egypt banned the brotherhood 's activities and froze its finances . erdogan -- who was accorded a hero 's welcome when he visited post-revolution cairo in late 2011 -- has spoken out strongly against egypt 's post-morsy leadership . read more : egypt 's war of symbols . fadi hakura from the london think-tank chatham house told cnn that saturday 's events were  a vivid illustration of turkey 's growing isolation in the middle east .   there 's a perception gaining ground in the region that the turkish government is allied to the muslim brotherhood and that its foreign policy is defined by sectarian priorities ,  hakura said .  turkey has tense relations with israel , the neighboring countries -- iran , syria and iraq -- the majority of the gulf arab states and morocco , algeria , egypt and jordan ,  he said . hakura said u.s. president barack obama also was deeply unhappy with turkish foreign policy in the region .  since early august there has been no telephone contact between the u.s. president and turkish prime minister and that 's a reflection in part with turkey 's deepening isolation in the middle east and also frustration in ankara at obama 's reluctance to get involved in the conflict in syria ,  he said . hakura said while tensions between cairo and ankara would not have a major impact on turkish-u.s. relations ,  what these events do is reduce the importance of turkey to u.s. foreign policy calculations .  it is a shift from 2012 , when erdogan told an audience at his party conference -- that included then-president morsy -- that turkey was a role model for regional democratic islamist movements in the wake of the arab spring .  this understating that we have put forth has gone beyond our borders and has practically become an example to all muslim countries ,  erdogan said . last month suat kiniklioglu , a former lawmaker from erdogan 's akp party , also warned that turkey needed to reprioritize its foreign policy objectives in the middle east after suffering serious setbacks in the region in recent months .  egypt is a key actor in the middle east . there is a clear need to calibrate the language directed at cairo , as well ,  kiniklioglu wrote in the english language today 's zaman newspaper .  the falling out with israel , the arab spring and especially the civil war in syria have radically altered turkey 's position in the region ,  he said .  the coup in egypt has added insult to injury . consequently , turkey is confronted with significant challenges on all fronts in the region .  cnn 's ivan watson and gul tuysuz contributed to this report .", "summary": " egypt asked turkey 's ambassador to leave saturday .   turkish media said egypt attributed the move to ankara 's interference in its affairs .   the turkish government later declared egypt 's former ambassador unwelcome .   the move follows a worsening in relations since the ousting of president mohamed morsy .
