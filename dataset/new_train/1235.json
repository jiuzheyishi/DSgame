{"text": "microsoft 's co-founder bill gates has said the world must use the lessons from battling ebola to prepare for a future ` war ' against a global killer disease . at a recent conference in berlin , mr gates said the risk of a worldwide pandemic is so high it is reckless not to act now - and added technology will be a crucial asset in the fight against disease . he explained : ` we do n't know it will happen but it 's a high enough chance that one of the lessons of ebola should be to ask ourselves : are we as ready for that as we should be ? ' a good comparison is that we prepare ourselves for war - we have planes and training and we practise . ' scroll down for video . speaking at a recent conference in berlin , bill gates -lrb- pictured -rrb- said the risk of a worldwide pandemic is so high it is reckless not to act now . he explained : ` are we as ready for that as we should be ? a good comparison is that we prepare ourselves for war - we have planes and training and we practise ' he said this included building teams of volunteers who are ready to mobilise quickly in a public health emergency , similar to schemes developed in the countries hit hardest by ebola such as guinea , liberia and sierra leone , which registered almost 9,000 deaths in the last year . ` look at the death chart of the 20th century , ' he told vox this week . ' i think everybody would say there must be a spike for world war i. sure enough , there it is , like 25 million . and there must be a big spike for world war ii , and there it is , it 's like 65 million . ` but then you 'll see this other spike that is as large as world war ii right after world war i , and most people , would say , ` what was that ? ' well , that was the spanish flu . ' the deadly flu virus attacked more than one-third of the world 's population , and within months killed more than 65 million people - three times as many as the world war i - and did it quicker than any other illness in recorded history . he said this included building teams of volunteers who are ready to mobilise quickly in a public health emergency , similar to schemes developed in the countries hit hardest by ebola such as guinea , liberia and sierra leone -lrb- pictured -rrb- , which registered almost 9,000 deaths in the last year . in particular , mr gates fears a spanish flu-like epidemic similar to the one that killed more than 65 million people in 1918 could decimate populations in a matter of months . in this image , patients of the spanish flu lie in influenza ward no. 1 in a french hospital as doctors battled the virus and the effects of the war . researchers recently discovered the pandemic virus arose shortly before 1918 , when a human h1 virus , which they believe had already been circulating in the human population since about 1900 , picked up genetic material from a bird flu virus . most influenza outbreaks disproportionately kill juvenile , elderly , or already weakened patients ; in contrast the 1918 pandemic predominantly killed previously healthy young adults . microsoft 's co-founder originally made the comments at a donor conference for the gavi alliance which delivers vaccines to poor countries in january . lacking a reliable cure , public health groups concentrated on prevention . the deadly flu virus attacked more than one-third of the world 's population , and within months had killed more than 65 million people - three times as many as the world war i - and did it more quickly than any other illness in recorded history . most influenza outbreaks disproportionately kill juvenile , elderly , or already weakened patients ; in contrast the 1918 pandemic predominantly killed previously healthy young adults . to maintain morale , wartime censors minimized early reports of illness and mortality in germany , britain , france , and the united states . however , newspapers were free to report the epidemic 's effects in spain , creating a false impression of spain as being especially hard hit - and leading to the pandemic 's nickname spanish flu . the close quarters and massive troop movements of world war i hastened the pandemic and probably both increased transmission and augmented mutation , researchers believe . the global mortality rate from the 1918/1919 pandemic is not known , but an estimated 10 % to 20 % of those who were infected died , with estimates of the total number of deaths ranging from 50 to 100 million people . calling vaccines the ` biggest saver of lives ' worldwide , the 59-year-old praised german chancellor angela merkel for hosting the conference and making vaccinations a priority of her g7 presidency this year . however , he said he was ` concerned ' about an anti-vaccination trend in the west , due to exaggerated fears of risks associated with the jabs , that was leading to dangerous outbreaks . ` our focus is on the poor children where you have millions that die of vaccine-preventable disease . it 's unfortunate that you 're not getting 100-per cent coverage in the rich countries , ' he said . ` they 're choosing to potentially infect somebody who ca n't protect themselves , ' he said , noting the renewed spread of illnesses such as measles and pertussis -lrb- whooping cough -rrb- . microsoft 's co-founder -lrb- left -rrb- originally made the comments at a donor conference for the gavi alliance , which delivers vaccines to poor countries . calling vaccines the ` biggest saver of lives ' worldwide , the 59-year-old praised german chancellor angela merkel -lrb- right -rrb- for making vaccinations a priority of her g7 presidency . ` i 'm glad there are people who are championing reducing these misunderstandings in rich countries because of the risk that creates . ' mr gates - ranked by forbes magazine as the world 's richest man with a net worth of some $ 80 billion -lrb- # 52 billion -rrb- - said the bill and melinda gates foundation already distributes about $ 4 billion each year to help the world 's neediest . ebola 's ` achilles heel ' has been identified by a team of scientists , prompting hopes of new treatments to stop the virus spreading . researchers in new york believe they have located the vital protein , which affects whether or not the virus can spread to infect its victim . their study found the virus can only invade host cells by attaching to the protein - called niemann-pick c1 -lrb- npc1 -rrb- . if it is unable to access that protein , it loses the ability to infect and kill its victim . the vicious disease has infected almost 27,000 people , killing 11,135 , in the last 18 months . it is also a major contributor to the gavi alliance , which tuesday drew pledges of $ 7.5 billion to help immunise 300 million more children in developing countries over the next five years . and he continued technology is a crucial asset in his foundation 's field work , seen most recently in a drive against polio . ` we use satellite photos to find out where people are living , we use a gps tracker with a cell phone so that we can see if the vaccine team is going to every place they 're supposed to go , we do statistical analysis within a few days to see if there 's any kids that we missed , ' he said . ` measurement is a pretty natural private sector thing ... innovative new technologies are going to make it possible to see what 's going on with far less cost . ' mr gates said moving from the world of big business to working in villages in the developing world where people ` have no idea who i am ' had been satisfying . ' i was super proud of the work i did at microsoft . . it let me carry the message of software out into the world in a very enthused way , ' he said . ` now i have a different message , my wife and i , that we should be generous to the poor . to the degree i have visibility hopefully i 'm using that in a positive way . '", "summary": " gates said the risk of a pandemic meant it was reckless not to act now .   he added technology will be a crucial asset in the fight against disease .   the 59-year-old philanthropist compared it to preparing for war .   and fears a pandemic - like spanish flu which wiped out 50 million people in 1918 - could decimate populations in less than a year .
