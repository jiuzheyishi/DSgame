' ivania , from miami , florida , added : ` my initial reaction to the entire conversation was confusion - as evan and i had never spoken to each another . the arm was meant to be decorative , but does have limited practical uses such as holding a glass of wine . ' i decided to go along with it because i was curious to see what would come out of it and it 's not every day a complete stranger comes up to you and offers to design you a custom prosthetic . ` when evan told me the arm had finished printing i was beyond excited to see it . ` he promised i 'd be the first to see it and when i did i could n't believe the intricacy and level of detail it had - i was in awe . ' i immediately tried it on and we were both relieved to find out that it fit me perfectly .
