{"text": "2014 marks an exciting new year for  downton abbey  fans . the show 's fourth season kicks off on pbs on sunday , and 1922 promises to be another scandal-filled time for the crawley family and their busy staff . the season just ended in the uk , but now american fans will have their chance to get wrapped up in the latest drama brewing within those british walls . season 3 brought us tragic deaths , new additions to the family and staff , and shirley maclaine . what will the next set of episodes hold ? here are the five things we are looking forward to over the next eight weeks : . 1 . how will lady mary move on from tragedy ? season 3 ended with a bang . hours after lady mary gave birth to a son , her husband , matthew , was killed in a car crash . season 4 picks up six months after the accident , and we will find out how the eldest of the crawley siblings is handling life as a widowed mother . is she still in mourning or working to find the perfect suitor ? mary 's biggest plight in the series has been her search for the right man , and now she 's got to consider picking it up again , this time with a small piece of baggage . perhaps she will devote all her time and energy to her new son . or will she resent the child as a constant reminder of her lost love ? matthew was in the midst of making changes at downton to help the abbey regain its financial footing , and now his wife must take on those duties . our guess is , the warmth brought out by matthew has since frozen over . expect to see the cold , emotionally closed-off mary we knew so well at the beginning of the series . also , we will almost certainly see mary don nothing but black . she is in mourning , after all . 2 . diversity at downton ! that 's right , after three seasons , we will finally see a person of color on the show ! downton has never been known for its diversity , but viewers know social change is on the horizon . it was only a matter of time before it creeps into those hallowed halls . while diddy 's casting may have been nothing more than a funny or die joke , season 4 will in fact include the show 's first recurring black character . gary carr has been cast as a charismatic jazz singer and will hopefully give us a glimpse into the characters ' feelings about the changing face of race in the 1920s . with cousin rose 's penchant for jazz clubs revealed in the finale , it 's a safe bet the two will cross paths this season . 3 . will this be the last we see of cousin isobel ? with matthew gone , what does that mean for his dear mother ? isobel has played a major part in the series since her son 's introduction in season 1 . now that we must get used to life without matthew , how much longer will we get to spend with the family he brought with him ? fans will surely get a glimpse into isobel 's grieving period since the huge loss . it will be interesting to see whether she remains a lead character on the series with only a grandson connecting her to downton . with mary inevitably trapped in a state of depression , perhaps it will be isobel who comes to her rescue and helps raise the newborn heir . 4 . how much time will we have to spend with cousin rose ? viewers were introduced to lady rose at the tail end of season 3 , and the rebellious teen did n't make the best impression . she had been invited to stay at downton while her parents travel to india . if the previews are anything to go by , we 're going to see much more of the troublemaker in coming episodes . with a dark cloud still hanging over the abbey after the shocking deaths of both matthew and lady sybil , rose might provide a much-needed bright spot to the house . 5 . what 's next for downton 's downstairs ? season 3 wrapped with most of downton 's downstairs players riding cloud nine . bates and anna have become the show 's most loving pair since the former 's release from prison . daisy , alfred and ivy became involved in an innocent love triangle . even the conniving thomas made peace with those he 's wronged . the finale gave the staff a chance to get out of their uniforms and spend some time bonding in the sun . expect some major changes within the hard-working team in the new season . a major player will be taking time away from downton , making room for a few shakeups . since branson 's been living as a widower for nearly two years , the former chauffeur may have to pay special attention to the latest addition . and with molesley now jobless , matthew 's former butler and valet will be in search of new work . did we mention fans can expect both special guest star paul giamatti and another helping of shirley maclaine in the roles of harold levinson and his mother , martha ? there 's nothing we look forward to more than one-liner standoffs between martha and the dowager countess . there 's never a dull moment at downton !", "summary": "  downton abbey  is back for a new season on sunday .   expect grief and some cast additions .   shirley maclaine will return as martha levinson .
