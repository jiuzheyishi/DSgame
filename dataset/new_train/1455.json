' the court heard hempel had not reported any problem to air traffic control but a frantic ian could be shouting to the lifeless pilot in the last cockpit recording . in the accidentally transmitted message an extremely upset mr lovell can be heard saying : ` oh my god , what are you doing ? put it up . ' medical evidence showed that hempel died from injuries caused by the impact itself but had not braced himself before hitting the water , suggesting he was unconscious . an autopsy found there was ` gross evidence ' that hempel , a pilot of 40 years , had a prior injury and scarring which could cause seizures . as his commercial , transport and commercial helicopter licence had been cancelled this meant he was not allowed to take paying customers in the air . after the hearing , mr lovell 's mother . lynn , 59 , said the coroner 's report had brought the family closure after . five years of campaigning . close : ian lovell 's family were left devastated by the crash . he is pictured here with sister becky . speaking from the family home she shares with husband david , 62 , in shifnal , shropshire , she said : ` it 's something that should never , ever have happened . something has got to happen , this ca n't happen to another family . ` hempel had no regard for anybody . he was a maverick , a cowboy and a liar - everything you would n't want to know in a person . ` sam bought the ticket along with ian 's friend . they thought it would be something he would like to do . ` he was n't a daredevil . he knew that sam had researched the flight . he did n't go into things lightly . ` the register is the one thing that really needs chasing up . sam will pursue that and make sure something is being done . ` she is angry at casa . we are angry at casa . ' angry : lynn and david lovell from shifnal in shropshire , look at photographs of beloved son , ian . girlfriend samantha - who is suing the two casa doctors responsible for medically clearing hempel for $ 955,000 - added : ` none of this brings ian back . recommendations can be put forward but ian is gone . ` i 'm angry really . when it comes down to it casa is the regulatory body and they did nothing to stop barry from flying . ' i think there needs to be a better way for people to be able to check what kind of licences pilots hold . ` what he did in flying ian was illegal and he had had his commercial licence suspended but casa actually gave him the freedom . ' mr lovell had been working in australia following his dream of combining travel with his work as a computer games animator . he had just completed his most high-profile project , working for chrome industries on the star wars computer game , before he died . a spokesman for casa said the organisation would ` carefully be considering ' the recommendations . brotherly love : ian lovell -lrb- right -rrb- , pictured here with sister becky -lrb- left -rrb- and brother carl -lrb- centre -rrb- .", "summary": " samantha hare watched in horror as boyfriend ian lovell crashed into sea .   pilot barry hempel was banned from flying commercially in 2001 .   but he retained private pilot 's license despite suffering epileptic seizures .   australian civil aviation authority knew about the 60-year-old 's condition .   coroner has slammed the body for ` disregarding ' medical observations .   girlfriend is now suing the staff involved for their ` cavalier ' approach .
