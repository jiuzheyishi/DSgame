{"text": "updated : . 17:04 est , 6 january 2012 . eddie gilfoyle speaking at press conference in 1992 , the year his wife died . police retained a secret diary that could have cleared a man jailed for life for killing his wife , it was revealed yesterday . eddie gilfoyle protested his innocence for nearly two decades after being convicted in 1993 of murdering his pregnant wife , paula , and making it look like suicide . but it has emerged that a padlocked box existed containing two volumes of a diary covering ten years . the journal reveals her troubled past and how she had previously tried to take her life . these facts were not disclosed to mr gilfoyle 's lawyers or told to the jury . in fact , the diary contradicts the image presented to the murder trial of mrs gilfoyle as a happy woman with everything to live for . police refused to say where the box had been over the years -- because the case is being reviewed by the commission that investigates miscarriages of justice . mr gilfoyle , 59 , who was released in december 2010 after two unsuccessful appeals , said yesterday : ' i am completely devastated that the police had these diaries and failed to hand them over to my defence . ' i am disgusted , appalled , words just fail me . they should have been disclosed prior to my two appeals but they were kept hidden . ' i have told the truth all the way through . the police have lied all the way through . ' his solicitor matt foot , said : ` mr gilfoyle has protested his innocence for 19 years . meanwhile the police have held on to a locked box containing material that directly contradicts their case . how has this happened ? ' eddie gilfoyle at his wedding reception with wife paula . he has always maintained that she killed herself . mrs gilfoyle , 32 , who was . eight-and-a-half months pregnant , was found hanged in the garage of the . couple 's home in upton , wirral , in 1992 . a suicide note was discovered in her . handwriting but prosecutors said gilfoyle dictated it to her , telling . her he needed it for a course in his job as an auxiliary nurse . relatives and friends told the jury . she was a happy , bubbly woman but the diaries and other personal papers . which she kept in the marital home reveal she took an overdose of pills . when she was 15 . they also show that as a teenager she . was engaged to a boy who was convicted of killing a girl . she bought . him a wedding ring while he was in prison . it was when that boyfriend , mark . roberts , threatened to leave her that she took an overdose , writing in . her diary : ` mark went mad but i done it to him . ' the new evidence also revealed that . two of mrs gilfoyle 's former boyfriends threatened suicide and among her . possessions was a note from one -- using similar words to the note found . where she died . mr gilfoyle 's lawyers have asked the . criminal cases review commission to refer his case back to the court of . appeal to be overturned . merseyside police confirmed they handed papers to mr foot last year but refused to comment further . the gilfoyles ' house , in upton , wirral where his paula 's body was found hanging in the garage . at trial , gilfoyle suggested his wife 's teenage relationship with mark roberts could have affected her mentally . her friends maintain that after roberts was jailed for killing a girl she did n't want anything to do with him . her diary tells a different story : . may 26 , 1974 : ` went to golden goose . went for a drink . had our photos taken there . ' one time he threatened to leave her and she took an overdose : ` took some tablets 10 mark went mad but i done it to him . ' september 30 , 1976 : ` mark rang me up . he has broken it off . very upset just ca n't believe he went with another girl . ' october 2 , 1976 : ` had to give a statement on mark he has been charged with murder . mum came to pick me up at his house nervous wreck . november 19 : ` went to court went in the cell with mark . he gave me a love bite . he is sick but i love him . ' december 3 : ` went to see mark in court , had hour and half with me lovely time . we kissed talked we are both in love . i want him and i need him . ' february 7 , 1977 : ` went to crown court . mark got sentenced for life , but i still love him . i shall try and keep my promise . on march 12 she bought him a silver wedding ring . two months later she collected his clothes he wore when he handed himself in : ` went to pick mark clothes up at police station and got his wallet too , his belt and jeans had blood on . ' the box containing the fresh evidence -- paula gilfoyle 's diary and other personal possession -- was handed to gilfoyle 's defence team in august 2010 by merseyside police . on the box was an exhibit label from lancashire constabulary , although it was the merseyside force that investigated the murder . lancashire had been invited by the police complaints authority in 1994 to review the investigation and took some exhibits . though it is unclear whether the box was discovered by lancashire detectives during a search of mrs gilfoyle 's home during their 1994 inquiry or had ion fact been taken in the original investigation , but for whatever reason , subsequently forgotten about . it was undisclosed throughout both gilfoyle 's appeals in 1995 and 2000 . new developments after june 2010 , when the new attorney general dominic grieve qc had to apologise to mps after parliament was given wrong information about the case . the cps had drafted a deficient answer for the solicitor general vera baird about the disclosure of evidence in gilfoyle 's trial . in a statement , the cps added : ` should there be any further queries or requests for clarification , the cps will try to deal with them as quickly and comprehensively as possible . ' two months later gilfoyle 's solicitor matt foot was taken to merseyside , when the box was produced by . no explanation was given by lancashire police or the independent police complaints commission -- which succeeded the pca - as to why the box was only now being produced . released : eddie gilfoyle -lrb- centre -rrb- is flanked by his sister susan caddick and lord hunt in the house of lords in 2010 . gilfoyle was released from prison in . 2010 after spending 18 years behind bars . at the time his solicitor , . matt foot , said there had been no forensic evidence for murder . ` the reason for that is that it was a . suicide , ' he said . ` what the prosecution did was distort the evidence . to give the appearance that there was forensic evidence in this case . ' mr foot claimed there were two . ` fallacies ' in the murder case - that mrs gilfoyle would not have been . able to keep her balance as she walked up the ladder to where she was . hanged , and that she would not have been able to get the rope over the . beam . ` these were complete and utter myths that were created by the prosecution and went into the trial , ' he said . it was an ` extraordinary coincidence ' that today 's press conference came as the law commission had . recommended changing the rules on expert evidence in jury trials . ` what they are saying is that there should n't be unjustifiable assumptions going into trials from experts , ' mr foot said . ` and that 's exactly what happened in . this case , and if the new rules that are being suggested were in force . in 1992 this case would never have gone to trial . ' the only marks found on mrs gilfoyle 's body were two small scratched on her neck , above where the rope had been . experts say that these are occur in . around 5 per cent of hanging suicides and are believed to be a result of . attempts to release the rope .", "summary": " friends said in court that paula gilfoyle was carefree and would never have killed herself .   her teenage diary reveals a previous suicide attempt and relationship with a murderer .   gilfoyle served 18 years for her murder but has maintained his innocence .
