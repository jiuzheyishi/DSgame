' i do n't believe there is any case for industrial action tomorrow , not least because talks are still ongoing . ` it is only a minority of unions who have taken the decision to go ahead and strike . ` what we are proposing is fair . it is . fair to taxpayers but it is also fair to the public sector because we . want to continue strong public sector pensions . ' he also attacked labour leader ed . miliband , who did not ask about the walkout , accusing him of being ` in . the pocket of the unions ' . the british chambers of commerce said . disruption will lead to many parents having to take the day off work to . look after their children , losing them pay and hitting productivity . paul griffin of law firm dbs paul . griffin warned that workers could face disciplinary action if they take . time off to look after their children . mr cameron today echoed his feeling that the strikes were wrong at a time when negotiations were ongoing . he said : ` anyone thinking of phoning . into the office tomorrow and claiming absence on the grounds of a . parental emergency could find themselves in hot water . ` whilst parents are entitled to . unpaid time off to arrange childcare due to sickness or some other such . unpredictable event , these strikes have been known about for months . 'em ployers could argue that this . situation does not qualify as an emergency and take disciplinary action . against individuals who do n't turn up for work .

' he added that it was ` regrettable ' that two of the teaching unions were planning strike action which was ` unnecessary while talks were still going on ' . ` it will cause massive inconvenience to hard-working families and it will hit working women particularly hard , ' he said . mr gove has also written to head teachers asking them to keep schools open warning that strikes ` wo n't improve the prestige of the profession ' an a column for the sun today . he concluded : ` this government wo n't allow strike action to derail our drive for a better future for our children . ' labour leader ed miliband said : ' i understand why teachers are so angry with the government . ` but i urge them to think about whether causing disruption in the classroom will help people understand their arguments . ' business secretary vince cable said . he believed the public would find it difficult to understand why the . strike was going ahead when negotiations over pensions were continuing . it was ` imperative ' that public . sector pensions were reformed , said dr cable , adding that he intended to . be in his office tomorrow and hoped that if any business department . staff went on strike it would not ` spoil ' the working relationship . mike cherry , policy chairman of the . federation of small businesses , said : ` small firms are concerned about . the impact that the proposed strike action will have on their ability to . do business on thursday . ` the recovery remains in a fragile . state and this action will have a wider impact on the economy as . businesses lose productivity - something the economy simply can not . afford .

' nut leader christine blower said : . ` the action tomorrow is regrettable but unfortunately , due to the . position that the government has taken , unavoidable . ` teachers have been left with no . option but to demonstrate the strength of feeling they have about the . unnecessary proposals , which will see teachers paying more , working . longer and getting less for their pensions . ` the national audit office has confirmed that teachers ' pensions are affordable . ` the institute of fiscal studies has said all the evidence demonstrates that the costs of public sector pensions are falling . ` it is increasingly obvious that the government is pressing ahead with changes on an ideological , not economic , argument . ' mr serwotka urged union members to . ignore government calls not to strike , adding : ` thousands of jobs are at . stake , lower pensions are set to cost three times as much , and pay is . frozen while inflation soars . ` if you have never taken part in strike action before , make tomorrow 's national action your first .
