{"text": "new research has shown a correlation between the rise of the internet and the decline of americans claiming religious affiliation . other factors , such as an increase in higher education , are also implicated , but according to allen downey , a computer scientist at the olin college of engineering in massachusetts , the increase in internet usage has a significant correlation . the mit technology review reports that in 1990 , eight per cent of americans had no religious affiliation . in 2010 , that figure stands at 18 per cent , or 25 million people . religious figures : downey says that increased internet usage correlates to about 25 per cent of the drop in religiosity . downey analyzed data from the general . social survey , a well-respected annual research survey carried out downey . says the single biggest cause of religious affiliation is upbringing : . those you are raised in religious households are much more likely to . remain in their family 's religion as adults . however , . since 1990 , the number of people who had relgious upbringings has . fallen , leading to a decrease in religious individuals - but downey says . that can only account for 25 per cent of the drop . higher education at the college level is also correlated with the drop in religion , but although the number of people receiving a college education has increased 10 per cent since the 1980s , downey says it only accounts for a five per cent drop . crossed off : about 25 million fewer americans have religious affiliations today than back in 1990 . by far the largest factor , says downey , is internet use . in the 1980s , internet use was virtually non-existent , but in 2010 , 53 per cent of people spent two hours online a week and 25 per cent spent more than seven hours . downey is careful to note that his research has revealed a correlation and not a causation . a relationship between the rise of the internet and the drop in religion exists , but one is not directly responsible for the other . downey says that his research has controlled for ` most of the obvious candidates , including income , education , socioeconomic status , and rural/urban environments ' to discount a third factor , one that is responsible both for the rise of internet use and the drop in religiosity . however , that still leaves a 45 per cent drop in religious affiliation that is unaccounted for . ` about half of the observed change remains unexplained , ' downey told the mit technology review .", "summary": " new research shows that the number of americans with religious affiliations has dropped by 18 per cent , or 25 million people .   computer scientist allen downey says there is a correlation between the drop and the rise of internet use .   he says the increased usage of the internet correlates to 25 per cent of the drop .
