{"text": "pensioners in their 60s and 70s have seen their incomes rise steadily during the recession years - and now they are less likely to be poor than any other group in society , according to a new report . by contrast young people in their 20s have suffered a major drop in their living standards since the onset of the downturn , and middle-earners among twentysomethings have lost the most , with a 12 per cent income fall . the analysis from the institute for . fiscal studies comes in a week which has seen rising controversy over . the wealth and lifestyles of older people . all smiles : older people are now less likely to be poor than any other group , according to the institute for fiscal studies . a senior church of england cleric , bishop of london the right reverend richard chartres , said the ` fortunate generation ' in their 60s are soaking up too much taxpayers ' money and that state spending on older people ` raises questions of intergenerational equity ' . the bishop 's critics accuse him of ignoring the way the older generation have worked and saved for their lifestyles and of trying to create a divide between old and young . the ifs report said : ` differences between age groups are not new but reflect longer term trends . ` pensioners have consistently seen faster income growth than other family types and age groups over the past 30 years . ' reasons for higher incomes among older people over the past three decades have included the spread of good occupational pensions during the 1960s , 70s and 80s , and the introduction of more generous means-tested benefits for low-income pensioners by the labour government after 1997 . larger numbers of older people are also staying in jobs rather than taking retirement . official figures this week showed that more than a million over-65s are now working , double the numbers of 20 years ago . ` individuals aged 60 or above are the only age group not to see real falls in median income since the recession , ' the report said , adding that incomes for older people have grown by between two and three per cent between 2007 and 2012 . since the late 1970s , it said , pensioner incomes have gone up at an average rate of about two per cent a year , double the rise enjoyed by working-age people . age gap : the institute for fiscal studies analysis showed how the over-65s are better off now than have ever been , while most other age groups have lower incomes than in 2007-08 and 2001-02 . younger working people without children have seen incomes go up at only a third of the pace of the increasing wealth of older people . ifs economist david phillips said : ` this is in many ways a triumph of social policy . ` but these figures also confirm that it is young people who have suffered most as a result of the recent recession and who are now at risk of falling further behind . ` it is important that policymakers and politicians understand these profound changes to patterns of low incomes and respond accordingly . ' for people in their 20s , there was no real rise in incomes between 2001 and 2008 , and a sharp drop during the recession years , the report said . it said young adults with jobs and no children lost out in the 80s and 90s as incomes rose for the best paid , and that from the late 1990s onwards ` earnings growth was generally weak for this group right across the income distribution . ' some politicians , including work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith , have suggested that depressed wages for less skilled young people were at least in part a result of large-scale immigration that meant millions of newcomers to the country were competing for jobs . the ifs report , funded by the left-leaning research group the joseph rowntree foundation , came on the day that official poverty figures showed that average incomes fell again last year . income : this graph shows how from 1978 to 2008 almost every group saw their incomes increase , but only the over-60s have seen their earnings rise from 2007 to 2012 . a three per cent fall in average income in the year to last march - to # 427 a week before housing costs are paid - was roughly the same drop as in the previous year . as a result real average incomes are at roughly the same level as 10 years ago . the across-the-board fall in earnings meant that poverty levels stayed the same when measured as ` relative poverty ' , the number of people living on incomes below 60 per cent of the average . but 900,000 people , including 300,000 children , fell below the 60 per cent line from the previous year after incomes are adjusted for inflation . this measure is known as ` absolute poverty ' . the department for work and pensions said : ` this was due to incomes not increasing as fast as inflation which was very high and is now coming down . ' work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith said the previous labour government had been ` fixated ' by poverty lines and ` despite paying out # 170 billion in tax credits alone , they failed to meet their target to halve child poverty by 2010 and far too many children were left behind . ' he added that welfare reforms would cut real poverty by giving people incentives to get off benefits and take jobs . but labour shadow work and pensions secretary liam byrne said : ` the devastating verdict is in - in just one year this government has pushed a million people into absolute poverty and progress in tackling relative child poverty has completely stalled . ` what these figures show is living standards are collapsing to their lowest level in a decade , and that is forcing an extra 300,000 children to grow up in absolute poverty .
