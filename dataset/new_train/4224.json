{"text": "when you click  like  on your friends ' facebook posts , do you really mean it ? if seeing your facebook friends living wonderful , fun-filled lives gives you a case of the blues , you 're not alone . a new university of michigan study found that the more people checked facebook , the more likely they were to feel worse about their own lives . to measure people 's feelings and facebook usage , the team enlisted a small group of young adult facebook users in michigan and texted them five times a day for two weeks . each text linked to an online survey that asked how they were feeling . in addition to reporting how much they were checking facebook , the subjects rated their worry and loneliness levels at that moment as well as their overall satisfaction with life . the authors also asked people to rate their level of life satisfaction at the start and end of the study , and found that the more participants used facebook over the two-week study period , the more their life satisfaction levels declined . by contrast , the study found that face-to-face interactions with others led people to feel better over time .  over a billion people belong to facebook , and over half of them log in every day ,  said university of michigan social psychologist ethan kross , lead author of the study .  on the surface , facebook provides an invaluable resource for fulfilling the basic human need for social connection . but rather than enhancing well-being , our findings demonstrate that interacting with facebook may have the opposite result for young adults .  what is it about the social network that bums some people out ? one theory is that people are comparing themselves to their friends ' seemingly fantastic digital lives and feeling inferior . though the sample group of 82 people was small , the findings are similar to other studies about facebook use and mental health . facebook has become a tempting subject for researchers because of its role as a constant presence in so many people 's lives . psychologists , sociologists and other academics are curious about what kind of impact it has on its users ' brains , emotions and self-worth . some researchers have tapped directly into the gold mine of data generated by the social network -lrb- facebook has its own staff of data scientists and sometimes teams up with universities -rrb- , while others conduct their own independent studies . in early 2012 , a study out of utah valley university also found that many people had a case of the blues after checking facebook . the researchers talked to a group of 425 students and found correlations between the amount of time people spent checking facebook and negative feelings about their own lives . the more time their subjects spent on the social network , the higher probability that they would think their friends lived better , happier lives . in january , a study from germany found that a third of people felt worse after spending time on facebook . seeing updates of friends ' successful careers , cute babies and fabulous vacations inspired feelings of envy , loneliness and even anger .", "summary": " study : the more people check facebook , the worse they feel about their lives .   researchers at university of michigan queried 82 young adults .   authors of study say people may compare their lives to friends ' and feel inferior .   study is not the first to find negative effects of frequent facebook use .
