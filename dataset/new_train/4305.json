{"text": "sen. rand paul marked the 50th anniversary of the civil rights act at a ceremony this week honoring the late maurice rabb , a renowned ophthalmologist and civil rights leader . it was part of his aggressive outreach to african-americans and other nontraditional gop voters as he works to expand the republican party and as he crisscrosses the country laying groundwork for a potential presidential campaign . it 's a community in which he has some fences to mend . while campaigning for the senate four years ago , paul sparked a firestorm for questioning parts of the historic law , especially its underpinnings that place restrictions on private property . the law gave the federal government too much power in telling business owners what they could and could not do , he argued . while he expressed strong abhorrence for racism , he said it was the job of communities , not the government , to fix discrimination in private places by boycotting such businesses . his argument lined up ideologically with his libertarian , limited-government leanings , but democrats have used his comments to try to define him as a civil rights opponent . paul is now considered a likely presidential contender . and as the most active republican leader in the effort to recruit african-americans to the gop , his comments from four years ago have become a thorn in his side . political strategists say the senator has gotten better at framing his arguments in a less divisive manner . but in order to lay to rest controversy over his 2010 remarks , he needs to keep doing what he 's doing : try to convince african-americans and democratic voters that he 's an advocate for many of their views , and push his fellow republicans to join him in the effort .  if we 're going to be the white party , we 're going to be the losing party ,  paul said tuesday at the shelbyville rotary club while he was in town for the event honoring rabb . paul 's questions about the law . in april 2010 , paul was asked by the louisville courier-journal about his thoughts on the civil rights act . he hailed the law for striving to end discrimination in the public domain , but he did n't fully approve of the government 's role in the process .  i think it 's a bad business decision to exclude anybody from your restaurant â $  but , at the same time , i do believe in private ownership ,  he said . he added that he agrees any publicly-funded entities should not be allowed to discriminate , but the law should n't necessarily apply to private businesses .  and that 's most of what i think the civil rights act was about in my mind .  so how would he resolve the problem ? consistent with his small-government philosophy , he said it should be up to the people to self-correct the issue .  in a free society , we will tolerate boorish people who have abhorrent behavior . but if we 're civilized people , we publicly criticize that and do n't belong to those groups , or do n't associate with those people ,  he added . his comments were similar to the views of his father , former rep. ron paul , who famously protested a 2004 vote in the house commemorating the 40th anniversary of the civil rights act . the then-congressman said the law did not improve race relations , and it diminished individual liberty . defending his father , paul said the problem with the law was the unintended consequences it had on property rights .  it 's not all about race relations . it is about controlling property , ultimately ,  he said on cnn in january 2012 . but patrick maney , a history professor at boston college , said the discussion around property rights was only a portion of the debate about the civil rights act at the time of passage .  saying the civil rights act was about property rights is sort of akin to those who say the civil war was about states ' rights ,  he said .  the main objection , especially among the most rabid opponents , was to racial integration , assimilation , and race mixing .  ` concerned about the ramifications ' paul also argued that the law set a dangerous precedent that 's paved a way for other restrictions on businesses , such as calorie-count regulations and smoking bans . while visiting howard university , a historically black college in washington , paul was questioned last year about his views on the law . he forcefully said he 's never come  out in opposition to the civil rights act or ever introduced anything to alter the civil rights act .  rather , he 's been  concerned about the ramifications of certain parts of it beyond race , as they are now being applied to smoking , menus , listing calories and things on menus , and guns .  but historians say there 's no direct connection between the 1964 law and the federal regulations he mentioned .  i see absolutely nothing in the civil rights act as opposed to any other law which would lead to smoking bans ,  said ed dorn , a professor and former dean of the lyndon b. john school of public affairs at the university of texas at austin . a more likely connection , dorn added , would be linking smoking bans and menu restrictions to health laws mandating child vaccinations . there is one title -lrb- out of 11 -rrb- in the law that addresses private businesses . it states that certain entities are exempt from the law , such as small bed-and-breakfast type facilities , known colloquially as  mrs. murphy 's boarding houses ,  in which there are five or fewer bedrooms and where the owner is a full-time resident . in a may 2010 interview with msnbc 's rachel maddow , paul famously suggested that if he were around in 1964 , he  would have tried to modify that  section of the law and  there would have been some discussion  on property rights . the washington post in 2013 ran a fact-check of paul 's comments about the civil rights act over the years and gave him three out of four pinnochios for what they described as  rewriting history .   it would be better to own up to his mistake â $  if he now thinks it was one â $  rather than sugarcoat it ,  the article stated . an uphill battle . perhaps more than any other republican politician , paul has been actively trying to expand the gop by making it more attractive to african-americans . he started his outreach following the 2012 presidential election , when republican mitt romney garnered only 6 % of that vote . paul has made multiple trips to historically black colleges and urban centers , preaching a pro-school choice position and holding meetings with students and school leaders . last month he helped open a kentucky gop office in a predominantly african-american area in louisville . in late july , he 'll address the national urban league in cincinnati . and in congress , he 's working to restore voting rights for people convicted of nonviolent felonies , many of whom are minority voters , and he 's pushed his idea of  economic freedom zones  that would focus on improving struggling communities in urban areas .  i think you 'll find nobody in congress doing more for minority rights than me , right now . republican or democrat ,  paul told reporters tuesday in shelbyville . paul 's policy messages will resonate with  the african-american of 2014 ,  said elroy sailor , an african-american businessman who 's traveled with the senator to urban areas and historically black schools -- though he stressed historical issues were still important to the black community . sailor said paul 's actions will ultimately speak louder than any comments he made in the past .  that 's what 's transcending a statement here , or a statement there ,  he argued , predicting paul will win people over in the long run .  i think you 'll see a lot of rand paul democrats .  but paul still faces an uphill battle in courting those voters . while he 's reaching out to african-americans on issues they care about , his political associations and ideology may be an obstacle for some .  the libertarian perspective has never been terribly strong in the african-american community precisely because it is tied to a private property argument that bears a very insidious connection to slavery and racial discrimination ,  said dorn , the professor of public affairs , though he said he takes paul at his word that the senator detests racism .  very few civil rights advocates have been libertarians ,  dorn added , however . learning a valuable lesson . as paul works to appeal to african-americans on the policy front , he 'll need to continue sharpening his message skills .  he learned a very , very valuable lesson : if it 's too complicated to explain your position , you 're probably in trouble ,  said gop strategist ford o'connell . he 's tried to clean up and clarify his comments about the civil rights act , and in may 2012 , he told cnn 's wolf blitzer that he would have voted for the bill in 1964 if he had the chance . he  would have been there marching with martin luther king  during the civil rights movement , he said . in a statement this week on the anniversary , paul said the law  changed the future of our nation by enforcing the belief that all men and women are created equal .  when running for the senate in 2010 , paul was considered a newcomer to politics . he had campaigned for his father 's presidential bids and had been involved in political activism , but rand paul 's senate run was his first big campaign of his own . strategists say his comments about the civil rights act were a rookie mistake ; paul , who had been a practicing ophthalmologist for 17 years , was n't quite ready for the sound-bite friendly media . if paul runs for president , democrats are almost certain to make sure his comments about the civil rights act overshadow any other efforts he 's made to appeal to african americans . on tuesday for example , the democratic national committee quickly pounced on the statement paul released on the anniversary . in an email blast , the dnc reminded people of his louisville courier-journal interview . paul is  now trying to have it both ways ,  the email stated .  no rhetoric can erase the number of instances where paul has turned his back on the civil rights act that 's created a more fair and just america ,  it continued . the response offered a glimpse at how democrats plan to target the likely presidential candidate . from a strategy standpoint , o'connell said paul has  gotten a lot better  at talking to the media and it 's  wise  for him to be active in appealing to the african-american community , not only for his own political future , but for the republican party as a whole .  his job between now and then is to continue what he 's doing with minority outreach and try to bury this every way possible ,  he said .", "summary": " rand paul got in some hot water over his 2010 comments about the civil rights act .   democrats will likely make the controversy a line of attack if he runs for president .   the kentucky republican is now trying to appeal to african-american voters .   experts say he 's made strides with his outreach efforts , but needs to keep it up .
