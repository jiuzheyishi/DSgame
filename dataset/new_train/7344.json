{"text": "women having caesarean sections could soon be saying goodbye to staples , stitches and unsightly scars -- thanks to a medical version of a welding torch . an israeli firm has developed a stitch and staple-free method of ` welding ' together surgical wounds which it claims creates neater joins . it says that mothers-to-be undergoing c-sections could be among the first to benefit , with treatments carried out as soon as this autumn . the company says that it takes just three or four minutes to seal a c-section wound and that scarring is minimal . it is hoped the new way of closing wounds will also be suitable for burns victims and cosmetic surgery patients . ionmed 's device is based on plasma -- a charged form of gas normally only seen in lightning bolts and in the intense light produced by welding torches . the plasma used in the bioweld gadget is much cooler , ensuring it does not damage delicate tissue . at around 40c it is hot enough to make the skin tingle but not cause pain . however , it still produces a very powerful flame and when channelled through the tip of a pen-like device , it welds a thin film of specially-designed material -- based on a naturally occurring sugar -- over the wound , closing it . it is hoped eventually the thin film can be dispensed with and the powerful plasma alone will be enough to seal wounds . in three clinical trials on women undergoing c-sections , in which an eight-inch incision is made along the bikini line , the wounds healed better than the stitches and staples currently in use . the company says that it takes just three or four minutes to seal a c-section wound and that scarring is minimal . mothers-to-be undergoing c-sections could be among the first to benefit , with treatments carried out as soon as this autumn . the gas is also said to encourage the growth of blood vessels , ensuring the area that was operated on receives a good supply of blood . it is also anti-bacterial , so should reduce the risk of wounds becoming infected . although many c-section wounds that are sealed by stitches or staples heal well , a recent study found that up to 44 per cent of women still had a raised , red scar six months on . gian carlo di renzo , a professor of obstetrics and gynaecology in perugia in italy , described bioweld 's results as ` very encouraging ' . he added : ` as surgeons , we seek better ways to connect tissue , to minimise damage to healthy tissue and obtain better clinical and cosmetic results for patients . ' ronen lam , vice president of business development at ionmed , the company behind bioweld , said : ` no one has done this before . ` using plasma enhances the complex wound healing process . ` doctors can learn how to use this very quickly . there is almost no learning curve . ' bioweld was invented by ronen lam 's brother amnon , who was a medic in the israeli army before becoming a project manager at a firm that uses cold plasma to create semiconductors . he came up with the idea of combining his combat medical experience with cold plasma technology . the company has submitted documentation for approval so that bioweld can be used by doctors and hospitals in europe . it says approval process should take a matter of months , meaning the new system could available for use on patients by the autumn . hospitals will have to pay around # 2,500 for the equipment , plus around # 10 to # 15 for the kit needed for each caesarean operation .", "summary": " an israeli firm has developed a method of ` welding ' together surgical wounds .   mothers-to-be undergoing c-sections could be among the first to benefit .   plasma is channelled through a pen-like device to close wounds smoothly .
