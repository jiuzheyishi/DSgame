{"text": "a flowering process 80 years in the making is finally underway . an american agave plant housed at the university of michigan since 1934 has started to bloom . the blooms so far are ` low-key ' with yellow anthers sticking out , joe mooney , a spokesman for matthaei botanical gardens , said wednesday . housed at the university of the michigan since 1934 , the plant has grown so rapidly since the spring that at more than 27 feet it is now too tall for the ann arbor conservatory , which has had to remove a pane of glass to accommodate it . the variegated american agave -lrb- agave americana -rrb- was collected in mexico by famed ethno-botanist alfred whiting , who then was a university of michigan graduate student . known as the century plant because it blooms infrequently , it is native to mexico and the american southwest and typically lives 10 to 25 years in the wild before blooming a single time then dying . american agave foliage is usually 3 to 6 feet tall and 6 to 10 feet wide . the flower stalk can reach up to 30 feet tall . the anther is the part of the stamen where pollen is produced . the agave began sprouting up at a pace of 6 inches a day in the spring and now stands at more than 27 feet -- so tall that staff had to remove a panel in the glass roof of the ann arbor conservatory . the variegated american agave -lrb- agave americana -rrb- was collected in mexico by famed ethno-botanist alfred whiting , who then was a university of michigan graduate student . known as the century plant because it blooms infrequently , it is native to mexico and the american southwest and typically lives 10 to 25 years in the wild before blooming a single time then dying . now that the michigan agave has begun to bloom , matthaei horticulture manager mike palmer said he plans to reach out to his colleagues out west . the variegated american agave -lrb- agave americana -rrb- was collected in mexico by famed ethno-botanist alfred whiting , who then was a university of michigan graduate student . ` i 'm going to call the desert botanical garden -lrb- in phoenix -rrb- and ask for a firsthand description of what happens during the flower opening , ' palmer said . mooney said it was difficult to predict how the flower will look in full bloom because the plant is so old and has lived its life in a conservatory rather than in a hot desert . once the agave completes the flowering process , it will take many months before it dies . the bad news , especially for anyone who 's seen this enormous plant in the conservatory or in nature with its sinuous yellow-streaked leaves bristling with spikes , is that the plant will bloom , set seed and die , says mike palmer , horticulture manager at matthaei botanical gardens & nichols arboretum . according to palmer the american agave usually blooms in nature at 10 to 25 years of age . the agave bllom up close , left , and the plant poking through the roof - which had to have a glass panel removed . ` although no one knows for sure what combination of environmental conditions induces flowering , ' he said . ` and it 's rare for one to bloom indoors . of course , being in a conservatory helps ! ' american agave foliage is usually 3 to 6 feet tall and 6 to 10 feet wide . the flower stalk can reach up to 30 feet tall . thankfully , life will go on for the botanical gardens ' variegated agave , palmer points out . ` while it 's sad that the parent plant will die , it also grows ` pups ' on the flower stalk and offsets at the base that are identical clones of the original plant , ' he says . and it produces hundreds or even thousands of seeds that have the potential to grow . ` in the harsh , low water environment of the desert , ' explains palmer , ` plants must produce many offspring to get a few progeny that will reach adulthood .
