{"text": "proud father anthony o'grady never got to walk his daughter down the aisle after he drank so much at her engagement party that he died , an inquest heard . the 53-year-old warehouse manager was not a heavy drinker but on the night of his daughter siobhan 's bash he had at least six pints of stella artois . he managed to get a taxi home from the celebrations in the early hours of the morning , but he fell off a small wall close to his house . tragedy : a taxi driver dropped mr o'grady to his house in herbert road , high wycombe , but rather than going straight indoors he sat on a low wall , from which he fell and later died . his body was found in a bush in a front garden by a horrified neighbour the next evening . home office pathologist dr nicholas hunt said mr o'grady died of acute alcohol intoxication . the level of alcohol in his blood was recorded at 368mg alcohol per 100ml . dr hunt said anything above 350mg could lead to death . he added that mr o'grady may have fallen into an unnatural position , causing ` postural asphyxia ' . the inquest heard that mr o'grady had attended the party at the glass house pub , in high wycombe , buckinghamshire , with other family members and friends . mr o'grady , who was married but separated from his wife penny , arrived at 9pm on saturday 8 october and left in the early hours of the following morning . party : mr o'grady , who the coroner heard rarely drank to excess , apparently drank at least six pints of stella during the party at the glass house , which has since been renamed . coroner richard hulett was told that mr o'grady managed to get a taxi to his home address in nearby herbert road but had sat down on a small wall after paying the driver . mr hulett said he appeared to have ` toppled ' off the wall backwards into a bush in a communal garden , and lay there unconscious until he died . mr o'grady 's body was found the following evening by a neighbour , who initially thought it was a sack of dumped rubbish and was horrified to discover what it was . police launched an investigation and a post mortem was carried out by the home office , which is called in to investigate suspicious cases . detective constable holly cannon , who investigated the death , told the inquest in high wycombe : ` mr o'grady had been at his daughter 's engagement party and his family reveal that he was there by 9pm and left at 1.20 am . ` from cctv images and what family members have told us he had drunk around six pints of stella artois . ` it is unknown what , if anything , he had drunk before leaving for the public house . ` he walked out of the public house onto the high street and a taxi took mr o'grady home to herbert road and dropped him off , ' she said . ` he had sat on a wall and dropped over backwards . the wall was not particularly high . he fell backwards and came into contact with sharp ends of twigs . ` that 's why he was n't found for some time - it was overgrown shrubbery in the front garden , ' said the detective . the inquest was told that mr o'grady would have a drink ` from time to time , but not to high levels except on social occasions . ' dr hunt discovered a puncture wound to mr o'grady 's neck which he said was consistent with falling on to sharp twigs , but he found no further injuries which suggested he had been attacked . mr hulett , in recording a verdict of death by misadventure , said : ` it looks to me that on this occasion he had consumed a considerable amount of drink at the social occasion . ` he got home , almost home , by taxi and seems to have sat down on this wall . due to the fact it was very late and he had had a lot to drink , he toppled over backwards . ` dr hunt , in his conclusion , refers to postural asphyxia , which means that when he fell down he was so intoxicated he became comatosed and stayed in that position and may not have breathed properly , which led to him dying there and then . ' he said mr o'grady had been ` unlucky ' . mr o'grady 's sister , anne-marie , said after the inquest : ` he was a lovely man , salt of the earth . he was well liked by everybody . his family was very close to him . ` it was such a happy occasion but ended in such tragedy .
