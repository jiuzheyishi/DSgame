{"text": "americans are generally excited about the new technology they expect to see in their lifetimes . but when confronted with some advances that already appear possible -- from skies filled with drones to meat made in a lab -- they get nervous . those are the findings in a report released thursday by the pew research center , which sought to gauge public opinion about our rapidly changing world of science and tech .  the american public anticipates that the coming half-century will be a period of profound scientific change , as inventions that were once confined to the realm of science fiction come into common usage ,  reads the report . overall , respondents to pew 's survey were upbeat about how technology will shape the near future . in the report , 59 % of americans think tech developments will make life in the next half-century better , while only 30 % said they will make life worse . more than eight out of 10 respondents -lrb- 81 % -rrb- said they think that in the next 50 years , people who need transplants will be able to get them with organs grown in labs . and more than half -lrb- 51 % -rrb- think computers will be able to create art as skillfully as humans do . they 're a little less optimistic about some science-fiction staples , though . only 39 % think it 's likely scientists will have figured out how to teleport things -lrb- or , presumably , people -rrb- , 33 % say we 'll have long-term space colonies by 2064 and a mere 19 % expect humans will be able to control the weather . interestingly , some of the advances that may be closest to becoming reality are the ones survey respondents were most worried about . nearly two out of three americans think it would make things worse if u.s. airspace is opened up to personal drones . a similar number dislike the idea of robots being used to care for the sick and elderly , and of parents being able to alter the dna of their unborn children . meanwhile , only 37 % of respondents think it will be good if wearable devices or implants allow us to be digitally connected all the time . with the advent of google glass and other wearable technology , that may not be such a distant dream . and already , researchers are developing robots to provide elder care , 3d printers are replicating parts of the human body and government regulators are considering allowing nonmilitary drones to legally operate in u.s. airspace .  in the long run , americans are optimistic about the impact that scientific developments will have on their lives and the lives of their children -- but they definitely expect to encounter some bumps along the way ,  said aaron smith , a senior researcher at pew and the author of the report .  they are especially concerned about developments that have the potential to upend long-standing social norms around things like personal privacy , surveillance , and the nature of social relationships .  other responses shined a light on what may be our cautious human nature . while generally excited about future tech , many survey participants were n't so keen on testing out those advances themselves . people were split almost evenly -lrb- 48 % -50 % -rrb- on whether they would ride in a driverless car . but only 26 % said they 'd get a brain implant to improve their memory or intelligence , and a mere 20 % said they 'd try eating meat made in a lab . while they were imagining the future , pew gave respondents the chance , in their own words , to share the one piece of futuristic technology they 'd most like to own . some 9 % said they 'd like to be able to time travel . a similar number said they 'd like something that would keep them healthy or extend their lives , 6 % said they wanted a flying car -lrb- or bike -rrb- , 3 % said they 'd take a teleportation device and a mere 1 % said they want their own jetpack . the report was based on telephone interviews conducted february13-18 with 1,001 adults from all 50 u.s. states and the district of columbia .", "summary": " survey : many americans are wary of futuristic tech advancements .   drones , robot nurses and always-on devices concern people .   but 59 % still think tech developments will make future life better .   nearly 1 in 10 say they 'd most like to be able to time travel .
