' in the original episode , lenny turns to carl and says : ` what 'd he say ? ' carl replies : ` i du n no . somethin' about being gay . ' however in the version screened on sunday , carl 's line was edited out . the episode abruptly cut to adverts after lenny said : ` what 'd he say ? ' ` what 'd he say ? ' carl 's reply to lenny was cut from the episode by channel 4 's compliance department . channel 4 said that simpsons episodes broadcast before 6pm are checked by its compliance department for unsuitable content , and that in this instance the department had been overly-cautious . a spokesman said : ` we always carefully consider the context in which language is used in our programming . ` however in this instance the episode was edited in error as neither the word nor the context was unsuitable . ' ofcom , the broadcasting regulator , says there is no evidence to conclude that use of the word ` gay ' is ` necessarily and automatically intended to be , or is , offensive . ' broadcasters are told to restrict usage of ` gay ' in a negative context when children are likely to be watching , as it could contribute to bullying . in may 2006 , chris moyles was accused of being homophobic after he dismissed a ringtone , saying ` i do n't want that one , it 's gay , ' on his radio 1 breakfast show . after receiving complaints , the bbc defended the presenter , arguing that the word ` gay ' , in addition to being used to mean ` homosexual ' or ` carefree ' , is also used as a synonym for ` lame ' or ` rubbish ' . the same year oxford university student sam brown was arrested for making homophobic remarks and spent the night in a cell after he called a police horse ` gay ' . the cps decided that there was not enough evidence to prosecute mr brown and it dropped the case .", "summary": " the broadcaster cut the word from the episode homer loves flanders screened on sunday afternoon at 12.55 pm .   channel 4 said its compliance department had been ` overly cautious ' and that ` neither the word nor the context was unsuitable ' "}
