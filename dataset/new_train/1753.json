{"text": "a green sea turtle was today enjoying a new lease of life thanks to the world 's first dive belt built exclusively for endangered sea creatures . ali has managed to dive properly for the first time in 11 years , since she was hit by a boat which left an air bubble under her shell , stopping her from submerging and causing her to float bottom up . the metre-long turtle , who weighs more than 10 stone , had found herself stranded on the surface . suited up : a team at weymouth sea life adventure park in dorset have created a pioneering belt with 2.5 lbs of removable lead weights that works just like those used by scuba divers . help : ali 's giant shell was split open by an engine propeller and she was left for dead after being hit by a boat in her native palm beach in florida . now a team at weymouth sea life adventure park in dorset have created a pioneering belt with 2.5 lbs of removable lead weights that works just like those used by scuba divers . the new invention is believed to be the first of its kind - and means ali , named after boxer muhammad ali , can dive again . fiona smith , curator at the sea life park , said : ` the common thing to do is to stick weights to injured turtles ' shells to allow them to dive . ` but where ali 's shell was in slightly worse condition because of her accident it was n't that easy . ` my team and i started thinking about how else we could attach the weights , and came up with the idea of a harness . ` we took the idea to a nearby dive shop and they came back to us with a custom-built dive belt we could slip weights into . it needs a few tweaks but otherwise it is ideal . special project : the new invention is believed to be the first of its kind - and means ali can dive again . ready to go : a protected endangered species , green turtles breathe oxygen but spend most of their lives under the water feeding and sleeping . ` it will take a little time for ali to get used to wearing her new jacket but eventually we see her wearing it all the time . poor ali used to float like a butterfly and swim like a bee . ` this new invention will make life so much better for her . if the belt is successful it could pave the way for the other turtles ' fiona smith , sea life adventure park . ` but this new invention will make life so much better for her . if the belt is successful it could pave the way for the other turtles . ' ali 's giant shell was split open by an engine propeller and she was left for dead after being hit by a boat in her native palm beach in florida . luckily she was rescued and nursed back to health at a special hospital for turtles - but when her injuries eventually healed an air pocket was left under the shell giving her unwanted buoyancy . she 's back : ali has managed to dive properly for the first time since 2001 , when she was hit by a boat which left an air bubble under her shell , stopping her from submerging and causing her to float bottom up . thought to be 15 to 20 years old , ali was one of five hospitalised green turtles transferred to weymouth to ease numbers . all five had weights glued to their shells to help them dive but her shell was so badly damaged the weights would n't stick , prompting work to start on the special belt . a protected endangered species , green turtles breathe oxygen but spend most of their lives under the water feeding and sleeping . they can dive for up to five minutes and sleep underwater for more than an hour . in the wild , green turtles -- known as chelonia mydas - can live for more than 80 years .", "summary": " ali had been hit by a boat which left an air bubble under her shell .   it stopped her from submerging and caused her to float bottom up .   but help has come from team at weymouth sea life adventure park .   they 've created pioneering belt with 2.5 lbs of removable lead weights .
