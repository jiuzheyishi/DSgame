{"text": "it 's an entirely preventable disease , and when diagnosed early , it 's easily treatable . yet malaria still claims hundreds of thousands of lives each year . all it takes is a single mosquito bite and you can become infected . in 2012 , the tropical disease caused 627,000 deaths internationally , 90 % of them in sub-saharan africa . ashley uys , a south african biotechnologist-turned-enterpreneur , is hoping to bring that number down to zero . through his company medical diagnostic , uys has developed a self-testing kit that can diagnose the disease in less than 30 minutes , and put sufferers on the path to recovery faster .  i decided to look at what is the most needing product in africa at the moment . and malaria , malaria is big ,  says uys .  i then decided to look at a malaria test that can actually show you the strain of malaria you have -- the type of malaria -- so -lrb- doctors -rrb- know which treatment to give you , and then also to see if the treatment is working or not . so i developed a test that can do all of that .  merging science and business . the best think about uys ' test is the price : they cost roughly 30 cents each , a fact uys takes immense pride in .  the fact that -lrb- they are affordable -rrb- of course makes it more accessible to the public . for me . it is very satisfying to know that a farm worker in a rural area does n't have to worry about going to a doctor . our product can be used at the point of care ,  he says .  you do n't need skilled labor to use it : prick -lrb- your finger -rrb- , run the test and wait for results . there 's a lot of diamonds in the rough -lrb- is africa -rrb- , a lot of potential , and diseases and epidemics are killing off this potential . so it has a knock-on effect that is important .  given uys is only 30-years old , he 's achieved an incredible amount . like many young entrepreneurs , he has drawn inspiration from his childhood and surroundings . using this experience , uys creates local solutions for everyday problems . for the cape town native , malaria prevention is just the beginning . saying ` no ' to drugs . uys has turned his attention to another scourge affecting his community : drug use .  on the cape flats , there was a big problem of drugs abuse ,  he recalls .  people abusing methamphetamine , et cetera . fortunately for me , although i grew up on the cape flats where it 's very prevalent , i used sport to keep me away from bad habits and getting involved with the wrong crowd .  now , as the founder of his own biotech company , uys created a test capable of detecting a range of drugs , including amphetamines , benzyls , cocaine , methamphetamine , heroine and morphine . the idea first came to him when , following a survey of users , he identified the correlation between drug use and eye movement . following this revelation , uys had a light-bulb movement that would take his product development to the next level .  we get five to 10 megapixel cameras on mobile phones . i thought to myself : ` imagine developing an app for your phone where you can actually test your kids for drugs by using the flash as a light stimulus . the camera can capture the movement and calculate the speed of your eyes and action , or -lrb- tell -rrb- if they 're dilated or constricted .  uys is still working on the prototypes for his oculus id pupil scanner , but he hopes the product will be ready to go into the market in coming weeks .  i 'm looking at innovation as the challenge for me . if you look at the first world countries it 's satisfying for me to see that we are innovating on that level or even better .  and me coming from belhar , i did n't go to harvard , did n't have a rich dad who could buy me what i wanted -- i had to work for everything . i had to work and study . i used to pack fish when i was a student . and that motivated me to work harder ,  he says . watch : nigerian professor makes history .", "summary": " malaria is a tropical disease frequently transmitted by mosquitoes .   when caught early , it is entirely preventable and yet , it still claims over 600,000 lives a year .   90 % of all malaria deaths are in sub-saharan africa .   south african biotechnologist has developed a test kit to diagnose sufferers earlier .
