{"text": "a seven-seat space taxi backed by nasa to ferry astronauts to the international space station will make a high-altitude test flight next summer , officials said this week . sierra nevada corp 's ` dream chaser ' space plane , which resembles a miniature space shuttle , is one of four space taxis being developed by private industry with backing from the u.s. government . for the unmanned test flight , it will be carried into the skies by whiteknighttwo , the carrier aircraft for the commercial suborbital passenger ship spaceshiptwo , backed by virgin galactic , a u.s. company owned by sir richard branson 's virgin group . space taxis : an artist 's impression of the dream chaser craft that may one day be used to take astronauts to the international space station . the test flight was added after privately held sierra nevada got a $ 25.6-million -lrb- # 16million -rrb- boost to its existing $ 80 million contract with nasa . the test flight will take place from either edwards air force base in california 's mojave desert , or from the white sands missile range in new mexico , according to ed mango , manager of nasa 's commercial crew program . with the retirement of the space shuttles this summer , nasa is now dependent on russia to fly astronauts to the space station , at a cost of more than $ 50million per person . blast off : the test flight will take place from either edwards air force base in california 's mojave desert , or from the white sands missile range in new mexico . the agency hopes to turn over crew transportation services to one or more commercial firms before the end of 2016 , mango said . in addition to sierra nevada , nasa is funding spaceship development work at boeing co , space exploration technologies , and blue origin , a start-up firm owned by amazon founder jeff bezos . ` having only one way to get crew to the station is a limitation , ' nasa astronaut mike fossum , who is currently living aboard the outpost , said during an in-flight interview last week . sky 's not the limit : dream chaser will be launched using whiteknighttwo , the carrier aircraft for virgin galactic 's spaceshiptwo . the station , a $ 100billion project of 16 nations , was finished this year after more than a decade of construction 225 miles -lrb- 350 km -rrb- above the planet . the outpost , which is about the size of a five-bedroom house , supports a variety of scientific research and technology demonstrations . along with helping to develop commercial space taxis , nasa is working on a heavy-lift rocket and capsule to fly astronauts and cargo to asteroids , the moon , mars and other destinations beyond the space station 's orbit . drawing heavily on equipment originally built for predecessor programs , including the space shuttle and the cancelled constellation moon exploration initiative , the new rocket , called the space launch system or sls , is scheduled to debut in 2017 . that unmanned test flight would be followed in 2021 by a trial run with astronauts , said kennedy space center director bob cabana . heavens above : the international space station orbits at over 200 miles above earth .", "summary": " sierra nevada 's ` dream chaser ' resembles mini shuttle .   it will use virgin galactic 's carrier aircraft for test .   private taxis could take over station flights in 2016 .
