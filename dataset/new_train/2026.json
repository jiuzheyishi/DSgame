{"text": "kabul , afghanistan afghan president hamid karzai 's office contacted the u.s. ambassador to afghanistan about reports the ambassador warned against sending more u.s. troops to the country , a karzai spokesman told cnn thursday . two u.s. officials confirmed to cnn that ambassador karl eikenberry sent two cables to washington expressing reservations about troop increases amid uncertainty over karzai 's government . one official , who spoke on condition of not being identified because of the sensitive nature of the cables , said the two communications  expressed concern and reservations about troop increases in afghanistan  until more is known about karzai 's government after his recent re-election . separately , a senior u.s. official also confirmed the existence of two eikenberry classified cables . the official said eikenberry expressed reservations about troop increases because of lingering concerns about karzai and uncertainties about the government he is going to put in place . the second official also asked not to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the cables . in kabul , eikenberry 's office would not confirm to karzai 's office the reports about the cables , karzai spokesman seyemic herawi said . herawi said karzai will not comment on the reports without more information from the u.s. embassy . should more troops be sent to afghanistan ? share your thoughts . eikenberry previously expressed worry about corruption in karzai 's government and its ability to partner with the united states to fight the taliban . a senior state department official told cnn that president obama 's administration has questions about karzai 's behavior , suggesting it has been inconsistent . asked for an official response on reports of the cables , the u.s. embassy in kabul said it does not comment on private messages , but did confirm that there had been correspondence between eikenberry and the president . in washington , state department spokesman ian kelly declined to comment thursday on eikenberry 's communications .  we are not going to get into the details of this kind of advice ,  kelly said .  this is a privileged channel of communication . they have the right to receive this advice in a confidential way ,  kelly said .  ambassador eikenberry has been providing this kind of advice and analysis to the president and secretary since he arrived ,  he said .  the president really deserves the right to be able to gather all of this information from all of the different principals , people involved in the shaping of this policy .  earlier , white house spokesman tommy vietor said ,  we wo n't discuss classified documents publicly , but , as we have said for months , success in afghanistan depends on having a true partner in the afghan government .  initial reports of cables sent by eikenberry appeared in the new york times , washington post and los angeles times . all three newspapers attributed the reports to senior u.s. officials , without identifying them . the developments came as obama told his war council wednesday that the u.s. troop commitment to afghanistan is not open-ended , and then asked for revisions to options he previously received for sending more troops , a senior administration official told cnn . the war council -- comprising top cabinet , pentagon and administration officials -- met with obama for the eighth time to discuss a request by the top u.s. commander in afghanistan for up to 40,000 more troops . the meeting lasted more than two hours , according to the senior administration official .  the president and his team discussed the length of time that it would take to implement the options he 's been presented ,  the senior official said .  the president believes that we need to make clear to the afghan government that our commitment is not open-ended . after years of substantial investments by the american people , governance in afghanistan must improve in a reasonable period of time to ensure a successful transition to our afghan partner .  in particular , obama pushed for revisions in proposed plans for troop increases to clarify how and when u.s. troops would turn over responsibility to the afghan government , the official said . earlier , a senior administration official and a u.s. military official independently told cnn that one option presented to obama calls for sending about 34,000 more u.s. troops to afghanistan , in addition to the 68,000 already committed to the country . the military official said the plan would send three u.s. army brigades , totaling about 15,000 troops ; a marine brigade of about 8,000 troops ; a headquarters element of about 7,000 troops ; and 4,000 to 5,000 support troops . the combat brigades would be brought in gradually , in three-month intervals , according to the military official . the troops would be spread across the country , mainly focusing in the south and southeast , where much of the fighting is , according to the military official . the option has been a favorite at the pentagon in recent weeks , the official added . that is only one option , the senior administration official emphasized . three other options , the official said , would be  different mixes ,  or  different components of it .  despite reports to the contrary , obama has not decided the number of u.s. troops he will send to afghanistan , white house officials said . such reports are  absolutely false ,  press secretary robert gibbs said . and anyone who suggests otherwise ,  does n't have , in all honesty , the slightest idea what they 're talking about .  republican members of the senate armed services committee urged obama in a letter sent wednesday -- veterans day -- to agree to the request for additional troops by u.s. military leaders in afghanistan . the letter , signed by 10 republican committee members , said success in afghanistan will require enabling local leaders to govern and secure their country without substantial international assistance . cnn 's barbara starr , elise labott , suzanne malveaux , mike mount , chris lawrence and tom cohen contributed to this report .", "summary": " state department says what ambassador tells president is confidential .   hamid karzai aides question u.s. ambassador 's advice to obama .   ambassador reportedly warns obama against sending more troops to afghanistan .   ambassador has expressed concerns about karzai government in past .
