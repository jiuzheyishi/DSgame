{"text": "perhaps one of einstein 's lasting legacies , aside from his groundbreaking theories and revolutionary equations , has been his brain . since his death on 18 april 1955 scientists have studied , probed and analysed the organ that was inside the head of one of the greatest minds of the modern era . and previously it had been thought that his abnormal genius was due to a different or enlarged brain - but new research suggests that was n't the case , and his brain was just like the rest of humanity . claims that einstein may have had a unique brain , which accounted for his great intellect , are wide of the mark according to a new study . it suggests that previous research of the genius 's brain were flawed and do n't actually prove there was anything special about it . in 1985 , a study by diamond et al claimed that einstein 's brain had a much higher number of glial cells than those of a more moderate intellect . he proposed there was an elementary particle responsible for transferring light - the photon . he developed his theory of special relativity , which described how time slowed as an object or particle approached the speed of light . his famous mass-energy equivalence equation , more commonly known as e = mc ² , suggested matter was a form of energy . this led to the development of nuclear power and nuclear weapons . meanwhile , his theory of general relativity linked space and time interact with each other , known as space-time . glial cells , also known as neuroglia , are those that provide support and protection for neurons in the brain , with an increase in them thought to possibly indicate a higher brain power . but new research by dr terence hines of pace university in new york suggests this and other studies were flawed - and there was actually nothing special about the brain at all , reports discover magazine 's neuroskeptic . einstein 's brain is itself a cause of some controversy - upon his death in 1955 it is rumoured that he had requested his entire body be cremated . but pathologist thomas stoltz harvey was keen to preserve the greatest mind of a generation , and instead removed the brain just seven and a half hours after his death . although at the time this was against the wishes of the theoretical physicist , his son hans later gave his blessing for the brain to be used for science according to national geographic . this led to that inaugural study in 1985 , on which harvey was a co-author , and since then numerous other scientists have suggested einstein 's brain was special in some regard . in his new paper , however , dr hines disagrees . a specimen of nobel physicist albert einstein 's brain is seen in a glass slide at an exhibition at the wellcome collection in london on 27 march 2012 . since his death in 1955 einstein 's brain has been meticulously studied , but scientists are apparently no closer to finding out what made him so smart . first , he says of 28 tests done in 1985 comparing einstein 's brain to other ` control ' brains , only one was deemed significantly accurate by the researchers at the time . furthermore , claims dr hines , other microscopic analyses ` found essentially no differences between his brain and that of the controls ' . the studies were famously performed with slices of einstein 's brain , but of that dr hines said : ` to believe that the analyses of one or a few tiny slices of a single brain could reveal anything related to the specific cognitive abilities of that brain is naïve ' . he suggests that observers should perform a ` blind test ' of einstein 's brain and others , to see if they notice anything that makes it stand out . ` if there are actual differences , such an experimental methodology would reveal them , ' writes dr hines . einstein also famously once wrote himself that he thought he had a great degree of control over his brain -- he said his thoughts were not only visual , but muscular as well . again , however , dr hines debunks these comments as worthless in actual neuroscience , saying it is not possible to perform accurate research of his brain based on a few things he said . it seems in death , after life , einstein continues to confound scientists across the world of all disciplines . one of einstein 's most famous equations was the mass-energy equivalence -lrb- pictured -rrb- that proposed matter was a form of energy . this led to the creation of the first nuclear weapons , of which einstein once said : ' i know not with what weapons world war 3 will be fought , but world war 4 will be fought with sticks and stones '", "summary": " previous studies have suggested that einstein had an abnormal brain .   but a new study by dr hines says that research may have been flawed .   einstein 's brain was ` stolen ' from his body hours after his death in 1955 .   it has since been studied extensively , with some claiming it was unique .   some researchers say his ` special ' brain accounted for his greater intellect .
