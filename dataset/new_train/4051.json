{"text": "within minutes of the news of his death , the backlash started . in the comments section of his cnn.com obituary , on twitter feeds , in blog posts . nelson mandela should n't be revered as a civil rights icon , the statements screamed : he should be exposed for what he is : a communist . a terrorist . a racist . to be sure , mandela ca n't be neatly grouped with mahatma gandhi or martin luther king , jr. . unlike them , he was n't always the pacifist he was known for in his later life . but should that be grounds for such bile-spewing vitriol ? we take a look at the three most common sentiments in these online accusations and put them in context . contention 1 : . nelson mandela was a communist . what they 're saying : .  before you go all wet and runny over mandela , remember he was a communist , and he never changed his views .   so nelson mandela was a communist who supported saddam hussein and befriended gadaffi apparently ...  what 's the basis : . mandela was branded a communist by the white apartheid government , which made it a crime to be one . and it was a label the united states was all too content to accept . the cold war between the united states and the russian soviet union was in full swing . the soviets had constructed the berlin wall just months before , and the world was dividing up into opposing camps -- allies of the united states or allies of the soviet union and china . this included many african nations . south africa 's government came down on the side of the west -- and communist or not , mandela was squarely on the other side . what 's the truth : . mandela 's close association with marxists goes back at least to the 1940s , when he was enrolled in law school . he began a life-long friendship with joe slovo ,  an ardent communist ,  the anti-apartheid icon wrote in his autobiography  long walk to freedom .  mandela described slovo as of the people ,  without whom i would have accomplished very little .  a watershed moment tightly bonded mandela to slovo and other communist allies . police gunned down 69 unarmed protesters in the town of sharpville in march 1960 . then the government banned the communist party and the african national congress , which fought for the freedom of black south africans . with slovo and other marxists , he co-founded the militia movement umkhonto we sizwe . it 's meaning :  spear of the nation .  on december 16 , 1961 , the group carried out its first attacks on government installations and handed out leaflets announcing its existence . but was mandela a dyed-in-the-wool communist ? not really , believes south african historian sampie terreblanche .  you must understand it all against the apartheid struggle .  mandela found the anc too tame and had begun to push for a violent struggle in the 1940s , when he headed its youth league , the former professor of economics at stellenbosch university said . the communists were for the use of violence , and terreblanche believes it led to the alliance . after his release from prison , mandela made some high-profile appearances with communist leaders . he visited fidel castro in cuba . and to commemorate the relaunch of south africa 's communist party in 1990 , he gave a speech . but he also made a point of distancing his own party .  the anc is not a communist party ,  he said . contention 2 : . nelson mandela was a terrorist . what they 're saying : .  it 's amazing we forget he was a terrorist   please explain how it is racist to point out that biographical articles about mandela are leaving out his terrorist actions pre-1991 .  what 's the basis : . the united states government placed mandela on a terror watch list , where he stayed until 2008 -- long after his term as president of south africa , and even longer after his receiving the nobel peace prize . he was placed on it because of his group 's militant fight against apartheid . at the time that umkhonto we sizwe carried out its first attacks , mandela was at its helm . the next year , in 1962 , he left for morocco and ethiopia , where he secretly studied guerrilla warfare . when mandela returned home later that year , he was arrested and charged with illegal exit of the country and incitement to strike . undeterred , umkhonto we sizwe built a militia and in 1963 made plans to start a civil war . police intercepted the plan and arrested mandela and other anc leaders . mandela received a sentence of life in prison . what 's the truth : . it 's true that mandela once believed that civil disobedience was not enough to vanquish racism and apartheid . he felt he had to decide between the better of two evils -- submit or fight . he may not have been directly behind the attacks , said hermann giliomee , a historian from south africa .  he was on the run , so i do n't think he had time for the planning on this .  giliomee finds the 1963 plan amateurish , not exactly the design of a master terrorist .  i think it 's a very naÃ ¯ ve plan with very little outlook for success ,  the former professor of political science at the university of cape town said . mandela changed his views on violence during his 27 years of incarceration . the rebel transformed into a pacifist .  as i walked out the door toward the gate that would lead to my freedom , i knew if i did n't leave my bitterness and hatred behind , i 'd still be in prison ,  mandela said after he was freed . contention 3 : . nelson mandela was a racist . what they 're saying : .  how convenient that we choose to ignore that he once sang , ` kill white people '   if apartheid was racist toward blacks , mandela was equally racist towards whites  what 's the basis : . umkhonto we sizwe beat the war drum against the  white supremacy  and  the white state .  its members often sang a song called  bring me my machine gun .  what 's the truth : . though he despised white minority rule that kept the black majority down , he did n't dislike whites .  he was rather strong against racism ,  terreblanche said .  the day before he was sent to robben island , he made a speech in parliament that he was against all forms of racism .  he was prepared to die for non-racialism , the historian said . joe slovo , one of mandela 's best friends , was white -- as were many other revolutionaries who joined him in the militant group .  umkhonto we sizwe is a new , independent body , formed by africans , it includes in its ranks south africans of all races ,  the group said in its manifesto . mandela has long espoused the way of reconciliation and called for there to be no racial violence in retribution for apartheid . in transitioning from the segregationist regime to a non-racial democracy , he partnered closely with his white predecessor , former president frederik willem de klerk , who shared the nobel peace prize with him . at a sports match in 1995 , as president , mandela made a gesture of support to white south africans that drew gasps . rugby was the dominant sport of white south africans of dutch heritage -- afrikaners -- and was reviled by blacks . during a world championship match against new zealand , mandela walked onto the pitch wearing the jersey of his team 's captain . the scene inspired the 2009 hollywood movie  invictus  directed by clint eastwood . the crowd began chanting his name . they were almost all white .", "summary": " a backlash poured in against mandela 's positive eulogies .   detractors accused him of being a communist , terrorist , racist .   there is some truth to some of the claims .   mandela had a close association with communists and cofounded a militant group .
