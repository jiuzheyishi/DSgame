{"text": "updated : . 18:23 est , 27 january 2012 . a tubby tom cat has become the country 's first ever feline to undergo knee-replacement surgery after vets ruled out amputating his cancer-stricken leg because of his size . cyrano , a 10-year-old kitty who weighs more than 20 pounds , has been helped by doctors and engineers at north carolina state university after cancer left his left hind leg almost useless . surgeon denis marcellin-little and university engineer ola harryssonare are at the forefront of osseointegration , a process in which a prosthetic limb is fused to a living bone . sitting kitty : cyrano awaits the operation to replace his knee that was weakened by cancer . he is joined by -lrb- left to right -rrb- engineer ola harrysson , surgeon denis marcellin-little and handler crystal ritenour . gadget : marcellin-little with the type of artificial cat knee joint - that can bend and rotate - used in cyrano 's leg . although a british doctor carried out a full knee replacement on a cat crushed by a car in 2009 , the surgery carried out by marcellin-little used materials more like those used for human operations . ` this is the most complex implant that nc state has made and really , in . all honesty , that anyone has built for any situation that i know of , ' marcellin-little , a french-born vet , told the associated press . the scientists used plastic and cobalt chromium alloy implant for the operation on cyrano , whose full name is mr. cyrano l. catte ii . ` it has a form of articulation that is unique - that allows the implant to bend and rotate , ' marcellin-little said . ` the devil is in the details . ' whiskered away : ten-year-old cyrano was in surgery for more than six hours in north carolina . mice work : vets operate on cyrano , believed to be the nation 's first recipient of a feline total-knee replacement . while these implants are commonplace in dogs , a cat 's small frame is harder to work with . cyrano 's damaged bones posed an extra challenge , marcellin-little told the ap . the new knee was made using a laser process that hardens metal powder to replicate his tiny bones . the two interconnecting parts each measure around two inches long . marcellin-little practiced the . procedure four times on plastic models ahead of the surgery , which took . around six-and-a-half hours to complete . the kitty is expected to be back on his paws in about a week - but wo n't be catching mice just yet . ` we would like him to take it easy for . about three months after surgery , ' marcellin-little said . ` and then we . will let him be himself . ' treating the process more as a research . project , much of the time and materials used were donated so a cost . estimate was impossible to make . but it cost owners sandra lerner and . len bosack around $ 20,000 . speaking from the waiting room , lerner told the ap that ` rat boy ' is worth every penny . cat scan : cyrano , who is now recovering , has a knee joint made from plastic and metal , as seen on the x-ray . on the mend : cyrano will be back on his feet within a week but will have to take it easy for three months . ` he 's my child . and if it were your child , would you begrudge the money ? ' she said . ' i have a personal philosophy that people are , at best , equal with the other inhabitants of the planet . and i 'm very , very grateful that i have the money and -lrb- am -rrb- able to do it . ' in 2009 , british vets used a stainless-steel joint for missy the cat 's knee after she was knocked down by a car . amputation was not an option as her . other hind leg had been broken in eight places . doctors faced putting . her down or finding another solution . family : owners sandra lerner and len bosack sit in a waiting room . the operation cost them $ 20,000 . the hinged implant was custom-designed based on a ct scan of missy 's knee and exactly fitted her measurements in terms of the size of her bones and the range of motion of her knee joint . it was bonded to the thigh and shin bones using cement . at the time , dr fitzpatrick said : ` the most difficult thing about the operation was miniaturising the implants and matching the hinge motion to allow walking , running and jumping , which cats do a lot of . ' a human patient with a knee replacement would probably walk and maybe even run but would rarely expect to jump . '", "summary": " cyrano underwent surgery after cancer left his leg weak and useless - but his body was too heavy to have it amputated .   surgeons used materials similar to those used in human knee operations .
