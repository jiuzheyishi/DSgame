{"text": "the chairman of the u.s. joint chiefs of staff , gen. martin dempsey , left the door open thursday to stepped-up u.s. military involvement in iraq if isis militants pose a threat to the united states . in response to a question about what the u.s. end game is in iraq , dempsey began by saying the u.s. military 's current role is much different from it was during the iraq war .  assessing and advising and enabling are very different words than attacking , defeating and disrupting ,  he said during a briefing at the pentagon in washington .  we may get to that point if our national interests drive us there , if -lrb- the islamic state in iraq and syria -rrb- becomes such a threat to the homeland that the president of the united states , with our advice , decides that we have to take direct action . i am just suggesting to you that we are not there yet .  dempsey also disputed the use of the term  mission creep  in iraq .  that 's the wrong phrase . the issue is mission match ,  he said .  we will match the resources we apply with the authorities and responsibilities that go with them based on the mission we undertake , and that is to be determined .  barzani : it 's time for referendum on independence . masoud barzani , the president of iraq 's semiautonomous kurdish region , told the regional parliament thursday that it is time to hold a referendum on the independence of kurdish areas . he said kurds should no longer have to wait on anybody to obtain the right of independence and told the kurdish parliament to begin taking steps to hold the referendum . last week , barzani announced that disputed areas , including kirkuk , were henceforth part of the kurdish autonomous region , after the iraqi central government failed to hold a long-awaited referendum . last month , the iraqi army withdrew from kirkuk , and kurdish peshmerga forces took control of the city and small villages in the areas as isis carried out its lightning offensive . the move by the kurds will probably complicate efforts to get iraqi lawmakers to form a new government representing all three major population groups -- sunnis , shiites and kurds . official : nuns , orphans missing . two nuns , who were thought to be under house arrest by isis militants , and three orphans have gone missing from an assyrian orthodox church in central mosul , the governor of nineveh province and witnesses told cnn on thursday . militants believed to be from the islamic state in iraq and syria initially barred the nuns from leaving miskintah church in the khazraj neighborhood in early june , gov. atheel al-nujaifi said . the two nuns manage an orphanage on the church grounds , and both are very well known to mosul residents , the residents say . residents in the neighborhood who were in touch with the nuns told cnn they had not been able to reach them on their cell phones since tuesday . on thursday , the residents forced their way into the church and said they could not find the nuns or three orphans . the two nuns were identified by the governor and the residents as sister hannah and sister uttor . indian nurses being moved . forty-six indian nurses being held by isis in former iraqi leader saddam hussein 's hometown of tikrit are being moved north , to the city of mosul , which is under control of the militant group , syed akbaruddin , the spokesman for india 's ministry of external affairs , said thursday at a news briefing . the news about the nurses follows reports that iraqi security forces have been battling isis militants for control of the city , north of baghdad , raising questions about whether isis is losing its grip on the area . maps : understanding the crisis . syed said his understanding is that the nurses have been moved for their own safety .  all of them are safe and unharmed ,  he said . asked whether the nurses were being held against their will , he said :  in zones of conflict , there 's no free will .  turkish truck drivers released . thirty-two turkish truck drivers who went missing in early june in mosul , when isis fighters swept through the city , have been released , turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu said thursday in a televised news conference carried by turkish television stations .  as a result of efforts and daily consultations for the past 23 days , now i am happy to say that our 32 drivers have been received by our consul general , and now our consul general is on the way to irbil with the drivers ,  davutoglu said . the drivers will then be flown to ankara , turkey , he said . there are still more than 40 staff members of the turkish consulate missing in iraq , davutoglu said . efforts continue  nonstop  for their safe return , he said . among those missing are special forces soldiers , diplomats and children , who were seized by isis militants on june 11 . baghdad bombings . a double bombing in baghdad 's predominantly shiite neighborhood of al-furhat left eight people dead and 17 wounded , police officials said early thursday . the blasts late wednesday night targeted people leaving the al-mustafa mosque after evening prayers in the neighborhood , which sits just 2 miles from baghdad international airport , the officials said . more than 16 people have been arrested in connection with the attack , officials said . they did not say whether those arrested were believed to be militants tied to isis . fighting in karbala . dozens were reportedly killed in days of fighting between iraqi security forces and followers of a prominent shiite cleric in the holy city of karbala , south of baghdad , authorities said thursday . the fighting raises concerns about whether infighting could fracture iraq 's shiite majority , potentially sparking further violence in a country already battling extremist sunni militants . the battle began tuesday when iraqi troops raided the offices of prominent shiite cleric mahmoud al-hassani al-sarkhi , sparking a battle with the cleric 's followers , they said . the raid came after the cleric 's followers blocked roads in and around shrines in karbala . al-sarkhi has been a fierce critic of prime minister nuri al-maliki and the united states . last week , he blamed some of the bloodshed on the country 's top shiite cleric , ayatollah ali al-sistani , who called for iraqis to take up arms against isis extremists . helicopters fired a number of times on the saif saad neighborhood , not far from the city 's famed holy shrines , on tuesday night , an employee at a shrine and a resident of karbala said . the aircraft again hovered over the area wednesday , as the city was placed on high alert and the streets remained empty of civilians . videos posted on youtube purported to show a firefight between iraqi forces and the cleric 's followers , including one that showed an iraq humvee burning as gunfire is heard in the distance . cnn can not confirm the authenticity of the videos . fighting in diyala , salaheddin provinces . iraqi security forces , with the help of volunteer fighters and sunni tribesmen , were carrying out an offensive thursday against isis fighters north of baquba in diyala province , security officials told cnn on thursday . the towns of al-dawaleeb and al-shohani , about 35 kilometers -lrb- 22 miles -rrb- north of baghdad , have been cleared of militants , the officials said . they said a number of isis fighters were killed and wounded during the operation , which lasted 7 hours . the officials say a large number of bombs were planted in both towns by isis , and iraqi forces were working to defuse them . meanwhile , state-run iraqi tv reported that a counterterrorism unit killed 88 extremists and destroyed 12 vehicles in salaheddin province thursday . it offered no evidence of the killings , and no further details were provided . cnn can not independently confirm the claims . maps : understanding the
