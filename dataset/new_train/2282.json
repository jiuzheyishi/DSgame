{"text": "mexico city  poor mexico , so far from god and so close to the united states ,  is something i heard a lot growing up in mexico in the 1980s . how that saying , first coined by president porfirio diaz around the turn of the 20th century , resonates today . with the u.s. election next door , mexico seems not only far from god , but forgotten . in the past six years , 60,000 people have died in drug-related violence . some say the death toll could be as high as 100,000 . yet the violence here did n't make it into the last u.s. presidential debate between barack obama and mitt romney . we may share a 2,000 mile border , but the view from here -- notwithstanding our trade relationship and the hunger for drugs in the u.s. that is fueling the bloodshed and flooding my country with weapons -- is that we 're truly off the radar . map : world weighs in on u.s. election .  we ca n't blame the u.s. for the violence in mexico ,  says anabel hernandez , an investigative journalist who has put her life on the line writing about mexico 's drug lords .  we have to look at our own corruption , the terrible impunity and lack of justice . we have to fix these problems ourselves , not wait for obama or romney . but that mexico did n't even warrant one line in the last debate , when we have thousands dead , and even two cia agents nearly killed in an ambush recently -- that tells you that the u.s. -- mexico relationship is not going to change .  so much has happened in mexico since outgoing president felipe calderón of the national action party -lrb- pan -rrb- declared war on organized crime in 2006 that it 's hard to keep pace with how much the country has changed . hard to come to grips with the pain of families i 've met during my years covering the drug war -- whose fathers , mothers , brothers , sisters , sons and daughters have come to an untimely and tragic end . postcard : is obama still kenya 's favorite son ? because it is hard to understand how we got here , i think back to the time when i was a child here -- back then , the institutional revolutionary party , or pri , dominated mexico -- and miles of walls across the country had the pri logo painted in mexico 's flag colors of green , white and red . one party , one ideology . one powerful broadcaster that fed us party propaganda . that was just the way it was . very early on , during family trips to texas , i learned that the u.s. meant choice . in the u.s. you could get a whole range of shoes , not just the boxy and nerdy pre-nafta shoes available to schoolchildren in mexico . it meant playing pac-man , watching the film  e.t. ,  not being spoon-fed soppy telenovelas . but the best , in my view : snickers and milky ways , not the slim , omnipresent carlos v chocolate bars available back home . postcard : nigerians enjoy election soap opera . the electoral process in mexico back then was just like its chocolate , not only insipid but worse -- a foregone conclusion . what we looked forward to was the  dedazo ,  when the president would figuratively wag his finger in the direction of his successor thereby naming his replacement . meanwhile in the u.s. , elections seemed much more colorful . one of my first memories of a u.s. election was of jimmy carter , the peanut farmer from georgia who talked about human rights vs. ronald reagan , the actor from california who talked about the  evil empire .  here were two very different men with two very different ideologies . in contrast , the stream of gray men running mexico endured . this period was marked by a couple of national tragedies -- the nationalization of the banks in 1982 , and the calamitous 1985 earthquake , which rocked the pri to its core . postcard : obama finds support among chavistas . in 1994 , on the eve of the zapatista rebellion , mexico joined the north american free trade agreement and for better or for worse , you could eventually get snickers bars in nearly every shop corner . at the same time the media was becoming freer and more robust . in mexico we have tended to see the u.s. elections through the prism of trade , as with nafta , or through immigration , as one out of every 10 mexicans lives in the u.s. . the 9/11 terrorist attacks shifted george w. bush 's focus from immigration to waging war in iraq and afghanistan . mexico , understandably , was not a priority . fast forward to 2006 , a little over five years into our nascent democracy with the pan in power after 71 years of autocratic pri rule : five severed heads were rolled into a nightclub in uruapan , michoacán . we were all stunned . this sort of thing did n't happen under the pri , and the violence has continued unabated to this day . postcard : why berliners , u.s. are kindred spirits .  there have been 30,000 killed in syria and 60,000 killed in mexico , many of whom the government says belonged to criminal groups . yet mexico did n't figure in the debate . it 's shocking , appalling and disturbing ,  says sergio aguayo , a political analyst here .  if mexico had been mentioned it may have been in the ` failed state ' category along with pakistan ,  counters andrés martinez of the new america foundation .  so a mention is not always a good thing .  in recent years i 've travelled back and forth to the front lines of the drug war , but i always return to the safety of mexico city , which so far seems to be cocooned from the bloodshed . postcard : war-scarred baghdad has little faith in election . but despite living in mexico city today , it 's hard not to see everything -- including the u.s. election -- through the very dark spectacles of the drug war .  that 's exactly the problem ,  says mexico city mayor marcelo ebrard , from the left-of-center party of democratic revolution -lrb- prd -rrb- . his government says it has significantly decreased crime in the last six years -- an improvement from when mexico city used to be a hotbed of crime . today victims of the drug war are taking refuge here , and even journalists from violence-ridden states are seeking exile in the capital . there is no denying that mexico city is going through some sort of renaissance . not only are the days of rampant kidnappings behind us , the capital 's also become more liberal , more culturally rich and more tolerant . postcard : obama 's ` hope ' a mirage for hostile pakistanis . yet , i tell ebrard , mexico city only seems safe because we 're comparing it to a level of violence we never had in the rest of the country .  imagine if we had a different strategy -- the tactic of confrontation -- to get rid of crime ,  ebrard told me .  we 'd have more blood .  as i write surrounded by boxes before an impending move to london , i see the pri 's comeback with president elect enrique peña nieto as a direct result of the pan 's failure . and i see mexico city as a reflection of what the rest of the country can one day become . as for god , he 's still very far away from here . and the u.s. elections ? largely irrelevant to most mexicans , except for eduardo cruz , a mexico city taxi driver who put it this way :  it does n't matter who wins the u.s. elections , they just better send the loser to sort things out here !
