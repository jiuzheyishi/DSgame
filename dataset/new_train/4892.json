{"text": "it could just blow up . but it seemed like pretty regular explosions .  kinsey traveled into the national park with two friends and recommends staying overnight .  the colors are so much more vivid ... it really is beautiful . we slept with our tents open so we could see it , and the tents face the volcano so we could see the explosions in the night .  orphaned gorillas find a safe haven . kinsey says he felt very at ease while on the trek despite the warnings about the region .  there are a lot of people walking around with guns , a lot of people walking around with ak-47s , carrying rocket launchers ... but obviously , if the national parks are confident that they can provide a safe experience then it 's safe ,  he says .  the rebel activity that is causing instability is not targeted at tourists . it is not really targeted at the rangers either . i felt safe .  he added :  i think that there will be a lot of interest -lrb- in volcano trekking -rrb- so now i just have to spread it out and get it out there that we can do this .  the impoverished central african country also made its debut at the world travel market in london in september this year , signaling to the world that it means business when it comes to boosting tourism revenue . in its efforts to promote tourism , the drc government , in conjunction with the institut congo pour la conservation de la nature -lrb- congolese wildlife authority -rrb- , has recently launched a tourism visa that can be obtained online through virunga 's website for $ 50 . drc borders uganda , burundi and rwanda at the junction of the rift valley lakes region , but despite the country 's more varied biodiversity , uganda and rwanda generate more revenue from the gorilla tourism trade , because of the instability in the area according to analysts euromonitor . many governments currently warn their citizens against traveling to the democratic republic of congo due to extreme security risks as a result of continued military activity . however , gocongo , a tourist operator in the area , describes the drc as a place of adventure . the company wrote on their website :  no one goes there to rest and sit in a chair for a couple of weeks . congo is an experience and asks for active people ... if you really need -lrb- five star -rrb- lodges , whisky on the rocks and your 20-channels television , please go somewhere else .  national park experts are unsure how long the volcano will continue to erupt , spraying vibrant lava and rocks into the sky . the virunga national park , a world heritage site has eight volcanoes that spread across the virunga mountain range , but only two are currently active . the 7,900 hectare site is also home to critically endangered mountain gorillas .  the area where the eruption is taking place is an area that has been affected by eruptions for around two-and-a half-years ... our mountain gorillas do n't live in that area . they are about 50 kilometers away so they are completely untouched ,  says virunga national park development officer cai tjeenk willak said .", "summary": " virunga national park in the drc is inviting tourists on overnight treks to see an erupting volcano .   eight volcanoes are found in the vicinity of the national park but only two are currently active .   surrounding wildlife , like the endangered mountain gorillas , are out of harm 50 km away .
