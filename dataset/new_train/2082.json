{"text": "the u.s. government pleaded saturday for north korean authorities to release 85-year-old merrill newman , with a spokeswoman saying officials are  deeply concerned  about him and another american being held in the isolated east asian nation .  given mr. newman 's advanced age and health conditions , we urge -lrb- north korea -rrb- to release mr. newman so he may return home and reunite with his family ,  said national security council spokeswoman caitlin hayden . washington 's plea came on the day north korean state media released print stories and video showing what they called newman 's  apology .  university of california , berkeley professor steven weber characterized it as  highly scripted political theater .  so how did an elderly retired financial consultant and korean war veteran become the central figure in an international dispute ? why is there such animosity still tied to a conflict , the korean war , that ended six decades ago ? and why is this all unfolding now ? weber , a former consultant to the u.s. commission on national security , has a theory :  they are trying to get the western media to pay attention .  with the notable exception of its longtime ally china , north korea is in many ways a pariah state bogged down by what many view as decades of repressive leadership . at the same time , the communist nation has had difficulties getting enough energy to power their country and food for their people . largely shut off from the rest of the world , its leaders and state media often use saber-rattling rhetoric to unite citizens against what weber described as  nasty outsiders  -- which , not coincidentally , are chiefly south korea and the united states , just as during the korean war . the discord in recent years has centered mostly on north korea 's nuclear and missile programs , with the international community taking punitive measures such as economic sanctions to hold pyongyang in check . north korea has n't been alone . iran , too , has long been an international target because of its nuclear program , though that landscape has changed with the recent diplomatic accord . that fact may not be lost on pyongyang , said weber , who surmised north korea may be particularly eager to get the world 's focus and , ideally , concessions in the process . added weber :  if the iran thing gets settled peacefully , then guess who 's left ?  wife , son beg for his release . elderly man not only american detained . newman is not the only american being detained in north korea . in her statement , hayden also asked for the release of kenneth bae , who was arrested in november 2012 in north korea . last may , bae was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor after north korea 's government found him guilty of  hostile acts  and attempts to topple the government .  we are thankful that the white house has advocated for the release of both mr. newman and my brother , kenneth bae ,  said terri chung , bae 's sister .  it has been a devastating experience for my brother and my family , so we pray every day for his release . now we 're including mr. newman in our prayers . we can not forget about these two men . for every action that the us government takes toward his release , we are thankful .  chung has said bae suffers from chronic health conditions that require doctors ' care , including hypertension , diabetes and an enlarged heart . on monday , chung said ailments her brother suffered before his detainment -- back problems and radiating leg pain -- worsened while he was forced to work long hours daily in a labor camp . he has lost 50 pounds since he was detained , she added . the bae family has been in  sheer pain and agony  since his detainment , chung said . other detained americans . unique case . newman 's age , and the circumstances surrounding his detention , are unique . according to his family , the palo alto , california , resident had gone on a 10-day organized private tour of north korea in october . from phone calls and postcards he sent , the trip was going well and there was no indication of any kind of problem , son jeff newman said . the day before he was to leave ,  one or two korean authorities  met with newman and his tour guide , the son added . they talked about newman 's service record , which left  my dad ... a bit bothered ,  according to jeff newman . then , just minutes before his beijing-bound plane was set to depart pyongyang in late october , he was taken off the aircraft by north korean authorities . newman 's weeks-long detention is complicated by the fact that , according to his son jeff , he suffers from a heart condition . sweden 's ambassador to north korea visited newman on saturday where he is being held at pyongyang 's yanggakdo hotel and delivered his medication , his family said .  as a result of the visit , we know that merrill is in good health ,  the family added .  merrill reports that he is being well treated and that the food is good .  the newmans went on to thank the ambassador and  express appreciation for the cooperation of the dprk government in allowing the visit to take place .   we are asking that the dprk authorities take into account his health and his age and , as an act of humanitarian compassion , allow him to depart immediately for home ,  the family said .  all of us want this ordeal to end and for the 85-year-old head of our extended family to be with us once more .  reported apology : ' i have been guilty of big crimes ' until saturday , the north korean government had n't said why it held newman . american accused of spying issues ` apology ' the explanation came in the form of a published apology from newman , as well as accompanying images of him thumbprinting his handwritten note and talking about his experiences . atop the first of the four pages is the word  apology ,  according to video released by north korea . the end of the last page is dated november 9 -- indicating newman made his reported admission more than 20 days ago . why might pyongyang have waited 21 days , then , to make the admission public ? that 's another one of the mysteries surrounding this case . in the note , newman talked about his having advised the kuwol unit , part of the  intelligence bureau  fighting against pyongyang in the korean war . he detailed how he commanded troops to collect  information  and wage various deadly attacks .  after i killed so many civilians and -lrb- north korean -rrb- soldiers and destroyed strategic objects in the dprk during the korean war , i committed indelible offensive acts against the dprk government and korean people ,  newman said , according to the  apology  reported by kcna . the reported message also touches on his return 60 years later to north korea , admitting that he  shamelessly ... had a plan to meet any surviving soldiers and pray for the souls of the dead soldiers .   i have been guilty of big crimes against the dprk government and the korean people again ,  newman adds in the  apology .  his statement ends :  if i go back to -lrb- the -rrb- usa , i will tell the true features of the dprk and the life the korean people are leading .  in addition to this statement , kcna ran a story alleging newman came to north korea with a tourist group in october and afterward  perpetrated acts of infringing upon the dignity and sovereignty of the dprk and slandering its socialist system .  this story claimed that newman tried to  look for spies and terrorists who conducted espionage and subversive activities against the dprk .  investigators determined that , as a member of the u.s. military , he  masterminded espionage and subversive activities ... and , in this course , he was involved in the killings of service personnel of the korean people 's army and innocent civilians .   the investigation clearly proved newman 's hostile acts against the dprk , and they were backed by evidence ,  the kcna story added .  he admitted all his crimes .  is american man a bargaining chip ? newman 's fate , north korea 's thinking unclear . just five days ago , his wife , lee , said she hoped he would be home for thanksgiving .  we need to have merrill back at the head of the table for the holidays ,  lee newman told cnn 's wolf blitzer .  and we ask -- respectfully -- for them to release him and let him come home .  one day before thanksgiving , rep. charlie rangel -- who himself was wounded fighting in the korean war -- released a letter urging north korean leader kim jong un  to release him immediately .  noting newman 's medical issues , the new york democrat implored kim to  have the heart to reunite him with his loved ones and those who can provide proper care .  rangel also reflected on the 1950s war , as well as the current state of affairs between the key players .  i believe that mr. newman , like myself and others who have fought during the korean war six decades ago , wants to see a united korea in our lifetime ,  wrote the congressman .  while progress has been slow on the political front , i am confident it can be advanced on humanitarian grounds .  so will there be fresh movement in newman 's case ? will his reported apology pave the way for his release or will it be followed , like bae , with a lengthy prison sentence ? as of saturday , nobody -- at least nobody outside of north korea -- seems to know . as weber , the berkeley professor said :  when it comes to north korea , nobody knows very much .  cnn 's chelsea j. carter , ashley killough and nancy baker contributed to this report .", "summary": " merrill newman was detained in north korea in october , after a trip to the asian nation .   state news said he  apologized  for crimes , including killings during korean war .   family of another detained american thanks the white house for seeking their release .   an expert says that north korea is trying to get the world 's attention .
