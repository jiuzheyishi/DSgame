' mr yeo 's interests in the green industry are believed to top # 1million . in his statement , mr yeo said : ` i am -lsb- standing aside -rsb- solely to ensure the smooth running of the committee during the next few weeks . ` i firmly believe that i have not breached the mps ' code of conduct in any respect and therefore await the outcome of the commissioner 's investigation with confidence . ` in particular i absolutely and unreservedly deny the allegation that i coached a witness with whom i have a business connection before that person gave evidence to the committee . ' i do not wish the commissioner 's investigation to be a distraction from the committee 's important work . i believe that during the past three years the committee has been extremely effective and i want this to continue . ' undercover reporters posed as representatives of a green energy firm looking to hire mr yeo and filmed their conversation . mr yeo has been under pressure to . resign from the committee after a newspaper investigation appeared to . show him claiming he could exert influence behind the scenes for private . companies . he was filmed . apparently bragging that he had privately coached the director of the . firm -- to which he has financial links -- on how to influence the . committee . in . reality , he was speaking to undercover reporters posing as . representatives of a green energy firm looking to hire him on a salary . of # 7,000 a day . mr yeo said he could introduce them . to ` really all the key players in the uk government ' , and guide them on . how to give evidence to his own committee of mps . the . mp , who served as an environment minister in john major 's government , . has earned about # 400,000 from consulting work for various green . companies . in the video he appeared to suggest that he had coached a client , john smith , managing director of gb rail freight , on how to influence the committee - a meeting at which he excused himself asking questions because of the conflict of interest . ' i was able to tell him in advance what he should say , ' he said . but mr yeo denied any wrong doing earlier today . he told bbc radio wales : ` what happened was i travelled with the person concerned in the company of two other people five days before his appearance before the committee in a train . ` during that conversation i spoke very briefly to him about his forthcoming appearance in front of the committee , so i could explain to him that because of the business connection between us - which , of course , was properly declared and registered - i would n't take part in questioning . ' i did not do so , i did not coach john smith as the paper alleges , he 's not a paying client as the paper alleges , and like many business executives giving evidence to select committees , he actually sought advice from the public affairs company which his company retains for that purpose . ' mps and campaigners said the footage was ` damning ' and called for him to stand down . westminster has been embroiled in a scandal this week about mps and peers handing lobbyists more than 200 parliamentary passes despite mounting concern about their influence . mr yeo , whose committee scrutinises . new energy laws , was recorded at a restaurant by sunday times reporters . posing as representatives of a solar energy firm who asked for his help . he would have to . declare such an interest , and was filmed saying he could not speak out . for them in the house of commons because ` people will say he 's saying . this because of his commercial interest ' . however , he reportedly assured them : ` what i say to people in private is another matter altogether . ' the mp for south suffolk has taken various paid roles at green firms since taking over the chairmanship of the committee in 2010 . he also has shares and options worth about # 583,000 in low-carbon firms that have employed him . the house of commons code of conduct prohibits members from acting as paid advocates .

' tim yeo mp . he is the latest politician to be . implicated in the ` westminster for sale ' scandal by the sunday times . it . was revealed last week that three peers had agreed to ask parliamentary . questions and lobby ministers for paying clients . lords mackenzie , . cunningham and laird all deny the claims . tory mp margot james wrote on twitter that the allegations were ` damning ' . she said ` paid consultancy and directorships relevant to committee work surely incompatible with chairing -lsb- a -rsb- committee ' . matthew sinclair , of the taxpayers ' alliance , said : ` tim yeo appears to have been caught red-handed in a disgusting attempt to bend the rules . ` mr yeo should resign but , more importantly , the government should reconsider its disastrous energy policies that reward this sort of behaviour . ' mr yeo apparently told the reporters he could commit to at least one day a month , despite already holding four private jobs and negotiating to take a further two . he said : ` if you want to meet the right people , i can facilitate all those introductions and i can use the knowledge i get from what is quite an active network of connections .
