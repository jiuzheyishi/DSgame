{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- a special team of hotshot corvette restorers has dealt a blow against an evil sinkhole that desecrated the national corvette museum in bowling green , kentucky . this week general motors and chevrolet unveiled the 2009 zr1 blue devil -- the first of three damaged cars that will be restored from a disaster that stunned corvette fans around the world . remember ? back in february , a freakish sinkhole appeared inside the museum , swallowing eight beautiful machines with an estimated value at about $ 1 million , the museum said . when the cars were hauled out of the hole , only three were deemed unscathed enough for restoration . hey , this is a big deal . experts call the corvette the most collected car in america . gm says it 's the  world 's longest-running , continuously produced passenger car .  the blue devil is no ordinary corvette . even though it 's only 5 years old , it 's been dubbed a  supercar  and  legendary  with a top speed of more than 200 mph . the sleek demon went on display for the first time on monday during a ceremony at the big specialty equipment marketing association show in las vegas . it 's not often car restorers get a chance to rescue a vehicle this special . this job was handled by a 10-member team with a less-than-sexy handle : gls -- global logistics services .  we need to come up with a better name -- like the corvette restoration swat team !  laughed gm spokesman monte doran . it may feel like a big win for the corvette nation against the forces of nature -- but now may be a bit too soon to crow about it .  that car really had very little damage done to it , compared to all the other cars in the sinkhole . it was a relatively easy restoration ,  doran said . that news will please cnn commenters who joked that the damage to the cars could be  buffed out  -- as easily as paint scratches . the biggest challenge , he acknowledged , will be the 1 millionth corvette , the 1992 convertible which was the millionth ` vette to come off the assembly line . fixing a hole . but what about that hole ? this coming monday , work is set to begin to fill the 30-foot-deep sinkhole which ruined the museum 's bright yellow , red-spired skydome . estimated cost of the eight-month project : $ 3.2 million .  they 'll be bringing in equipment and moving cars out of the room , before they start work on the sinkhole ,  said museum spokeswoman katie frassinelli . the museum had initially considered leaving the hole unfilled as a permanent display -- perhaps because the disaster has been good for business . in the months since the earth opened up and snatched these precious cars from our midst , visitors to the museum have increased by 71 % over the same period last year , she said . folks have been able to see the hole safely through a glass window . also on display , are five cars that were pulled from the hole -- but were too wrecked to be restored : . -- a 1984 ppg pace car . -- a 1993 ruby red  40th anniversary corvette  -- a 2001 mallett hammer z06 corvette . -- the 2009 white  1.5 millionth corvette  -- a 1993 zr-1 spyder . but visitors said they wanted more . so the museum has started selling jars full of dirt from the sinkhole for $ 10 a pop .  they asked for it ,  frassinelli said .  the dirt has little bits of fiberglass in it from the cars .  the road ahead for the remaining two salvageable cars is a bumpy one . a 1962 beauty dubbed the  black corvette  is just too old for gm to handle . the company says it no longer has the institutional knowledge required to properly put it back in shape . that job is expected to be done by a hand-picked restoration specialist team , frassinelli said .  we have n't identified who 's fixing it yet .  gm has accepted the challenge of restoring the worst-damaged of the salvageable cars : the 1 millionth corvette . it  has much , much more damage than the blue devil ,  doran said . it 's  going to be a much harder , much longer process . simply because the car is older so it 's hard to get replacement parts . we do n't have all the expertise in house that we do with current corvettes like the blue devil .  one of the biggest decisions is how many of the parts on the car should be replaced .  one of the guys in design calls it a ` respectful restoration , '  doran said .  you want to keep as much of the original components as you possibly can to preserve the history of the car .  restoration on the 1 millionth corvette is set to begin in january , doran said , and the job is expected to take about six months . chevrolet 's total contribution to the museum : $ 250,000 . an agreement with gm allows the museum to keep the insurance money for the blue devil and spyder -- which are both owned by gm -- in addition to paying to fix the blue devil , the 1962 black corvette and the 1992 1 millionth , frassinelli said . meanwhile , the blue devil will be back home soon . packed with loving care in a special enclosed truck by special handlers , doran said it is expected to head to the museum around saturday . when it gets there , workers will roll it back into the holy church of the corvette nation , where for generations to come , visitors will talk about how it survived the great corvette sinkhole of 2014 .", "summary": " gm unveils first restored corvette from national corvette museum sinkhole disaster .   a 2009 blue devil zr1 was shown publicly monday in las vegas .   it 's the first of three corvettes slated to be restored ; five other corvettes were too damaged .   a $ 3.2 million project to fix the giant sinkhole at the museum begins monday .
