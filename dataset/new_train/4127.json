{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- a year ago at the australian open , stan wawrinka achieved something not done in five years . he became the first man outside tennis '  big four  to win a major since juan martin del potro in 2009 . the women 's champion was less surprising , in the form of the now retired li na . with this year 's opening grand slam starting monday , here are seven things to watch as the tennis season bursts into life . rafa 's comeback . if rafael nadal wins in melbourne , he might cherish his second title more than his first . that 's because after beating roger federer in a thrilling five-set final in 2009 , melbourne park has been less than kind to the 14-time grand slam champion on the health front . check out this list : in 2010 he retired with a knee injury , a year later he suffered a hamstring injury in his quarterfinal and last year a back problem surfaced while warming up for the final . it was the clear turning point and wawrinka took advantage . it was his long-time rival federer who wept after losing to nadal in 2009 , but it was the spaniard 's turn to cry in 2014 . nadal has n't competed at a grand slam since wimbledon , having skipped the u.s. open with a wrist complaint , and his buildup has been marred by two bad losses in the middle east . but friday 's draw for 2015 's first major was kind to nadal . he appears to have a smooth path to the semifinals . should nadal somehow be the last man standing , only two triumphs would separate him and 17-time grand slam winner federer . serena 's quest for 19 . if it was an odd-numbered year over the last decade , chances are that serena williams won the australian open . she took home the title in 2003 , 2005 , 2007 and 2009 . but williams ' recent appearances mirror nadal 's . there was the ankle she hurt at a warm-up tournament in 2012 that led to a fourth-round exit in melbourne . in 2013 a back injury was probably to blame for a quarterfinal loss and last year the back flared up again in the quarterfinals . williams ' play early in 2015 is sure to have worried her fans , too . the 18-time grand slam singles winner complained of a lack of energy at the hopman cup in perth and subsequently split two of her four singles matches . like nadal , williams ' longest grand slam drought now happens to be in melbourne . she won the u.s. open in september by topping her bff , caroline wozniacki , but they ca n't face off in the australian open final since they 're in the same quarter . roger 's bid for one more major . with nadal 's performances patchy , world no. 1 novak djokovic getting off to a less than stellar start in 2015 and andy murray struggling for grand slam form , the 33-year-old federer ca n't be discarded . while federer did n't have to face any of his fellow  big four  members as he shone in brisbane -- where he collected his 1,000 th match win -- he defeated two players thought of as outside grand slam contenders in 2015 . he dispatched milos raonic in the final having routed grigor dimitrov in the semifinals . aiding federer would have been a kind draw , but unfortunately for him , it did n't happen . he found himself in the same quarter as murray and same half as nadal . eugenie bouchard and the genie army . can the  genie army  propel eugenie bouchard to glory ? although she showed flashes in 2013 , last year in melbourne was when the tennis world truly took note of the 20-year-old . her semifinal showing was n't an anomaly , with bouchard then reaching the last four at the french open and the final at wimbledon . but bouchard could n't duplicate her success from august onwards , the low point perhaps coming at the year-end championships where she failed to win a set in her three matches . fatigue no doubt played a role . bouchard arrives in melbourne this year without a permanent coach , and you wonder how high her confidence is . the return of juan martin del potro . only the grinch would n't be happy that del potro is back playing tennis . skipping most of last year with further wrist troubles , his supporters must have been holding their breath when the argentine pulled out of brisbane . but he returned in sydney this week -- unsure of how his left wrist would cope -- and made the quarterfinals . the pain has n't gone away yet , he said . none of the contenders would want to face del potro early , though only the very optimistic would suggest he could win a second major over the coming fortnight . maybe claiming a few rounds and coming through the tournament unscathed would be enough for him . he does n't face a top-10 player in his opener but it 's still an enticing -- and imposing -- encounter . the 6-foot-6  tower of tandil  plays 2013 wimbledon semifinalist jerzy janowicz , who stands 6-foot-8 . simona halep 's opening major ? in an era where players on the women 's tour all seem to be towering 6-footers , simona halep -- 5-foot-6 -- is an exception . she still packs a punch from the baseline , but it 's her use of angles that so often gets her into winning positions in rallies . her backhand is one of the best around . if halep 's breakthrough was in 2013 , she went one better last year by making the difficult jump into the top 10 and top five . how close was the romanian to winning the french open ? very . she extended one of the game 's top competitors , sharapova , to 6-4 in the third set of the final . halep -- the most clicked on player on the wta 's website last year -- began this year with a title in shenzhen . a high-profile home hope . who is the top australian hope ? the rankings will tell you it 's samantha stosur , who like del potro is a u.s. open winner . she 's the world no. 20 on the women 's tour . but stosur has never really flourished at the australian open , and she has n't been shy to admit that nerves have been a huge factor . only once since 2007 has stosur -- armed with arguably the best second serve in the women 's game -- exceeded the third round . australians are probably banking on nick kyrgios , the athletic 19-year-old who stunned nadal at wimbledon , to have an extended run . kyrgios chose to take a break in september , saying he was  burnt out ,  and injuries have crept up . he missed the hopman cup with a sore back . so expecting too much from kyrgios may be a mistake .", "summary": " the australian open starts monday in melbourne .   rafael nadal makes his grand slam comeback .   serena williams seeks a 19th career major .   roger federer enters with momentum after 1,000 th win .
