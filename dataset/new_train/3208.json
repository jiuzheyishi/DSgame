{"text": "this eerie ghost-like figure left a group of trekkers stunned when it suddenly appeared over a mountain range , but it was nothing more than the rare natural phenomenon known as a brocken spectre . ukrainian photographer , mikhail baevsky . was part of the trekking group which came across . the unusual spectacle at chatyr-dag mountain region , in crimea , . southern ukraine . but the ghostly figure mr baevsky photographed is actually his own shadow magnified hundreds of times as it is cast upon the surface of clouds opposite the sun . scroll down for video ! tricks of the shade : this ghostly figure left a group of trekkers quaking in their walking boots after it appeared in the ukraine 's chatyr-dag mountain region . illusion : the creepy figure which appeared in front of a dramatic mountain . backdrop is actually a natural phenomenon known as a brocken spectre . brocken spectres are often accompanied by brilliant multi-coloured ` halos ' of light around the figure creating an ethereal effect . like with a rainbow , this is caused by light refracting through tiny droplets of water in the air . the phenomenon of refraction , as illustrated on pink floyd 's dark side of the moon album cover -lrb- above -rrb- , occurs when light rays are bent as they pass through different transparent materials - in this case water and air . when a beam crosses between the two materials the wavelength of the light changes . as light is made up of several colors , when it is refracted these colors can bend at different amounts and become individually visible . the pink floyd cover shows a triangular glass prism with a beam of light moving through the two sides causing the different colors to bend and break out in a rainbow . water in the air acts as tiny prisms so when light enters the raindrop , it reflects off the sides of the drop and is broken into a spectrum . another example of refraction would be a drinking . straw in glass of water . when viewed from the side the straw appears to . be broken at the point it enters the water due to the difference in the . densities of water and air . the stunning illusions are created when a low sun shines behind someone looking down into fog from a ridge . the heads of the figures are often surrounded by rings of coloured light , an effect caused by the diffraction of visible light . to add to the frightening effect , the ghostly figures can sometimes appear to move , often very suddenly , due to the drifting of the clouds . photographer mikhail , 61 , a university chemistry lecturer , trekked up to 1,200 metres above the cloud levels to get a glimpse of the phenomenon . he said : ' i love being out taking pictures and even when it gets down to . some freezing temperatures around -15 degrees i 'm still out climbing the . mountains looking for the perfect image . ` as . a scientist , i know the physics behind why this shape happens but . because that day i saw this a few times it was as if i was being chased . by a ghost . ` the beginning of the day was so cloudy that i just presumed that i would n't be able to capture anything . ` we . were tempted to turn back at 900 metres because it was so cloudy but . i 'm really glad we persevered and carried on heading up as at around . 1,200 metres the fog started to clear otherwise i 'd never have been able . to see this . ' the brocken spectre got its name because of early sightings on the brocken , the highest peak of germany 's harz mountains . it . can appear on any misty mountainside or cloud bank , or even on some . occasions , from an aeroplane so long as the conditions are right . although it may look like the arrival of a spook this is in fact an example of the brocken spectre phenomenon . the extraordinary sight is created by the light behind a climber casting their shadow often in an odd triangular shape . the heads of the figures are often surrounded by rings of coloured light , an effect caused by the diffraction of visible light . amazingly , . the ghostly figures can sometimes appear to move rapidly when the cloud . layer moves or there are variations in its density . german . scientist johann silberschlag first observed the phenomenon in 1780 but . since then they have been seen and recorded many times in the region . the extraordinary sight involves the light behind a climber casting their shadow often in an odd triangular shape . the shadow can also fall on water droplets of varying differences from the observer 's eye causing confused depth perception . the clever illusions are created when low sun shines behind someone looking down into fog from a ridge . photographer mikhail baevsky was part of a trekking group who were left stunned when they came across the unusual spectacle at chatyr - dag mountain region , in crimea , southern ukraine . among . mountain climbers though there is a superstition that whoever sees a . brocken spectre will die in the mountains the very next day . the team also headed up angar-buran and eklizi-burun mountains in search of a sighting . the region is famous for the stunning landscapes and breath-taking wonders which attract people from all over the world .", "summary": " brocken spectre is actually a person 's shadow cast onto low-lying clouds .   light diffraction causes figures to be surrounded by a multi-coloured ` halo '   stunning examples photographed in ukraine 's chatyr-dag mountain region .   according to climbers ' superstition , whoever sees one will die the next day .
