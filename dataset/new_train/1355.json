{"text": "given the choice , world war ii veteran phillip coon probably would n't want the formality and fuss of being honored on a military base with men and women standing at attention , dressed in full regalia -- even if it was with a fistful of long-overdue medals he waited decades to receive . so it 's fitting that the awards were presented to the humble tulsa-area man monday evening in an informal ceremony at the tulsa international airport , with family and fellow veterans in attendance and little pomp and circumstance . the 94-year-old survivor of a pow labor camp and the bataan death march received the prisoner of war medal , bronze star and the combat infantryman badge after he and his son , michael , returned from a trip to japan to promote understanding and healing with the u.s. scroll down for video . hero : phillip coon , 94 , finally received the prisoner of war medal , bronze star and the combat infantryman badge for service in world war ii . humble : ` i 've been blessed to come this far in life , ' coon said , a tear streaming down one cheek .
