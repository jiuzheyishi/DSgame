{"text": "washington the new congress is still a month and a half away from being seated , but the battle for the next congress is already heating up . and the fight for the 2014 senate may end up being the most compelling storyline as the dawn of the midterm campaign approaches . after failing to take advantage of a golden opportunity to win back control of the chamber this year , the gop gets another chance in 2014 . the democrats , with big victories in the 2008 election , will be defending 20 of the 33 senate seats up for grabs in 2014 . if it sounds familiar , it is . thanks to their success in the 2006 midterms , the democrats defended 23 of the 33 seats up for grabs last week . in fact , they expanded their majority by at least one seat and probably two -- depending on which party independent angus king , the senator-elect from maine , caucuses with -- from their current 53-47 majority . analysis : it 's never too early to talk about 2016 .  it would be easy for someone to say the democrats ` were on the defensive in 2012 and they did just fine , ' but i do n't think any two election cycles are exactly the same . we have to see what the political environment looks like ; we have to see what candidates and nominees emerge ; we have to see what kind of retirements we have . those are the factors that play into how successful a party will ultimately be in the upcoming election ,  says nathan gonzales , deputy editor of the non-partisan rothenberg political report . and the current lame-duck session between now and the end of the year could also impact the next election . difficult votes on avoiding the fiscal cliff in 2012 could come back to haunt some senators facing difficult primary or general election challenges in 2014 . among the most vulnerable democratic senators up for re-election in 2014 are -lrb- in alphabetical order -rrb- : mark begich of alaska , max baucus of montana , kay hagan of north carolina , tim johnson of south dakota , mary landrieu of louisiana and mark pryor of arkansas . democrats may also have some open seats to defend . sen. frank lautenberg of new jersey is an obvious candidate to retire . he 'll be 90 by november 2014 . and jay rockefeller of west virginia will be 77 by the midterms . republicans and democrats proclaim optimism on fiscal cliff deal .  there are some vulnerabilities on the democratic side , but a lot of it depends on how popular the president is in the midterms and the quality of the republican challengers against these democratic senators ,  adds gonzales . a senior gop strategist argues that president barack obama 's victory last week makes it tougher for some of those senate democrats facing challenging re-elections .  the irony of this past election is that if you 're mary landrieu , mark pryor , tim johnson or other targeted democrats , it would have been easier for each of them politically if president obama had not been re-elected . because the president 's liberal , big government agenda , and their longtime support for it , will undoubtedly play an even greater role in each of their races next cycle ,  says the strategist , who spoke to cnn on the condition of anonymity . but the democratic senatorial campaign committee , the group that focuses on getting democrats elected to the senate , disagrees .  last week 's results proved that conventional wisdom is often wrong , especially two years out from election day . we 've proven we can win in red states , we can overcome steep spending deficits , and we can defy the odds even when the map is tilted against us . remember only two democratic incumbents have lost reelection in eight years ,  dscc communications director matt canter tells cnn . opinion : conservatives , do n't despair . the 2014 geography seems friendlier to the gop . of the 13 republican seats up for grabs next november , only susan collins of maine comes from a state that 's not solidly red . the moderate republican senator has n't said if she 'll retire or run for another term in 2014 . some of the republicans up for re-election , including minority leader mitch mcconnell , could face potential primary challenges . regardless , just holding onto their seats wo n't be enough for the national republican senatorial committee . a big problem , of course , is that the last gop primaries resulted in some extreme , combustible or un-electable senate candidates , who have arguably cost the republicans five senate seats over the past two cycles . that includes controversial comments about rape by rep. todd akin of missouri and indiana state treasurer richard mourdock , who both lost their contests last week .  republicans openly acknowledge that they have a lot of soul searching to do right now . the party is at war with itself . even in more conservative areas of the country , voters reject the extremism and tea party ideology that has taken over the republican party ,  suggests canter . the key for the republicans is if stronger , less controversial and more generally acceptable nominees emerge from their 2014 primary process . people ` unliking ' romney on facebook .  i think you can find common-sense conservative candidates who can appeal to primary and general election voters ,  says another republican strategist , adding this needs to come without the downside of those candidates saying some stupid things . for the gop , the simple math of the next senate means winning back the majority will be a tougher proposition in 2014 than it was this year . but republicans do have one thing in their favor : a midterm electorate .  if 2014 is similar to past midterm elections , the demographics of the people who turn out to vote will be very different from the electorate in the presidential elections of 2008 or 2012 ,  says cnn polling director keating holland .  in midterms dating back to the 1990s , voters under the age of 30 represented 11 % -13 % of all voters , compared to 19 % this year . african-americans in past midterms have represented 9 % -11 % of all voters , compared to 13 % in 2012 . so if history is any guide , the 2014 midterm electorate will be older and a bit whiter than this year , which could easily benefit republican candidates ,  adds holland . just like last cycle , we may not have to wait until election day for the first senate contest of 2014 and if that 's the case , we 'll have massachusetts to thank . the 2009 death of democratic sen. ted kennedy forced a january 2010 special election , which republican state sen. scott brown won , in an upset . if massachusetts ' senior senator , foreign relations chairman john kerry , is nominated as obama 's defense secretary or secretary of state for his second term , there would be another special election in that state . and that could provide an opening for brown , who was just defeated last week , to make a comeback . moderate senate democrats eye midterms warily .", "summary": " the race for the 2014 u.s. senate is already starting .   democrats actually gained at least one senate seat in last week 's election .   republicans have one thing in their favor in 2014 - a midterm electorate .
