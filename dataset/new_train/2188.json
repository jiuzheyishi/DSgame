{"text": "washington president barack obama 's state of the union address and the traditional post-speech road trip were designed to boost both his agenda and democratic chances in this difficult election year . but there were instant reminders of the tough terrain , and internal democratic jitters : the democratic candidate for governor of wisconsin was nowhere to be found when the president visited ; that after several vulnerable senate democrats publicly tried to create distance between their re-election bids and obama . obama state of the union themes are democrats ' 2014 playbook . and then , this , in an exclusive conversation with cnn 's jake tapper : . tapper :  it 's possible that you might be able to get an immigration reform bill on your desk that has legal status for the millions of undocumented workers who are in this country , but not citizenship . would you veto that ?  obama :  well , you know , i 'm not going to prejudge what gets to my desk .  cnn exclusive : obama says he 's not recalibrating expectations . on its own , maybe that 's just a conciliatory tone so as not to become part of the gop 's debate about immigration . but the timing makes the president 's open mind more significant . house democratic leader nancy pelosi just wednesday said of the immigration debate :  in our caucus there has to be a path of citizenship .  and speaking to the washington post , afl-cio president richard trumka , whose unions are vital to democratic midterm campaign chances , said of a gop plan that provides legal status but not a guaranteed path to citizenship for illegal immigrants :  it 's a joke . it 's a hoax , is what it is . it 's like fool 's gold .  so obama is now on record saying he wo n't prejudge an idea that is a nonstarter to the top house democrat and a  joke  to organized labor . and he is not only at odds with those two traditional allies -- he is at odds with himself . a year ago , speaking in las vegas , the president laid out his bottom line :  for comprehensive immigration reform to work , it must be clear from the outset that there is a pathway to citizenship ,  he said then . the president 's refusal to draw a veto line on the citizenship question will make his liberal base anxious , and those tensions could hurt in an election year . frustrated liberals start to look beyond obama . but whether liberal disappointment now turns into a political problem closer to election day depends in large part on whether republicans can test the president 's openness by getting a bill to his desk . and that remains a giant question mark . speaker john boehner wants the house to pass , in several pieces , immigration changes that would include citizenship for so-called  dreamers  -- younger undocumented people who were brought illegally into the united states by their parents -- but guarantee only legal status for older undocumented individuals . house republican leaders unveil immigration standards . if the house were to act , it would then need to try to reconcile its ideas with already passed senate legislation . democrats control the senate , and finding common ground , again assuming the house acts , likely would prove difficult . but , for now , the biggest question is whether the house will act . boehner not only believes the changes are good economic policy , he also is trying to help his party deal with a latino voter crisis that significantly complicates any republican white house aspirations . but many republican members of congress are worried more about their 2014 races and angering the conservative base , whose turnout is critical in the midterm environment . most house republicans believe any immigration debate distracts attention from obamacare . and on the senate side , there is less urgency as well because of the states the gop is targeting in its effort to retake control . the 11 seats now held by democrats that are the top gop targets have relatively small latino populations . but in each of those , conservative gop base turnout would be critical if the race is close come november . the speaker understands that he is at center stage at the moment , and that any chance to see the democratic immigration tensions in full force depends on whether the house can first advance something meaningful .  it 's been turned into a political football ,  the speaker said thursday of the immigration debate .  so i think it is time to deal with it . but how we deal with it is going to be critically important .
