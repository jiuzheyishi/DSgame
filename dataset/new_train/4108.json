{"text": "in the wake of the six-month anniversary of boko haram 's kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls two weeks ago , the nigerian military released a terse statement that it had negotiated a ceasefire with the cult-like islamist insurgency , saying it would be finalizing the details for return of most of the girls this week . the announcement came as a surprise , since the administration of president goodluck jonathan had refused to negotiate for the girls ' release up to that point . what is going on ? boko haram has yet to comment publicly on any of this , and instead attacked two villages the day after the purported ceasefire . last week , they reportedly abducted another 30 children . the nigerian military has , for its part , regularly made false or misleading statements throughout the insurgency , which spread in earnest beginning in 2011 , and which has seen boko haram expand control of territory in the northeast of the country . yet despite these developments , the nigerian government maintains that talks with the insurgents are progressing in neighboring chad . if the government really is in talks , then it represents the best prospect for the return of the girls since they were kidnapped in april . still , a real resolution of the insurgency -- and an end to boko haram 's current tactics -- seems remote . after all , kidnapping is one of the most important sources of boko haram financing , and the girls ' return will certainly come at a heavy price . moreover , the movement 's goal of installing its medieval version of a taliban-style state in as much of nigeria as it can capture leaves little room for negotiating some form of a permanent settlement . but that is all looking ahead . in the meantime , there is the complicated issue of determining the nigerian government 's motivations for agreeing to a ceasefire and negotiations . up to this point , the inaction and/or ineptitude of president goodluck jonathan 's administration in managing both boko haram and the liberation of the kidnapped girls has prompted heavy criticism within nigeria and abroad . the success of the #bringbackourgirls movement , which has kept a daily demonstration alive in abuja since april , and enjoys the support of u.s. first lady michelle obama and a chorus of celebrities , underscores public frustration with the nigerian government 's poor management of boko haram . why the government , which earns roughly $ 100 billion annually from oil revenues alone , can not finish the job is the source of intense debate across nigeria . massive sums of public funds are being released for the counterinsurgency effort , but troops in the theater of operations have mutinied several times over lack of equipment and allegations that officers are stealing their pay . just as shocking as the corruption is the apparent indifference of the government to the emergency . the very day that boko haram kidnapped the schoolgirls in april , just a day after it set off a bomb at a bus stop killing over 70 innocent victims , president jonathan reportedly danced and sang at a political rally for himself and his ruling party as general elections approach in february 2015 . not only did the military have a four-hour warning that the attack on the girls ' village was imminent , according to amnesty international , but it took them two weeks to respond . to his credit , president jonathan met with his security chiefs about the kidnappings the day after the political rally , and also visited the bus stop shortly after the bombings took place . but his political priorities appear clear -- spending the majority of his energies seeking to stave off the growing political opposition to his re-election plans . despite a major insurgency that is threatening a third of the nation and displacing over 250,000 people , by some estimates , the business of politics , it seems , comes first . and what a business it is . earlier this year , the internationally respected governor of the central bank announced that $ 20 billion of nigeria 's oil earnings were unaccounted for by the state-owned oil company , and that he planned to investigate . rather than applauding these anti-corruption efforts , the president sacked the governor . in a surreal public debate , the finance minister counter-argued that  only  $ 10.8 billion was missing . while 85 % of nigerians live on less than $ 2 per day , the nigerian media report almost daily accusations of audacious spending and corruption across government at all levels , from gold-plated iphones allegedly distributed to guests at the president 's daughter 's wedding , to the minister of petroleum reportedly spending millions in public funds on chartered aircraft for private trips . as a result of all this , fears are growing that government claims of the girls ' imminent release is a public relations stunt designed for election year consumption and to divert attention from the jonathan administration 's problems . not only has boko haram embarked upon new attacks and kidnappings in recent days , but nigerian journalists are also reporting that the man the government says is representing boko haram at the talks in chad is a fraud . the media-savvy head of boko haram , abubakar shekau , has yet to comment , but the government has wrongly claimed to kill him twice already , only to have him appear in another online video . of course , if the negotiations prove to be real and succeed in reuniting the girls with their families , the jonathan administration has a brief opportunity to initiate a process that could end the insurgency . boko haram is a movement of many parts , the most extreme controlled by the shekau network . but other factions are interested in a negotiated settlement and have requested mediators on several occasions . if the nigerian government can engage these fence-sitters in the movement in a peace process that offers some measure of amnesty , it may be able to isolate shekau and the hardliners sufficiently to bring them to justice and end the war . unfortunately , with so much at stake in the coming elections , there seems a very real chance that the jonathan administration will return its attention to the business of politics , and lose this opportunity to change course . if so , it will face not only the weary nigerian electorate at the ballot box in the coming months , but also a growing insurgency that may see less and less reason to negotiate .", "summary": " despite ceasefire claims , boko haram attacks continue
