{"text": "a girl battling cancer has been fitted with metal bones which will grow as she does . lily willis , 8 , from great lumley , county durham , was diagnosed with a bone cancer tumour called osteosarcoma in february after she came home from school limping just weeks earlier . the tumour , on her right leg , meant that her entire knee , tibia and part of her femur had to be removed and rebuilt with stainless steel adjustable bones . as lily grows , a magnet will be placed around her leg which will allow doctors to lengthen the bones in her shin and thigh as required . lily willis holds an x-ray of her leg , which shows her new metal bones that will grow with her over the next six years . her mother tori , 30 , said : ` lily came home after school one day with a sore ankle . she had been doing cross-country and was limping . we thought nothing of it and imagined she had just sprained it while she had been out running . ` but after a couple of weeks , the pain had travelled up her leg and did n't seem to be going anywhere so i took her to the doctors . ' i thought they were just going to strap her up and send her home again - we never thought it would ever be anything serious . ' but tori and lily 's father bryan were in for the shock of their lives after doctors sent lily for an x-ray , which revealed she had a tumour on the bone above her right knee . bryan , 40 , said : ` they did an x-ray of her ankle and then called us back so they could do another on her hips . ` we were told to wait five days and assumed this meant there was nothing serious going on or they would have done something straight away . ` but the hospital called us a few days later and told us we had to take lily out of school and get her there . ` that 's when we started to worry . i could sense the urgency over the phone and i could n't possibly have expected what they were going to tell us . ' lily will undergo another six months of chemotherapy to ensure all cancerous cells have been destroyed . surgeons at newcastle 's royal victoria infirmary performed a biopsy on lily 's tumour and found it to be cancerous . tori , a former florist said : ` it sounds stupid to say now but until we were told lily had cancer , i did n't think children got cancer . ` i 'd heard of children with leukaemia but for some reason i did n't think of them as the same thing . ' once tori and bryan had been told of lily 's cancer , doctors sat the youngster down and explained to her what was wrong with her . lily said : ` they told me i had cancer but i did n't know what it meant . i 'd heard people talking about it but i did n't know what it was . ' tori said : ` when we were told lily had the disease , i think my heart stopped for a second . my little girl had cancer . no parent should have to hear that . ' i thought she was going to die . we asked doctors if she was going to be ok but it was a question they could n't answer - they just looked at us sympathetically . ' just a week after her diagnosis in february , medics began lily on a course of chemotherapy and performed a 14-hour operation on the youngster to remove her knee and tibia bones . they then replaced them using adjustable stainless steel to act like real bones . xray of lily 's leg : as lily grows , a magnet will be placed around her leg which will allow doctors to lengthen the bones in her shin and thigh . bryan , a former mechanic , said : ` lily was so poorly . the chemotherapy hit her hard , she was sick a lot and had very little energy . ` her hair began to fall out which i think was hard for her - but now we ca n't imagine her ever having any ! ` she also contracted pneumonia - a strain which doctors said was the worst they had seen , after her lung collapsed . ` the operation was the hardest part . we did n't think it would take that long so it was a waiting game for her to come out of theatre . the longer she was down there , the more we thought was going wrong . ' but the operation was a success and after installing lily 's new limbs , surgeons managed to reconstruct all of the muscles , tendons and even blood vessels around the new bones . as the new metal bones were too big for her leg when they were fitted , skin and tissue from her left thigh was used to stretch around her newly built limb . now that the cancerous tissue has been removed , lily is well on the road to recovery . she will still need up to six months worth of chemotherapy to ensure all cancerous cells have been destroyed before she can be given the all-clear . lily 's new bones will last until she is 14 , when they will be replaced with adult sized metal pieces , which will be left inside her leg for the rest of her life . in the meantime , her sisters jessy , 5 , and ruby , 2 , are pleased to have her home where they can help look after her with their parents , who both gave up their jobs to be lily 's full-time carers . the brave youngster has recently been nominated for a champion child of courage award , after she made hundreds of friendship bracelets while she was in hospital to raise money for charity . her mother said : ` she 's doing really well , she is better than she used to be . she is absolutely amazing . ` it will be a while before lily can walk independently as she has to build up the muscles again in her legs but she is doing brilliantly - we are all so proud of her .
