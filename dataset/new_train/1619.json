{"text": "a ` miracle ' transplant patient died after junior doctors failed to spot she was suffering organ rejection , her family have claimed . hannah pudsey , 24 , received media attention in 2001 after a six month wait for a new heart - at the time , the longest wait any british child in need of an organ had been forced to endure . her story inspired thousands of people to become potential organ donors but ms pudsey died on february 1 last year , after she was diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis that was hiding another problem with her heart . hannah pudsey , pictured during her engagement photoshoot , died in february last year , just a month before her wedding . doctors diagnosed her with diabetic ketoacidosis , but this was hiding another problem with her heart . an inquest heard that a trainee registrar at hull royal infirmary failed to read a letter from ms pudsey 's gp detailing her complex medical history and therefore did not to treat her as a priority patient . hannah , who was five months away from marrying her boyfriend kevin preston , could have been sent to a high dependency unit , but instead , the inquest in hull heard she was left for hours between blood tests . in a statement read out at the inquest , hannah 's mother , ros pudsey said : ` hannah was seen by a junior doctor in the morning and transferred at 12.30 pm to a diabetes ward . ` she was not seen by anyone senior on that ward until 4pm . by that time her condition had deteriorated . i was concerned that the care she was given was not sufficient . her mother explains that she called for a doctor at 6pm when her daughter ` screamed out for oxygen ' before collapsing . ms pudsey received media attention in 2001 -lrb- pictured then , aged 12 -rrb- after a six month wait before she received a new heart . at the time it was the longest wait any child in britain with a heart defect had experienced . ros pudsey said : ` if hull royal infirmary had acted earlier on in the day , maybe hannah would have survived . we feel she could have survived that day . ' ms pudsey , who was given just six months to live when she was 13 after being born with two holes in her heart , was given a new lease of life thanks to her heart transplant , which allowed her to go to school , pass her driving test , get a job and meet her fiance . she developed type 1 diabetes in 2008 , believed to be as a result of drugs she took to minimise the risk of organ rejection . ms pudsey , of driffield , east yorkshire , had visited her gp on the morning she died complaining of severe nausea , which she had been suffering from for several days . her gp called for an ambulance and hannah was taken to the a&e department with suspected gastroenteritis . ms pudsey , pictured with fiance kevin preston , developed type 1 diabetes in 2008 , believed to be as a result of the anti-rejection drugs she took . she visited her gp on the morning she died , complaining of severe nausea . trainee registrar dr kanchan manchegowda was given details of ms pudsey 's medical history but told the hearing she failed to read the notes . hospital staff believed ms pudsey was suffering from diabetic ketoacidosis , caused by a lack of insulin and she was transferred to ward 10 , while staff investigated possible causes . when asked by coroner professor paul marks if dr manchegowda would have acted on ms pudsey as a matter of urgency , if she had read the letter , she replied ` maybe , yes . ' dr manchegowda continued : ' i did n't get a chance to look at the information , as i was also dealing with another patient who was also suffering from a cardiac arrest . i was unaware that hannah had been moved from the a&e department to ward 10 . ms pudsey , pictured at her 21st birthday with boyfriend mr preston , called for an ambulance and was taken to a&e with suspected gastroenteritis . trainee registrar dr kanchan manchegowda was given details of ms pudsey Â¿ s medical history but told a hearing she failed to read the notes . ` hannah did not complain about any heart problems to me . she was initially responding to treatment and heading in the right direction . ' dr jane patmore , a consultant physician at hull royal infirmary , raised her concerns over her staff 's actions . ` the first decision we made was the wrong one . when staff diagnosed the diabetic ketoacidosis , it was , at best , only part of the issue , ' dr patmore said . ` if hannah 's admittance to hospital was purely down to the ketoacidosis , then ward 10 would have been correct . ` however , my concern is that we set off down a different pathway before we could identify any other issues . had we identified these , such as the cardiac rejection , we would have taken a different path , and that maybe would have been the high dependency unit . ' staff at hull royal infirmary hospital -lrb- pictured -rrb- believed ms pudsey was suffering from diabetic ketoacidosis , caused by a lack of insulin . from the examinations conducted in a&e , and by the registrar , doctors found no evidence of heart failure . dr patmore said a clinician with her own level of expertise and experience may have identified both causes of miss pudsey 's illness . but when asked by the coroner if a consultant cardiologist should have been alerted straight away , dr patmore replied : ` retrospect is a wonderful thing . it 's clear from the examinations conducted in a&e and by the registrar that they found no evidence of heart failure . on that basis , i would not have jumped to the consultant cardiologist ' . diabetic ketoacidosis -lrb- dka -rrb- is a dangerous complication of diabetes caused by a lack of insulin in the body . it occurs when the body is unable to use blood sugar -lrb- glucose -rrb- because there is n't enough insulin . instead , it breaks down fat as an alternative source of fuel . this causes a build-up of a by-product called ketones . symptoms include passing large amounts of urine , feeling very thirsty , vomiting and abdominal pain . if the condition is diagnosed very early , it may be possible to relieve the symptoms with an insulin injection . those with advanced diabetic ketoacidosis must be admitted to hospital where they will be given a combination of insulin and fluids . high levels of ketones in the blood disrupt normal working of many parts of the body . the more ketones in the blood , the more ill a person with diabetic ketoacidosis will become . left untreated , diabetic ketoacidosis can cause potentially fatal complications , such as severe dehydration , coma and swelling of the brain . source : nhs choices . dr patmore made clear the treatment would have been similar had miss pudsey been transferred to the high dependency unit . she said the cause of death should be recorded as metabolic acidosis , which occurs when the body produces too much acid or when the kidneys are not removing enough acid , along with heart rejection . despite a written apology from phil morley , chief executive of hull and east yorkshire hospitals nhs trust , for ` unacceptable mistakes and errors ' , the coroner concluded there were no ` missed opportunities ' . recording a verdict of natural causes , he gave the cause of death as metabolic acidosis and cardiac rejection . ` admittance to the high dependency unit and a discussion with a cardiologist may have made a difference to the outcome , but we are unable to say for definite , ' professor marks said . ` thus i am persuaded that there have been no missed opportunities which may have changed the outcome . ' i am satisfied that the trust initiated the appropriate measures and that there is no ongoing failure in the system . hannah was a much loved woman who wanted to live a normal life and had succeeded in that . ' ros , who lives with husband , hannah 's father david , said after the case : ` in view of phil morley 's previous statements to say that he was sorry for the unacceptable mistakes that they made , i do feel we have some closure and we need to move on in our lives and start to try and rebuild it . ' i do n't feel that she was given the best quality care . ' i was very proud of hannah . she was absolutely fantastic and she fought for what she believed in . she supported transplantation . ` it is n't a cure , but she believed that everyone deserved a chance and she just wanted to live her life every day to the full .
