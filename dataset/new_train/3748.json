{"text": "a baby girl born out of wedlock must be adopted to save her from the risk of being slaughtered in an ` honour killing ' , a court ruled yesterday . if the unmarried muslim woman 's father found out about the child , he would feel such ` unimaginable shame ' he could unleash a vengeful bloodbath by killing the baby and his whole family , three senior judges agreed . so they made the extraordinary order to have the one-year-old girl -- known as baby q -- adopted for her own safety . safe : baby q has settled well with her adoptive parents -lrb- picture posed by models -rrb- . she will now grow up with adoptive . parents and , when she is older , they will explain to her why she could . not have been brought up by her biological parents . it is believed to be the first time an english court has ordered an adoption to prevent a murder . the baby 's maternal grandmother told . police that if her husband ever found out about the little girl , ` he . would consider himself honour-bound to kill the child , the mother , the . grandmother herself and the grandmother 's other children ' , the court . heard . the identities of all those involved . have been kept anonymous to ensure the girl can grow up safe from her . apparently murderous grandfather -- who still has no idea his daughter . was ever pregnant . the astonishing background to the case was set out at the appeal court in london yesterday . the baby 's mother -- referred to as m -- . conceived the child at the end of 2009 when she was having an affair . with a married man , known as f. neither the mother nor the father . were born in the uk and both came to live here separately within the . past ten years . they are both muslims , but from different cultures . at the time of his infidelity , f 's wife was still waiting for permission to join him in the uk , though she is now here . lord justice munby and mrs justice black , pictured left and right , along with lord justice kitchin said that the child must be adopted . when m suspected she was pregnant , in . the spring of 2010 , she was so ` terrified ' of how her ` traditional . muslim ' father would react that she concealed her pregnancy by wearing . loose clothes . she continued living at home and was confident her growing bump would not show unless someone ` was looking ' . she travelled to ` the other side of . town ' for her antenatal care , to avoid her parents finding out , and only . had her pregnancy confirmed at 23 weeks . eventually she confided in her mother . and a sister , and they hatched a secret plan that when she went into . labour , someone would call her father away on a pretext , to ensure he . never found out . she also told social services she wanted the baby to be adopted straight away . baby q was born in the autumn of . 2010 . at just a few hours old , baby and mother were parted as m was . discharged from hospital and baby q was left in the care of nursing . staff . by december , she was placed in the . care of the muslim couple who are now about to adopt her . the court case . came about because the baby 's natural father , f , discovered he had a . daughter and wanted to take custody of her himself . but a high court judge , mrs justice . parker , rejected him as unsuitable in july this year , and said the baeasily be put together ' by the maternal grandfather or someone who knew . him . the baby was ` quite obviously ' not . the child of f 's wife , the judge said , adding : ` if the grandfather 's . community were thus to find out about the relationship between m and f , . it would be a matter of intense almost unimaginable shame to him and his . family . ' there was a ` very significant risk ' he might launch a violent attack to preserve the family 's honour . adoption : the court of appeal ruled the risk was so grave that the baby could not be looked after by her natural father . the court heard mrs justice parker . had been ` persuaded by the evidence of the police ' that the mother and . baby q could be at ` a very high level of risk ' if the baby 's birth was . to become known in the wider community . the police force in question was not . identified , nor the social services department involved in the case . but . the court was told that social workers , police and the mother of baby q . were all in agreement that she should be adopted . still hopeful of taking custody of . his child , f launched an appeal , but this was rejected yesterday by . three senior judges , lord justice munby , lady justice black and lord . justice kitchin . they agreed with the first judge that . there were several good reasons why f and his wife -- who now have a . baby of their own -- should not be allowed to bring up baby q. among them was the ` tension ' that . would be caused by f 's wife looking after her philandering husband 's . illegitimate child as well as her own . both f and his wife also lacked . ` empathy and insight ' , and were criticised as being incapable of dealing . with the little girl 's feelings as she grew older and wanted to learn . the details of her ` very unfortunate start in life ' . the judges concluded : ` the risks -- . physical , emotional , short and long term -- are too great for q to be . brought up by her father . ' although f and his wife 's ` care and . warmth ' towards their own child was taken into account , the judges . concluded there was ` a high likelihood ' they would feel differently . about baby q. by contrast , baby q had quickly . developed a deep attachment to her adoptive parents , known as mr and mrs . a , muslims who live in the uk but come from the same country as the . baby 's mother . they had a ` high degree of empathy , . sympathy , insight and maturity ' , and the judges said they had ` absolute . confidence in mr and mrs a to give q information about her background , . her life , what happened to her mother , the feelings of her father , her . father 's wishes for her , and the fact she has another family .
