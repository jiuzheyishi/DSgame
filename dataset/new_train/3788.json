{"text": "when it was announced that che adams was joining sheffield united from ilkeston of the evo stik league premier division in november , the news was largely overshadowed by the club 's interest in another striker . ched evans may have a vaguely similar name to the teenager , but the circumstances surrounding the two players could not have been more different . while united were forced to abandon plans to offer evans a route back into football following his release from prison amid a blaze of bad publicity , adams slipped quietly into bramall lane on a two-year-deal . che adams spearheaded a fightback from sheffield united that nearly took them to the capital one cup final . adams arrival went largey unnoticed as united were being criticised for reports linking them with ched evans . nigel clough 's side were moments away from taking the tie with tottenham into extra time . everyone will know who he is this morning , though , after the 18-year-old so nearly turned the second leg of this capital one cup semi-final on its head last night . ultimately , tottenham booked their place at wembley , but the premier league club were left rocking on their heels by the introduction of adams in place of jamal campbell-ryce in the 74th minute . his two coolly taken goals in the space of just 140 seconds put the blades level on aggregate and on course for extra-time until christian eriksen broke their hearts with his second goal of the night . it was a stunning performance from the youngster , even if his manager nigel clough was less than impressed with his goal celebration . ` he 's got to learn not to slide in the corner and celebrate when we 've still got to get another goal ! ' said clough . ` get the ball out of the net and get back to the centre-spot and we can go again . ` hopefully we 'll be talking about him for the next few years . we 've been delighted since he 's come in . just a few months ago he was playing a few leagues down . ` we like the look of him . he 's still quite raw , only 18 years old , but he 's got a lot of potential . ` he 's cup-tied in the fa cup but he 'll get plenty of chances in the league now . ' adams celebrates scoring his first goal for clough 's side against tottenham . christian eriksen -lrb- right -rrb- scores the winner for tottenham in the closing minutes of the game . andros townsend -lrb- left -rrb- celebrates reaching the cup final with two-goal hero eriksen -lrb- right -rrb- . adams made his debut for united when they upset southampton in this competition here last month -- one of five premier league victims beaten by clough 's side in the cup competitions since he took over at bramall lane 15 months ago . towards the end of his time at ilkeston , 45 scouts turned up at the club 's manor ground to see a young man who was earning a burgeoning reputation for his blistering pace . but clough beat off competition from leicester city , newcastle and sunderland to sign him for a nominal fee and the promise of a friendly against the league one side . adams , who has been approached by antigua barbuda to represent them internationally , played for coventry under-14s as a youngster . a boyhood arsenal fan , last night 's exploits meant even more to him . ` it 's been a really good night for me , ' he said . ` it 's horrible losing but it 's a good team that we lost to and hopefully they can win it now . ` there were n't really any nerves tonight . a lot of people dream of doing that and fortunately i can . ` the manager did n't really say anything when he sent me on but he knows what i can do and i showed him . he just wanted me to go back to the halfway line after the goal . it got to my head and i did n't know want to do . ' being cup-tied means that adams will not be eligible to face manchester united in the fifth round of the fa cup if louis van gaal 's side beat cambridge in their replay and sheffield united overcome preston north end . louis reed -lrb- left -rrb- and adams -lrb- right -rrb- clap united supporters after the game against tottenham . adams shoots past the tottenham defence and gets his second goal of the game at bramall lane . an eriksen free kick handed tottenham the lead in the first half in spectacular style . given the opportunity , you would not rule out clough 's side producing another shock after last night 's efforts . ` at half-time just told players to go for one and see what would happen , ' said the manager . ` if they had played us off the park for two games and beat us easily , we would hold up our hands but losing after being so close just makes it worse . ` now have a game against preston to try to get a tie against manchester united here , so that is the objective .
