{"text": "governor chris christie has been accused of exacting still more political revenge after his administration shut down the dmv office in a large new jersey city three years ago -- and democratic politicians say it was because they opposed his tax policies and worked for his election day opponent . ` he shut it down , plain and simple , and of course this was political , ' new jersey state assemblyman joe cryan told mailonline of the motor vehicle commission office in elizabeth , the fourth-largest city in new jersey . ` this was complete retribution . ... there was no other possible explanation for it . ' cryan 's district includes elizabeth . he was former gov. john corzine 's state democratic chairman when he ran for re-election in 2009 , unsuccessfully , against christie . ray lesniak , cryan 's state senate counterpart representing the city , had been a top corzine strategist since the future democratic governor was elected to the u.s. senate in 2000 . and elizabeth 's longtime mayor , chris bollwage , got under christie 's skin soon after he took corzine 's job , joining cryan and lesniak to publicly oppose what they called a ` flawed ' plan to cap the rate of annual property tax increases in new jersey . the three democrats now say closing the motor vehicle bureau in elizabeth was a way for christie to crush three political adversaries with a single stroke of his pen . christie and his insiders , bollwage told . mailonline , ` are used to getting their way no matter the consequence to . constituents and families . ' 65 jefferson avenue in elizabeth was once the location of a busy new jersey motor vehicle commission office , but taxpayers in the region now have to trek to other cities to get their plates or licenses renewed , and politicians say wait times have skyrocketed . mayor chris bollwage says the closure of his town 's motor vehicle bureau office was an act of political retribution from gov. chris christie . governor chris christie has begun his second term in office under a cloud of scandal related to traffic bottlenecks whose alleged political subtext sounds familiar to democrats in elizabeth and surrounding union county . the mayor added that he suspects foul play in the christie administration 's awarding of money to fund red-light traffic safety cameras . three towns near elizabeth have received the funds , but ` high volume ' intersections in elizabeth ` with numerous accidents and near-misses ' did n't make the cut . ` just another retaliation by this administration , ' said bollwage of gov. christie . ` and some folks think its a good idea that he gets the nuclear codes . ' the swipe is a reference to christie 's ambition to make a run at the white house in 2016 . while the moderate republican has not yet said if he will enter the race , pollsters are already fond of taking the public 's temperature with scenarios that pit him against hillary rodham clinton in the next presidential contest . but christie 's road to washington , d.c. has become bumpy of late . need a state id renewed but take mass-transit from your home in elizabeth , nj ? good luck finding the newark motor vehicle agency without a car . new jersey state senator ray lesniak , shown campaigning with u.s. sen. cory booker , said the ` predominately minority , low-income ' people of elizabeth were left behind by the christie administration . he fired two aides this month and watched as two political appointees resigned from the port authority in december , following an alleged plot to manufacture traffic jams leading from the town of fort lee to the george washington bridge during four days in september . democrats in trenton are feverishly investigating the possibility that christie personally gave the order as punishment for democratic mayor mark sokolich 's failure to endorse his re-election bid . cryan compared the experience of frustrated fort lee commuters with elizabeth 's largely lower-income population after their local mvc office disappeared . ` same thing , ' he offered . ` and there was no logical reason to do it other than to be a vindictive -- i do n't want to use the word  prick  -- but a vindictive individual . ' christie spokesman colin reed defended the closing in a statement . nj assemblyman joseph cryan said ` there was no logical reason ' to close the elizabeth mvc office , ` other than to be a vindictive -- i do n't want to use the word  prick  -- but a vindictive individual . ' the governor , he said , ` immediately acted ' when he took office ` to eliminate wasteful spending and ensure all government agencies were operating efficiently . ' ` the elizabeth agency was not only the least used of the three in union county , but its consolidation saved new jersey taxpayers nearly $ 300,000 . ' bollwage scoffed at that idea , saying in a little-noticed msnbc interview that ` the salaries of the folks who worked there were relocated or assumed by others , and therefore all you were left with was lease payments . ' ` and we wanted to work with the dmv , and move them into a building that may have even been owned by the city -- because the service is important . our demographics , our community needs a dmv that 's located on bus lines . ' the closure of mvc offices in elizabeth and two other towns came at the end of 2010 , ten weeks after the governor 's office notified local officials that the decision had been made . whispers had circulated around trenton for months about a plan to consolidate locations , but insiders tell mailonline that no one expected elizabeth to be on the short list . ` we heard at the time that christie was stupid , that he made poor blacks think he did n't sympathize with them , ' a veteran new jersey republican strategist said wednesday , ` and in retrospect that 's probably what happened . ' ' i mean , look -- these are folks who need to take the bus to renew their id . they may have an old car , but they take the train to work . the elizabeth location was on all the transit routes . and the one in newark ? you have to drive there . ' ` maybe christie 's people were a little tone-deaf , ' the political insider said . lesniak sounded a similar note at the time , calling his home town ` predominately minority , low-income . ' ' i think it 's a cold , cruel and , ... despicable thing for them to do this , ' he said , noting that elizabeth 's taxpayers were less likely than new jerseyans in wealthier areas to be able to conduct their mvc business online . scene of the crime ? these george washington bridge toll booths were the location of the man-made ` bridgegate ' traffic bottlenecks that backed up commuters across the town of fort lee , new jersey in september . investigators are probing how high up in the governor 's office the plot reached . heads roll : bridget kelly -lrb- r -rrb- was a fixture alongside christie as he toured disaster areas following the devastating hurricane sandy in 2013 , but got the axe this month when emails from her emerged in which she appeared to orchestrate the bridge toll lane closures . months later , with the elizabeth office shuttered , lesniak said his constituents were finding 3 - and 4-hour wait times at other mvc locations , more than 5 miles away , that absorbed the overflow . ` the agencies around us got all that . foot traffic from the shut-down elizabeth office , ' cryan recalled , . he and lesniak introduced a bill forcing the motor vehicles commission to find a way to limit wait times to just 15 minutes system-wide . it passed in the senate but never got a vote on the assembly floor . in one public hearing , assemblyman gary schaer , a passaic democrat , quickly calculated that the elizabeth mvc 's 23 employees were already meeting that 15-minute standard when they lost their jobs . ` why in the name of whatever would we want to be eliminating one of the branch divisions of your organization that is already achieving that ? ' schaer asked a hearing witness from the motor vehicle commission . ` and i did this on the back of a napkin . ' mayor bollwage added wednesday via email -- he 's recovering from surgery on his vocal cords -- that gov. christie saw the reorganization as an opportune moment to appoint two political allies as managers of the nearest mvc locations to survive . bollwage named carlos trujillo and armando da silva , current and former members of the elizabeth board of education who have supported christie in both of his statewide elections . their mvc jobs pay in excess of $ 70,000 each , according to public records . ` this administration is not one to deal with unless you want to get hurt in the future , ' mayor bollwage said of gov. chris christie 's gop inner circle in trenton . the decision to close his city 's mvc office , bollwage said , came after a drawn-out legislative battle over annual increases on property tax rates . christie ran for governor on a platform of capping those rate hikes at 2 per cent . the mayor objected , he said , because ` tax bills in new jersey are comprised of local taxes , county taxes and school taxes , and some have fire district taxes too . ' ` all of those entities have a 2 per cent cap on their tax levy , ' he explained , ` which in essence amounts to a 6 per cent tax increase to the property tax payer . ' more slights ? a budget for red-light cameras in elizabeth fell on deaf ears -- another sign , says the town 's democratic mayor , of political favoritism at work . and , bollwage said , the christie administration has given legal exemptions to some municipalities -- allowing elizabeth 's school board , for instance , to push through a 7.5 per cent tax hike last year . after the mayor objected , a christie administration official in charge of education finances wrote to the city government insisting that despite the law 's plain text , ` the tax levy cap for school districts ... is not a hard 2 percent cap . ' the mayor cited that episode as another indication that new jerseyans in democratic strongholds like elizabeth and fort lee are n't served well by their governor . ` this administration is not one to deal with unless you want to get hurt in the future , ' he said . but the motor vehicle department office closure still stings three years later , he said . ` we have had a dmv since henry ford was building cars , ' bollwage said . and cryan told mailonline that he knew right away when the announcement came in october 2010 that he had been ` christied . ' ` it was n't hard to figure it out , ' the assemblyman said . ` we knew the deal ' christie , he said , ` was always one of those guys who punished individual legislators for not supporting the way he thinks . that 's just who he is . '", "summary": " elizabeth , nj lost its motor vehicle commission office at the end of 2010 , leaving locals without a place for licenses and vehicle tags .   the city 's largely poor , black population was left in the lurch , the town 's mayor says , because he and two state lawmakers ran afoul of gov. christie .   the three democratic politicians opposed christie 's first election as governor , and later pushed back against a plan to cap property tax hikes .   the ` bridgegate ' scandal sounds familiar now as elizabeth residents have to go miles away and wait in hours-long lines .   a state assemblyman calls the .   situation the ` same thing ' as christie 's alleged punishment of another .   mayor with traffic jams in september .   ` there was no logical reason to do it , ' he says , ` other than to be a vindictive -- i do n't want to use the word  p *** k  -- but a vindictive individual ' "}
