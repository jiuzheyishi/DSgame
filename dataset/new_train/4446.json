{"text": "as soon as passengers arrive at the rovos rail station in pretoria , south africa , it 's clear this wo n't be a typical train journey . no crowds , just fellow guests -- and only a few dozen of them -- heading on a three-day trip to cape town . inside the meticulously restored building , champagne flows freely and ceiling fans turn leisurely . occasionally the resident peacocks squawk as they preen around the platform , until they scatter with the arrival of the steaming locomotive . yes , steaming , as if it was headed to hogwarts , because that 's what this pretty much is : a storybook rail safari through africa . rovos rail offers a series of journeys across south africa and beyond that allow passengers to encounter the region 's spectacular scenery and some of the big beasts that roam it . itineraries include trips between the south african cities of pretoria and durban that take in the nambiti conservancy -lrb- a big five retreat in kwazulu-natal -rrb- or to victoria falls via botswana , zimbabwe and the hwange national park wildlife sanctuary . hot tub on rails . the trains are billed as the most luxurious in the world . that 's hard to dispute . in the 16-square-meter -lrb- 172-square-foot -rrb- royal suite , there 's a double bed , richly upholstered armchairs and a full victorian bath for lounging in the tub and watching the world roll there are few modern nuisances to distract from the landscape views . no televisions , no wi-fi . cell phones are discouraged and laptops forbidden outside of suites .  we do n't want any work being done in public ,  rovos founder rohan vos tells passengers before they board .  ambiance and good conversation , that 's what this train is all about .  to encourage this , the journey from pretoria begins with high tea . the observation car is at the rear of the train . one portion is glassed off to protect the smokers , who have a tendency to wander off when they leave the train to grab a puff . it 's not the prime place to be in any case . it 's best to claim a spot at the very rear of the car , which is gloriously exposed so passengers can sit on a long bench or lean over the railing to claim uninterrupted views of the goldfields , the karoo and eventually the mountains and winelands that surround cape town . dinner gong . it 's good to take it easy at high tea . before long a gong sounds to call guests to the dining cars for a seven-course meal , each with a wine pairing . the food leans heavily toward local fare , both game and produce , all of it meticulously prepared . the cape town journey is one of the shortest , but includes two stops . the first is at kimberley , the diamond mining town known for the  big hole ,  the largest excavation in the world , a mile wide and going down seemingly forever . the other stop is in matjiesfontein , in the middle of the karoo . the entire town is a national heritage site , preserving the victorian village that was founded as a railway rest stop but became a health spa once frequented by south africa 's elite . although the train is sometimes pulled by a more modern locomotive , the oldest of rovos rail 's carriages date to 1930 , two years before agatha christie imagined the belgian detective , hercule poirot , sleuthing across europe . most were once owned by south african railways , and were bought as rusting and decrepit shells . before leaving pretoria , it 's worth taking a look at the original carriages , if only to appreciate how beautifully restored they are . as much as rovos rail envelops its passengers in a time warp , they 're not shielded from all modern headaches . the growing pains of south africa 's rails mean delays can and do happen .  i ask you to please accept the fact that we are never on time ,  vos quips .  however , we will get you to cape town this week , and that 's what matters .  on rovos rail 's longer , international journeys into namibia , zimbabwe , zambia and tanzania , the logistics of african travel can interfere . slow tourism . the train stops for border posts -lrb- waits can be lengthy -rrb- and poorly maintained tracks in some regions keep the speeds slow . despite all that , this is the best imaginable way to make an overland trip . the 15-day route from cape town to dar es salaam is a train lover 's dream , taking a meandering route from the cape through the heart of south africa , up to the madikwe game reserve and then onto zimbabwe for an overnight stay at the victoria falls hotel . crossing the zambezi river on its landmark bridge is like living on a movie set , the mist of the falls thundering upward on one side , the dark rocks of the gorge plunging down on the other . the train then crosses the length of zambia , sometimes churning , sometimes crawling until it reaches chishimba falls in the rarely visited northern province . here , hikers can explore the sacred cave behind the falls , where the nature spirit chishimba is believed to live . this is a place of prayer and offerings , so the zambia tourism authority has strict instructions for visitors :  because of the sacred nature of the falls , no sexual intercourse , arrogance and quarrelsomeness is allowed in the vicinity of the falls .  passengers should plan their time accordingly . this is literally a high point of the journey . the rest of the trip is a descent into the rift valley , winding through tunnels and along viaducts , with a stop for a game drive in selous reserve , the largest in africa . rovos runs this route five times a year , and it 's their most popular option , according to brenda vos , rohan 's daughter who works in what 's now a family business . regardless of the itinerary , she says for many passengers the train itself is the destination .  we want guests to get on board , and it does n't matter where they 're going .  rovos rail , paul kruger street , pretoria , south africa ; +27 12 315 8242 .", "summary":
