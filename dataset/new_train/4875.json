{"text": "no christmas is complete without a war on christmas , and this year it 's being fought on several fronts . npr reported the white house attacking republican intransigence over the debt talks in a report with a section titled  the holiday season is no time to threaten middle-class pocketbooks .  that prompted the daily caller to respond with the headline ,  disagreeing with obama can ruin christmas , says white house report .  in the eyes of some liberals , the republicans have become the party of the grinch . this must be news to conservatives who have always insisted that it 's the democrats who want to steal christmas . to them , the war is being waged by liberal secularists against patriotic american christians who want to celebrate the holiday loudly and publicly in the way baby jesus intended . pat robertson has hit out at those  miserable  atheists and fox news has gone after rhode island gov. lincoln chafee for deciding not to host a christmas tree lighting ceremony . in other words , although the war on christmas phenomenon might have something to do with rising unbelief among americans , more likely it reflects growing partisanship among politicians . in an age when nothing is so sacred it ca n't be used to hurt a political opponent , christmas is one more weapon that statesmen and stateswomen can use against each other . but the meaning of the war on christmas is actually bigger than partisan tomfoolery and is n't limited to right-wing fantasy , either . some of it exposes genuine tensions within american politics and society . take the decision of the santa monica city council to end the tradition of erecting nativity scenes or other displays in palisades park . the right to display a scene was hitherto decided by lottery , and the previous winter season atheists won 11 out of 14 spaces , which they used to erect enormous critiques of christianity . in response , locals lobbied the council to establish stricter guidelines about who could take part . the council decided that would be discriminatory , but it also did n't want to leave the system open to abuse by more offensive groups like neo-nazis . so it decided the displays would have to stop altogether . that decision was upheld in november by a federal judge . the local secularists were thrilled .  the free thinkers ... played the game of the religionists and they outsmarted them ,  annie laurie gaylor told the huffington post .  they showed the christian people of the city what it feels like to have a public park promoting views that offend your personal conscience . these views were on public property that were supposed to be owned equally by everyone .  this story is a classic example of the failure to reconcile different interests within a democratic society . nobody involved was technically wrong . the secularist campaigners were right to say that the nativity displays should be open to everyone because they were on public land . their christian opponents were right to insist that anything erected to celebrate christmas ought to give some priority to celebrating christmas . and the council was right that , in the absence of consensus , it was better to allow no displays at all . the tragedy being that gaylor 's campaign ended up destroying a perfectly wonderful tradition in the name of fairness . and that hardly seems fair . unfortunately , gaylor gets around almost as much as santa claus ; now she 's involved in an effort to take down a jesus-shaped war memorial near a popular ski resort in montana . there 's a thin line between this sort of secularist activism and the politics of personal taste . in portsmouth , new hampshire , a jewelry shop manager called the cops on salvation army bell ringers because the noise was  raising her blood pressure and making her hate christmas .  in colorado springs , the salvation army was stopped from bell ringing because of a new ban on panhandling . what 's really happening is n't just a targeted , political war on christmas but a more general battle for control of what goes on in the public sphere , especially around the holidays . undoubtedly , some of this is motivated by anti-religious secularism . but it 's also the product of living in a crowded multicultural environment where everyone risks getting on each other 's nerves -- and we have to find better ways of getting along . one of the reasons why  happy holidays  has risen in use as an alternative seasonal greeting to  merry christmas  is simply that it helps avoid occasions of offense and confrontation . religious conservatives complain that it 's a surrender to militant atheism . but if that 's the case then the surrender is widespread . george w. bush 's white house cards wished everyone a happy  holiday season  and even fox news has its own holiday wish list . if there is a solution to this controversy then perhaps it 's to try to treat it with a dash of humor and disdain . the rev. jonathan morris was recently invited on  fox and friends  to unleash hell on the war on christmas . instead , he did the opposite . after pointing out that christians have throughout the centuries taken much worse persecution -lrb- and , i might add , dished out a bit , too -rrb- he concluded ,  if our christmas is going to be all about getting upset at people trying to take away christmas , is n't that silly , too ?  amen , father .", "summary": " tim stanley : it 's not christmas without  war on christmas ,  a cooked up culture crisis .   this time , politics in mix , with white house , others using holidays to score points , he says .   he says  war  really reflects failure to reconcile different interests in democratic society .   stanley : battle is over what goes on in public sphere . one solution ? have sense of humor .
