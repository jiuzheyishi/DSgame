{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- you 'd expect a conversation with mulatu astatke to be about music . he is , after all , the father of a musical genre : ethio-jazz . but when he talks about the art form , he tends to focus on its scientific merits .  when you start talking about jazz , they 're usually telling us that africans contributed to the rhythm parts of jazz music , but it 's not only the rhythms . we have contributed to the science of jazz as well ,  he says . while innovators like charlie parker may get credit for the creation of modern jazz music by using diminished scales -lrb- as done in classical music by composers like claude debussy -rrb- , astake offers an alternative view : .  in southern ethiopia , there are tribes called the derashe -- i call them the scientists of music . by cutting different size bamboos , -lsb- they -rsb- have been playing this diminished scale -lsb- for centuries -rsb- . so who first created it ? debussy , charlie parker , or the derashe tribes ?  unsurprisingly , i 'm not the only one who 's been presented with such questions by astatke , whose passion about africa 's contribution to music extends back to the 1960s when he went on to fuse the traditional ethiopian five-tone scales with western 12-note harmonies to give life to a whole new music genre : the hypnotizing and eerily seductive soundscape of ethio-jazz . music pioneer . astatke , whose performance saturday at africa utopia was one of the highlights of the london-based festival , has been outspoken about his country 's cultural heritage throughout his five-decade career . yet , the father of ethio-jazz first had to go outside ethiopia to find his musical calling . born in jimma , southwestern ethiopia , in 1943 , astatke was sent to wales as a teenager to further his high school studies , with the goal of studying aeronautical engineering . it was there where his fascination with music began , after being encouraged by his teachers to pick up various musical instruments . astatke quickly discovered his natural musical talent -- and has never looked back . after shelving plans to study engineering , he moved to london to study classical music at trinity college . during those years , he also started performing live , playing congas and timpani in various clubs across the london capital . keen to explore jazz , astatke then decided to enroll at boston 's berklee college of music , becoming the famed institution 's first african student . at berklee , astatke analyzed the work of jazz giants -- anyone from duke ellington and count basie to gil evans and john coltrane -- but was also encouraged to explore his own musical vision .  i remember at berklee we had a fantastic teacher who always used to tell us , ` guys , be yourselves , '  says astatke .  so i started concentrating , working things out my own way and experimenting .  the result was a captivating musical fusion of the four pentatonic ethiopian modes with western jazz .  i started combining the five notes against the 12 notes , and it 's not easy ,  recalls the multi-instrumentalist , who after berklee moved to new york and recorded three albums with the ethiopian quintet .  it 's so difficult because it can easily lose the beauty , the character and the feel of the ethiopian modes and scales ,  he continues .  i really had to think and work out how to combine it both and come up with something beautiful and very interesting -- that 's how ethio-jazz was created , in new york .  cultural ambassador . by the late 1960s , astatke had returned to ethiopia , bringing his electrifying new sounds with him . at first , his radical approach was met with some resistance , especially his use of instruments like vibraphones , electric pianos , trumpets and wah wah pedals . yet , he eventually managed to win the hearts and minds of his co-patriots and became a leading figure in the  swinging addis  era of the late 1960s and early 1970s , when the ethiopian capital of addis ababa became famous for its experimental music scene and vibrant nightlife . during that period astatke also got to work with one of his heroes , duke ellington , escorting the great american jazz composer during his visit to ethiopia in 1973 .  we talked about ethiopian music and the great african contribution -- especially the tribes in ethiopia ,  recalls astatke ,  and i made him listen to our great traditional music players .  astatke enjoyed a successful career in the last years of haile selassie 's reign and continued making music after the ethiopian emperor got deposed in 1974 by the derg military regime , which lasted until the early 1990s . but his big break -- at least for the wide public -- came in 2005 , when award-winning director jim jarmusch decided to use astatke 's music for his bittersweet masterpiece  broken flowers .   jim helped so much for my success , he 's a great man ,  says astatke , recalling his first ever encounter with the american filmmaker .  i was playing in new york and his secretary called up one afternoon and said jim jarmusch would love to come to your concert ,  says astatke .  i said ok , you 're welcome ... we met backstage after the concert and i remember him telling me , ` mulatu i 've been a fan of your music for a long time , do you mind if i use your pieces in my film ? i said , ` great , just go ahead , there 's no problem . '  jarmusch used astatke 's music as the soundtrack to the travels of bill murray 's character , and even included an ethiopian character in the story . the film was widely successful , and helped to introduce astatke 's music to a large and diverse audience -- from jazz and funk enthusiasts to hip-hop and rap fans . several successful tours , collaborations and recordings have since followed , as well as a number of academic accolades -- in recent years astatke has been awarded an honorary doctorate from berklee , has completed a radcliffe institute fellowship at harvard and is working with mit on creating modern versions of traditional ethiopian instruments .  sometimes i just do n't believe myself ,  says astatke .  i am really so surprised when i see that we play for 120,000 people in japan ; in glastonbury i played twice for 140,000 people ,  he continues .  there are some great people who created something and probably died before seeing the fruit -lsb- of their work -rsb- . but i 'm still alive , seeing my music being played all over the world . i 'm very happy and very pleased to see this thing happening while i 'm alive .
