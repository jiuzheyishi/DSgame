' the mother - who has two other young sons - added : ` oliver was so special , and really kind and gentle , he was just lovely . ` at the time he had an 18 month-old brother , finley , who was just at that stage where he really liked his older brother ; it was really , really hard . ' ms blockley took her son to stoke mandeville 's a&e department in october 2011 and was initially told to go back home to thame , oxfordshire , and give him fluids . oliver -lrb- pictured right with mother jennifer and little brother finley -rrb- actually had an invasive form of sore throat bacteria strep a which should have been picked up by a blood test . the young boy soon became dehydrated as he was denied vital fluids . she insisted his condition was more serious and that he remained at the hospital . despite blood tests revealing he was severely dehydrated and was heading for septic shock , doctors continued to refuse him antibiotics or give him fluids . throughout the evening , the nurses and doctors failed to notice oliver 's fast heart rate and rapid breathing - a sign of septic shock - and between 8pm and 1am failed to monitor him at all . despite nurses noticing his grey colour and dilated pupils doctors arrived too late and he died following a cardiac arrest . he was eventually given antibiotics too late - just half an hour before he died . even after his death nurses still told his distressed mother he had a stomach bug and not streptococcal . the family 's solicitor laura cook , of darby 's solicitors , said : ` it 's another sad example of the nhs only admitting to mistakes after legal action is taken , putting the family through additional stress at what is already such a traumatic time . ' he died at the stoke mandeville hospital aged just four , due to 28 admitted counts of negligence by hospital staff in treating oliver for a stomach bug . despite blood tests revealing he was severely dehydrated and was heading for septic shock , doctors continued to refuse him antibiotics or give him fluids . throughout the evening , the nurses and doctors failed to notice oliver 's fast heart rate and rapid breathing - a sign of septic shock - and between 8pm and 1am failed to monitor him at all . anne eden , chief executive of buckinghamshire healthcare nhs trust , said : ' i sincerely and without reservation apologise to ms blockley for the actions of the trust which led to the death of oliver in 2011 . ` we have thoroughly reviewed the circumstances around oliver 's death , as well as policies , procedures and staff training , and we commissioned an independent expert review . ' a number of other improvements have been made , which include strengthening our early warning process for recognising when a child 's condition is getting worse , improving how we care and treat patients with gastroenteritis , in particular the use and types of fluid given and additional advanced life support training . ` we recognise and regret that nothing will ever change this terrible situation for the blockleys but we have learned the lessons and hope these changes will ensure that as far as possible no other family will suffer in the same way .
