' i was n't given enough time last time to present them with what i wanted to and that was a professional expert - a medic to back what i 'm saying . ` it should be my choice because i 'm the one that is going to be caring for neon or the rest ... i have always been his main carer . ' ' i just want to do the best thing for neon and if the doctors have to go down their route and something happens to neon , am i not going to hold that in my mind ? ' seriously ill : neon roberts is due to start radiotherapy next week . she added : ' i would like the opportunity to do all these other treatments for him . ' neon was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour and had an operation to remove it on october 25th last year . doctors said he needed radiotherapy as routine follow-up treatment but his mother missed three hospital appointments and went on the run with neon for four days without telling his father ben , her estranged husband . neon is now due to begin radiotherapy next week , after a judge at the family division of london 's high court overruled mrs roberts ' wishes to try alternative therapies . the child has spent the last week being prepared for his treatment by doctors . today mrs roberts told daybreak that she had many concerns about her son having radiotherapy , including ` damaging the dna ' . she said : ` just altering it and him never recovering from that . his growth . infertile . ` no grandchildren is a big factor . and there 's just so many other treatments that he could be having . ' she said in countries including germany and china , doctors used treatments including ` hyperthermia ' in which heat is used to stimulate healing alongside radiotherapy and chemotherapy to lessen the risk of side effects . mrs roberts said radiotherapy was ` not a sure thing ' and denied that stopping it would kill her son . ` that 's from the doctors here in the uk , ' she said , ` we 've gone abroad and found other doctors who are backing what i 've been saying from the beginning ... . in other countries in the world they are giving these other treatments a chance and doing very well with them . she also refuted concerns that her son might be running out of time , saying : ` that 's what they keep saying but i disagree ' . ` we all want what 's best for neon ' : sally roberts on daybreak this morning . mrs roberts , who is from new zealand but lives in brighton , east sussex , said her son was ` doing very well ' following the most recent operation to remove cancerous cells . neon and his twin sister , electra , spent christmas day with their father , an it consultant from knightsbridge , west london , and his family after mr roberts told mrs roberts she was not welcome following the family rift over how best to treat neon . mr roberts believes his son should receive conventional treatment based on advice from his son 's medical team . doctors advise that patients in cases like neon 's should receive chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 28 days of surgery for the best chance of survival . the boy 's doctors agree that there may be side-effects , but say that without the treatment the little boy could be dead within a few weeks . a doctor told the court last month : ` this boy has a very highly malignant disease and he will die very quickly unless somebody gets their hands on him to treat him . ' mrs roberts said : ` we all want what 's best for neon . he is the most amazing little boy .
