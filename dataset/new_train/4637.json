{"text": "seventy-two bodies discovered at a ranch in northeast mexico belonged to migrants who were making their way toward the united states , mexican officials said wednesday . the preliminary investigation indicates the victims were illegal immigrants from honduras , el salvador , brazil and ecuador , said alejandro poire , spokesman for national security strategy . the motive for the killings was under investigation , though officials pointed out that mexico 's drug cartels have expanded their activities to include extortion and kidnapping of immigrants .  mexican institutions have hit the operational structures of these criminals and their income , and because of that , they turn to extortion and kidnapping of migrants , as well as recruiting them to force them to become part of their group of hit men ,  poire said . the bodies of the 58 men and 14 women were found above ground in a structure on the ranch , which is about 14 miles -lrb- 22 kilometers -rrb- from the town of san fernando , near the border with texas . the mexican navy , which was called in to investigate the case , said it is one of the largest discoveries of bodies in mexico 's 4-year-old war on organized crime . members of the mexican navy were tipped off to the site after a man with a gunshot wound approached a military roadblock . the man said he had been injured by a criminal gang , according to a statement released by the navy . mexico 's attorney general 's office identified the man as an ecuadorean immigrant with a bullet wound to the neck .  the navy went to the area where the man came from and encountered gunfights . a naval officer was killed and three of the delinquents were killed ,  said an officer who answered the telephone at the navy 's communication department . the officer , who was not authorized to speak on the record , declined to give his name . after the gunbattle , authorities said , they found a stash of weapons , including 21 rifles , camouflage uniforms , bulletproof vests and four trucks . one of the vehicles had been disguised to look like a truck from the ministry of national defense , officials said .  this discovery once again demonstrates the extreme danger and violence that central americans face on their treacherous journey north , as well as mexican authorities ' abject failure to protect them ,  amnesty international said .  mexico must immediately investigate this massacre , bring the perpetrators to justice and establish the identities of those killed so that their families can be informed .  wednesday 's gruesome discovery came about a month after authorities in the neighboring state of nuevo leon discovered 51 bodies in nine mass graves . in that instance , investigators found charred remains , incinerated bone fragments and stains of fire on the ground where bodies were presumably burned in steel drums , the state-run notimex news agency said . the bodies were mostly males between age 20 and 50 , notimex said . many of them had tattoos . similar mass graves have been discovered in the mexican states of guerrero and quintana roo since late may . authorities have linked them to mexico 's ongoing drug war . nuevo leon and tamaulipas , which border texas , have seen a marked increase in drug violence this year due to an intensifying rivalry between the gulf cartel and the zetas gang , which was formerly the cartel 's armed branch . last week , authorities found the bound and blindfolded body of edelmiro cavazos leal , the mayor of a city in nuevo leon . he had been abducted two days earlier . his body was found on the outskirts of the city of santiago , where cavazos was mayor . there were signs of torture . news reports indicate that officials believe the zetas ordered cavazos killed . five police officers and a transit worker were arrested last week in connection with the slaying . more than 28,000 people have died in drug-related incidents since president felipe calderon intensified the government 's fight against drug cartels and organized crime after taking office in december 2006 . about 90 percent of the fatalities have been among cartel members and other criminals , calderon has said . cnn 's nick valencia contributed to this report .", "summary": " new : the victims were illegal immigrants heading toward the united states , officials say .   three suspects and a member of the mexican military were killed in a shootout .   the bodies of 58 men and 14 women were found in a building on the ranch .   a man with a gunshot wound led navy personnel to the bodies .
