{"text": "they spend barely any money on bills and produce their own honey . it 's certainly the good life for yvonne and steven lucas , who spend just # 4 a month on their electricity and heating bill by living ` the good life ' . yvonne , 48 , and steven , 53 , from basingstoke , hampshire , have slashed their energy bills by installing solar panels , growing their own fruit and vegetables and collecting rainwater to flush their toilets . the couple have developed their suburban property so as to become as self-sufficient as possible . they have ranks of solar panels in back and front gardens reducing their bills to # 50 a year . the prudent pair model themselves on the characters from cult 1970s comedy tv show the good life , starring richard briers and felicity kendal , by creating a simple and self-sufficient lifestyle . since installing a water meter , they have seen the bills for their three-bedroom detached bungalow drop from # 200 a year to under # 30 for six months . they also own six-acre woodland in surrey as well as their own bee hives to produce honey and chickens to lay fresh eggs . thrifty steven brought his first set of solar panels in 1992 and has stepped up his cost-saving green campaign since being made redundant in 2010 . the former electronics engineer said : ` we visited the centre for technology in wales in 1992 and brought our first couple of solar panels . from that it has just evolved . they grow a huge variety of vegetables , harvest multiple fruits from their home orchard and keep chickens as well as bees . steven turns the handle of a crossley ph1060 paraffin hopper used for topping up the batteries used for storing solar energy in the back garden of the home . ` we have always grown organically but we knew we wanted to do more for the environment and over the years have brought more and more . ' yvonne and steven , who have two sons james , 22 , and jonathon , 19 , installed solar panels in their 40ft garden to generate hot water , which they use in their home . knitting teacher yvonne added : ` we do n't feed our solar panels into the national grid as we store the energy in a two kilowatt battery system . ` if our neighbours did n't have any power we would still be able to turn out lights on , have access to the washing machine and everything else . ` our rain harvesting system also collects around collect around 1,000 gallons which we to flush our toilets and for day-to-day living . ` all our chutneys , jams , cordial and wine are home-made , as well as keeping bees for honey . thrifty steven brought his first set of solar panels in 1992 and has stepped up his cost-saving green campaign since being made redundant in 2010 . ` we 've always been interested in gardening and recycling and having a more environmentally friendly life style . ` gradually we did more and more upgrading , reusing and recycling items which has saved us a lot of money . ' vegetarians yvonne and steven use three allotments , two greenhouses and their garden to grow more than 15 fruit trees , a wide variety of vegetables and herbs , flowers and several ponds . six years ago they also brought the woodland to use the timber to fuel their wood burner and carry our repairs at their eco-friendly property . steven added : ` we only probably spend five hours a week working on the land because we try and keep on top of it . ` we also use the woodland to camp down there once a month to collect and chop wood and enjoy the bird life . ` we have even managed to see badgers down there one evening - until a woodpecker disturbed them . ` it 's great being able to enjoy the great outdoors . ' yvonne said : ` our friends joke we are like the good life television show - we just do n't have a pig in our garden ! ` everybody can do their bit by recycling more and turning things off when they are not in use . ` you ca n't get away from plastic products but you can make sure everything possible gets recycled , sometimes we only put our bins out once a month . ` even composting green waste helps .
