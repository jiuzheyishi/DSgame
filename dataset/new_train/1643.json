{"text": "children born to older dads run a higher risk of having autism , psychiatric disorders and performing badly at school , researchers have warned . they found children conceived when fathers were 45 and older were on average three and a half times more likely to have autistic problems compared with the offspring of men in their early 20s . the risk was even higher at 24-fold for bipolar disorder and 13-fold higher for adhd , says a report in jama psychiatry journal . children born to older dads , such as simon cowell , 54 , run a higher risk of having autism , psychiatric disorders and performing badly at school , researchers have warned . researchers warned that advancing paternal age posed a risk of ` numerous public health and societal problems ' . they said men should be advised about the potential problems in order to help their personal decision-making when it came to having fathering children at older ages . among well-known older dads are simon cowell , 54 , whose son was born earlier this month , and comedian frank skinner whose first child was born in 2012 when he was 55 . mounting research suggests the older age of parents might be partly responsible for growing numbers of children with autism . autism is an umbrella term for a range of developmental disorders that have a lifelong effect on someone 's ability to interact socially and communicate . in the uk , around one in 100 adults is thought to be affected by autism , mostly men , caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors . children born to fathers who are over 45 are three and a half times more likely to have autism . frank skinner was 55 when his first child was born . experts think the link with paternal age could be explained by genetic errors creeping into sperm production as men get older , which build up over time . in the latest study , researchers studied people born in sweden from 1973 to 2001 and estimated the risk of psychiatric problems such as autism , bipolar disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , and academic trouble . the study used several models to establish estimates of risk depending on the father 's age , including comparisons of siblings , cousins and first-born cousins . it concluded there was a 3.5 fold higher risk of autism among children of fathers aged 45 and over , compared with dads aged 20 to 24 years old . those born to older fathers had a 13-fold extra risk of adhd , 24-fold higher risk of bipolar disorder , and double the risk of suicide attempts and substance abuse . there was also a higher risk of academic problems such as failing a grade and low attainment . researcher brian d'onofrio , of indiana university , indiana , u.s. , said : ` advancing paternal age is associated with an increased risk of psychiatric and academic morbidity , with the magnitude to risks being as large , or larger , than previous estimates . ' dr d'onofrio added : ` we were shocked by the findings . ` the specific associations with paternal age were much , much larger than in previous studies . in fact , we found that advancing paternal age was associated with greater risk for several problems , such as adhd , suicide attempts and substance use problems , whereas traditional research designs suggested advancing paternal age may have diminished the rate at which these problems occur . ' previous studies have shown that fathers aged 50 and older are more than twice as likely to have a child diagnosed with autism than younger fathers , while some research suggests older mothers may also be more at risk .", "summary": " those conceived to fathers over 45 are 3.5 times more likely to have autism .   they are 24 times more likely to have bipolar disorder and 13 times more likely to have adhd - could be because genetic errors creep into sperm .
