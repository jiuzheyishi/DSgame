{"text": "nato 's leader confidently proclaimed on sunday that libyan leader moammar gadhafi 's days are numbered , but he could n't foresee how long the alliance 's grinding mission to protect besieged civilians will last .  the game is over for gadhafi ,  nato 's secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen told cnn 's  state of the union .   he should realize sooner rather than later that there 's no future for him or his regime .  nato 's anders fogh rasmussen on the endgame in libya . rasmussen , a former danish prime minister , believes gadhafi will be ushered out of power amid the  wind of change  sweeping across north africa and the middle east , and the dramatic military strides in afghanistan and pakistan .  this week we have seen a major blow to al qaeda and osama bin laden 's evil vision of conflict as a means to create conflict between the muslim world and the rest of the world . and in afghanistan , the taliban is under pressure everywhere , so basically i am very optimistic ,  he said , making reference to the killing of bin laden by u.s. navy seals on monday in pakistan . the alliance has been carrying out a u.n. security council resolution calling for the protection of civilians from the gadhafi regime by any means necessary , and since march 31 , its planes have been pounding targets across the country . according to nato 's latest daily operational update , nato planes struck several targets on sunday , including an ammunition storage site in the zintan region , tanks in misrata and ajdabiya , military vehicles in al-brega , and headquarters compound buildings and ammunition and vehicle storage facilities in hun , south of sirte . there have been widespread assumptions among experts that the conflict between pro- and anti-gadhafi forces will continue to be a stalemate for some time . rasmussen was asked when the nato operation would be completed but all he could say was  it needs an end of the mission .   we have defined three very clear military objectives ,  he said .  firstly , a complete end to all attacks against civilians . secondly , a free and unhindered and immediate access for humanitarian assistance . and thirdly , a withdrawal of gadhafi military forces and paramilitary forces to their bases and barracks . when these objectives are fulfilled , our mission is accomplished .  he said  it 's hard to imagine  that the  outrageous and systematic attacks  by pro-gadhafi forces against libyans will halt as along as gadhafi stays in power . he said there needs to be a political and not a military solution with a  peaceful transition to democracy  as gadhafi leaves power . but the conflict rages on . the tunisian state news-agency reported on sunday that 50 people were injured when government forces and rebels clashed near the tunisian-libyan border on saturday . gadhafi 's forces on saturday bombed key fuel depots in the besieged city of misrata , destroying six containers and causing a massive fire , a rebel spokesman said . meanwhile , in the de facto rebel capital , benghazi , the libyan opposition said saturday that italy has agreed to arm the rebels . abdul hafiz ghoga , deputy chairman of the national transitional council , said opposition representatives have flown to italy to finish the deal . the italian foreign ministry categorically denied it will send weapons to libya . a press office spokesman said italy will only go as far as sending non-lethal weapons such as satellite and radar systems to aid the rebels . the rebels , intent on winning on the ground without foreign troops , have been asking for arms supplies as the war rages in cities like misrata .", "summary": " rasmussen cites the ` wind of change ' in the arab world .   there 's no way to gauge the end of the mission , rasmussen says .   nato planes strike more targets in libya .
