{"text": "troubleshooters : sir michael wilshaw , chief inspector of schools , wants to best teachers to go into the worst schools . hit squads of top teachers and headteachers should be employed directly by the government and parachuted into failing schools , ofsted 's chief inspector said today . experienced staff with a proven track record of success could transform children 's prospects , sir michael wilshaw believes . the trouble shooters would be drawn from teaching schools , which were set up two years ago to train top graduates . they would be targeted at areas which have been identified as the worst-performing in the country . sir michael said : ` we 're calling these teachers  national service teachers  . these would be a tranche of teachers identified -- not newly-qualified teachers , people who are working in schools that we know to be good teachers . ` we 're suggesting to government that they contract with government and are then directed to these schools where children are failing , for a period of time , incentivised to do so -- financially incentivised to do so -- and also then given the chance to move on when they 've proved themselves ... fast-tracked into leadership positions , ' he told bbc radio 4 . sir michael has already revealed that a report he is publishing today , access and achievement , will show inner city areas are no longer hotbeds of under-achievement among pupils . instead , the problem has shifted to deprived coastal towns and rural areas , as well as ` sinking schools ' , often in areas of relative affluence . sir michael added : ` where the problems now are is in schools -- good schools , outstanding schools -- in county areas , with small proportions of poor children who are doing extremely badly . ` the worst place that we found for a poor child to be educated in england is in west berkshire ; not exactly the sort of place you 'd expect . ` west berkshire is a place where poor children do badly in the primary sector , in the secondary sector , and in post-16 in rural areas , like norfolk and suffolk , in lincolnshire and coastal areas , hastings and so on . we need to think carefully about what we 're doing to do in these situations . ' white working-class boys are also the most likely to leave education with few or no decent qualifications now instead of ethnic minorities . rural : sir michael said that leafy west berkshire was the worst place for a poor child to be educated in england . in a speech sir michael said : ` today , many of the disadvantaged children performing least well in school can be found in leafy suburbs , market towns or seaside resorts . often they are spread thinly , as an ` invisible minority ' across areas that are relatively affluent . ` these poor , unseen children can be found in mediocre schools the length and breadth of our country . they are labelled , buried in lower sets , consigned as often as not to indifferent teaching . ` they coast through education until - at the earliest opportunity - they sever their ties with it . ` the most important factor in reversing these trends is to attract and incentivise the best people to the leadership of underperforming schools in these areas . ` this may require government to work with teaching schools to identify and incentivise experienced and effective teachers to work in less fashionable , more remote or challenging places . the concept of a national service teacher should be considered . ' an ofsted insider last night said details of how the scheme would work had not been drawn up , although the idea is they would be ` employed and funded by central government ' . it leaves open the prospect of teams of top teachers being sent in to turn around struggling schools or individuals taking long-term placements . sir michael has already said the report will recommend a series of regional initiatives that will improve weak areas by focusing on leadership and mentoring by leading schools . a department for education spokesman said : ` we will consider ofsted 's recommendations and respond in due course . '", "summary": " sir michael wilshaw warns of ` poor , unseen children in mediocre schools '   demands new focus on failure in coastal and countryside areas .   government should contract the best teachers to parachute into schools .
