{"text": "we 've all been there : the annoying moment when your iphone goes off and you 're busy doing something else . you stop what you 're doing , reach into your pocket or bag , and by the time you 've pulled out the phone , you 're too late to draw your finger across the screen and answer the dratted thing . well , if you thought you were annoyed by missed calls , you obviously were n't as annoyed as this japanese man . scroll down for video . no more missed calls : the japanese inventor demonstrates how his gadget works . as this hilarious footage -lrb- see below -rrb- shows , he has devoted serious thought to the first world problem of missed iphone calls . obviously inspired by the quick-draw technique of gunslinging cowboys in western movies , the young man has designed a holster for the iphone that can , apparently , be strapped to the limb of your choice . the youtube clip shows a detailed drawing of the holster , which seems to be an iphone holder attached to an extending plastic arm that you strap to your arm or leg . when the phone rings , you flick your wrist and the arm shoots out , bringing your phone to your ear in a second . when the phone is not in use , it remains hidden up your sleeve . on the clip , the man demonstrates in agonising detail how the quick draw holster works . how it works : a drawing shows the design of the iphone gadget . moshi-moshi ? the inventor answers his phone within seconds . gunslinger : the man appears to have modelled his design - and technique - on quick-draw cowboys in westerns . shoots from the sleeve : the iphone is always close to hand . in a variety of increasingly bizarre locations -lrb- sitting on a loo , leaping backwards onto his bed , lying beside a toy train track on a building 's roof -rrb- , the inventor shows how the iphone can be at his ear almost immediately it rings . he looks extremely pleased with himself as he stares into the camera . his invention does not always work perfectly , though , with the iphone flying out of its holder and across the room on a couple of occasions . you can wear it on your leg ... or on both legs , should the mood take you . why he felt the need to test his gadget on top of a tall building while lying next to a train-set is anyone 's guess , but it has n't harmed the ratings , which were pushing 1,000,000 this morning , two days after the clip was posted on youtube . most of the comments posted by viewers were positive , but not everyone was so impressed . one person wrote : ` someone needs a girlfriend . ' the inventor does a commando-style roll out of his apartment to demonstrate the holster 's versatility . motive not entirely clear : the inventor shows how he can answer his iphone on top of a rain-soaked office block . off the rails : the innovator shows how he wo n't even miss a call when playing with a trainset . video : watch the hilarious footage showing how to answer your iphone like a cowboy .", "summary": " japanese man gets 1m hits on youtube showing off bizarre phone holster .
