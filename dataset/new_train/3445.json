{"text": "his foreign secretary said last week that the only way to revive britain 's flagging economy was to work harder . but it appears william hague 's blunt words may not apply to david cameron who found time to go home and change into jeans before whisking his wife out for a swanky meal last night . with thoughts of the recession , the euro meltdown and lol-gate placed firmly to one side ` call me dave ' seemed determined to enjoy ` date night ' at oslo court in north london . with its salmon-pink decor and retro puddings , critics say the french restaurant is like stepping back into the 1970s . did you have to wear that coat darling ? david cameron and wife samantha dress down for a night out at french restaurant oslo court in north london . sartorial flair : as ever mrs cameron got it right in a classic breton top and navy trousers with classic taupe coat unlike ` call me dave ' who looked like he was off to scoff pie and mash down the local boozer . that decade was dogged by strikes and economic decline too , which may explain why mr cameron chose to dine at oslo court instead of his regular haunts in upmarket kensington . according to a source , the camerons had been celebrating a family birthday at the restaurant . after tucking into half a dozen oysters and the veal chop the prime minister is thought to have eaten a slice of birthday cake before heading home . in a recent interview he explained how his weekly date night with his wife was important for maintaining a healthy marriage . but the only way to bring colour back into the economy 's cheeks after the uk plunged into its first double-dip recession since 1975 is hard work , according to mr hague . speaking to the sunday telegraph , he delivered a hammer blow to the country 's bosses saying they should stop complaining and get on with reviving economy . work harder : foreign secretary william hague delivered a hammer blow to the country 's bosses saying they should stop complaining and get on with reviving economy by working harder . with its salmon-pink decor and tempting dessert trolley , french restaurant oslo court has changed little since opening its doors in 1970 . it attracts an older , loyal clientele who wolf down bulging glasses of lobster cocktail and whole globe artichokes . david cameron last night dined on half a dozen oysters and veal chop , according to a source . but the restaurant in north london also serves up classic beef wellington , steak , chateaubriand and is well known for its fresh fish and seafood . the dinner menu is a fixed price of # 42.50 with some dishes carrying a small surcharge , allowing you to splash out on a nice bottle of plonk . a bottle of the b√¢tard-montrachet grand cru will set you back # 199 . puds come courtesy of egyptian waiter neil who wheels out his dessert trolley groaning with lemon meringue and tarts in every colour . current owner antonio ` tony ' sanchez - who is ` sadly not french but spanish ' - says he 's well used to seeing famous faces in the restaurant . ` alan sugar was in last week and we 've had joan collins . everyone comes here , ' mr sanchez told the mailonline before adding that bar mr cameron he had n't seen many cabinet members for a while . mr hague may be glad to hear it . ' i think they should be getting on with the task of creating more of those jobs and more of those exports , rather than complaining about it , ' he said . asked if his comments could be compared to lord norman tebbit 's ` on your bike ' message to the unemployed in the 1980s , mr hague said : ` it 's more than that . it 's get on the plane , go and sell things overseas , go and study overseas . ` it 's much more than getting on the bike , the bike did n't go that far . ' his comments are a direct riposte to business leaders , including chief executive of sainsbury 's justin king , who criticised the lack of measures for economic growth in the queen 's speech last week . mr hague , a former comprehensive schoolboy from yorkshire whose parents manufactured soft drinks , is seen as the best person to deliver the tough message , rather than david cameron or george osborne , who have been criticised for their privileged backgrounds . but mr cameron 's privileged background does not appear to have influenced his sartorial choices . in a classic breton top , stone-coloured jacket and navy trousers , his wife look her usual chic self . but with his shiny ` dad ' anorak and pointy work shoes , ` call me dave ' looked ready for pie and mash down the local boozer rather than a lobster cocktail in plush surroundings . in a recent interview the prime minister described himself as a ` romantic ' and revealed that he tries to take his wife out for dinner on valentine 's day - if he remembers to book a table early enough . he also revealed he and his wife have a couple of favourite italian restaurants in upmarket kensington , west london . mr cameron 's image took yet another battering earlier this week when he revealed that the dark side of the moon , by pink floyd was his favourite album . already hounded for being ` out of touch ' during the economic crisis , critics pointed out that the album appears a fitting choice , featuring tracks including us and them , and money . labour leader ed miliband also delivered a hammer blow during the queen 's speech at the state opening of parliament last week . he said : ` in two years , this prime minister has gone from david cameron to david brent . ' keeping it alive : mr cameron said the couple 's weekly date nights help to keep their 16-year marriage going .", "summary": " cameron had half a dozen oysters and the veal chop at french restaurant oslo court in north london .
