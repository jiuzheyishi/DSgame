{"text": "furious : sorina howarth is calling for the baby food to be taken off the shelves after adam nearly choked on an orange pip she believes came from the jar . a mother feared her baby son would die after he turned blue as he choked on an orange pip she claims was in his baby food . sorina howarth , 23 , of fulham , west london , has called for the food to be taken off the shelves , after doctors told her six-month-old adam could have died if he was two months younger . she had to rush her son to hospital after he almost choked to death on the pip just four days before christmas . sorina , who is four and a half months pregnant , is now concerned because little adam is too scared to eat solid food and has gone back to drinking milk . the incident happened at her mother-in-law 's home when she was feeding adam the hipp organic jar of mango and banana . the mother-of-two said : ' i was feeding adam and the rest of the family were in the other room . ` he was eating quite a lot and at the end of the second jar he started to gag , which sometimes means he has had enough . ` he coughed and then really started to choke and i was crying because he was turning blue . ` we rushed him to hospital and i was trying to make him swallow . he was n't crying , which really scared me . ` the hospital found an orange pip lodged in his throat - it was a really large one . ` when it was removed i was absolutely furious . ` the baby food is from four months plus and the hospital said if adam had been that age , he would have choked to death . ' i thought he was going to die - i just could n't believe it . ' mrs howarth called the company the day after and told them she wanted the product , which she bought in a boots store in fulham broadway , taken off the shelves . but she said when a courier showed up at her flat to pick up the jar , he left after she asked him for identification . demands : mrs howarth called the company the day after the incident and told them she wanted the product taken off the shelves . she said : ` when i spoke to the company , they said it was n't necessary to take it off the shelves because it is a freak incident . ' i wanted the pip sent recorded delivery so the company could determine if it came from them , and was told they would send a courier to pick it up for me . ' i was in the shower when he showed up and had to answer the door in my towel . i was absolutely fuming because he joked i should n't have got dressed up for him . terrified : mrs howarth said she thought her son was going to die after he turned blue while choking on a pip , which she believes came from the jar of baby food . mrs howarth sought legal advice and was told she does have a case , but has to prove the pip came from a hipp jar of baby food , and stump up the money for hefty legal fees . she has now sent the pip to the hipp in the uk and says they are going to send it on to germany . she said : ' i do n't want to win money from them , i just want the food taken off the shelves in case something like this happens again . ' case : the 23-year-old mother-of-two , who is four months pregnant , has sought legal advice following the incident , but says she does not want money from the company . she said her husband adam had been left furious following the incident . she said : ` we were both just so shocked and terrified because we thought he was going to die . ` he does n't eat baby food anymore and will only drink milk otherwise he gags , which i think is a mental issue . ` he was obviously scared by it and now literally does n't eat anything , which is really worrying because her is n't putting on any weight . ` i 'm stressed out and pregnant and feel like i am going to explode . you ca n't just play around with kids ' lives like this . ' she has received a letter from the company apologising for her ` distress ' , but says she will ` scream and shout from the rooftops ' until they accept blame and remove the product from supermarkets and shops . the letter says that the company will carry out an investigation and a full report . it says : ` please accept our sincere apologies for the distress and upset this has caused you and your family and thank you for providing us with an opportunity to investigate this further for you . we do hope that your baby has now recovered from this distressing experience . ` we would like to reassure you that we believe our quality control and production standards are the highest in the industry and we rarely receive complaints of any nature . please accept our sincere apologies again for the uncertainty and upset this has caused . ' a hipp organic spokeswoman told the sun mrs howarth had not given the company the jar , so it was unable to investigate . but she said it was ` extremely unlikely ' a pip would get into one of their products .", "summary": " mum sorina howarth said son turned blue as he choked on pip in baby food .   23-year-old told baby boy could have choked to death if two months younger .   company has said it is ` extremely unlikely ' a pip would have been in jar .
