{"text": "if you follow scientific developments as if they were football games , this would be a good time to cheer  tick-tick-tick-tick ! tick-tick-tick-tick ! go , clock , go !  the reason for such enthusiasm ? researchers have released a study in the journal science describing what they believe is the world 's most precise clock . you 'd never need this level of precision for getting to work on time , but the clock could be used for scientific exploration and technological advancements in areas such as navigation systems , said study co-author andrew ludlow , researcher at the national institute of standards and technology in boulder , colorado . the rate of ticking of this timepiece -- known informally -lrb- and awkwardly -rrb- as the ytterbium optical lattice clock -- does not change by more than one part in 10 ^ 18 , ludlow said . in other words , if there is any variation in how a second is measured , it would be in about the 18th decimal place .  the ytterbium optical lattice clock has demonstrated a groundbreaking , new level of clock stability ,  he said .  one could say that this is like measuring time over a hundred years to a precision of several nanoseconds .  in order to understand what 's so special about this table-sized clock , it helps to have a little background : . how clocks work . inside a clock is a mechanism that changes in some regular way , called an oscillator . imagine , for example , a grandfather clock , whose pendulum swings back and forth denoting time . in a wrist watch there is often a crystal with an electrically oscillating signal . a particular number of  back and forths  corresponds to one second . an atomic clock makes use of an electromagnetic signal -- in other words , light emitted at an exact , known frequency . at the core of the system , there is an atom . the light is used to excite an electron in the atom . in this model , the excitation and de-excitation of an electron corresponds to a pendulum swinging right to left , but in an atomic clock , the  tick  denotes an unimaginably tiny fraction of a second . the current gold standard for time is the cesium clock , a type of atomic clock that an international body of experts has used to define what is the unit of one second : about 9.19 billion oscillations . in this clock , a microwave light source is used to excite electrons in cesium atoms . but the new atomic clock at nist , described in the science study , uses a different element : ytterbium , atomic number 70 . optical light -- specifically , yellow light from a laser with a wavelength of 578 nanometers -- is used to excite the electrons of ytterbium atoms . whereas scientists talk about billions of oscillations per second in the cesium clock , oscillations per second in the ytterbium clock approach one quadrillion per second , ludlow said . the new clock is akin to a ruler that has markers for fractions of inches , compared to a ruler that only delineates inches . the first instrument would make more precise measurements .  you divide time into finer and finer intervals ,  ludlow said . in order to establish the precision of this clock , the scientists had to make two of them , to confirm agreement in the measurement of time . the devices wo n't fit on your wrist , or even on your wall . because of all the laser equipment and technology necessary for this level of precision , the atomic clock and all of its components occupy a space about the size of a dining room table , ludlow said . efforts are under way to shrink the technology , however , particularly so that a version of it might be sent into space . potential uses . researchers studying einstein 's theory of general relativity could make use of this clock to more precisely measure how time is different depending on the surrounding gravitational force . global positioning systems -lrb- gps -rrb- already take this into account . because they are farther from earth than we are , and therefore experience less gravitational pull , their measurement of time as they orbit earth is slightly different from what we perceive on the ground . a more precise atomic clock could measure the correctional factors even better . such clocks could also test alternative theories about the relationship between time and gravity . there could be other applications for navigation and communications systems . but you probably wo n't want one for your alarm clock . ludlow said the total cost ranges on the order of a half-million dollars . accuracy . although scientists have proclaimed that this is the world 's most stable clock , they do not yet know as much about its accuracy . this is a subtle but important difference : the ytterbium clock has demonstrated incredible stability of measurement -- it always measures a second in the same way -- but we do not yet know if what it is measuring is a  true  second . so , we 'll have to wait to find out whether these clocks could be the most accurate in the world . more research is needed . it 's a story we hear time and time again . follow elizabeth landau on twitter and google + .", "summary": " new study describes
