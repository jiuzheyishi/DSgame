' only last week the same judge gave jayne godsmark , 41 , an eight-month suspended jail term for stealing # 6,000 from her ailing 98-year-old grandmother 's life savings . louise gallagher , prosecuting , said lowery , who was responsible for his great-grandmother 's financial affairs , stole the cash from an account she had with the hsbc for 40 years . she loaned him her bank card and he was the only one who knew her pin number and used it at cash machines to withdraw money directly from the account or simply wrote out cheques payable to himself . his thieving came to light after his great-grandmother took out an equity release policy on her home with insurance company aviva and lowery attempted to obtain # 30,000 in three tranches over four months in 2011 . the company called in the police and the discrepancies were discovered . ironically , lowery used to collect his great-grandmother 's pension for her without taking any of it . when interviewed by police , lowery said he became ` addicted ' to taking the money and did not realise just how much he had stolen . plea : despite the theft , his great-grandmother brenda begged the judge not to jail him , sheffield crown court -lrb- pictured -rrb- heard . lowery , of beauchief , sheffield admitted theft of # 56,427 from december , 2005 to may , 2012 . vanessa saxton , for lowery , said she needed her great-grandson 's help with managing her finances . he apologised for his behaviour but had not told anyone , even his own family , why he did it . ` his attitude has been one of putting his head in the sand , he is a very quiet individual , ' said miss saxton . he had made frequent small cash withdrawals over a long period of time and was astonished when confronted with the total . ` until now he seems to have led a perfectly respectable life and cared for his great-grandmother all his life , ' said miss saxton . he still lived with mrs lowery but no longer had access to her bank account . judge murphy told lowery he had used the account as a cash dispenser ` to dip into whenever you wanted .
