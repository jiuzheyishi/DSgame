{"text": "a ceasefire negotiated between rival muslim and christian militias brought a brief respite saturday to a central african republic town after two days of violent clashes . the truce between the muslim seleka militia and the christian anti-balaka in bossangoa allowed aid agencies to begin assessing the needs of the population caught in the midst of the violence . at the ecole liberte school , where a makeshift displaced camp sprang up in september to harbor fleeing muslims , the numbers swelled during the clashes from around 2,500 displaced to nearly 10,000 . the people there are in need of almost everything : food , water and shelter . over in a catholic church compound where 35,000 christians sought refuge from the seleka militias in september , the camp is more established , but water and food supplies are dwindling and there is very little shelter from the elements . malaria and malnutrition are all too common among the camps ' denizens . a tense standoff had developed earlier between the seleka and the regional peacekeeping force , fomac , after the militia threw grenades into the compound in an attempt to storm it . a soldier from fomac was killed during an exchange of fire . there is still no official death toll , but witnesses at the ecole liberte camp told cnn at least 19 muslims were killed in what has become a spiraling cycle of retribution between the two communities . the anti-balaka began targeting muslims after tens of thousands of christians were forced to flee their homes as seleka militias marauded through the countryside . ` extremely dire circumstances ' julian donald overseeing a hospital in bossangoa managed by doctors without borders , or medecins sans frontieres , said the aid group had worked through the violence , almost overwhelmed by the flood of patients .  we have been fully operational the entire time ,  he said .  i ca n't give you any numbers right now , i 'm sorry , all i can say is it 's still ongoing .  but the work he and his agency do is not enough , donald said . the central african republic desperately needs more help from the outside world .  a situation where you have hundreds of thousands of people who through no fault of their own are living in extremely dire circumstances , i would hope that the international community would mobilize to provide them assistance ,  he said .  the fact that we have n't seen it happen yet is a tragedy .  some help could be on the way . on thursday , the u.n. security council unanimously approved a resolution approving military intervention in the central african republic by an african union-led force , backed by french troops , to protect civilians , restore humanitarian access and stabilize the country . the number of african union peacekeeping troops in the country will increase to 6,000 -- up from the current 3,500 -- the french presidency said . central african republic : what 's going on , what 's at stake , what 's next .

end of saturday , french president francois hollande said at the peace and security in africa summit in paris . by saturday evening , some of them had arrived in the northern city of bossangoa . france 's goal is for the nation to be able to hold elections once security is restored , in the same way that france helped mali return to democracy , hollande said . france 's intervention in the central african republic is for humanitarian reasons , not to fight terrorism , he said . there have not been many incidents of violence in the country saturday , hollande added . the start of the french soldiers ' new operation in the car capital was announced friday morning by defense minister jean-yves le drian on the french radio station rfi . about 185 miles south of bossangoa , bangui has also been rocked by two days of clashes . many have flocked to the city 's airport , hoping to find safety there .  we estimate at least at 400 to 500 people have been killed so far in bangui and the killings continue ,  peter n. bouckaert , emergencies director for human rights watch , told cnn saturday .  two hundred and eighty bodies were recovered as of yesterday , but the red cross tells us there are more bodies on the streets that they are working to recover .  medecins sans frontieres said friday that at least 92 bodies had been brought to the morgue of a hospital where its staff is working . another 170 people have been treated for injuries , including gunshot , machete or knife wounds , it said . opinion : why central african republic is slipping close to catastrophe . air sorties . a french defense ministry statement early saturday said three helicopters and hundreds more troops had arrived in bangui . french troops have been out on patrol in a bid to restore calm to the city , which remains tense , as well as working to safeguard french nationals and secure the airport , the statement said . aerial sorties have also been launched above the capital to signal the french forces ' presence to armed forces thought to be opposed to them . back at the catholic church compound in bossangoa , people scattered , screaming , as the unfamiliar boom of a low-flying jet swept over them . the horror soon turned to laughs of jubilation , however , with shouts of  the french ! the french !  desperate for help from the outside world , they hoped the sonic boom was a sign from the french forces that they would soon be there too . french troops begin operation in central african republic as violence worsens . fears of genocide : 10 things to know about the central
