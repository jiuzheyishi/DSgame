{"text": "in the seven years since its founding , twitter has become a go-to place for news updates , witty one-liners , political one-upmanship and even absurdist storytelling . it 's also become a go-to place for intolerant bile . on sunday night , nina davuluri , an american of indian ancestry , was named miss america . immediately , the twitterverse started spewing .  this is miss america ... not miss foreign country ,  said @meredithroanell .  congratulations al-qaeda . our miss america is one of you ,  posted @blayne_mkitrain . what is it about twitter ? whether the events are earthshaking or trivial , the site of more than a half-billion accounts has something to say -- and often , it 's upset . ben affleck is named the new batman ; the anger flows . george zimmerman is acquitted ; people fly off the handle . comments on sports , tv shows , politics , news media -- when there 's something negative to be said , it will be said -lrb- occasionally with poor spelling and in all caps -rrb- on twitter . as stephen colbert summarized the miss america outcry on  the colbert report ,   and twitter , as usual , could not be happy .  david reiss , a san diego-based psychiatrist who specializes in personality dynamics , observes that twitter 's impulsiveness can get the best of people .  it 's very easy to jot something off and hit send , and you can impulsively say something without thinking it through ,  he says , noting that it 's the reverse of the classic angry letter you write and then put in a drawer until you cool off .  with twitter , you do n't need to -lrb- do that -rrb- . and if there is feedback or push back , you do n't necessarily even see it .  as of friday afternoon , twitter had not responded to a request from cnn for comment . ` anger is more influential ' such anger is n't just limited to twitter , of course . you can find it on other social media platforms , news site comment boards -- including on cnn.com -- and pretty much all over the internet . youtube , for example , also has been known for attracting mean-spirited comments . still , twitter is an easy target . besides the impulsiveness reiss mentions , there 's a typical litany of virtual-world reasons for twitter 's vitriol : anonymity , a perceived lack of consequences , a troll-ish desire to stir the pot . but perhaps the most intriguing was revealed in a study published recently by beihang university researchers . by analyzing posts on weibo , a chinese version of twitter , they determined that anger is the most powerful online emotion . of the four basic emotions into which they classified tweets , sadness and disgust barely travel . joy does better . but anger , like a potent virus , spreads the fastest and most widely of all .  our results show that anger is more influential than other emotions like joy , which indicates that the angry tweets can spread quickly and broadly in the network ,  the researchers wrote . 23 key moments from twitter history . the idea of twitter anger is so prominent that monica stephens , a geography professor at humboldt state university in california , put together a map titled  the geography of hate .  the project was inspired , in part , by racial slurs on twitter after president obama 's re-election . the map highlights sections of the country that engage in certain hate speech based on keywords , aggregated by county and adjusted for population . the results have favored rural areas , which stephens attributes to insularity and fear of outsiders . indeed , a more accurate title for the map would be  the geography of xenophobia ,  she says . the map certainly hit home with certain parts of the country , stephens says .  so many people lashed out in anger towards me after seeing it ,  she says .  i have hundreds of really angry e-mails that start with the term ` racist bitch . '  anonymity and distance . this is n't the sort of thing that tends to happen as widely on facebook or other social media sites . there are a couple reasons for that , says tammy vigil , a professor at boston university 's school of communication . one is that facebook is largely a closed system in which you mainly communicate with people you know -- unlike twitter , where a tweet goes out to the whole world . moreover , facebook friends can react more directly to vitriolic posts , either by calling the poster out or simply unfriending him or her , she says . in may , the site strengthened policies to stamp out hate speech .  with facebook , there 's more accountability ,  says vigil .  most people 's facebook accounts have multiple pictures of them , they 've got connections to ` these are my friends . ' there 's a lot less of the anonymity , so there 's a little less of the disinhibition that occurs .  twitter also creates more distance , adds lesley withers , a communications professor at central michigan university .  it 's asynchronous -- you 're not chatting real-time with another person -- so there 's less of a sense that the other people out there are real ,  she says . a phone call or even some kinds of online dialogue establishes a connection that you 're dealing with actual human beings . but on twitter , that connection is n't there , so  that allows us to go off in ways that we would n't choose to do if we had to look at another person 's face when we did it .  consequences ? twitter 's brief screeds seldom have consequences , though that may be changing . the site recently created a  report abuse  button and the media -- which is often to blame for highlighting anger -- is paying more attention to bullying on the site . but the idea of consequences is hard for twitter users to understand , observes withers .  i think people do n't think about the long-term ramifications ,  she says .  when i talk with students about how they use social media and say that a lot of employers will look to see what kinds of things you 're posting on facebook or twitter , i 'm surprised by the number of people who say , ` any employer that would stalk me that way online , i would n't want to work for them anyway . '  there are signs that a growing number of twitter users do n't like the venom in their midst . after the nastiness with miss america , a number of people responded with positive tweets congratulating her . some even reprimanded the angry tweeters -- and received apologies .  i am so sorry . i did n't think before i tweeted what i did . i absolutely did not mean to hurt or offend anyone . again i am so very sorry !!!  tweeted @jayres15 . withers points out that the system has much to overcome .  people use twitter to get reactions out of others ,  she says .  it 's like a popularity contest : if you can put something out there that 's quick and inflammatory and it gets retweeted a ton , that 's your feedback -- that 's how you know that it was an interesting or effective tweet . and people do n't seem to be as concerned if the response is positive or negative .  and what works ? let 's all scream it at the top of our lungs : anger .  anger is an empowering emotion . you can post something angry and it can make other people feel something . it allows us an opportunity to be dramatic ,  says withers .  and a lot of people really like drama . ", "summary": " the crowning of miss america on sunday led to angry , often bigoted tweets .   twitter has become a go-to place for online anger .   many reasons : it 's fast , brief , requires little thought -- and anger is powerful .   such behavior is less common on facebook , where people interact mostly with friends .
