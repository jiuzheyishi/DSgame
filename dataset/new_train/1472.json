{"text": "a jobless single mother who flaunted her notoriety as a serial shoplifter with the boast , ` at least i 'm famous ' , has finally been locked up . jade underwood was banned from 80 stores and had her photograph displayed on police posters after stealing relentlessly and terrorising her community . just two weeks after being made the subject of a crasbo -- a criminal anti-social behaviour order -- the 23-year-old returned to her old habits . ` at least i am famous ' : single mother jade underwood appeared to enjoy the comparison made between her and character vicky pollard , right , who was played by matt lucas in the comedy little britain . magistrates were told that she was caught stealing # 110 of perfume from debenhams in stockport . she also stole food and dvds from another shop and ignored a community punishment order by failing to turn up for an appointment . underwood , who has been likened to vicky pollard , the foul-mouthed , tracksuit - bottomed character in little britain , has now been jailed for ten weeks for five offences of theft . at stockport magistrates court she was also barred from a further 120 shops across the town centre . yesterday one shopkeeper said they were relieved underwood had finally been sent to prison . ` that woman has been nothing but a menace , ' the shopowner said . ` prison 's probably too good for the likes of her , but at least it will keep her from us -- for now . ' neighbours said the 5ft tall mother of three treated shoplifting as a vocation , bragging about her daily sprees . shame : bright yellow posters showing jade 's face were posted all around the area encouraging locals to report her if she flouted her crasbo . one boots store , in edgeley , stockport , had been targeted so many times that staff even stopped putting make-up on display . she also verbally abused parents taking their children to and from a local primary school and tormented neighbours in the tower block she lived in before being evicted for playing loud music until 5am . in may , after a catalogue of complaints about underwood , police obtained the crasbo , which differs from an asbo in that it is imposed after a criminal conviction . in court she was described as a ` prolific shoplifter ' who ` on numerous occasions used language and behaviour that has caused considerable alarm , harassment and distress to shop staff ' . shameless : mother-of-three jade ` treated shoplifting like a job ' , would openly tell neighbours she was off to steal and refused to work because she was better off on benefits . the crasbo barred underwood from the main shopping street in edgeley , a primary school and supermarkets . posters bearing her grim-faced photo were put up to encourage residents to report her if she flouted the bans . but underwood was undeterred and instead toasted her crasbo on facebook , posting a series of misspelt , crude messages from her new flat in withington , manchester . one said : ` heyy yah dont bring me down , let meh tell u f *** ing hell least am famouse sad stupid t ** ts !! yah all whata leve meh da f *** alone coz m8 u whata start playing games like dat . . ! ' despite the threat of prison , the posters made jade feel like a celebrity and she was caught shoplifting again just two weeks later in debenhams . former neighbour john duggan , 55 , said : ` this woman has absolutely no shame whatsoever . she would openly say to me ,  i 'm going shoplifting today .  ` she was not ashamed about telling me . ` a leopard can never change their spots . she will never stop what she is doing . ` she used to wear tracksuits and looked just like vicky pollard from the tv show . she 's a little terror . ' yesterday pc jon daniels , of greater manchester police , said : ` when she stole something , she would sometimes become abusive and shout in the middle of the store . ` the jail sentence shows if you breach your order , what can happen . ' he added : ` shoplifting has a massive knock-on effect for stores and can really add up . ` shops can lose thousands in a month and can close down through stock loss . ' cj 's in stockport was just one of the original 80 shops which jade was banned from as a result of her persistent shoplifting .", "summary": " jade underwood , 23 , abused neighbours , shop staff and mothers taking children to school .   bragged online about being ` famous ' after being slapped with a ` super abso ' for her appalling behaviour .   jailed for 10 weeks for five offences after appearing at stockport magistrates .
