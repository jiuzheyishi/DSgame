{"text": "a woman who failed to reveal she was a convicted thief when she applied to become a police constable is suing scotland yard for discrimination . rachida sobhi 's bid to become a wpc was turned down when background checks revealed she had a criminal record for stealing from a previous employer . but she has launched legal action against the force , claiming that she has amnesia that caused her to forget her crime -- but no other aspect of her life . it is believed that ms sobhi is the first person with amnesia to have been declared disabled for the purposes of an employment tribunal . rachida sobhi -lrb- left -rrb- in her pcso uniform at a community event in notting hill . she is suing the met for disability discrimination . astonishingly , her claim has been backed by a renowned psychiatrist -- but the metropolitanpolice is ` vigorously ' contesting her case , arguing that her condition is irrelevant as she would not be allowed to become a constable with her criminal record in any case . the case , which has been described as ` bizarre ' , has raised fresh concerns about the compensation culture in the police . earlier this year the mail on sunday revealed that pc kelly jones was suing a petrol station owner because she tripped over his kerb while investigating a possible break-in . ms sobhi , who is already employed by the met as a police community support officer , has had her case dismissed by an employment tribunal . but she won the right to a fresh hearing after a senior judge ruled she was indeed disabled when she filled in the application form . as a pcso -- nicknamed ` plastic police ' because of their lack of arrest powers -- she can earn up to # 28,539 a year . she previously worked in notting hill in west london and continues to be employed by the met as part of a ` safer neighbourhoods team ' in bromley , south east london , patrolling local streets with regular police officers and attending community events . mr justice keith allowed a new hearing . he said that she forgot about her conviction due to traumatic events in her life . in august 2008 she applied to become a . constable but when her fingerprints were taken as part of the process . it emerged that she had a criminal record . ` she . had been convicted in 1991 of an offence of theft from a previous . employer for which she had been conditionally discharged , ' according to . the judgment of the appeal tribunal published this week . it . is understood she had been a cashier in a department store in brixton , . south london , and was arrested with other staff for stealing make-up . friends say she protested her . innocence at the time but she was convicted and received a conditional . discharge , which means the offence went on her criminal record but she . received no further punishment . ms . sobhi received a disciplinary reprimand for not mentioning the . conviction in her initial application to become a pcso or during her . attempt to become a pc . undeterred , in november 2009 she applied again to become a constable and was knocked back because of her reprimand -- but bosses made clear her conviction would have ruled her out anyway . although around 1,000 police officers and pcsos in england and wales are thought to have criminal records , those found guilty of serious offences such as dishonesty are not allowed to serve in the force . a year later ms sobhi , who is of moroccan background and thought to be in her early 40s , filed a claim in the london central employment tribunal ` complaining of discrimination on the ground of her sex , her sexual orientation , her religion or beliefs , her age and her disability ' against the met and several individuals . it was claimed that the met treated her ` less favourably ' because of her condition and failed to take ` reasonable steps ' to accommodate her . ` her case is that when she had originally applied to become a police constable , she had forgotten about her conviction and the facts to which it related as a result of traumatic events in her life , ' said tribunal judge mr justice keith . the met apparently accepts she was suffering from ` dissociative amnesia ' -- a form of mental illness that involves gaps in memory -- when she filled in the questionnaire . but its lawyers say she should have admitted ` she did not know whether or not she had any convictions ' . at a pre-hearing review in may 2011 , neuropsychiatrist michael kopelman said ms sobhi had been suffering from depression . the case has raised new concerns about the compensation culture in the police . pc kelly jones sued the force for a prang in her car . the expert said her memory loss was likely to be a genuine effect of ` traumatic circumstances ' and that it only affected ` her ability to recall events around the time of her arrest and conviction in 1991 ' . the mail on sunday has attempted to establish what these circumstances were . although ms sobhi , her lawyers and the police declined to explain , sources have suggested she had a baby when young and had a difficult family life . she got married in 1991 but later separated from her husband . yet the ` relatively small gap ' in her memory did not affect her current job , prof kopelman said . her discrimination claim was initially dismissed by a judge , who ruled she had not been disabled at the time of the job application . but last month mr justice keith said : ` ms sobhi 's appeal must be allowed , the employment judge 's finding that she was not a disabled person must be set aside , as must his order that her claim of discrimination on the ground of her disability be dismissed . the case must be remitted to the employment tribunal . ' the fresh hearing will consider if ms . sobhi actually knew she had amnesia when she filled in the form , and if . it had a substantial effect on her day-to-day activities . a . met spokesman said : ` we believe the first hearing outcome was the . correct one and will vigorously defend our position at all future . hearings . we would not wish to discuss our position further prior to . proceedings . ' the average . compensation awarded in employment tribunals in cases of disability . discrimination last year was # 22,183 . the maximum awarded was # 390,871 , . although there is no upper limit . dissociative amnesia is a real condition triggered by traumatic events rather than physical injury , say experts . but they stress it is almost always caused by extreme incidents such as repeated childhood sexual abuse . sufferers ' brains forget the events to escape the emotional pain of the memory . dr christopher findlay explained the condition was considered ` dissociative ' because sufferers ` separated off an emotional part of themselves ' by forgetting a trauma.the condition is included in the psychiatrists ' ` bible ' , the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders -lrb- dsm -rrb- . but dr findlay said the condition was ` very rare ' and was not usually confined to forgetting a single event . he said he would want to have an extensive psychiatric report to prove a single episode of amnesia was ` part of a wider disorder ' . and clinical psychologist dr roderick orner said : ` memory loss of such a one-off event does not really fit the typical profile for dissociative amnesia . ' brian paddick , a former deputy assistant commissioner at scotland yard , said : ` it 's a complete and utter farce . i think it 's extraordinary . ` people with convictions for dishonesty should not be police officers , full stop . we 've got enough problems with people not trusting the police as it is . ' but he denied the met had a wider problem with employment tribunal claims , saying : ` the fact that they did n't give way and are defending it shows that they are trying to stand up for themselves . ' keith vaz mp , chairman of the commons home affairs select committee , said : ` this is a bizarre case and appears to extend the law beyond what parliament has intended . the met is absolutely right to resist this claim . it is essential that there is full disclosure at the time of applications to join the police . ' dissociative amnesia is a type of memory loss not linked to a physical cause , such as a head injury , but traumatic events , such as being in a car crash or childhood abuse , and some doctors doubt it can be triggered by relatively trivial events .", "summary": " background checks revealed that rachida sobhi had a criminal record .   was a cashier in department store and arrested for stealing make-up .   launched legal action as her amnesia made her forget her crime .   she has not forgotten any other aspect of her life .
