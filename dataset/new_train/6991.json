{"text": "hillary clinton fans and foes need not rush to the store tomorrow morning to buy the former secretary of state 's book hard choices , readers who obtained early copies say . the juicy sections of the book have already been leaked , and book is overall ' a newsless snore , ' politico 's mike allen said today in his morning newsletter . hard choices was ` written so carefully not to offend that it will fuel the notion that politics infuses every part of her life , ' allen said . ` in this book , like in  the lego movie  theme song , everyone is awesome ! ' hillary clinton 's soon-to-be released book hard choices is getting bad reviews . at . one point in the book , clinton , a likely 2016 presidential candidate , discusses criticism and notes that , . ` your critics can actually teach you lessons your friends ca n't or . wo n't . ' ' i try to sort out the . motivation for criticism whether partisan , ideological , commercial , or . sexist , analyze it to see what i might learn from it , and discard the . rest . ' what clinton ought to take away from criticism of hard choices is that she should be more honest in her next book , readers say . ` clinton 's account is the low-salt , . low-fat , low-calorie offering with vanilla pudding as the dessert , ' slate 's john dickerson said in a review today titled ` safe choices . ' likewise , allen said a republican who has already devoured the book told him in an email , ` honestly , it is so vanilla and picked over . ' she does a lot of complimenting people in d.c. everyone is . clear-eyed and indefatigable . ' '  hard choices  is no tell-all by a former official looking to settle . scores , ' says the washington post 's dan balz . balz quotes clinton as writing in the book that she did n't always agree with president barack obama and other administration officials , ` some of those times you 'll read about in this book , but others will remain private to honor the cone of . confidentiality that should exist between a president and his secretary . of state , especially while he is still in office . ' the anecdotes in the book mostly fall into the latter category , if early reviews are to be believed . clinton Â¿ s account is the low-salt , low-fat , low-calorie offering with vanilla pudding as the dessert , ' one critic said . clinton has routinely said that she 's not yet certain of her future political plans . it 's clear from the book that she is ` keeping all her political options open , ' however , new york times reporter michiko kakutani , writes . the 2008 presidential candidate obviously wants to be ` known not only for mastering the art of diplomacy , but also for having the policy chops to become chooser-in-chief , ' he said . but clinton does n't quite get the job done , according to dickerson . ` the . entire message of the book is that foreign policy is hard and . complicated , so when obama goes another route , ' than the one she advised . him to take , ` clinton explains that it . was a reasonable path to take having weighed all the complexities ' instead of explaining why her way would have been better , dickerson says . ` no one likes to . lose a debate , including me . but this was the president 's call and i . respected his deliberations and decision , ' clinton says after explaining that she wanted to assist syrian rebel forces in forcibly removing syrian president bashar al-assad from power but obama said no . on a similar note , balz said , ` the book is a careful document designed to preserve , perhaps burnish , . future possibilities . ' balz wrote that the ` normally cautious clinton ' comes off in the book as ` less a visionary and more a practical-minded problem solver . ' the purpose of clinton 's memoir was n't to provide a vision , though , new york times magazine 's mark leibovich says . like most memoirs by politicians and presidential hopefuls , clinton likely penned the book for the following reasons : ' a payday , the aforementioned shadow campaign , the future right to say ,  i addressed that in my book  -- but reading pleasure is not among them . ' ` as a general rule , the most engaging political memoirs are written by those who are ending their political careers , ' leibovich said in an article panning clinton 's memoir last month . such books out to be called , ` contractually obligated and desperate not to offend , ' republican strategist mike murphy told leibovich . ` when someone is brave enough to write one of these books and call it  screw iowa and new hampshire  or something , then i might actually read it , ' murphy said , referring to the states that traditionally hold their presidential primaries first , and therefore set the tone on the race . in an interview with abc 's diane sawyers about the book , clinton said she 'll make her decision about running for president again after she finishes her book tour and the 2014 midterm elections are over this fall .", "summary": " hillary clinton 's memoir hard choices does n't come out until tomorrow , but the juicy potions have already been leaked in the press .   early readers of the book say that it 's ' a newsless snore ' and a ` low-salt , .   low-fat , low-calorie offering with vanilla pudding as the dessert '   clinton goes out of her way to portray her former colleagues and the president positively rather than telling readers what she really thinks , reviewers say .
