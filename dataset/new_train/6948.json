{"text": "a mother made the heartbreaking decision to have an abortion after being told there was a 50 per cent chance that giving birth would kill her . doctors told lucy buckby , 28 , that she was at high risk of dying during labour due to a serious heart condition which only became apparent during her third pregnancy . miss buckby , of york , says she still lives with deep regret after agreeing to the advice to terminate the pregnancy . lucy buckby -lrb- pictured with her oldest child , thomas , when he was a baby -rrb- was diagnosed with high blood pressure in her pulmonary arteries when she was pregnant with her third son , jayden . but says she feels thankful to her son , who she named jayden , for alerting her to her potentially fatal idiopathic pulmonary hypertension . she said : ` i sometimes wonder whether i would have been able to survive the labour , and whether i did the right thing . ` i asked to see an ultrasound of jayden alive before i gave birth to him when he was 17 weeks old . my son was very small , but in my heart he was a human being . ` we christened jayden and we held a funeral . the decision i made is something i 'll have to live with for the rest of my life , but i believe his purpose was to let me know about the heart condition . ` if it was n't for jayden , my two older sons could have been left without their mum . ' miss buckby and her partner , factory worker john smith , 29 , were delighted when they discovered she was 11 weeks pregnant in april 2013 . ms buckby was warned that there was a 50 per cent chance she would die during childbirth and she was advised to terminate baby jayden . miss buckby made the heart-breaking decision to go ahead with the termination when she was 17 weeks pregnant . she made the decision for fear of leaving her other children without a mother . soon after discovering the happy news , however , miss buckby 's health began deteriorating rapidly . in early may , she collapsed while in town on a shopping trip . she said : ` i was walking down the street when i felt myself slump . i was completely out of breath and felt sick to my stomach . i sat down on a bench and was horrified when i realised i simply could n't move . ' an ambulance rushed her to the york hospital , where doctors began urgent tests . pulmonary hypertension is raised blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries . these are the blood vessels that supply the lungs . the term idiopathic means that the underlying cause is unknown . pulmonary hypertension is a serious condition that can damage the right side of the heart , making it less efficient at pumping blood around the body . symptoms include shortness of breath , fatigue , feeling faint , chest pain , a racing heartbeat and leg swelling . the condition occurs when the walls of the pulmonary arteries are thick and stiff making it difficult for them to expand to allow more blood through when the heart is under any strain - such as during exercise . it can also occur if the arteries are blocked by blood clots . the reduced blood flow makes it hard for the right side of the heart to pump blood meaning it has to work harder . if it is continuously having to work harder than it should , it may become weaker . this can eventually lead to heart failure . the condition usually gets progressively worse but it can be treated with some medications . two thirds of people with pulmonary hypertension now live for more than five years after their diagnosis . there is a high risk of death during pregnancy and childbirth for women with the condition . this is because they can suffer heart failure as a result of the pregnancy or birth putting extra strain on their already struggling heart . source : nhs choices . miss buckby , who has two other children , thomas , eight , and ashley , two , did not leave hospital for nearly a month . she said : ` they wondered whether i had a blood clot on my lungs , but i was transferred to a specialist heart unit at the freeman hospital in newcastle , where they confirmed idiopathic pulmonary hypertension . ' pulmonary hypertension is high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries , which are the blood vessels which supply the lungs . it is a serious medical condition that can damage the right side of the heart , making the heart less efficient at pumping blood around the body and getting oxygen to the muscles . symptoms include shortness of breath , fatigue , chest pains , feeling faint and leg swelling . it can lead to the sudden death of a woman during childbirth when the heart is put under strain . about two thirds of patients live for more than five years after diagnosis . the word idiopathic means the root cause of miss buckby 's condition remains unknown . as miss buckby struggled to come to terms with the life-changing diagnosis , she was faced with a heartbreaking decision - either continue with her pregnancy knowing there was a high chance both she and her unborn child would die , or agree to a termination . she said : ` i do n't agree with abortion unless there are very extreme circumstances . i never thought i would have to face a choice like that . ` the consultant made it absolutely clear that if i decided to continue with the pregnancy , i would be doing so against strong medical advice to terminate . ` i thought about what life would be like for my two other children if i died . it had n't been long since i 'd given birth to ashley and i did n't want to leave my boys without their mum . ` i still felt protective over my child , so i asked for a scan and discovered he was a boy . we decided to name him jayden . ' the pregnancy was then terminated and miss buckby endured an induced labour , after which hand and footprints were taken . it was safer for her to go through a carefully managed labour after just 17 weeks of pregnancy , when the baby was very small , that to wait until the baby was bigger and it would put more strain on her heart to deliver him . miss buckby said : ` we were heartbroken . we had jayden christened and then john took him to be with him in the accommodation area while i recovered on the ward . miss buckby -lrb- pictured with thomas -rrb- says she credits jayden with saving her life . ` he was buried after a service . i was too upset to say anything during the memorial . ' today , miss buckby takes medication to manage her heart condition and must attend hospital for regular check-ups . she said : ` jayden is now my guardian angel . he let us know about the heart condition and without him , i might not be here today . he was tiny , but he was looking after me . ` i believe it was his purpose in life to make sure that his brothers could spend more time with me . ` i wonder what the future would have been like with jayden with us . i know that one day , i will see him again .
