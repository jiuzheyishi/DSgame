{"text": "san diego , california at last , a wisconsin mother and her long-lost son met saturday for the first time since her estranged husband spirited him away to mexico more than 30 years ago . it was an emotional reunion in the san diego airport , heightened by the fact that the mother speaks only english and her 37-year-old son only spanish . david amaya barrick , whose father took him across the border at about age 2 from chicago , was biting his nails just before his mother , kathy amaya , now 60 , appeared before him in the airport . they embraced , hugged and kissed -- the first time they 've laid eyes on each other in about 35 years . the son spoke in spanish :  i love you and i missed you a lot . i welcome you into my life .  the mother declared to her son :  i love you and i 'm very happy to see you and i 'm not going to let you go .  later , the son told reporters that he was at a loss of words . the mother remarked :  he 's all grown up .  abducted son reunites with father after 13 years . the mother and son will spend a few days in san diego getting to know each other again . they will do so during long strolls along the beach , they said . then they will travel tuesday to her home in chippewa falls , wisconsin , where they will enjoy thanksgiving together . kathy amaya , an assistant housekeeper at a hotel , has four adult children who are half-siblings to david amaya . two of those adult children live with kathy amaya . saturday 's journey to see her son also marked another milestone in kathy amaya 's life : it was the first time she ever flew in a plane . the separation between mother and son spanned 1,800 miles and lasted more than 30 years . the mother counts the absence as 35 years , the son as 34 years -- an exact figure to be certainly figured out while they get reacquainted . the family saga then took a dramatic turn by how david amaya was discovered : he was arrested illegally crossing the u.s.-mexico border at imperial beach , california , on october 30 . the u.s. border patrol thought he and a mexican national were smugglers because they were in the company of six romanian nationals . they were all arrested after crossing a flood control tunnel frequented by intravenous drug users and polluted by human waste . bandits had earlier robbed david amaya of his money and cell phone , leaving him only the clothes he was wearing . david amaya did n't even have any identification cards on him . at first , he said he was a mexican national , and then , as if he summoned a distant memory , he told border patrol agents that he was a u.s. citizen born in chicago . freed iranian journalist , ` proud ' son dream of a reunion . border patrol agents checked out his story and indeed found his birth certificate -- as well as his mother , in wisconsin . complicating the drama are the conflicting parental accounts about the son 's relocation to san luis potosi , mexico , where he was raised by paternal grandparents . kathy amaya said her estranged husband took the boy to mexico without her permission and would n't return him . she mailed letters to the grandparents in san luis potosi , but those notes were never answered , she said . more recently , she searched for her son under the name  david amaya  for years on social media , but she never knew that he was using her maiden name -- barrick -- as part of his full name , a common practice in latin america . her estranged husband , who has n't made himself available for comment , told their son that his mother abandoned him at an orphanage because she did n't love him , david amaya said . but after the father put the boy in the grandparents ' care ,  he almost never spent time with me ,  david amaya said . at one point , the mother nearly lost all hope of ever seeing her son again , unable to make contact with him , she said . when the couple divorced in 1986 , they did n't settle on child custody , so police were unable to help her , she said . david amaya will spend the holidays with his mother in wisconsin for a month , and he hopes to speak with his father about what really happened to him when he was 2 or 3 years old . then david amaya will return to san diego to build a new life . he was a drummer in a band in mexico and now likes san diego 's proximity to mexico and its cultural atmosphere . moreover , he 's taken a liking to a local church pastor , freddy rivas , who has helped amaya with food and shelter since the border patrol released him this month . amaya was recently baptized at the church . while in mexico , he married and divorced , and his ex-wife and their two children live in mexico city . as he makes a new home in san diego , he says he will recount his life by writing a book .", "summary": " mother
