{"text": "` big hoax ' : david morrison , a senior scientist and astrobiologist at nasa 's ames research centre , appears in the short film to dispel doomsday rumours . nasa tried to calm fears that doomsday is due at some point today with the release of a second video of a senior scientist dispelling the various rumours of impending apocalypse . there are fears that the end of the mayan long count calendar , which some experts say comes today , signals the end of the world . david morrison , a senior scientist and astrobiologist at nasa 's ames research centre , appears in the short film to reiterate the agency 's belief that the rumours are just a ` big hoax ' . it is the second video this month nasa has released in an effort to calm fears , after it was accused of tempting fate by releasing a film dubbed why the world did n't end yesterday - ten days early . however , that nasa has seen fit to ask one of its most esteemed and learned scientists to answer the rumours shows the agency is taking seriously the possibility of mass panic . dr morrison says : ` nasa has received thousands of emails and calls from members of the public who are concerned , especially young people , so it seems only right that nasa scientists should help to dispel these rumours . ' chief among the rumours spinning across the internet is that the end of the world has been predicted by the mayan long count calendar , which apparently completes its cycle today . ` that 's simply not true , ' dr morrison says . ` that 's a modern rumour , it has nothing to do with the real maya . ' coming to an end today : the mayan long count calendar . astronomical and planetary experts from the u.s. space agency explained away all the myths surrounding the end of the mayan calender - particularly that a rogue planet was due to hit the earth . another widely held fear is that a . rogue planet known as niburu or planet x is headed for a collision . course with earth , and that the impact will completely wipe out human . civilisation and , probably , everything else . dr morrison calls the rumour ` silly ' pointing out that if such a planet were on headed for an impact with our . own world ` anyone could see it ' . ` it would be one of the brightest things in the sky , ' he adds . less apocalyptic , but still . catastrophic , are the fears that the earth 's rotation is set to change . and the poles will flip , doing massive damage to our habitats and . civilisation . but dr morrison says ` this just ca n't happen ' , adding that there is ` no way ' the earth 's poles could flip . the video from nasa makes the point that if a rogue planet or asteroid was about to hit the earth we would already be able to see it with our bare eyes . ancient mayans believed that a 5,125-year cycle known as the long count would come to a close on december 21 2012 . experts estimate the system , which is made up of 394-year periods called baktuns , started counting at 3114 bc , and will have run through 13 baktuns , or 5,125 years , around december 21 . they say 13 was a significant number for the maya , and the end of that cycle would be a milestone -- but they have been keen to stress that it does not mark an end . conspiracy theorists nonetheless believe the maya may have been privy to impending astronomical disasters that would coincide with 2012 , ranging from explosive storms on the surface of the sun that could knock out power grids to a galactic alignment that could trigger a reversal in earth 's magnetic field . he goes on to discount rumours that a . planetary alignment will occur , since the planets are currently ` all . over the sky ' , and we are set to be gobbled up by a massive black hole , . which , he says , astronomers know is ` impossible ' . to those whose fears have been exacerbated by the belief that the number of natural disasters is increasing across the planet , dr morrison says ` the frequency of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions is not greater now than any time in the past . ' he also dispels a more recent internet rumour that nasa has confirmed that there will be three days of total darkness beginning from tomorrow . ` nasa did n't say that , nobody said it , ' he says . ` it 's just one more crazy idea . ' the video was published on tuesday , . just five days after the agency indicated it was so confident the . apocalypse was going to happen today it released a video entitled why . the world did n't end yesterday . like dr morrison 's video , it outlined . point by point the myths surrounding the end of the mayan calendar with . astronomical and planetary experts answering them . ` if you are watching this video then . that means one thing ... the world did n't end yesterday , ' began the . prematurely released video . the end-of-days prophesy is based on . an interpretation of the ancient mayan calendar which claims the world . will end on december 21 2012 .", "summary": " last week space agency accused of tempting fate after releasing why the world did n't end yesterday film ten days early .   nasa says it has received thousands of calls and emails from concerned citizens asking for information about apocalypse rumours .   senior space agency scientist david morrison says the rumours are just a ` big hoax ' and there 's nothing to be worried about .
