{"text": "powerful evidence that water good enough to drink once flowed on mars has been found by one of nasa 's aging rover vehicles . evidence of water of mars has been indicated by a succession of discoveries on mars but until now they have all suggested flows of sulphuric acid . this is the first time water has been found in a form that is likely to be drinkable . the discovery boosts the chances that one of life 's most important building blocks was once present on the planet , and might even still be there . opportunity found traces of a clay mineral on mars thought to have been formed by a reaction with water . esperance is a metre-square area on a crater rim and the spot marked esperance6 in this false colour image is where the sample was taken . it was hailed by a leading nasa scientist as one of the most important yet made by the mars opportunity rover , which is approaching the tenth anniversary of its launch . the find that has so excited the team behind the opportunity mission is chemical analysis of a small rock which included a clay mineral , montmorillonite , that is likely to have been formed by water with a neutral ph. ` this is powerful evidence the water interacted with this rock and changed its chemistry , ' said professor steve squyres , of nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory and cornell university . ` clay minerals only tend to form at a more neutral ph. this is water you could drink . this is water that was much more favourable for things like pre-biotic chemistry - the kind of chemistry that could lead to the origin of life . montmorillonite exists on earth where it is known to be formed from a reaction with igneous rocks . the rock that was analysed by opportunity by its alpha particle x-ray spectrometer and microscopic imager once the rock abrasion tool had obtained a clean sample inside a square meter test area called esperance within a region known as cape york on the rim of a 14-mile wide crater , endeavour . opportunity has travelled 22.5 miles since landing on mars in january 2004 on what was expected to be a three-month mission . it started its explorations at eagle crater , just 72-feet across , and worked its way up to the 14-mile wide endeavour crater . signals beamed back to earth revealed to waiting scientists that it was a rock like no other yet tested by opportunity . ` we 've been discovering evidence of water on mars since we landed in 2004 , ' said professor squyres . ` the vast majority of them point to water that was at a very low ph -- it was acid . we run around talking ` water on mars , water on mars ' . in fact , what opportunity has mostly found evidence for is sulphuric acid on mars . ` what we have here has a very different chemistry . clay minerals like montmorillonite only tend to form at a more neutral ph. the rock , esperance , that showed signs of drinking water once being on mars , was within an area known as cape york . the rover reached the area in august 2011 and explored it for more than 20 months , leaving in may this year . the while line shows the route . ` this is the most powerful evidence for neutral chemisty water that has been found by opportunity . ' he added : ` to me right now i would say what we have found with esperance has sort of vaulted into my personal top five for the whole nine-and-a-half year mission . this is a good one . ` esperance was so important , we committed several weeks to getting this one measurement of it , even though we knew the clock was ticking . ` what 's so special about esperance is that there was enough water not only for reactions that produced clay minerals , but also enough to flush out ions set loose by those reactions , so that opportunity can clearly see the alteration . ' a digitally enhanced image providing a 3d view of the route opportunity has taken since leaving the esperance rock . it took 20 martian days to get from the rock to the spot shown as ` sol 3327 ' where it was on june 3 . sol 1 was the day opportunity landed on mars . scientists are confident the spectrometer has revealed signs of water with a neutral ph because of the high proportion of aluminium detected by the spectrometer compared to other chemicals including iron , magnesium and calcium . the rover has now been instructed by its controllers to head towards solander point , another part of the rim of endeavour , having spent two years exploring cape york . the opportunity rover is now on its way to solander point , just over a mile away , to investigate more geological features . this false colour image highlights some of the ancient rock formations that it will have to negotiate . opportunity was launched on july 7 , 2003 . and landed on january 25 , 2004 for what was originally expected to be a . three-month mission . opportunity travelled 283 million miles to reach mars after its launch in 2003 . its sister rover , spirit , reached the planet three weeks earlier . nasa lost touch with spirit in march 2010 after it got stuck in soft ground . opportunity was the first to find evidence of water on the planet , within three months of starting operations . it has travelled more than 36km and its motor has made 70 million revolutions , seven time more than were guaranteed by the manufacturer . its performance , however , exceeded all expectations and while the rover is today described as ` arthritic ' , with a ` gimpy shoulder ' and a memory that is showing the first signs of failing , it is still operational and making amazing findings . john callas , the project manager for the mars rover expeditions , said opportunity is in ` remarkably good health ' but added : ` we 've been on borrowed time for a while . ' one of the rover 's flash memories is showing signs of ` amnesia ' he said but while it is proving an ` occasional annoyance ' it is not yet a serious threat to the mission . he emphasised that the rover is operating in a ` very hostile environment ' with extreme temperature fluctuation . ` the rover could have a catastrophic failure at any moment , ' he added . ` every day is a gift .
