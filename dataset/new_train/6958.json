{"text": "the d-day landings have been recreated as a virtual world to allow a new generation to experience the invasion of normady using 3d displays and virtual reality headsets . french researchers painstakingly scanned and recreated the landing craft , gliders and even the artificial harbour , known as the mulberry harbour , for the virtual invasion recreation . the team today revealed their work as part of the seventieth anniversary of d-day and the invasion of normandy . scroll down for video . the mulberry harbor was one of the most extraordinary technological feats of wwii . developed in part by major allan beckett of the royal engineers , it was an artificial harbor built in england , transported across the english channel and assembled off the coast at arromanches to unload the vast quantities of supplies and men that were needed for battle . tim beckett , son of major allan beckett , who designed the mile-long mulberry harbor bridge , stands on a virtual recreation of his father 's work , long lost under the waters of normandy , france . in order to preserve the engineering innovations that were instrumental in the war , a team of experts led by dassault systèmes used catia design software to accurately recreate the harbor , and have projected into onto giant screens and into vr goggles . some of the innovations engineered for the invasion and now recreated are : . landing craft , vehicle & personnel -lrb- lcvp -rrb- was designed by american businessman andrew jackson higgins and carried a platoon-sized ck complement of men and weapons to the beaches of normandy . waco cg-4a gliders were relatively small , lightweight and maneuverable planes . most importantly , they were silent and could land troops in enemy territory during the early hours of the june 6 invasion . the glider could carry up to 13 men or a vehicle . dassault systèmes , the paris firm behind the project , say it is designed to ` safeguard the memory of some of the remarkable engineering achievements of d-day and preserve it for future generations , ' the 3d model is an accurate , scientific reconstruction of the harbor that will allow many to see and experience a site that was destroyed after wwii . the dassault systèmes teams also identified , located and gathered all available data in order to create detailed 3d models of both the waco glider and lcvp landing craft , right down to the last nut and bolt , taking careful account of the specific materials used and how they would have behaved in actual conditions . ` virtually reconstructing the mulberry harbor , the lcvp landing craft and the waco glider brings to life one of the most exciting episodes of 20th-century history for the broadest possible audience , safeguarding this valuable part of our engineering heritage -- a heritage that is gradually being lost , ' said mehdi tayoubi , passion for innovation institute director & experiential strategy vp for dassault systèmes . ` this project builds a bridge between the engineers of yesterday and today by preserving the memory of these remarkable technological innovations . the result is a fitting tribute to the engineers of then and now . ' much of the hardware deployed on d-day was part of a huge effort among the allies to develop the weapons , airplanes , landing crafts and other innovations that could turn the tide of the war . a beach assault required the engineering of wholly new ways to land an invading army , along with the necessary gear and supplies that the operation entailed . the lcvp or higgins boat was a landing craft which allowed the allies to disembark massive numbers of men on the beaches of normandy 70 years ago . the waco glider was accurately recreated in 3d by dassault systèmes , using what remained of the original blueprints and designs . the glider was one of many engineering innovations built specifically to enable the allied victory in wwii . the dassault systèmes ' recreation of the mulberry harbor will be featured in an upcoming two-hour documentary ,  d-day 's sunken secrets ,  produced by the pbs science series , nova . the film follows the team as they carry out the most extensive survey ever done of the seabed bordering the legendary d-day beachheads of normandy , revealing the ingenious technology that helped the allies overcome the german defenses and ultimately liberate europe from the nazis . one of the key parts of the project was the mulberry harbour . the mulberry harbour was one of the most extraordinary technological feats of wwii . developed in part by major allan beckett of the royal engineers , it was an artificial harbor built in england , transported across the english channel and assembled off the coast at arromanches to unload the vast quantities of supplies and men that were needed for battle . world war two , france 7th june 1944 : aerial view of the concrete mulberry harbour in position at normandy during the allied d day invasion . an artificial harbor was assembled off the coast at arromanches -- the first temporary deepwater facility of its kind ever devised and attempted . it was be used to offload no less than 2.5 million men , 500,000 vehicles and 4 million tonnes of supplies . major allan beckett of the royal engineers developed a system of floating metal roadways mounted on pontoon units of concrete or steel , which connected the beaches to the floating pierheads , further out to sea where large vessels could berth . thanks to legs that rested on the seabed but allowed these floating platforms to move up and down with the tide , operations could continue round the clock , which was a world first . the system used to join the floating sections gave them great flexibility , absorbing movements caused by sea swell and the weight of vehicles moving over them . the ` kite ' anchors , which moored the floating platforms to the seabed , were designed to dig in further when the cable is pulled , keeping the structure firmly in place throughout the landing operations . huge reinforced concrete caissons were laid in a semicircle around the artificial harbor to form a breakwater , protecting it from tide surges and storm damage . by the end of july 1944 , the mulberry b at arromanches was the world 's busiest port in terms of traffic volumes . the mulberry harbor was the first temporary deep water facility of its kind ever devised . today , nearly seventy years after d-day , only pieces of the harbor remain . to recreate the harbor , the dassault systèmes team compiled what remained of the original plans from the royal engineers museum in london , the construction and maintenance manuals , the aerial photographs taken at the time and additional information provided by tim beckett , the son of mulberry harbor designer allan beckett , himself a marine engineer . all of this valuable data was brought together and scrutinized over a period of almost eight months by the lab teams , to enable the son of its inventor to virtually stand on it in an immersive 3d experience . the virtual recreation allows people to stand onboard the mulberry bridge -lrb- right -rrb- , and even see the amphibious vehicles driving onto the beach -lrb- left -rrb- . built in catia , the same technology used by leading manufacturers to digitally design cars , airplanes and other advanced products , people can experience these 3d recreations through a number of different technologies , from typical computer screens , to oculus rift virtual reality headsets , to an immersive virtual reality experience as shown here .  nova : d-day 's sunken secrets  premieres wednesday , may 28 , 2014 at 9pm edt on pbs -lrb- check local listings -rrb- .", "summary": " french researchers painstakingly scanned and recreated the landing craft , gliders and landscapes .   team recreated the artificial harbour , known as the mulberry harbour , for the virtual invasion .   can be seen online , shown on giant screens or viewed through vr goggles .
