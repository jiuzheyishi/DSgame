{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- former international monetary fund chief dominique strauss-kahn said his trial , which wrapped up friday , was the first time his side of the aggravated pimping case against him has been fully heard . he 'll learn june 12 whether investigative magistrates accepted his version . a verdict by the lille court will be read on that date . the onetime contender for the french presidency has denied investigators ' accusations that he organized or encouraged sex parties involving prostitutes .  for the first time , throughout these last hearings , i felt i could explain myself and i have the feeling i have been listened to ,  strauss-kahn said . strauss-kahn appeared to get a boost earlier this week when the lille prosecutor told the court that the defendant should be acquitted because of insufficient evidence . lille prosecutor frederic fevre 's statement conformed with what his office said more than a year ago : that the evidence did n't support the charges . but investigative magistrates nevertheless pursued the case to trial , which began two weeks ago . investigators alleged that the sex parties , in locations such as belgium , new york and washington , stemmed from a prostitution ring , organized from the hotel carlton in lille . strauss-kahn , who was married to french tv journalist anne sinclair until their divorce in 2013 , has never denied that he took part in the parties . but the crux of his defense is that he did not know that prostitutes were involved . in testimony last week , he acknowledged that the sexual encounters were organized in such a way that they could fit his agenda , but he denied organizing them or asking anyone else to do so for him .  i do n't consider myself as the organizer of any party whatsoever ,  he said last week . in france , prostitution is legal , but pimping is not . prosecutors allege that two other defendants , businessman david roquet and fabrice paszkowski , a businessman friend of the former imf director , picked up the bills for the sex parties . strauss-kahn saw his stellar career plummet to earth after a separate sex scandal that resulted in his arrest in new york in 2011 . he was later cleared of the new york allegations . before that scandal erupted , he had been on track to run for the french presidency -- an election that his socialist party later won with francois hollande as its candidate . the lille prosecutor 's office in late 2013 asked for strauss-kahn 's case to be dismissed , citing a lack of evidence . however , the investigating magistrates did not follow its recommendations . a judgment in the case could come  within months ,  fevre 's spokeswoman , maud perraudeau , said tuesday . cnn 's laura smith-spark contributed to this report .", "summary": " strauss-kahn :  i have the feeling i have been listened to    prosecutor 's office has long said there was n't enough evidence to pursue the case .   but investigative magistrates pursed case against him and others .
