{"text": "david cameron has been urged to drop his plans to regulate the press because they ` run counter to bedrock principles of a democracy ' . some of america 's leading journalists have written to the prime minister saying he will encourage dictators around the world to suppress their newspapers unless he takes a ` step back ' from creating a new watchdog backed up by statute . their letter warns that britain will lose its ` moral authority ' to criticise authoritarianism elsewhere if it brings in a statutory response to the leveson inquiry into press standards . under fire : an association of some of the top journalists in the us has written to david cameron , pictured , to urge him to rethink press reform plans . the tories signed up to a deal thrashed out at 2.30 am last month which will see a royal charter , underpinned by law , used to establish a new watchdog to police the press regulator . controversially , the deal was drawn up in the office of labour leader ed miliband in the presence of four members of pressure group hacked off . media organisations in the uk have warned that the plans , which will see papers that refuse to sign up threatened with punitive damages in court , are likely to be in breach of european law . mr cameron backs the plans but the committee to protect journalists compares them to draconian rules in place in eastern europe . the letter , signed by the committee 's executive director , joel simon , says : ` those news organisations that opt out of the mechanism face the prospect of  exemplary damages  , a concept that reminds us of hungary 's unpalatable media law in its potential to foster self-censorship and chill investigative journalism . ' it says statutory under-pinning does ` run counter to bedrock principles of a democracy ' . powerful members : arianna huffington , left , founder of news website the huffington post and former cbs anchor dan rather , right , are on the board of the committee to protect journalists . it adds : ` it is the job of journalists to hold governments to account and thus ensure the full participation of citizens . ' a natural antagonism therefore exists between the press and those in power -- but in some instances , governments seek to pass legislation to restrict the media and even criminalize investigative reporting . ` it would be highly regrettable if such leaders could point to the british parliament as precedent for introducing statutory media controls or regulations . ' the committee , based in new york , is an independent , non-profit organisation that promotes press freedom worldwide . its directors include senior figures from : the three main us television news networks abc , nbc and cbs ; the new york times , the washington post and the chicago tribune ; the new yorker and the nation magazines . dan rather , one of america 's best known former news anchors and arianna huffington , founder of the huffington post , the american news website , sit on its board . their letter warns that the ` hasty ' way the deal was thrashed out sends the ` wrong message ' to the rest of the world where dictators want to ` rein in irksome reporters ' . it says : ` prime minister , we urge you to take a step back from the current proposals , which do not take into account the implications for press freedom beyond fleet street . deal : plans to reform regulation of the press were thrashed out after lord leveson published his report into newspaper practice . ` online journalists and bloggers and those outside the london-based , national newspaper establishment need to have their voices heard too . ` the haste with which this deal has been put together leaves too many unanswered questions . ` journalists , especially those working under authoritarian regimes , are watching and hoping that their colleagues in britain can find a better solution than regulation anchored in law . ` mr cameron , we think that in the interests of global press freedom , you should allow them the opportunity to do so . ` many responsible journalists in britain acknowledge the sins of fleet street , but most argue that these can be addressed through existing legislation . ` use the criminal law to prosecute criminal behavior ; make the civil law more accessible to the victims of unscrupulous newspapers ; and do not try to impose standards of fairness and accuracy in newsrooms through statute . ' last month the daily mail highlighted how the world 's media has reacted with astonishment to the plans to shackle newspapers with state regulation . even the russians and iranians scorned the plans . newspapers in moscow accused the uk of censorship while a state-owned iranian tv channel announced : ` the measure puts in danger freedom of expression and democracy .
