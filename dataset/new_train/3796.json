{"text": "a disabled pensioner claims she has been banned from using the sainsbury 's home delivery service after describing one of their drivers as a ` coloured gentleman ' . marian burke , 73 , says she used the term entirely innocently to refer to a ` lovely ' deliveryman who works for the supermarket . but she says a manager at sainsbury 's immediately branded her a racist for saying the word and said her custom was no longer welcome . osteoporosis sufferer marian burke , 73 , claims she has been banned from using the sainsbury 's home delivery service after describing one of their drivers as a ` coloured gentleman ' last night the supermarket insisted the ban was justified and accused mrs burke of using a ` racial slur ' on three separate occasions while being aggressive towards staff . but wheelchair-bound mrs burke , who has a kenyan carer , strenuously denied the charge and said sainsbury 's should be ashamed of its actions . mrs burke , who suffers from osteoporosis and can not leave the house , says she is completely dependent on the delivery service for her # 80 weekly shop . being unfamiliar with computers means online delivery is not an option , so for the last ten years she has phoned the supermarket with her shopping list of food and household goods . after a string of mistakes in recent weeks with deliveries arriving without several essentials , she called the shop to inform them of their error . she recalled : ` when the manager asked me what the name of the delivery driver was , i had to tell him that i did n't know . i said to him ,  i do n't know his name , but he was a lovely coloured gentleman  . ' she continued : ` then all hell broke loose . the man on the other end of the phone called me a racist , and said they would never again take an order from me . ' last night a sainsbury 's spokesman claimed the company 's ban came after mrs burke had been ` aggressive ' and used ` racial slurs ' . he said : ` mrs burke 's version of events does not reflect our experience of her . she was not solely banned for the use of the word ` coloured ' but for a range of racial slurs on three separate occasions , used in an aggressive manner against our colleagues . mrs burke says she is completely dependent on the delivery service from the finchley road branch -lrb- above -rrb- for her # 80 weekly shop . ` as you would expect we do n't take action . like this lightly but have a duty of care to protect our colleagues . from racial and abusive language and any form of aggression . ' but mrs burke denied the firm 's version of events , saying : ` that 's absolute lies . how dare they call me a racist ? they should be ashamed . ' last night one of mrs burke 's two carers said : ` i heard the phone call . she was not rude and she was not racist at all . ' the sainsbury 's telephone ordering service -- which is not offered by her other local supermarkets -- had previously been a lifeline for mrs burke , who is separated and does not have children . she says she wept after the staff member 's outburst earlier this month and is now relying on a friend who lives nearby for her shopping needs . she said : ` there 's not a racist bone in my body . what 's wrong with referring to someone as coloured ? it 's political correctness gone mad . ' the retired secretary , who lives in highgate , north london , was dependent on her weekly delivery from the nearby finchley road branch which processed her order from a call centre -- although not always correctly . ` they were always forgetting things , and it 's so hard for me to get out , ' said mrs burke . ` also , the delivery costs me nearly # 10 , so i felt that i was n't getting the service i deserved . ' she went on : ` as a loyal customer , i had had enough , so i rang my local store , not to shout at them or anything , but because i wanted to tell them that i 'm very frail and if they could try to remember everything i order , i 'd be very grateful . ` sainsbury 's was my lifeline , and now it 's been taken away from me . ' using the term ` coloured ' to refer to black people is considered to be offensive because it dismisses everyone who is not white as the same . the term was in widespread use in britain in the 1960s but is now viewed by many to be racist .", "summary": " marian burke , 73 , from highgate , north london , says she used the term entirely innocently to refer to a ` lovely ' deliveryman .   however sainsbury 's says she has used racist language on three separate occasions and has been banned from using other words .   mrs burke , who has osteoporosis .   and can not leave the house , says she is dependent on the .   delivery for her # 80 weekly shop .   wheelchair-bound pensioner , who has a .   kenyan carer , said sainsbury 's should .   be ashamed of its actions .
