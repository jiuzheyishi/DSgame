{"text": "homosexuality is passed down through the generations from mother to son and from father to daughter , a new study claims . from an evolutionary standpoint , homosexuality is a trait that would not be expected to develop and persist in the face of darwinian natural selection . it is nevertheless common for men and women in most cultures and previous studies have shown that homosexuality runs in families , leading most researchers to presume a genetic underpinning of sexual preference . puzzle : scientists had long puzzled over why homosexuality appears to run in families when as a genetic trait it would not be expected to develop and persist in the face of darwinian natural selection . however , no major gene for homosexuality has been found despite numerous studies searching for a genetic connection . now in a study published yesterday in the quarterly review of biology , researchers from the u.s. national institute of mathematical and biological synthesis suggest homosexuality has an epigenetic link , not a genetic one . epigenetics explains how gene expression is regulated by temporary switches , called epi-marks . these constitute an extra layer of information attached to our genes ' backbones that determine their effect on our development . while genes hold the instructions , epi-marks direct how those instructions are carried out -- when , where and how much a gene is expressed during development . gay marriage : a study suggests homosexuality has an epigenetic link , not a genetic one , allowing it to confound the usual rules of evolution . epi-marks are usually produced anew each generation , but recent evidence demonstrates that they sometimes carryover between generations and thus can contribute to similarity among relatives , resembling the effect of shared genes . william rice , an an evolutionary biologist at the university of california santa barbara and lead author of the study , says epi-marks can determine the development of homosexuality in the offspring of heterosexual parents . ` there is compelling evidence that epi-marks contribute to both the similarity and dissimilarity of family members , and can therefore feasibly contribute to the observed familial inheritance of homosexuality and its low concordance between -lsb- identical -rsb- twins , ' he told u.s. news . dr rice and his team integrated evolutionary theory with recent advances in the molecular regulation of gene expression and androgen-dependent sexual development to produce a biological and mathematical model that delineates the role of epigenetics in homosexuality . sex-specific epi-marks produced in early foetal development protect each sex from the substantial natural variation in testosterone that occurs during later foetal development , the researchers say . sex-specific epi-marks stop girl foetuses from being masculinised when they experience atypically high testosterone , and vice versa for boy foetuses . different epi-marks protect different sex-specific traits from being masculinised or feminised -- some affect the genitals , others sexual identity , and yet others affect sexual partner preference . however , when these epi-marks are transmitted across generations from fathers to daughters or mothers to sons , they may cause reversed effects , such as the feminisation of some traits in sons , such as sexual preference , and similarly a partial masculinisation of daughters . the study solves the evolutionary riddle of homosexuality , finding that ` sexually antagonistic ' epi-marks , which normally protect parents from natural variation in sex hormone levels during foetal development , sometimes carry over across generations and cause homosexuality in opposite-sex offspring . the mathematical modeling demonstrates that genes coding for these epi-marks can easily spread in the population because they always increase the fitness of the parent but only rarely escape erasure and reduce fitness in offspring . ` transmission of sexually antagonistic epi-marks between generations is the most plausible evolutionary mechanism of the phenomenon of human homosexuality , ' said study co-author sergey gavrilets , a professor at the university of tennessee-knoxville .", "summary": " new study answers puzzle of why homosexuality seems to run in families .   it would not be expected to persist given darwinian natural selection .   researchers show it is an epigenetic rather than a genetic trait .
