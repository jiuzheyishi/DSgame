{"text": "whatever the upshot from that new york lawyer 's bizarre appeal against his own report into allegations of world cup bidding corruption -- and do n't hold your breath on that one -- england 's claim to the moral high ground has been blown from under their feet . whether or not fifa 's ethics committee have finessed -- twisted even -- michael garcia 's findings with regard to qatar 2022 , the football association are in the dock for the way they went about campaigning to host the 2018 finals instead of russia . of all people , the custodians of our national game crawled into bed with the disgraced jack warner who fifa , none other , have kicked out of their vice-presidency and who has been cited for fraud by the governing body of football in the americas , of which he used to be president . warner told prince william and david cameron and david beckham he would vote for england - then reneged . england bid team could be punished over 2018 world cup efforts ... but qatar are cleared to host 2022 event ! fifa investigator garcia to appeal against his own body 's interpretation of his report . russia 2018 bid 's computers and emails ` destroyed ' , say fifa . who is michael garcia ? sportsmail 's lowdown on fifa investigator . they granted lavish favours and squandered millions on this treacherous figure who did not even vote for england when it came to casting his ballot . in so doing the fa dragged their own president , prince william , two of this country 's prime ministers , gordon brown and david cameron , our ultimate olympian lord coe and even poor old unsuspecting david beckham , among many , into the mire with them . it used to seem that the fa were merely na√Øve and incompetent when it came to international football affairs . now , with this shabby business following their reneging on the gentleman 's agreement not to bid against germany for the 2006 world cup , they appear at best stupid , at worst as dodgy as those they have presumed to impugn . while it may seem disproportionate for england 's dubious dealings to catch most of the back-draft from an investigation into something as serious as how over-heated qatar came to be awarded a world cup , there can be no escaping the fa 's sorry reality now . the fa are set to come under fire for trying to woo former fifa vice president warner -lrb- second left -rrb- . after the humiliation of receiving only two votes for 2018 this , the mother country of the global game , is now a broken off-shoot from the world football community , bereft of even the slightest influence . after all the english ranting at fifa , long is it likely to remain so . as for the tin pot mps who have done nothing about bent bankers , failed to indict tony blair for going to war under false pretences or call their own house to order for fraudulent misconduct - but have been falling over themselves to jump on the populist anti-fifa bandwagon - they are left clinging to an american lawyer 's coat-tails . good luck with that , since garcia will be perceived in many quarters abroad as trying to distance himself from the backlash on social media following qatar 's absolution from wrong-doing , in case it damages his ambition of high office in washington . and as for the backlash itself -- whipped up as it is here by jingoistic resentment of england not being given the 2018 world cup -- the most popular remedies being suggested are impractical . resign from fifa , they cry . boycott the world cup . former fifa vice-president warner has been kicked out of the organisation . quite simply , the fa can not afford to do that . already grappling with the financial implications of the new wembley and the centre of coaching excellence , they need not only big england international matches to avoid the risk of going broke but -- like it or not -- their share in the financial windfall from world cups . and even if they did pull out , they would find themselves isolated . there is a notion that the us , if no-one else , would walk with us . that founders on their understanding that fifa will take the world cup back to north america soon , perhaps in 2026 , the successor to qatar . there are few echoes abroad of the uproar in this country . fifa president sepp blatter is a racing certainty for re-election in may because the overwhelming majority of national federations appreciate the billions he generates for the sustenance and development of football around the planet . as for garcia 's protest , the fifa appeals committee is manned mostly by representatives of the countries in most urgent need of that income . our hitherto invisible mp have started demanding examination of the world cup bidding process by governments and their police forces . they seem unaware that the most relevant national state , given that fifa is based in zurich , recently completed an exhaustive criminal investigation . their principal target was blatter , whom they ultimately cleared of all suspicion . nor did they find anything to indict in fifa 's governance of football . the sir alf ramsey statue in ipswich . not only that but the ghastly warner is only one of half-a-dozen or so officials who have been rooted out by fifa with far greater alacrity than our government have ousted the crooks in the city and in parliament . wherever the qatar fandango leads it wo n't be england sign-posting the direction -- or hosting a world cup in most of our lifetimes . cheers to sir alf ramsey - help save this local pub . the locals are revolting . patrons of the sir alf ramsey in tunbridge wells are fighting to prevent the demolition of the only pub named after england 's world cup-winning manager . they are asking football lovers around the country to help them lobby politicians in kent and the editor of the local courier newspaper , as well as taking to social media . pressure is mounting against planning application by the owner for the building to be sold , knocked down and replaced by four homes . there are two notable monuments to sir alf , a statue in ipswich which became his home town during his successful time there as manager and a bust of his head in the players ' tunnel at the new wembley stadium . both are impressive . but the pub stands alone in preserving a priceless world cup memory , that of how he used to buy his players ` just one beer ' at the england team hotel on the evenings before their big matches . george cohen -lrb- left -rrb- and then england manager fabio capello unveil the bust of ramsey in 2009 . to join the campaign search ` save our pub ' on facebook or e-mail paul.marsden@khl.com .", "summary": " england 's claim to moral high ground over fifa is no more .   fa are in the dock for way they went about trying to host 2018 world cup .   fa appear stupid at best , dodgy at worst after trying to court jack warner .   locals are trying to save the sir alf ramsey pub in tunbridge wells .
