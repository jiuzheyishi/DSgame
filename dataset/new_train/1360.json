{"text": "a leech has been found to be able to survive after being submerged in liquid nitrogen . ozobranchus jantseanus , a parasite found inside freshwater turtles , can be successfully reanimated after exposure to an astonishing -196 °c for 24 hours . it can also survive in temperatures of -90 °c for nearly three years . the ozobranchus jantseanus , a leech that can survive a day in -196 c . the discovery was made by a team of japanese scientists who found a still-living leech attached to a frozen turtle . most organisms expire after freezing because of the damage caused by the water in their cells when it freezes . the team are now trying to unlock why the ozobranchus jantseanus is able to survive something that is so devastating to other creatures . it could help unlock humanity 's grasp of cryopreservation , where cells , whole tissues , or any other substances susceptible to damage caused by chemical reactivity or time are preserved by cooling to sub-zero temperatures . suspended animation is the slowing of life processes by external means without killing the organism . breathing , heartbeat , and other involuntary functions may still occur , but they can only be detected using electronic equipment . extreme cold can be used to slow an individual 's functions , a process known as cryonics . cryopreservation freezes organisms using liquid nitrogen that will preserve it until reanimation . two-celled embryos have been kept in suspended animation for as long as 13 years . extreme temperature : a flower frozen in liquid nitrogen and smashed . ` ozobranchid leeches have a mysterious mechanism to prevent freezing . i want to get to the heart of the matter , ' researcher takahiro kikawada said , reported the asahi shimbun . the research , published in published in peer-reviewed science journal plos one , states : ` this finding is particularly interesting because the leech can survive these temperatures without any acclimation period or pretreatment . ` it is unlikely that o. jantseanus would encounter similar freeze-thaw cycles in its natural environment of so it is suggested that the cold tolerance observed in this species has not arisen in response to some ecological need or that it is an environmental adaptation . ` rather , it is likely that this cryotolerant ability has arisen in response to some as yet unclarified adaptation . ' liquid nitrogen is nitrogen in a liquid state at an extremely low temperature . at atmospheric pressure , liquid nitrogen boils at − 196 °c and is a cryogenic fluid that can cause rapid freezing on contact with living tissue . when appropriately insulated from ambient heat , liquid nitrogen can be stored and transported , for example in vacuum flasks . nitrogen was first liquefied at the jagiellonian university on 15 april 1883 by polish physicists , zygmunt wroblewski and karol olszewski .", "summary": " the parasitic leech has been found to survive immersion in liquid nitrogen .   it was discovered by japanese scientists inside a frozen turtle .   the discovery may unlock science 's understanding of cryogenics .
