{"text": "if you have ambitions of being one of the first people on mars , listen up : a dutch company says it is moving along with its plan to send four lucky earthlings to colonize the red planet . the catch : they wo n't ever come back . the mars one foundation announced tuesday that it has secured lead suppliers for an unmanned mission launching in 2018 , which involves a robotic lander and a communications satellite . lockheed martin has been contracted to study building the lander , and surrey satellite technology ltd. will develop a concept study for the satellite , mars one said . this first mission will demonstrate technology that would be involved in a permanent human settlement on mars . if all goes well -- and that 's still very much an  if  -- the first pioneers could land on mars in 2025 . enthusiasm has been growing since the project 's first big announcement in april . more than 200,000 people have signed up to be prospective astronauts , mars one ceo bas lansdorp said in washington on tuesday . apparently , they 're ok with living out the rest of their lives on mars . the technology for a return flight does n't exist -- there 's no kennedy space center launch pad over there ! -- and having a one-way trip greatly reduces costs , the company has said . the application period is now closed , and by the end of this year , the company plans to notify those special folk who made it to round 2 . the unmanned mission is the  most important and most difficult step of actually getting humans to mars ,  lansdorp said . it would also be the first privately funded planetary exploration mission .  the opportunity to participate in that is just really exciting ,  said ed sedivy , a chief engineer at lockheed martin space systems . lansdorp expects that the majority of funding for the unmanned missions will come from sponsors and partners , not public contributions . the cost of the lander and satellite will be something that the contracted companies will study , although mars one has a ballpark figure in mind , lansdorp said . mars curiosity rover finds life-supporting chemicals . what they want to send in 2018 . the lander will be based on the successful nasa phoenix mission , lansdorp said . the mars one probe will feature a robotic arm carrying a camera that will shoot continuous video , as well as a water experiment that will demonstrate the production of liquid water on the surface of mars .  the highest priority is to actually have liquid water on mars ,  he said . this unmanned mission will also carry the winning projects from an experiment contest . there will be a worldwide university challenge giving teams the chance to propose tests to carry out on mars . these could be science experiments , of course , but mars one is also interested in  fun  experiments . one of lansdorp 's visions , for instance , is a balloon with a camera attached to it that would film mars from an altitude of 200 to 500 meters , which has never been done . the communications satellite will provide live video feed from surface of mars to earth , representing the first mars synchronous communications satellite , lansdorp said . tourist trips to the moon by 2043 ? getting to mars . mars one was originally slated to land the first humans in 2023 , but the project has been delayed . after the first humans arrive in 2025 , the plan is send additional crews every two years , lansdorp said . right now , the idea is to send crews of four , but eventually bigger vehicles may become available to transport more people . is there enough time to get the lander and satellite on their way by 2018 ? sedivy said it takes about 3 1/2 years from commitment to initiating a preliminary design to launch , so that gives his company about a year of leeway to study this concept before promising to execute it . that timeline is  pretty favorable ,  he said tuesday . but as to whether it 's enough time to develop the science side of things , that 's  a little tricky ,  he said . it takes money . mars one is looking at  a range of funding scenarios .  the total estimated budget for getting the first four humans to mars is $ 6 billion . lansdorp would not disclose how much money has been secured from partners and sponsors but said donations currently total more than $ 200,000 . a reality tv concept may help recoup costs . lansdorp noted that mars one will have the most unique video  available in the solar system ,  which has a lot of value , and he hopes this will attract sponsors and partners . media coverage will be a main funding source . but will the money come through ? will the technology really be developed by 2018 for the unmanned mission and to send people there by 2025 ? will four humans survive the journey in a tight space capsule and embrace a desolate planet as their home ? as lansdorp himself said tuesday ,  you ca n't go to mars on excitement .  time will tell whether prospective applicants can go at all . follow elizabeth landau at @lizlandau .", "summary": " more than 200,000 people say they want to go to mars .   the first mission will be unmanned , planned for 2018 launch .   lockheed martin , surrey satellite technology ltd. are studying concepts .
