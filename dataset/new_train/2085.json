{"text": "retail stores across colorado sold nonmedical marijuana to adults for the first time wednesday . as someone who has worked on reforming marijuana laws for nearly three years , i decided to take part as a customer and get in line . advocates , industry members and media stayed away from partying new year 's eve to get up early to commemorate the historic day . we began at 3d cannabis dispensary at 7 a.m. with a press conference . we joined city and state representatives at medicine man dispensary later in the morning . the atmosphere was reminiscent of a concert or sporting event . people who braved the cold stood in line and made small talk . a lot of people , particularly those over 50 , said  it 's about time ,  and told stories about arrests spanning decades for using marijuana . it was like a wedding or election night , with lots of picture-taking , hugs and congratulatory wishes -- except it was 7 a.m. and coffee and cocoa took the place of beer and wine . i waited alongside three fairly young men who drove nine hours from nebraska to take part . behind them was a couple from chicago who insisted their decision to go to denver was not solely based on buying state-regulated marijuana -- but it played a significant role . many others were local marijuana users looking forward to experiencing what only medical marijuana patients had been accustomed to in colorado . once in earshot of the  budtenders ,  the conversation was fairly surreal . i asked for a strain perfect for after work , something to make me relax and help me sleep -- a marijuana merlot . i was told two indica strains are solid sellers for this purpose : tahoe triangle and ogre . tahoe triangle had a light pine smell ; ogre was more musty and pungent like you might imagine a hairy monster would be . i went with the ogre with thoughts of shrek in my mind . the stores are fully backed by the state and local governments , and have been given a cautious green light by the federal government to proceed as planned . colorado voters approved amendment 64 , which legalized pot for recreational use , because they believe marijuana prohibition is more harmful than good and wastes resources . colorado 's previous efforts to decriminalize the plant -- remove criminal penalties for possession of small amounts of marijuana while it still remained technically illegal -- have already proven cost effective , practical and safe . according to the colorado center on law and policy , the amendment 's decriminalization alone would save the state $ 12 million in 2012 . in the last decade , the state has averaged more than 10,000 arrests and citations per year for minor marijuana possession . the number of arrests has dropped over the last year to below 4,500 , but this number represents high increases in arrests for public consumption . public consumption is a primary issue ahead of us . using marijuana in public is still illegal in colorado , and the denver city council has been engaging in a long back and forth to define  open and public use .  the current definition is n't specific enough for the post - amendment 64 era . the proposed law in denver would allow for open and public use as long as it 's on private property with permission of the owner or lessee . smoking is not allowed on city sidewalks , parks or the downtown mall . law enforcement rarely arrested anyone for public use before amendment 64 , when possession charges were the primary prohibition . we expect this number to stabilize and decline as law enforcement , decision-makers and users establish a culture of responsible use . fortunately , use and consumption laws will soon be a civil issue in denver , not a criminal one . on the way back to the car after making my first fully legal and regulated marijuana purchase , i saw the guys from nebraska again . i handed them educational brochures created by local reform advocates that provide various resources , address the effects and caution for consuming potent edibles , and generally explain the law . the young men thanked me , jumped in their jeep with nebraska license plates and denver bronco covers and took off . the state is addressing potential harms of using marijuana with public education , safety and health outreach efforts . it felt good to put this new reality in action with cautionary discussions with the nebraskans and others throughout the day . colorado is leading the nation in a new way to control marijuana , focusing scarce law enforcement resources away from arresting responsible users . it is satisfying to be part of that process , and it feels incredible to be in a position to promote safety and positive experiences for adults who are now law-abiding . they are pioneering an end to prohibition just by being regular people , standing in line , and behaving with friendly cheer and good spirits on the first day of 2014 . the sky did n't fall in the mile high city . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of art way .", "summary": " art way bought marijuana at a store in colorado on first day of legal pot for adults .   way : in line , the mood was celebratory , with people saying  it 's about time    way : arrests for possession have plummeted , but you can get arrested for public use .   he says colorado is leading the nation in a new way to control marijuana and save money .
