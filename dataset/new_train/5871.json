' i . could have died of embarrassment . i could n't bring myself to tell her . that i was n't pregnant , so i just said that i was getting off at the . next stop . ' i went straight home in tears - and the first thing i did was log onto my computer and start looking up diets . younger sister victoria pictured before and after her impressive weight loss . nicola said she noticed she was struggling to fit in size 18 clothes , ` but it was n't until the day someone assumed i was pregnant that i actually did anything about my weight ' ' i remembered seeing frankie essex had lost weight on the cambridge weight plan , so i signed up the same day . ' within a few weeks , retail manager nicola had lost more than a stone - and was the envy of her younger sister . and after realising that nicola was melting away before her eyes , victoria also pledged to sign up to cambridge - and like her sister , started shedding the pounds . since joining the plan in july , 5ft 8in nicola has lost a staggering four and a half stone - shrinking from a whopping 15st 12lb and struggling to squeeze into a size 18 dress to a slender 11st 6lb - and a size 10 to 12 . and sister victoria , who is 6ft tall , now weighs just 12st 2lb - after originally tipping the scales at just under 17st . the sisters say : ` our mum is so proud of us - she ca n't believe how much weight we have lost ' victoria , a teaching assistant , said : ` we 've both managed to keep on track thanks to a bit of sisterly competition . ` when we were bigger , we used to convince each other that we were never supposed to be skinny girls - that we did n't have the skinny gene . ` but now , we 've started to convince each other that there 's no reason we ca n't fit into a size 10 - and we 've helped each other get there . ` we were inconstant competition to keep up with each other 's weight loss , and that kept us going . ' nicola added : ` one night when our weight loss had had slowed a bit , i remember standing at the fridge , rummaging for chocolate . ` then my phone beeped with a message , and it was victoria saying she 'd lost four pounds that week - i slammed the fridge shut straight away . ` we 've both joined a gym and we try to go to work out together - it 's so much easier when there 's someone else egging you on . ` if you 'd told us both we 'd have been going to a gym a year ago we 'd have both said you were mad - but it 's true ! ` our mum is so proud of us - she ca n't believe how much weight we have lost . ` we keep getting compliments wherever we go and it 's a great feeling . ` over christmas , we actually lost weight , rather than put it on - it was amazing . ` i 'm sure we 'll help each other motivated enough to keep it off too .
