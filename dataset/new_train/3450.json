{"text": "adverts for a ryanair charity calendar featuring stewardesses posing in bikinis have reportedly been banned by a spanish judge for being sexist . amanda cohen ruled that the low-cost airline 's adverts for its annual girls of ryanair campaign depicted the stewardesses in ' a sexually suggestive manner ' following a formal complaint from a consumer group , according to spanish reports . the calendar , which has been released every year since 2008 , shows female cabin crew stripped down to their beachwear . ` sexist ' : a spanish judge has reportedly banned this year 's ryanair charity , right , because of its images of scantily clad air stewardesses , left . the company has raised more than # 587,000 for charity through sales with next year 's proceeds to go to the teenage cancer trust . but spanish consumer group adecua claimed the calendar constitutes advertising with ` sexual connotations ' and called for it to be banned . judge cohen , sitting at the commercial court in malaga , ruled the cabin crew are shown in ' a sexually suggestive manner ' and that ` the female body is being used as a mere object and as part of the appeal of the advert . ' in a written ruling she added there was ` an absolute disconnection between the image used and the product being promoted . ' beauties : the stars of the 2014 calendar pose in their uniforms at the launch event earlier this year . she described the advert as ` illegal , discriminatory and unfair . ' although she praised the airline for its ` laudable charity work ' the judge said it was ` obvious ' the calendar was being used as a marketing tool to sell airline tickets . ryanair is to appeal the ruling and has formally complained about the judge , alleging that it was unable to defend itself properly at an earlier hearing . the airline sells the calendar , shot in crete , for # 10 or 10 euros on flights and online and a video showing the photo shoot has been watched almost 700,000 times on youtube . spanish consumer groups have been calling for the calendar to be banned for the past five years . despite the reports in spain that the calendar itself has been banned , the company , which sells 10,000 copies of the calendar a year , said that the ruling does not affect the 2014 calendar or the firm 's future charity work . a spokesman said that the ruling only relates to advertisements for the calendar that were released in november and december last year . ryanair hopes to sell the remaining few hundred calendars in the coming weeks . calendar stars : the stewardesses pictured in their beachwear and heels . ryanair 's robin kiely said : ` we have instructed our lawyers to appeal this ruling regarding last year 's cabin crew charity calendar , which raised more than # 84,000 for a polish charity , the tvn foundation , to help sick children in poland . ` this case and ruling only relates to specific adverts run in november and december 2012 and has no effect on ryanair 's continuing charity work or our current 2014 cabin crew charity calendar .
