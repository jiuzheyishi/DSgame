{"text": "steven gerrard gave an assured display at the heart of england 's midfield . check out his heat map and all the match stats here . in the 82nd minute , a large , white paper aeroplane floated down the considerable distance from wembley 's third tier and struck hansell riojas , a peru substitute playing at full-back , on his right shoulder . it drew the most heartfelt cheer of the night . quite right , too . skill like that you do n't see every day . the rest of it , we 've sort of seen before . the most famous peruvian visitor to these shores took to hanging about antiques shops in portobello road and kept marmalade sandwiches under his hat , so it is fair to say not a huge amount was expected of england 's opponents and they did not disappoint . peru turned in enough skilful , enterprising play on the counter early on to pose a gentle threat , followed by some woeful defending of set-pieces that afforded england two second-half goals from corners , and a scoreline with emphasis . video scroll down to watch hodgson talk about prince william 's visit to the dressing room . class act : daniel sturridge curls home the opener after 32 minutes to put england on the road to victory . spot the ball : time stands still after sturridge unleashed a magnificent effort just after the half hour mark . no chance : peru keeper raul fernandez clutches at thin air as welbeck 's shot flies into the net . get in : skipper steven gerrard was one of the first to congratulate sturridge after his screamer . the eyes have : sturridge hit his fourth international goal ahead of england 's flight to miami . england : hart , johnson , cahill , jagielka -lrb- smalling 73 -rrb- , baines -lrb- stones 75 -rrb- , gerrard -lrb- wilshere 64 -rrb- , henderson , lallana -lrb- milner 73 -rrb- , rooney -lrb- sterling 66 -rrb- , welbeck , sturridge -lrb- barkley 82 -rrb- . subs not used : foster , lampard , lambert , flanagan , forster . goals : sturridge 32 , cahill 65 , jagielka 70 . booked : gerrard . peru : fernandez , rodriguez , callens , ramos -lrb- riojas 68 -rrb- , advincula -lrb- velarde 78 -rrb- , yotun , cruzado , ballon , ramirez -lrb- hurtado 60 -rrb- , deza -lrb- ruidaz 66 -rrb- , carrillo -lrb- flores 86 -rrb- . subs not used : forsyth , gambetta , trauco , gallese . booked : cruzaldo . referee : viktor kassai -lrb- hungary -rrb- . it . will not be this easy in brazil . the italian back four have seen the . odd inswinging corner and , first of all , you have to get up their end of . the field to win it . on this evidence , what progress england do make . in that direction will be painstaking , to say the least . the energy levels grew as more players with a point to prove -- . those not in the starting line-up -- were introduced , but if this was a . dry-run for england 's tempo in the heat of manaus , ` slow and steady wins . the race ' seems to be the motto . england 's first group game with italy . is the shortest price for a 0-0 draw of any fixture in the tournament , . and with good reason . still , . a party with a happy atmosphere was the demand and england will depart . for brazil via miami this weekend , smiling . there was music , a bit of . mexican wave-style dancing and some games with planes kept the guests . amused when the sporting fare failed to satisfy . towering : gary cahill doubled england 's lead , connecting with leighton baines ' corner to power a header home . three lions on a shirt : cahill beams after doubling england 's lead . no mistake : phil jagielka fired home through a crowd of bodies to put england on easy stret . queuing up to score : jagielka reacted first in a crowded box to put the gloss on victory . double act : cahill and jagielka kept a clean sheet and both got on the scoresheet . whether this england team will fly quite as gracefully once the serious stuff begins is another matter entirely . still , . a win is a win , and there is nothing wrong with leighton baines showing . his worth from corners as he did on two occasions once captain steven gerrard had surrendered his duties on leaving the field -- or daniel . sturridge finding his range from outside the area , as he did in the . first half . sturridge 's goal , coming after 32 minutes and much needed . after a turgid opening , was the true highlight of the night . the chance of finding a back four in brazil quite as prone to bouts of narcolepsy , however , is unlikely . glen . johnson took a quick throw-in on the right , and would have been . delighted to find the two nearest defenders in repose and in no position . to stop sturridge receiving the ball and turning towards goal . he was . forced out to just beyond the penalty area by the one peruvian paying . attention but it was not diversion enough . sturridge sighted the target . and hit a lovely left-foot shot that curled away from goalkeeper raul . fernandez , who is not the most imposing presence , it must be said . lift-off : gerrard and his team-mate applaud the home fans after a satisfying result at wembley . a big hand : joe hart was called into action several times but kept peru at bay . the . goal gave england the breathing space required and peru 's defence did . the rest . it might have been different if a 35-yard shot from jean deza , . who has spent the past year on loan at montpellier , had dipped an extra . six inches nine minutes into the second half but it did n't and peru 's . threat then passed . their . best spell had come in the first half when joe hart saved another . deflected shot from deza and then kept out luis ramirez with his feet , . but peru were nifty without being greatly intimidating . they were chosen . for this purpose , one supposes , and served it well . it . may be that manager roy hodgson instructed his squad to imagine this . was a stifling night in tropical manaus and to play at a tempo conducive . to saving energy in heat and humidity . we can only hope so . if . not , england need to find several gears if they are to make any . impression on the group in brazil , let alone the tournament . no matter . the conditions , a certain rhythmic level is required and england lacked . it for long periods . it is . not a good sign when the biggest cheer is provoked by paper missiles , . or when the first successful throw on to the playing area instantly . inspires hundreds of distracted imitators . on the front foot : ross barkley plays the ball as the england playmaker stretches the south americans . special moment : john stones made his england debut , replacing team-mate baines in the 75th minute . terrifying pace : raheem sterling came on in the second-half and produced some trademark bursts of speed . pain game : luis ramirez winces after coming off worse in a challenge with wayne rooney on friday night . caught out : danny welbeck slips while trying to evade the attentions of christian ramos . sadly , . all that was proven for much of the night is that england 's flyers are . as inconsistent as their footballers : the very occasional score . enlivening a rather ordinary succession of failures . having . said this , a good set-piece will always win matches , even in the most . rarefied atmosphere , and england are taking a weapon of sorts to south . america in the shape of baines . it . was the everton man who picked out gary cahill in the 65th minute for a . thumping header that gave england a two-goal cushion and dispelled any . hope of a peruvian revival . the marking was ordinary and it always helps . when the man guarding the far post would need a pogo stick to reach any . header steered towards the top corner , but peru 's shortcomings are not . england 's responsibility . there . was a degree of fortune with the third , however , the entirely . unconvincing fernandez dropping what should have been a simple gather , . the ball clipping cahill 's head on the way down and falling to phil . jagielka who prodded it smartly through the hapless goalkeeper 's . legs . job done : hodgson replaced skipper steven gerrard with jack wilshere . looking up : wayne rooney skips past josepmir ballon as england launch an attack . watching brief : the england bench observe proceedings at wembley . plenty to ponder : hodgson named a strong team , including rooney , for the final game on home soil before the world cup . by royal approval : prince william is flanked by fa chairman greg dyke and arsenal chief executive ivan gazidis . fernandez then . collapsed to the floor as if injured -- his pride more than his body , one . suspects . the usual regiment of substitutes invaded towards the end , . but we are well and truly in phoney war territory now . hodgson . says that he has not made his mind up on the team , but performances in . training are as likely to influence a final decision as any match -- . unless a player turns in a performance of extremes , either positive or . negative . there was nothing at either end here . england did what was expected , but need to step it up this summer . they . walked from the field accompanied by a blast of papa loves mambo , no . doubt intended to make those gathered think optimistically of summer in . rio de janeiro . mambo is cuban music . let 's hope the team are better . prepared than the fellow in charge of the soundtrack .", "summary": "
