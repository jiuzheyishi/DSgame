{"text": "a little over ten years ago the coral reefs of pemuteran bay in bali , indonesia , were in a state of terminal decay . fishing with dynamite and cyanide , untreated sewage and rising water temperatures had all pushed the reefs , and life they supported , close to the limit .  tourist numbers fell due to destruction of dive and snorkeling sites -lrb- while -rrb- fishermen had to go further and fish longer for less catch . hunger was a real threat ,  says narayana randall dodge , project manager of the pemuteran coral regeneration project . the fact that the reef also acted as a natural flood barrier increased the town 's exposure to coastal erosion from rising sea levels , he adds . today however , pemuteran bay 's coral reefs are once again teeming with life thanks to biorock -- an electrically-powered coral reef growing scheme . coral is placed on underwater electrified steel frames that are connected to a power source on land . the electrification speeds up a process called  mineral accretion  that helps damaged corals grow and repair themselves .  living corals are carefully collected and transplanted onto the structures by attaching with wires or wedged between -lrb- electric -rrb- steel bars ,  says narayana . the project has been so successful that not only has it preserved the reef and surrounding marine ecosystem but it has also become a tourist attraction in its own right , says narayana . despite the success of the pemuteran bay project , biorock technology -- first discovered by german-born architect , wolf hilbertz , in the 1970s -- is it still only used on a small scale . although now present in over 20 countries , the largest biorock scheme is in pemuteran bay and only covers around 500 meters . this constitutes a drop in the ocean when compared to the 109,800 square miles of coral reef that the united nations environment program estimates to exist , 75 % of which is believed to be under threat according to the world resources institute . read more about the threat to coral reef diversity . but according to thomas goreau , head of the u.s. based non-profit , the global coral reef alliance , biorock is more efficient than any other form of reef regeneration and will become a particularly effective defense against rising sea levels in years to come .  we have to run cables out into the sea and you can only go so far before you lose a lot of power ,  says goreau who works to encourage the implementation of biorock technology in vulnerable ecosystems . the cables dictates how far out at sea the steel frames can be placed -lrb- only a few hundred meters -rrb- and therefore limits the area of coral reef that can be grown or repaired . as the technology develops though , goreau sees no reason why biorock structures could n't stretch across hundreds of miles of shoreline or far out into the oceans , protecting vast coastal areas that are exposed to rising sea levels . the key to this prospect becoming a reality , he says , is the harnessing of renewable sources such as tidal and wave energy .  there is a vast amount of energy in the ocean . it 's untapped and what it will allow us to do is generate our power on site ,  says goreau .  this renewably powered technology is still in the pioneering stage but it will be far cheaper and far more effective when it becomes available .
