{"text": "a philadelphia company has unveiled its innovative bike for children that never falls over . called the jyrobike , it makes clever use of gyroscopes to keep the bike balanced even when a child leans from side-to-side . according to the company , this means a child can learn to ride the bike in just one day . the jyrobike -lrb- pictured -rrb- claims to offer children a fast and easy method to learn how to ride a bicycle . a rapidly spinning disc inside the front wheel acts as a gyroscope that stabilises the bike when a kid leans from side to side so that they do n't fall over , and it can be controlled remotely by a parent . the jyrobike , which is currently part of a kickstarter campaign , works on the principle that a bike is more stable at higher speeds . inside the front wheel of the bicycle is a fast spinning disc . motor power : 14.4 watts . battery life : 3-4 hours . max flywheel speed : 2,000 rpm . weight : 3 kilograms -lrb- 6.6 pounds -rrb- . size : 12 or 16 inches -lrb- 30 or 40 centimetres -rrb- . connectivity : micro usb . water resistant : yes . this creates a gyroscopic force that balances the bike even when it is ridden slowly , as might be expected for a child getting behind the handlebars for the first time . a ` control hub ' in the front wheel dictates how the gyroscope acts . this can also be bought separately and attached to another bike . it can change the rate that the disc in the front wheel spins to give a rider different levels of stability . this means as a rider improves , the assistance can be toned down . and ultimately , once they are comfortable , the spinning disc can be removed to reduce the weight of the front wheel by 60 per cent . there are two versions of the bike available ; the smaller 12-inch -lrb- 30 centimetres -rrb- version costs # 179 -lrb- $ 249 -rrb- , while the larger 16-inch -lrb- 40 centimetres -rrb- bike is # 219 -lrb- $ 299 -rrb- . as seen here the jyrobike is stable even when it is given a gentle push and it is allowed to move by itself with the gyroscope inside the front wheel enabled . a remote control can be used to alter the ` control hub ' in the front wheel of the bike . this means a parent can change the stability assistance afforded to a child as they ride . this means as a rider improves , the assistance can be toned down , or it can be turned up if they are struggling . ` the genius behind our technology is that it covertly promotes correct riding technique , ' the company said on their kickstarter page . ` it takes the stress out of teaching , eliminates fears of falling and gets the whole family out riding together faster than trial and error , balance bikes or training wheels . ' the speed of the spinning disc in the front tyre can also be adjusted remotely , so an adult can quickly increase the stability if their child is far away and looks like they are about to fall , for example . the disc inside the bike can be charged with a micro usb cable and lasts for about three hours , and the software inside can also be updated by connecting it to a computer . production on the jyrobike is due to start ` soon ' and it is expected to hit the market in january 2015 . and next year the company also hopes to build an adult version that uses the same technology in a larger bike to help older people learn how to ride . the jyrobike , which is currently part of a kickstarter campaign , works on the principle that a bike is more stable at higher speeds . inside the front wheel of the bicycle is a fast spinning disc that creates a gyroscopic force -lrb- pictured -rrb- to balance the bike even when it is ridden slowly . the jyrobike is available to preorder now at the company 's kickstarter page , with production expected to begin later this year . the first bikes will be shipped in january 2015 . the company also hopes to design a larger version of the bike next year that can be used by adults learning to ride .", "summary": " a philadelphia-based company is seeking funding for its jyrobike .   using gyroscopes it lets kids learn how to ride without falling over .   the bike has a rapidly spinning disc in its front wheel that makes it stable .   this means the bike stays upright when a child leans from side to side .   production begins later this year and it will be on sale in january 2015 .
