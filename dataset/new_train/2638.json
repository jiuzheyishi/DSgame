{"text": "when jon bohmer sat down with his two little girls for a simple project they could work on together , he did n't realize they 'd hit upon a solution to one of the world 's biggest problems for just $ 5 : a solar-powered oven . inventor jon bohmer with the oven he has made out of a cardboard box . the ingeniously simple design uses two cardboard boxes , one inside the other , and an acrylic cover that lets in the sun 's rays and traps them . black paint on the inner box , and silver foil on the outer one , help concentrate the heat . the trapped rays make the inside hot enough to cook casseroles , bake bread and boil water . what the box also does is eliminate the need in developing countries for rural residents to cut down trees for firewood . about 3 billion people around the world do so , adding to deforestation and , in turn , global warming . by allowing users to boil water , the simple device could also potentially save the millions of children who die from drinking unclean water . bohmer 's invention on thursday won the ft climate change challenge , which sought to find and publicize the most innovative and practical solution to climate change .  a lot of scientists are working on ways to send people to mars . i was looking for something a little more grassroots , a little simpler ,  bohmer said thursday . bohmer 's contest win notwithstanding , solar cooking with a cardboard oven is n't new . two american women , barbara kerr and sherry cole , were the solar box cooker 's first serious promoters in the 1970s . they and others joined forces to create the non-profit solar cookers international -- originally called solar box cookers international -- in 1987 . further , the organization 's executive director , patrick widner , said that the plans for a solar box cooker were found in a book published by the peace corps in the 1960s .  we are pleased that mr. bohmer has taken up the cause and interest of the 95 member organizations and 160 individuals of the solar cookers worldwide network ,  widner said .  it would be a pleasure to work with mr. bohmer in kenya where we have been promoting the use of solar cookers for ten years .  bohmer , a norwegian-born entrepreneur based in kenya , said he also had been looking at solutions  way too complex , for way too long .   this took me about a weekend , and it worked on the first try ,  bohmer said .  it 's mind-boggling how simple it is .  the contest was organized by the forum for the future -- a sustainable development charity -- and the financial times newspaper . among the judges were british business magnate richard branson and environmentalist rajendra pachauri . the public also voted on the finalists . bohmer 's invention beat about 300 other entries , including a machine that turns wood and other organic material into charcoal , wheel covers that make trucks more fuel efficient by reducing drag , and a feed supplement for livestock that reduces the methane they emit by 15 percent . bohmer named his invention the kyoto box , after the international environmental treaty to reduce global warming . the box can be produced in existing cardboard factories . it has gone into production in a factory in nairobi , kenya , that can churn out about 2.5 million boxes a month . bohmer has also designed a more durable version , made from recycled plastic , which can be produced just as cheaply . he envisions such cardboard ovens being distributed throughout rural africa .  in the west , we cook with electricity , so it 's easy to ignore this problem ,  he said .  but half the world 's population is still living in a stone age . the only way for them to cook is to make a fire .  i do n't want to see another 80-year-old woman carrying 20 kilos of firewood on her back . maybe we do n't have to .
