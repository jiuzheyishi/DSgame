{"text": "female cat owners are more likely to suffer mental health problems and commit suicide because they can be infected with a common parasite that can be caught from cat litter , according to a study . women infected with the toxoplasma gondii - or t. gondii - parasite , which is spread through contact with cat faeces or eating undercooked meat or unwashed vegetables , are at increased risk of suicidal thoughts . about a third of the world 's population . is infected with the parasite , which hides in cells in the brain and . muscles , often without producing symptoms . risk ? female cat owners are more likely to commit suicide because they can be infected with a common parasite that can be caught from cat litter . the infection , which is called . toxoplasmosis , has been linked to mental illness , such as schizophrenia , . and changes in behaviour . scientists from the u.s. , denmark , germany and sweden looked at more than 45,000 danish women who gave birth between 1992 and 1995 . babies . do n't produce antibodies to t. gondii until three months after they are . born , so the antibodies present in their blood represented infection in . the mothers . the scientists . scoured danish health registries to determine if any of women . diagnosed as infected later attempted suicide , including cases of violent suicide attempts . which may have involved guns , sharp instruments and jumping from high . places . they found . that women infected with t. gondii were one-and-a-half times more likely . to attempt suicide compared to those who were not infected , and the . risk seemed to rise with increasing levels of the t. gondii antibodies . lead researcher dr teodor postolache , from the university of maryland , said : ` we ca n't say with certainty that t. gondii caused the women to try to kill themselves , but we did find a predictive association between the infection and suicide attempts later in life that warrants additional studies . ' the study is the largest ever to try and ascertain a link between t. gondii and attempted suicide and the first prospective study to document . suicide attempts that occurred after the infection was discovered . dr postolache 's research team at the university of maryland was the first . to report a connection between t. gondii and suicidal behaviour in 2009 . the parasite thrives in the . intestines of cats and is spread through oocysts passed in their . faeces . all warm-blooded animals can become infected through ingestion . of these oocysts . the organism spreads to their brain and muscles , . hiding from the immune system within ` cysts ' inside cells . humans . can become infected by changing their infected cats ' litter boxes , . eating unwashed vegetables , drinking water from a contaminated source or , more commonly , by eating undercooked or raw meat that is infested . with cysts . not washing . kitchen knives after preparing raw meat before handling another food . item also can lead to infection . pregnant women can pass the parasite . directly to their unborn babies and are advised not to change cat litter . boxes to avoid possible infection . dr postolache noted the study 's limitations , such as the inability to determine the cause of suicidal behaviour . he added : ` t. gondii infection is likely not a random event and it is conceivable that the results could be alternatively explained by people with psychiatric disturbances having a higher risk of becoming t. gondii infected prior to contact with the health system . ' the findings are published online in the archives of general psychiatry .", "summary": " women infected with toxoplasma gondii are one-and-a-half times more likely to attempt suicide .   third of world 's population is infected with parasite , which hides in cells in the brain and muscles , often without producing symptoms .
