{"text": "tehran , iran with hundreds of protesters gathering and riot police out in force on the streets of tehran , hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad took the oath of office wednesday , beginning a second term in a bitterly divided iran . mahmoud ahmadinejad was sworn in wednesday as iran 's president . he begins his second term . ahmadinejad , 52 , was formally sworn in before iran 's parliament , known as the majlis , as security forces guarded the building and nearby streets in anticipation of protests . witnesses reported a heavy police presence -- including members of the pro-government basij militia -- and several choppers hovering overhead . some reported protesters , many of them women , sitting in front of the parliament building 's entrance . as discontent surfaced yet again , ahmadinejad vowed to take iran forward and flung sharp words at those who questioned the validity of the june 12 elections , in which he was declared the winner with almost two-thirds of the vote . he took particular aim at the united states , britain , france , italy and germany , which have not sent formal letters of congratulations to ahmadinejad .  they said they would recognize the election , but will not congratulate ,  ahmadinejad said in his inaugural speech .  this means they only want democracy at the service of their interests and do n't respect the people 's vote and rights .  nobody in iran is waiting for anyone 's congratulations ,  he said . what 's next for iran ?  asked tuesday whether the white house recognizes ahmadinejad as the rightful leader of iran , press secretary robert gibbs said ,  he 's the elected leader .  gibbs expanded on that comment wednesday , telling reporters  it 's not for me or for us to denote his legitimacy , except to acknowledge the fact .   whether any election was fair , obviously the iranian people still have questions about that , and we 'll let them decide that ,  gibbs said .  but i would simply say he 's been inaugurated , and we know that is simply a fact .  the united states and iran have had no diplomatic relations since 1980 . britain has maintained ties , but has criticized the iranian crackdown on protests that followed the disputed election and has not issued a statement of congratulation to ahmadinejad . however , the british ambassador to tehran did attend the ceremony , and the foreign office in london said the international community still needs to engage iran on  serious issues ,  such as its nuclear program .  while we need to engage with iran 's government , today 's ceremony does not change our position on iran 's elections ,  the foreign office said . among others attending wednesday 's ceremony were iran 's top lawmakers , the heads of the three branches of government , the secretary of the guardian council and foreign diplomats . but as the camera of the semi-official press tv panned the hall , an unprecedented number of empty seats were visible . it was unclear whether opposition leaders were boycotting the inauguration . ahmadinejad struck a note of unity in his attempt to move iran forward , saying  who has voted for whom -- this is not the question . today we need a national resolve . today we need to join forces .  he vowed to promote religion and morality , and support righteousness and spread justice .  i will guard the power that the people have entrusted in me as the sacred trust ,  ahmadinejad said .  i will safeguard it like an honest and faithful trustee .  ahmadinejad , however , starts another four years in office with many iranians questioning his legitimacy . the results of the june 12 election were widely disputed ; ahmadinejad 's chief rival , reformist mir hossein moussavi called the elections a  fraud .  since the vote , iran has seen turmoil not witnessed since the 1979 islamic revolution as thousands have taken to the streets to protest and security forces have brutally cracked down . analyst amir taheri told cnn wednesday that ahmadinejad 's second term will be closely watched around the world . taheri said the freshly inaugurated president faces myriad challenges in his second term , among them a faltering economy and a burgeoning popular movement favoring reform .  he has to worry a lot about the opposition ,  taheri said . iran says about 30 people have been killed in the post-election violence . among those who were arrested , 110 are facing trial , according to iranian media reports . under iran 's constitution , the incoming president must receive the supreme leader 's approval before being sworn into office . on monday , after ayatollah ali khameini gave that endorsement to ahmadinejad , hundreds of iranians again demonstrated in the iranian capital . witnesses and sources said the crowds marched on the sidewalks around vannak square and vali asr avenue , under the watchful eye of hundreds of iranian security forces . some chanted  death to the dictator ,  while others said  god is great .  international media outlets , including cnn , have been restricted in their coverage of iran in the aftermath of the elections .", "summary": " mahmoud ahmadinejad begins a second term as iran 's president .   the results of the june 12 election were widely disputed , sparking violent protests .   since the vote , iran has seen turmoil not witnessed since the 1979 islamic revolution .
