{"text": "the future shape of britain if scotland goes independent has been glimpsed in a piece of kfc chicken . the bizarre discovery was made by terry o'neil when he pulled out a breaded piece of fillet and noticed it looked just like a map of england and wales - but no scotland . it comes hot on the heels of the appearance of a cloud in the shape of the uk with scotland removed . scroll down for video . bizarre : this piece of chicken looks like a map of the uk without scotland , according to the man who found it . mr o'neil made his finding when he ordered a bucket of kfc while on holiday in sussex with his family . the 55-year-old from the isle of wight said : ' i picked this one piece out and i thought it looked like the map of britain , but then i realised scotland was missing . ' he added : ' i did n't notice it at first , but the closer i looked the more it just looked like the uk - well , england and wales - but with no scotland . ' i do n't know whether it 's an omen for the outcome of the scottish referendum , but i would n't be surprised if scotland vote yes . ' earlier gillian begnan , a scot who lives in england , took a picture of a cloud which she says looks like a map of the uk with scotland removed . she now believes the odd sighting could be an ` omen ' about thursday 's vote - though sceptics may dismiss it as nothing more than coincidence . ` omen ' : gillian degnan took this photograph of a cloud which looks like the uk without scotland . mrs begnan , 44 , grew up in the village of fairlie in north ayrshire , on the west coast of scotland , but has lived in nottingham for 20 years and so is not able to vote in the referendum . she captured the photograph of the distinctive cloud while on holiday with her family in sardinia . ' i was on my sun lounger when i spotted it in the sky , ' she said . ' i thought it was a bit weird . ` the referendum is the talking point between everyone at the moment and i started to wonder whether it was an omen about how the vote is going to go . ' mrs begnan added that she supports a no vote - but does not resent the fact that she is unable to cast a ballot . ' i would vote no , ' she said . ' i think scotland would be too small on its own . ' a split would have a negative impact on the rest of britain as well . i think it would cause a huge disadvantage to everyone , financially and politically . ' close battle : the yes and no campaigns headed by alex salmond and alistair darling are now neck-and-neck . the engineer continue : ' i have been away so long now it has to be a decision made by residents , it 's not going to affect me directly . ` most of my family still live in scotland so we discuss what is happening with them . ` my daughters are 13 and 16 , but my oldest thinks that 16 is too young to vote and she feels like if she had a vote she would n't be ready to decide . ` but my youngest is quite interested in it all and she says she would vote yes if she could . ` whatever happens i think it 's going to have a big impact on the uk as a whole .
