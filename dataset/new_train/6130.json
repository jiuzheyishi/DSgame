{"text": "sitting at the desk in rudyard kipling 's old wood-panelled study , it 's easy to see why the world-renowned author was so enamoured of the elms , his home in the coastal east sussex village of rottingdean , where he wrote his just so stories . for the view from the bow windows -- featuring the village green and pond , as well as the flint walls of the cosy plough inn and the old blacksmith 's in the distance -- is just so english . a portrait of kipling sitting here , surveying a scene that has barely changed in more than 100 years , now hangs in the national portrait gallery . so charming : the elms , rudyard kipling 's # 1.45 million home in the coastal east sussex village of rottingdean , is where he wrote his just so stories . one can imagine him twirling his famous moustache and seeking inspiration for his novel stalky & co and poem the white man 's burden , which he also wrote here . if that failed , a walk up to the first and second floors reveals views that take in a windmill , the 13th century st margaret 's church across the road , the south downs and the twinkling english channel . kipling , also author of the jungle book , rented the house for three guineas a week from 1897 to 1902 after discovering rottingdean when he stayed with his aunt georgiana . she was married to the pre-raphaelite painter edward burne-jones , who lived on the other side of the green . in his autobiography , something of myself , kipling says of the elms : ` it stood in a sort of little island behind flint walls which we then thought high enough , and almost beneath some big ilex trees . it was small , none too well built , but cheap , and so suited us . ' impressive : the double-fronted home that has five bedrooms , three reception rooms and three bathrooms . in the same tome he remembers his time in rottingdean -- with his wife carrie and daughters josephine and ellie -- as a tranquil period in his life . ` beyond turning out at 2am to help a silly foxhound puppy who had stuck in a drain , i do not remember any violent alarms and excursions other than packing farm-carts filled with babies and despatching them into the safe , clean heart of the motherly downs for jam-smeared picnics . ' indeed , he only decided to move on when the owner of a hotel on the seafront organised buses to bring people out from brighton to gawp at the home of , at the time , one of the most famous people in the country . that , and the fact that , when he enquired about buying the property , the owner , a mr aha bliss , quoted a price so outrageous that kipling responded : ` obviously you think that there is a goldmine under the green . ' kipling instead sought peace in the east sussex countryside at burwash , where his magnificent former residence bateman 's is now open to the public through the national trust . famous resident : rudyard kipling rented the elms for three guineas a week from 1897 to 1902 . still tucked behind those same high flint walls , the rottingdean house , which dates back to 1745 , is now an imposing double-fronted home that has five bedrooms , three reception rooms and three bathrooms , and is on the market for # 1.45 million . the present owners , frank and marnya wenstrom , both in their 70s , bought the grade ii listed property from the daughter of the writer enid bagnold in 1978 . enid was the author of national velvet , which was made into a movie starring a young elizabeth taylor , and the play the chalk garden . she was also samantha cameron 's great-grandmother . but by the time the wenstroms arrived , the house was in a sorry state . ` it was a total wreck , ' says frank , a retired manufacturer of hotel interiors . ` everything was taken back and rebuilt . we did n't move in for two years and lived nearby in brighton while the work was carried out . ' an impressive hallway now leads to a new kitchen with oak floor , and large bay window doors open out on to a patio and side garden . there 's a dining room off the kitchen , a lounge , kipling 's former study of course , and stairs down to the large cellar rooms . on the first floor a large drawing room overlooks the green , there 's a master bedroom with en suite bathroom and a dressing area that overlooks the garden , and a second large bedroom . the top floor is home to three further bedrooms . the wenstroms , who have two grown-up daughters and a son , might be selling the house , but they are not leaving rottingdean . ingeniously , they have built on top of the old cellar at the back of the house and incorporated the old maid 's quarters to create a new two-bedroom cottage for themselves . ` we love the area . our children grew up here and have moved on so we no longer needed the space , but we never had any intention of moving away , ' says frank . ` rottingdean has everything -- pubs , restaurants , shops and its own beach -- and brighton , with its 50-minute train service to london , is just three miles away . ' by coincidence , the house owned by kipling 's uncle and aunt is also on the market -- with an asking price of # 675,000 . the four-storey , three-bedroom grade ii listed prospect cottage -- last sold for # 499,950 in 2008 -- is a blue-plaque house like the elms . two historic houses for sale opposite each other , separated by a quintessentially english village green . just so ... the elms is for sale through winkworth -lrb- 01273 772175 -rrb- and prospect cottage via fox & sons -lrb- 01273 309968 -rrb- .", "summary": " rudyard kipling wrote his just so stories at the elms in east sussex .   the five-bedroom home in rottingdean village is now up for sale .   the elms dates back to 1745 and is on the market for # 1.45 million .
