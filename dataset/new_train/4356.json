{"text": "washington the senate health care bill is not worthy of the historic vote that the house took a month ago . even though the house version is far from perfect , it at least represents a step toward our goal of giving 36 million americans decent health coverage . but under the senate plan , millions of americans will be forced into private insurance company plans , which will be subsidized by taxpayers . that alternative will do almost nothing to reform health care but will be a windfall for insurance companies . is it any surprise that stock prices for some of those insurers are up recently ? i do not want to subsidize the private insurance market ; the whole point of creating a government option is to bring prices down . insisting on a government mandate to have insurance without a better alternative to the status quo is not true reform . by eliminating the public option , the government program that could spark competition within the health insurance industry , the senate has ended up with a bill that is n't worthy of its support . the public option is the part of our reform effort that will lower costs , improve the delivery of health care services and force insurance companies to offer rates and services that are reasonable . although the art of legislating involves compromise , i believe the senate went off the rails when it agreed with the obama administration to water down the reform bill and no longer include the public option . but that 's not the only thing wrong with the senate 's version of the health care bill . under that plan , insurance companies can punish older people , charging them much higher rates than the house bill would allow . in the house , we fought hard to repeal mccarran-ferguson , the antitrust exemption that insurance companies have enjoyed for years . we did that because we believed firmly that those fortune 500 corporations should not enjoy special treatment . yet the senate bill does not include that provision -- despite assurances from some members that they will seek to add it . by ending that protection , we will be able to go after insurance companies with federal penalties for misleading advertising or dishonest business practices . the house bill would cover 96 percent of legal residents , while the senate covers 94 percent . compared with the house bill , the senate 's bill makes it much easier for employers to avoid the responsibility of providing insurance for their workers . and of course , the senate bill did not remove the onerous choice language intended to appeal to anti-abortion forces . now do n't get me wrong ; the current house and senate bills are a significant improvement over the status quo . given the hard path to reform and the political realities of next year , there is a sizable group within congress that wants to simply cut any deal that works and call it a success . many previous efforts have failed , and the path to reform is littered with unsuccessful efforts championed by franklin delano roosevelt , harry truman and bill clinton . supporters of the weak senate bill say  just pass it -- any bill is better than no bill .  i strongly disagree -- a conference report is unlikely to sufficiently bridge the gap between these two very different bills . it 's time that we draw the line on this weak bill and ask the senate to go back to the drawing board . the american people deserve at least that . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of louise slaughter .", "summary": " senate bill is n't worthy of being called health reform , says rep. louise slaughter -lrb- d-new york -rrb- .   slaughter , who heads rules committee , says lack of public option is a fatal flaw .   she says senate bill would not stir competition among big insurance firms .   slaughter : senate needs to go back and start over on health care .
