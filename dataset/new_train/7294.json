{"text": "for those of us who would never dream of going to music festivals , the attraction of dodgy sound systems and fields turned into mud baths has always been a bit of a mystery . no more . the secret behind the success of many summer festivals is that they 're not really about music . fans are now more likely to go to a festival to take drugs , get drunk or sleep with a stranger than actually listen to the music , a study found . a quarter say they have slept with a stranger , 21 per cent taken drugs , and 13 per cent got into a fight . survey : only 45 % of those who attend festivals such as glastonbury , pictured , actually go for the music . and the misbehaviour crosses the generations . among middle-aged -lrb- 45 to 54 -rrb- fans , nine per cent admit experimenting with illegal drugs at a festival , a fifth drink to excess , 10 per cent have slept with a stranger , and two per cent got into a fight , according to the study by msn.co.uk . others even admit burning tents . brits will spend an average of # 423.01 at uk festivals this year , making them too expensive for 60 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds . however , despite the rolling stones headlining glastonbury and the stone roses the isle of wight festival , just 45 per cent actually go for the music . the others are lured by the atmosphere , the chance to socialise with friends , and to ` escape from everyday life ' . in total , 47 per cent have done things at a festival they would ` never consider doing outside of the music festival environment ' , the study found . for those aged 35 to 44 , the figure is 50 per cent . festivals expert george mckay , professor of cultural studies at salford university , said it was ` human nature ' to let your inhibitions go at a festival . he said : ` festivals are deeply rooted in the carnival tradition , which is to invert everyday expectations of normal behaviour . different reasons : other festival-goers say they go to events like glastonbury , pictured from the stone circle area of the festival site on worthy farm , pilton , to ` escape from everyday life ' ` historically , carnivals would have a ` lord of misrule ' who oversaw the revelries and subversion of the ordinary rules of life . ` for example , at the medieval christian feast of fools , a ` boy bishop ' would lead a temporary revolution interlaced with hedonistic partying . ` this carnival attitude can be seen in the earliest popular music festivals in britain , such as the beaulieu jazz festival in 1960 . that ended up in a riot between modern and trad jazz fans . ` the stonehenge free festivals of the 1980s also degenerated into trouble . ` the msn research shows that misbehaving modern festival goers are simply upholding this ancient tradition . ' professor mckay added : ` the pop festival has been around for more than half a century . that means there are now several generations of keen festival-goers . ` remember that venerable hippie slogan from the 1970s :  you 're never too old for a happy childhood  ? ` music festivals continue to be places where we can escape reality and subvert the rules - whatever age we happen to be . ' typical british weather : one in eight festival-goers say they are staying away from events held in fields this year because of fears it will ran the entire time . while escaping reality for a few days can be fun , it can also have its irritations . the biggest gripe is that portaloos are not cleaned often enough , with 43 per cent infuriated by this , the poll of 2,000 festival-goers found . almost one in five -lrb- 17 per cent -rrb- are irked by the high price of food and drink , and 16 per cent say they have to queue too long to buy it . a similar number -lrb- 17 per cent -rrb- get frustrated at not being able to charge their mobile phone or get a signal . one in eight festival fans say they are staying away from the fields this year because of fears over the weather . and of those that are going , a pair of wellies tops their list of essential items , followed by wet wipes , fancy dress and clean underwear . office worker ryan davies , from manchester , said the ` free-spirit ' nature of festivals make them the perfect place to forget about the stresses of work . the 41-year-old said : ` festivals are the perfect place to let your hair down without anyone judging you . i have a responsible my day job , so usually moderation and professionalism are key . ` once i have pitched my tent i can really relax , let off a bit of steam and share the love . the good music is a bonus .
