{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- turns out the beagle had landed , after all . the 11-year-old mystery of what happened to the uk-sponsored beagle 2 mars lander on its trip to the red planet 's surface appeared to be mostly solved friday with the announcement the craft had been spotted in high-resolution nasa images taken from orbit . the lander -- crammed with devices to look for signs of life on mars -- never radioed home after hitching a ride aboard the european space agency 's mars express orbiter and dropping into the atmosphere on december 25 , 2003 . the images appear to show that the lander 's solar panels did n't fully open after landing , preventing the craft from getting power and exposing the antenna it would have used to communicate with controllers on earth , according to the space agency . while the reasons for that failure remain unknown , the discovery of the lander helps solve one of the most enduring mysteries in martian exploration , said mark sims , a beagle 2 team member from the university of leicester .  every christmas day since 2003 i have wondered what happened to beagle 2 ,  he said , adding that he 'd almost given up hope of ever knowing what had come of the lander .  the highly complex entry , descent and landing sequence seems to have worked perfectly and only during the final phases of deployment did beagle 2 unfortunately run into problems ,  he said . the lander , which is less than 2 meters -lrb- 6.56 feet -rrb- across when fully deployed , was first spotted in the nasa images by michael croon of trier , germany -- a former member of the european space agency 's mars express operations team , the uk space agency said . croon is among a group of beagle 2 team members who have spent years combing through images from nasa 's hirise camera , which is on the agency 's mars reconnaissance orbiter , looking for signs of the missing craft , the agency said . he found it in an area near the planned landing zone , an impact basin called isidis planitia close to the martian equator . the grainy images appear to show the lander resting on the surface , its solar panels only partially deployed . the craft 's rear cover and parachutes are nearthe lander -- the first european craft sent to the martian surface -- was named after the hms beagle , the ship that carried charles darwin on a groundbreaking 5-year scientific survey . while its namesake resulted in no such breakthroughs , david parker , chief executive of the uk space agency , said the discovery proves the beagle 2 had its successes .  the history of space exploration is marked by both success and failure ,  he said .  this finding makes the case that beagle 2 was more of a success than we previously knew and undoubtedly an important step in europe 's continuing exploration of mars .
