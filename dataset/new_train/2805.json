{"text": "despite spending more per person on health care than any other country , americans are getting sicker and dying younger than our international peers -- a problem persisting across all ages and both genders , according to a new report . in 2011 , the national research council found life expectancy in the united states was increasing at a slower rate than in other high-income democracies . shortly after , the nrc and institute of medicine convened a panel of experts to investigate why . the panel was given 18 months to review recent health studies from 16  peer countries  : australia , austria , canada , denmark , finland , france , germany , italy , japan , norway , portugal , spain , sweden , switzerland , the netherlands and the united kingdom . the panel released its report , titled  u.s. health in international perspective : shorter lives , poorer health ,  on wednesday .  our panel was unprepared for the gravity of the finding we uncovered ,  chair steven woolf wrote in the report 's preface .  we hope that others will take notice .  lagging behind . this is not a new problem , woolf noted on a conference call about the report .  it 's been going on since 1980 and it 's getting progressively worse .  data from 2007 show americans ' life expectancy is 3.7 years shorter for men and 5.2 years shorter for women than in the leading nations -- switzerland for men and japan for women . as of 2011 , 27 countries had higher life expectancies at birth than the united states .  the tragedy is not that the united states is losing a contest with other countries ,  the report states ,  but that americans are dying and suffering from illness and injury at rates that are demonstrably unnecessary .  america does rank well in some health measures , according to the panel . the united states has higher cancer survival rates , lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels and lower smoking prevalence rates than many of its peer countries . those americans who make it to age 75 will survive longer than their peers in the comparison countries . global report : obesity bigger health crisis than hunger . but that 's where the good news stops . the report outlines nine health areas where the united states lags behind other rich nations , including infant mortality , homicides , teen pregnancy , drug-related deaths , obesity and disabilities . americans have the highest prevalence of aids in the group . seniors are at a greater risk of developing and dying from heart disease . and our children are less likely than children in peer countries to reach their fifth birthday .  many of these conditions have a particularly profound effect on young people , reducing the odds that americans will live to age 50 ,  the report states .  and for those who reach age 50 , these conditions contribute to poorer health and greater illness later in life .  why ?  the sheer systemic nature of the problem , that affects so many health outcomes across the whole lifespan , surprised all of us ,  said panel member ana diez roux .  it seems to be a whole bunch of things acting together .  it 's easy to point a finger at our health care system , which unlike comparison countries ' does not provide universal coverage . as a result , lower income and less educated people often receive poorer care .  the u.s. health system is highly fragmented , with limited public health and primary care resources and a large uninsured population ,  the authors wrote .  compared with people in other countries , americans are more likely to find care inaccessible or unaffordable .  opinion : finding the jugaad for u.s. health care . but the panel says that 's not all that 's to blame . studies show even white , insured , college-educated americans are sicker than their peers in europe . the experts gave three other possible causes for the country 's growing health disadvantage : . though americans know what 's  good  for them , few act on it . although we are less likely to smoke and drink heavily than our peers , we consume more calories , have higher rates of drug abuse , are less likely to use seat belts and are more likely to use guns in acts of violence , according to the report . most high-income countries report income and education disparities in their health care system . but the panel said americans benefit much less from social programs that could negate the effects of poverty .  in countries with the most favorable health outcomes , resource investments and infrastructure often reflect a strong societal commitment to the health and welfare of the entire population ,  the report states . our environment is also a big contributor to americans ' poor health , the panel said . u.s. communities are built around automobiles , discouraging physical activity and increasing traffic accidents . contraceptives are only available by prescription , instead of over the counter . even stress could play a role -- adding to our waistlines , substance abuse and criminal behavior . moving forward .  it would be a mistake for people to respond to this by saying we need to spend more money on health care ,  woolf said . he noted that our peer countries spend significantly less , but appear to be spending it more effectively . where in the world can you get universal health care ? with  lives and dollars  at stake , the report made several recommendations for the future . the experts asked the national institutes of health to join with international partners to improve the quality of research that could be used to compare peer countries around the world . they also recommended the nih commission research on health policies that have been successful in our peer countries that could potentially be used in the united states . waiting for more research is n't the answer , woolf said . individuals can make changes now , listening to advice about healthy diets and exercise , or making sure to wear their seat belts . as for policy , the panel hopes this report will open a broader discussion about what we value as a nation .", "summary": " as of 2011 , 27 countries had higher life expectancies than the united states .   u.s. falls behind in infant mortality , homicides , teen pregnancy and drug-related deaths .   several factors are to blame for the problem , a panel of experts says .
