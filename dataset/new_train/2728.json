{"text": "in egypt , the words  street food  and  gourmet  do n't often go hand in hand . street food is not about style ; it 's meant to be quick , cheap and filling . however chris khalifa , a 30-year-old owner of zooba cafe in cairo , has tried to change that . he saw a trend elsewhere in the world : chefs hit the streets and serve dishes out of food trucks .  i noticed no one had ever tried to do this with egyptian street food ,  said khalifa .  i try to create a brand around a more gourmet egyptian street food .  but instead bringing gourmet food to the street , zooba turns street food into fine dining . located in cairo 's upmarket zamalek neighborhood , the cafe serves classic street fare like koshari and falafel with a new twist . the dishes , like spinach-infused  baladi  bread or sweet potatoes roasted with a blowtorch , are prepared by professionally trained chefs , using top-quality ingredients . read more : egypt 's street art revolution . khalifa 's business partner , moustafa el rafaey , handles the creative side of running the restaurant . trained at a culinary arts program in the united states , he initially found cooking egyptian cuisine was quite daunting -- and foreign .  i was scared to be honest ,  said el rafaey .  i had -lrb- a -rrb- good international background . to leave all this to cook ... egyptian food was a bit scary for me .  to develop the restaurant 's menu , el rafaey traveled across egypt . he mastered local recipes , tried new flavors and searched for best ingredients . he relishes his experience , saying that preparing food is like creating an artwork .  anything that puts a smile on your face is an art . when you watch a good dance or listen to a good music that makes your smile ,  elrafaey says .  and i put smiles on people 's faces with my food .   when we started , i honestly had no idea how people would respond to a gourmet ` ful , ' ` tameya ' or ` koshari , '  said khalifa , who quit his banking job to start the restaurant .  the response has been good , people have been coming in .  business is so good that they are thinking to expand , opening a second and a third branch of zooba in cairo . and perhaps one day , in dubai or even london -- which means taking egyptian street food to the world .", "summary": " for many residents of cairo , the best food is street food .   it is not about style ; it means to be quick , cheap and filling .   zooba cafe in cairo turns street food into fine dining .
