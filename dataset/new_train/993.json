{"text": "updated : . 19:13 est , 28 january 2012 . kitchen cabinet : ed balls -lrb- pictured -rrb- and his wife , yvette cooper , have been wining and dining political allies . ed balls and yvette cooper were last night accused of a ` lasagne-gate ' dinner party plot to undermine labour leader ed miliband . the husband-and-wife labour frontbench duo have each been tipped to succeed the embattled party leader if he is forced to resign before the next election . they have been wining and dining hand-picked labour mps at their london home and in westminster . the couple say that the events are merely intended to boost the party 's morale . but critics have accused them of disloyalty , claiming that they are attempting to build up their own power base ready to make a leadership challenge . at a gathering over new year at their north london home , mr balls cooked lasagne for more than 30 of their closest political allies and afterwards the couple 's children performed a party piece . when a guest cheerily observed to one of the children , ` well done ! you would clearly make a great leader of the labour party , ' the youngster replied : ` no , my mummy is going to get that job . ' the balls-cooper charm offensive has not gone unnoticed by allies of ed miliband 's brother , david , who remains determined to avenge his defeat in the contest for the labour leadership in 2010 . blairite david is a long-standing personal and political foe of the brownite mr balls . a source close to the former foreign secretary said : ` the balls-coopers are like the borgias . they invite you round to lunch , then pour poison in your ear . ' mr balls also reportedly discussed ed miliband 's future at a separate dinner he had with a fellow senior shadow minister . labour lasagne-eater to balls minor : . balls minor : . according to one account , mr balls , the shadow chancellor , asked the dinner guest if they thought the labour leader would survive . worried about falling into the trap of saying something disloyal , the guest declined to answer . the ` lasagne-gate ' affair comes after a series of polls showed support for ed miliband falling away badly , even among labour voters . power couple : balls and cooper 's charm offensive has not gone unnoticed by ed miliband 's brother , david , who still harbours leadership ambitions himself . mr balls and ms cooper , shadow home secretary , are understood to have invited mps , peers and other key labour figures to lunch , dinner and late-evening whiskies . the party over new year was held for members of their respective treasury and home affairs teams . mr balls remains bitter at his defeat by ed miliband in the contest that took place after gordon brown stepped down as labour leader following the 2010 election . but he has recently been overtaken as a potential future leader by his wife , who is seen as being more attractive to the public than her husband , who has a reputation as a political bruiser , despite making attempts to soften his image . under fire : balls has reportedly raised the questions of ed miliband 's political survival among his dinner party guests . in recent times , he has toned down his aggressive style and talked of his love of cooking and how he was learning to play the piano . mr balls has also said he cries while watching the tv programme antiques roadshow and has claimed that he would happily stand aside to let his wife become leader . but some observers have said this would be untenable , claiming it would be impossible for the formidable mr balls to remain shadow chancellor because people would suspect he was still pulling the strings behind the scenes . he is still viewed with great suspicion by many labour politicians , and in particular those close to tony blair , who say the shadow chancellor was at the heart of the blair/brown feuding when labour was in government . however , other labour mps view mr balls as one of the party 's few ` big hitters ' , whose warnings that the coalition is strangling economic growth by slashing public spending too quickly are increasingly being borne out . a spokesman for mr balls last night said that he and ms cooper had no comment .", "summary": " pair have wined-and-dined labour bigwigs at home .   more than 30 allies ate lasagne at new year gathering as balls children performed party piece .
