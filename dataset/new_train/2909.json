{"text": "it began by accident . my girlfriend , ronni , and her twin sister , marina , rented a documentary on panda bears . we all melted . then we went online and found videos of tourists , somewhere in china , embracing pandas . one showed a gaggle of cubs eagerly descending a slide in what looked like panda day care .  we have to find this place ,  ronni said , eyes lighting up . hugging baby pandas costs about $ 130 and the pandas are even cuter in person than you would imagine . a friend of a friend had recently gone to china on a botanical excursion , and i could see the wheels turning in ronni 's and marina 's heads . soon enough , we had tickets and immunization appointments . much in the same way you might say ,  hey , let 's go to a movie ,  we made plans to cross the pacific . we had no basis to believe that meeting pandas was possible for ordinary people . we consulted guidebooks and online travel forums , and our best bet appeared to be a facility for research and visitors at the wolong nature reserve , about five hours away from chengdu in sichuan province . because it was difficult to reach , we figured it must be more rewarding . once in hong kong , i contracted a fixer on the mainland to help sort everything out . his name was huang , and he 'd been to wolong earlier that year with national geographic . ever since empress wu zetian sent a pair of panda bears to the japanese emperor around a.d. 700 , china 's public face has been represented by the furry goodwill ambassadors , who even forced a smile from richard nixon . today , we noticed upon arrival in shanghai , you do n't see dour mao nearly as much as jingjing , the flower-crowned cartoon panda that 's one of the beijing 2008 olympic mascots , and just the first in the parade of pandas that adorn china 's storefronts , advertising , clothing , and vibrant cell-phone-charm industry . in chengdu , we were greeted at the airport by a 40-foot column topped with a giant bronze panda . on our way into the city , we also could n't help but notice that the lampposts , rickshaws , and even highway overpasses were festooned or stenciled or otherwise decorated with pandas . but chengdu was just a transit point for our trek along the min and pitiao rivers to the wolong nature reserve . we hired a driver , part of a fairly dodgy tour we 'd found last-minute on the internet . all road travel in china happens frenetically -- the constant , aggressive brinksmanship of millions of shoddy minivans with toy-like wheels . we left for wolong at dusk , ascending steep gorges that sometimes disappeared into the mist , on roads that sometimes disappeared altogether . there 's no real town , and not many restaurants , other than the shabby ones at the wolong hotel and the panda inn . the following day , we awoke to a crisp and cool autumn day , with the sound of the river filling the narrow valley . this is the panda 's native habitat , a subalpine arboreal wonderland that makes you understand chinese fairy tales . the china conservation and research center for the giant panda has marked off large enclosures for its several dozen pandas . last summer , the notoriously fickle pandas produced 18 cubs . we could see some of them through the glass of the nursery . the newest born were tiny pink nubs . those slightly older were fed with bottles . the cubs we had seen online were from the previous summer . a little over a year old , all 16 played together in a single enclosure next to the nursery . three japanese girls entered the day-care center and frolicked among the cubs .  how can we do that ?  i asked tang , one of the keepers . he took us to an office , where we discovered advance work to arrange a special panda visit is unnecessary . to hug baby pandas , all you have to do is show up and pay the wolong panda club $ 130 per person . that 's nothing for five minutes of nirvana . in the flesh , the cubs were so unbelievably cute that they seemed artificial . with their round heads , big eyes , and rolling gait , they looked and acted like jim henson creations . touching one felt like meeting a unicorn . the cubs moved like puppies in a curious , playful swarm . they did n't lick so much as nuzzle . and grab : to our delight , the desire for hugging was mutual , and what began as a careful encounter quickly devolved into fuzzy mayhem as the cubs attached themselves to our arms and legs . at one point , ronni was dragged to the ground by a clutch of cubs , and she beamed beatifically .  i ca n't believe this is happening ,  she said as she freed herself , only to be taken down again . after the staff pulled the cubs off us , we stood around in a daze . stepping back outside of the panda pen , ronni stopped grinning long enough to say ,  i want to do that again .  round-trip airfare between chengdu and beijing , hong kong , or shanghai runs $ 400 to $ 680 on dragonair or air china . e-mail to a friend . get the best travel deals and tips emailed to you free - click here ! copyright Â© 2009 newsweek budget travel , inc. , all rights reserved .", "summary": " wolong panda club lets visitors hug pandas for $ 130 fee .   the pandas will hug you back .   last year , pandas at the country 's breeding center had 18 cubs .
