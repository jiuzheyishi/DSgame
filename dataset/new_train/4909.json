{"text": "i know what you 're thinking : what do justin timberlake and i have in common ? first , we 're both responsible for bringing sexy back . second , we 're both standing up to cancer on friday . why ? well , i do n't know justin 's connection to cancer , but i do know mine . i lost both of my grandfathers , an uncle and numerous friends to cancer . additionally , my mother is a cancer survivor . -lrb- first , uterine cancer , and then kidney cancer . -rrb- and i know that all the stars who are coming out friday night and all the viewers at home have been personally touched by cancer in some way . they 've seen the havoc the disease can wreak on a person 's life , family , friends and immune system . no matter who you are , how wealthy you are , how famous you are , cancer will find a way into your life , affecting you or someone you love . every day , 1,600 americans die from cancer . eight million people worldwide will die this year from the disease . in the u.s. , one in every two men and one out of every three women will be diagnosed with some form of cancer in their lifetimes . stand up to cancer is a movement designed to get top researchers from the best medical centers focused on highly specialized projects aimed at bringing new treatments to people faster and making everyone diagnosed with cancer a survivor . we 're gearing up for a national election , yet it 's rare to hear leaders from either major political party say anything about cancer . we , the people , must . it 's why for years now , i 've  spontaneously  showed up at baseball games and other events to support cancer research and on the friday after labor day , i put on one of those fancy t-shirts and stand up to cancer with my friends from film , tv , music and sports . say what you want about the entertainment industry -lrb- and , really , what has n't been said ? -rrb- but on this one , we 're getting it right . for all the issues and problems facing us all right now , this is one of the most pressing . it 's also one of the most promising . scientists and doctors are genuinely excited about the progress in the fight against the disease . certain cancers have higher survival rates than others . by having dedicated dream teams of scientists collaborating in an unprecedented manner and studying the connections between certain types of cancers , those kinds of cancer with lower survival rates have been put on notice . -lrb- that 's right , pancreatic cancer , your days are numbered . -rrb- . during friday 's broadcast , you will hear first-hand from patients bravely participating in clinical trials and scientists on the front lines of the war against the disease , and your favorite movie stars will share stories of real people , just like my mom , who went through hell and back because of cancer . but after all , we are the entertainment industry , and therefore you will be entertained by the likes of coldplay , alicia keys , tim mcgraw and taylor swift . -lrb- i personally picked the music . you 're welcome . -rrb- . but even with an incredible lineup of stars that includes tom hanks , julia roberts , samuel l. jackson , one of our executive producers gwyneth paltrow and america 's newest sweethearts , olympic gold medalists gabrielle douglas and missy franklin , there will still be cynics out there . from the hopeless :  cancer will never be cured . why bother ?  to the apathetic :  the war on cancer is decades old . why bother ?  to those whose sole purpose in life is to point fingers :  cancer is all a matter of lifestyle . why bother ?  to the conspiracy theorists :  the drug companies do n't really want a cure for cancer . why bother ?  to these people , i say ,  stand up . and stand up now .  we have been finding cures for diseases since the beginning of time . polio was decades old before the march of dimes movement , initially broadcast on radio , galvanized a country to find a cure . to those who think cancer is solely a byproduct of unhealthy living , i say healthy people get cancer , too . and to those conspiracy theorists out there , i am reminded of something stand up to cancer 's co-founder laura ziskin used to say :  the people who work at drug companies get cancer , too . so do their mothers , wives , husbands , sons and daughters . they want it to end , like the rest of us .  so now is our time . this is our movement . pull up a chair -lrb- i recommend bringing a box of kleenex or two with you -rrb- , turn on just about any channel on tv friday night and at some point go to su2c.org and give what you can . stand up . so that one day your grandkids or your great-grandkids will ask you ,  what is cancer ?  and you 'll proudly say ,  something of the past . and boy , ` modern family ' was a helluva show .  follow @cnnopinion on twitter .", "summary": "  stand up to cancer  fundraiser will be on tv friday at 8 p.m. et .   organization , backed by entertainment industry , funds research .   eric stonestreet says his family has been touched by cancer , as have so many others .   stonestreet : let 's make cancer a thing of the past .
