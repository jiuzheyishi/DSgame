{"text": "finding grubs in your dinner wo n't be cause for complaint in a new welsh restaurant . chef adam holcroft 's grub kitchen is set to open in haverfordwest , pembrokeshire , this summer and it will serve dishes which feature crickets , bugs and worms . the 37-year-old head chef says it will be the first restaurant in the uk dedicated to serving insects as protein to show how bugs can help feed the booming global population . adam holcroft is opening the first insect restaurant in britain , grub kitchen , this summer which will serve worm fudge ice cream and bug burgers to peckish customers . satay sago worm pad thai : a stir-fry dish with baby sweetcorn , capsicum , courgettes and crickets . mr holcroft said the restaurant aims to ` normalise ' eating creepy crawlies on a daily basis . he said : ` we 're treating them as a normal food item , incorporating insect protein as an ingredient but using normal flavours we 're familiar with and everyday food items we recognise . ` we want to pioneer the movement to normalise the eating of bugs on a day-to-day basis . ' mr holcroft and his team have found some interesting ways of incorporating insects into their cooking . the restaurant menu will include bug burritos and burgers , bamboo fudge worm ice cream and cricket kofta kebabs . trio of grubs : the chef has incorporated bugs and insects into dishes . creepy-crawly dinner : mealworm , cricket and grasshopper burger served with polenta chips . some of the bugs used in recipes include sago worms , meal worms , crickets and grubs . he said : ` as a chef you are always looking for ways to be creative . ` we 've found that we can ground crickets up to make flour , which can be used in baking . we 've also created cricket grapes served with bamboo worm fudge ice cream . ' mr holcroft set up shop after a run of successful pop-up cafes serving grubs to intrigued diners across south wales last year . he said that the new dishes and food creations come off the back of years of research into the principles of entomophagy - the practice of eating insects . bug burritos being prepared . entomophagy remains common in some parts of the world with at least two billion people worldwide eat insects , according to the food and agriculture organisation at the un . yellow jacket wasp larvae are popular in japan , cicadas are treasured in malawi , and weaver ants are devoured in thailand . termites , a food favourite in many african nations , can be fried , smoked , steamed , sun-dried or ground into a powder . the list of edible insect species is currently at 1,900 and growing . but he is keen not to put off squeamish customers - so if you do n't fancy a bug-based dish you will be able to order something a bit more traditional . adam said : ` i 'm a firm believer that people are n't going to stop eating meat - that goes against biology - so bugs are also going to sit next to normal dishes on the menu . ` for example , we 're serving both bug burgers and lamb kebabs . ' grub kitchen will be based at dr beynon 's bug farm - a science attraction run by oxford university entomologist and television presenter dr sarah beynon . unconvinced ? consider british wine merchants laithwaite 's world 's first insect and wine matching guide , created last year , which paired chardonnay with tarantulas , sparkling rose to barbecued locusts , sherry to giant waterbugs and shiraz with sago worms . asian forest scorpion - scorpions have a strong , bitter flavor and are normally eaten with sweet chili sauce . paris street rose is full of rich sweet fruit made from full bodied transylvanian pinot noir , so it will have enough body to cut through the combination of flavours . mealworms - match their nutty taste and light , crunchy texture with a crisp clare valley viognier wine that has just the right combination of fruit and richness . zebra tarantula - tarantulas are normally eaten deep fried , so think similar to fish and chips . a lively full bodied chardonnay will stand up to the complex fishy flavours of the tarantula . sago worms - these worms have a distinct taste a bit similar to bacon so you need a big meaty red with loads of punch to match that savoury flavour . mclaren vale shiraz is fresh with loads of red fruit and spice . bbq locusts - locusts taste a bit like an exotic bar snack and with the bbq flavour you 'll need a wine with a hint of sweetness . the hacienda de lluna moscatel is a gorgeous lightly bubbly pink that works well as an aperitif . chocolate dipped locusts - these locusts are essentially a savory dish as they taste a bit like sunflower seeds , but also have the sweetness from the chocolate . a rich robust wine with loads of sweet fruit will stand up to these flavours . giant waterbugs - the meat inside the water bug 's body tastes a bit similar to a sweet scallop , while the head has hints of anise , so you 'll need to find a wine that can match well with seafood and stronger flavours . a dry sherry , and a fino at that , is the only choice here . the crisp citrus and nutty flavours will complement their complex flavours . queen weaver ants - their slightly sour and crunchy tastes like a lemon . they would go well with an aromatic white with pretty fruit and floral notes . a gewürztraminer provides the perfect balance to crunchy textures . asian forest scorpion - scorpions have a strong , bitter flavor and are normally eaten with sweet chili sauce . paris street rose is full of rich sweet fruit made from full bodied transylvanian pinot noir , so it will have enough body to cut through the combination of sweet and sour . crickets - the flavours are much harder to distinguish in crickets and so they are often prepared with garlic and salt . nevertheless the nutty flavor that comes through means a perfect fit is a rich full-bodied white wine like albariño . garlic chapulines - have an earthy and grassy flavour and a very crunchy texture , therefore we recommend a creamy dry champagne that will match well with the earthy flavours -lrb- similar to matching with mushrooms -rrb- and crunch .", "summary": " grub kitchen in haverfordwest , pembrokeshire to feature insects on menu .   head chef adam holcroft wants to ` normalise ' eating of bugs for protein .   cakes baked using special flour made from ground crickets .
