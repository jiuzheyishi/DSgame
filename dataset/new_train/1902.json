' ms anderson estimates there will be 200,000 visitors per year to spaceport ` when all our customers are flying . ' as well as his dreams for commercial spaceflight , richard branson has said he wants to develop planes so fast that passengers will be able to travel between new york and tokyo in less than an hour . and he says the technology could be available sooner than we think . speaking to cnbc , the entrepreneur said that once his virgin galactic space tourism project is underway he will turn his attentions to developing supersonic commercial flights that fly at 19,000 mph -lrb- 30,500 km/h -rrb- . he said : ` after we 've done the space programme , we will be producing supersonic planes , which will go far , far , faster than -lsb- the -rsb- concorde . ' the spaceport america base in new mexico will work with the normal air traffic control system to launch spaceshiptwo . spaceshiptwo will carry six passengers and two pilots . each passenger gets the same seating position with two large windows - one to the side and one overhead . the virgin announcement came hours before richard branson 's main rival in the commercial space race was to unveil its latest spacecraft . commercial flights are to begin by the end of this year and more than 600 people have already signed up at $ 250,000 -lrb- # 150,000 -rrb- each to take a trip on spaceshiptwo . the carrier aircraft is pictured here .", "summary": " agreement sets out how missions work with alongside air traffic control .   flights to begin by end of the year with a ticket costing $ 250,000 -lrb- # 150,000 -rrb- .   news came hours before rivals spacex unveiled dragon v2 spacecraft .   richard branson has also said he wants to develop .   planes so fast they will be able to travel between new york .   and tokyo in less than an hour .
