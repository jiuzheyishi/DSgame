{"text": "former president george w. bush said in a rare tv interview broadcast sunday morning that he was shocked to learn iraqi dictator saddam hussein expected him to back down from their 2003 standoff that preceded a massive u.s. invasion . ` you know , when he was captured , i was told that the fbi agent that talked to him -- he said ,  i just did n't believe bush  , ' he told cbs newsman bob schieffer sunday morning . ` and it 's hard for me to believe he did n't believe me . ' ` we 'd given an ultimatum to the taliban and delivered , ' bush said . ' i make the point in the book , of course , that -- and dad understood this better than anybody -- that when you say something as president , you better mean it . ' that line is already being interpreted on twitter and elsewhere as a veiled slap at president barack obama , whose ` red line ' ultimatums leveled at syria and iran have been seen globally as tentative and toothless . former president george w. bush appeared sunday for a rare tv interview with cbs newsman bob schieffer on ` face the nation ' ' i just did n't believe bush , ' iraqi dictator saddam hussein reportedly told american interrogators after his capture , a revelation that left bush ' 43 ' surprised . ` words mean something . ... i thought i was pretty clear at times during my presidency and meant it , ' bush said sunday . ` saddam hussein did n't believe us . so i was surprised . ' ` it was hard in retrospect for me to look back and say ,  i do n't see how he could doubt my word  . ' the interview aired on cbs during a day when the network was marking the 60th anniversary retrospective of the program ` face the nation . ' bush 's new book , ' 41 : a portrait of my father , ' will ship on tuesday . it 's a portrait of president george h.w. bush , who served a single term in the white house before losing the job to bill clinton in 1992 . the younger bush kept the book project close to his vest for years . the associated press reported sunday that it includes a probing analysis of his father 's decision to invade iraq the first time around . but he insists in the book that his 2003 middle east battles with saddam hussein were n't son 's homage to his dad . ' i was not trying  to finish what my father had begun ,  as some have suggested , ' he writes . bush sr. had driven iraqi forces loyal to saddam hussein out of kuwait but allowed them a safe retreat to baghdad . bush jr. swooped in to finish the job after al-qaeda terrorists struck new york city and the pentagon in 2001 . ' i went in there as a result of a very changed environment because of september the 11th . and the danger we were concerned about was that the weapons ... would be put into the hands of terrorist groups that would come and make the attacks of 9/11 pale in comparison . ' he included an explanation in his book , bush said sunday , because he ` was just responding to , kind of , the gossip that tends to work around the political circles -- that  clearly he had only one thing in mind and that was to finish the job his father did n't ,  because my dad decided not to go into baghdad after routing saddam hussein out of kuwait . ' the younger bush preceded barack obama in america 's highest office , and saw his pentagon 's hard-fought gains in the region reversed by troop pullouts from both afghanistan and iraq . he said sunday that he has no regrets about sending american servicemen and women into a brutally fought and protracted war . ' i think it was the right decision , ' he told schieffer . obama 's troop withdrawals at the end of 2011 have been blamed widely for the rise of isis , the self-proclaimed islamic state of iraq and al-sham , which swarmed into the spaces left by america 's departure . bush appeared sunday in a rare tv interview , discussing iraq policy , his new biography of his father , and the chances his younger brother jeb might make a white house run of his own . ` mission accomplished ' : president george w. bush addressed the nation aboard the nuclear aircraft carrier uss abraham lincoln in may 2003 after what he called a ` victory in a war on terror ' after saddam hussein 's ouster -- but obama would later roll back those gains by withdrawing all us troops from iraq . saddam ii ? isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi , shown preaching in a mosque , has become public enemy no. 1 in iraq and syria , fueled by the absence of dominating us power in the region . isis now controls nearly two-thirds of both iraq and syria , by some estimates . bush suggested sunday that it did n't have to be that way . ` my regret is that a violent group of people have risen up again , ' the former president said . ` this is  al qaeda-plus .  i put it in the book , they need to be defeated . and i hope we do . i hope that the strategy works . ' bush also commented on talk of his younger brother jeb , a former florida governor , making a run for the presidency in what would be a precedent-setting three-peat for the bush family if he were successful . jeb is ` wrestling with the decision , ' he said . ' i think it 's 50-50 . ' ` he and i are very close , ' offered the former president . ` on the other hand , he 's not here knocking on my door , you know , agonizing about the decision . he knows exactly , you know , the ramifications on family , for example . he 's seen his dad and his brother go through the presidency . i 'd give it a tossup . ' he said he would be ` all in ' to support his brother if he runs , and would accept a behind-the-scenes role if that 's what was asked of him . former first lady barbara bush has gone on record saying that enough bushes have already run for president . ` sometimes her prognostications have n't been very accurate , ' george w. said .", "summary": " bush insists he did n't invade iraq in 2003 to finish what his father started .   ultimatum to saddam hussein was serious , he told cbs news -- ` when you say something as president , you better mean it '   that line was a veiled slam on president barack obama , whom he also slapped over the rise of isis in iraq where the u.s. military once dominated .   ` my regret is that a violent group of people have risen up again , this is  al qaeda-plus  '   interview came on cbs during a 60th-year fete for ` face the nation ' show .
