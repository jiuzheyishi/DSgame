{"text": "having an orgasm that lasts for three hours might sound like fun to many but for liz , from seattle , the experience was anything but . instead , she says it was fun ` for the first five minutes ' but soon descended into a nightmarish experience that left her needing hospital treatment . worse , the marathon orgasm proved to be the first of a series of unwanted sexual spasms that could strike anywhere and at any time . scroll down for video . awkward : seattle native liz developed a rare condition which left her orgasmic up to 12 times a day . ` initially it was just after sex but . eventually , it got to the point where i could be doing anything from . watching tv , walking down the street and i would have an orgasm out of . the blue , ' explains liz . ' i . could sometimes hold it off for a short time by holding my breath and i . would get out of public situations as quickly as possible . i did n't run . my life - my body ran my life for me . ` it . was very depressing . it got to the point where i would have as many as . 12 spontaneous prolonged orgasms in one day . i was going from specialist . to specialist to specialist and they did n't know what to do with me . it . was a very hard time in my life . ' her problems began after she suffered an unexpectedly lengthy orgasm that continued for so long , it left her in hospital . embarrassing : liz -lrb- pictured with boyfriend eric -rrb- says her orgasms could strike any time and anywhere . ` the first five or so minutes were pleasurable , ' remembers liz . ` most people who have n't been through something like this think a half hour long orgasm , an hour-long orgasm , would be an awesome experience . until you actually experience something like this , that is . ' when the orgasm failed to stop , liz , panicking , began ringing every doctor she 'd ever been to in the hopes of finding a way of stopping the unwanted sensation . with the help of boyfriend eric , she tried hopping on the spot , drinking a glass of wine and even took antihistamines in an effort to stop it . realising that it was n't about to stop , eric insisted on taking liz to a&e where doctors were left baffled by the continuing orgasm . ` having to walk while having an orgasm is like walking in jello , ' adds liz . ` it 's a difficult thing to do . i remember having to put mind over matter to make it work . telling their story : liz and boyfriend eric told their tale on tlc show , sex sent me to the er -lrb- tonight -rrb- . solution : liz will have to take bipolar medication for the rest of her life to keep the orgasms at bay . ` the doctors kept asking me ,  are you sure your partner did n't drug you or something like that ?  and i was thinking ,  why on earth would eric drug me ?  , ' she adds . eventually , the orgasm stopped - without the help of medics who had been unable to establish the cause . ` at first , it was just sheer disbelief , ' adds liz of the moment the orgasm finally ended . ' i thought it was going to start right back up but it did n't . ` it 's a physically , emotionally and mentally taxing experience to have an orgasm for three hours . ' but although the marathon orgasm had ended , her problems had n't as she endured near-continuous orgasms , sometimes having as many as 12 a day . doctors , initially baffled , eventually pinpointed the cause of the problem - bipolar disorder which had been misdiagnosed as depression and treated with anti-depressants . ` anti-depressants exacerbate multi-orgasmic dysfunction because they actually change brain chemistry , that 's their job , ' comments dr irwin goldstein , director of the institute of sexual medicine in the usa . to tackle both the bipolar disorder and persistent orgasms , liz was given valproic acid - a substance that treats bipolar while at the same time suppressing the brain chemicals used during orgasm . ' i got . down from where i was to having them only daily , then to one every . other day , then i was having them weekly and then maybe it was about . once a month , ' says liz . ` it took about four to five months before they were . completely under control and it 's probably been about a year since i 've had . one . she adds : ` my diagnosis is that i . probably have to take meds every day for the rest of my life and i . do n't live in fear . i have a very happy sex life and i do n't have to . live in fear .
