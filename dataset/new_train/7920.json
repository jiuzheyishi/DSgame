{"text": "david cameron invoked the vision of margaret thatcher 's favourite political guru yesterday in an attempt to fight back from the shattering tory defeat in the eastleigh by-election . he refused to ` tack right ' , but said he would pursue ` common ground ' policies on welfare , immigration , the nhs and crime to woo ordinary voters . the prime minister 's ` common ground ' theme is a tribute to one of mr cameron 's tory heroes , sir keith joseph . inspiration : david cameron with baroness thatcher in 2007 . sir keith was the intellectual driving force behind thatcherism , but was nicknamed ` the mad monk ' by left-wing critics for his ascetic manner and some of his more controversial views . mr cameron 's response to the eastleigh result , where the conservatives finished third behind the lib dems and ukip , came as : . mr cameron 's vow to stay on the ` common ground ' followed pressure from tory right-wingers to take a tougher stance on europe and other issues to counter the ukip threat . his refusal to ` tack right ' is a clear message that he will not abandon policies such as gay marriage , which have enraged his right wing . but by praising sir keith , he is trying to convince activists that he has not renounced the party 's thatcherite heritage . mr cameron said : ` we are engaged in a battle for britain 's future ... it is a battle we will only win if we reject the cynicism , the political calculation and the easy ways out -- and stick to the course we are on . ` the right thing to do is to address the things people care about -- to fix yourself firmly in what keith joseph called the  common ground  of politics . ' a no 10 source said : ` we have shown we can occupy that ground by cutting immigration by a third , introducing a welfare cap and imposing a tough but fair criminal justice policy . ` but it is not just as an appeal to the right -- we will continue to ring-fence health spending . ` and we are taking the right decisions on the number one issue facing the country -- the economy . these are all common ground issues . labour are n't there at all . ' sir keith joseph was the intellectual driving force behind thatcherism . sir keith , who is regarded as one of the chief architects of thatcherism , believed that the out-of-touch political elite had to find ` common ground ' with ordinary voters . he was widely acclaimed for his brilliance and sincerity , but admitted that he lacked the judgment , personality or stamina to be leader . he was a candidate to succeed edward heath in the 1974 tory leadership election -- until he gave a speech in which he argued the poor should not have more than two children per family . he said the ` balance of our population , our human stock ' was ` threatened ' by the higher number of children in poorer families . after being accused of advocating selective breeding , or eugenics , he withdrew from the race , and backed thatcher instead . sir keith later said it would have been ` a disaster for the party , country and me ' if he had become leader . in 1981 , he clashed with michael heseltine by opposing plans to rebuild recession-hit merseyside and suggesting a ` managed run-down ' of the area instead . sir keith , who died in 1994 , held three cabinet posts . his political soul mate lady thatcher said the two politicians who had most influence on her were sir keith and the equally controversial enoch powell , both of whom she called ` very great men ' . triumphant mr farage used his party 's stunning second place finish in eastleigh to reveal that he intended to go one better by winning a by-election in his own right before the next election . he told the mail on sunday that if another by-election occured in the immediate run-up to 2015 , he intended to stand . mr farage 's allies say he ` bitterly regrets ' not standing in eastleigh . many commentators believe his popularity would have enabled him to win it . nigel farage , with eastleigh ukip candidate diane james , is said to regret not standing for the seat himself . mr farage said : ` i would certainly consider standing in a by-election once the euro elections in 2014 are out of the way . ' he also launched a new personal attack on ` dishonest ' cameron , stating : ` the aspirational classes who supported thatcher wo n't touch cameron with a bargepole because we are the only party who want to take those on a minimum wage out of paying tax altogether and who know bright children from poorer backgrounds will benefit hugely from more grammar schools . ` if cameron thinks that printing leaflets in ukip colours , as they did in eastleigh , will bring him votes then he 's wrong -- all it does is highlight the tories ' dishonesty . ' a confidant of mr cameron said : ` it is high time farage 's fantasy politics and economics of the mad house are exposed . ` just because you smoke and drink pints at 11am does not make you a good leader . when ukip is subjected to scrutiny , they will crumble . '", "summary": " david cameron said he will pursue ` common ground ' policies to woo voters .   sir keith joseph was the intellectual driving force behind thatcherism .   he believed the political elite needed to be in touch with ` ordinary ' voters .   ukip leader nigel farage said he planned to become an mp before the 2015 election .   senior ministers said it was time to ` take the gloves ' off over populist mr farage and hit back hard following his ` conman ' jibe at the prime minister .
