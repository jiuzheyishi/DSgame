{"text": "nicosia , cyprus in the old town of cyprus 's capital nicosia , something subtle and unexpected is happening . in the wake of the economic crisis , the historic center -- an attractive old town ringed by vast 16th century venetian walls -- is gradually coming back to life with new cafes , shops , and art galleries emerging from the labyrinthine streets . ledra street , at the heart of town , has been a symbol for the island 's division since 1974 , when , in july of that year , a greek military junta backed a coup d'etat in cyprus . in response turkey launched military intervention and by august it had landed thousands of troops and successfully partitioned the island . around 180,000 greek cypriots were forced south and some 50,000 turkish cypriots moved into vacant properties in the northern turkish occupied zone . since 2008 , ledra street has reopened with a checkpoint that can now be crossed . but between the ubiquitous kentucky fried chicken and starbucks outlets , and the local restaurants selling frozen yoghurt , coffee , and souvlaki by the pita-load , u.n. soldiers still patrol . gradually however , through the frustrations of separation and the strain of the economic crisis , a new generation of poets , directors and entrepreneurs are reclaiming the area . band aid . the band monsieur doumani have been playing in and around ledra street for several years . many of their songs have a distinctly political edge . the band 's lead singer , antonis antoniou , says that in his view music and art can help to heal old wounds : .  we strongly believe that art and music can reconcile and reunite people ... especially in parts of the world where problems are between neighboring countries . for instance , here in cyprus , the two communities share the same culture , and people used to live happily together listening to the same songs -- in many cases sung in both greek and turkish . this should be used as an example to bring people of the communities together .  the green line -- the buffer zone between the north and south cyprus -- stretches almost across the length of the country -lrb- interrupted by the british overseas territory of dhekelia -rrb- , but nowhere is it more visible than in nicosia .  the green line gives the city a strange energy ... in a good way ,  says eleni xenou , a writer who lives in city .  there is a silence here ; an absence . a feeling of the past with the u.n. in the middle . it is very edgy and it gives the city a very interesting charm . you need to get over yourself to get over the line .  cafe culture . even though the checkpoints are now open , barricades still snake through the middle of town . on the corner of one inauspicious street , is the popular xaratsi cafe , which owner stavros lambrakis has managed since before the checkpoints opened up . the cafe attracts all kinds of people , and welcomes anyone from either side of town .  the vibe of the place is what i believe attracts -lrb- my customers -rrb- ,  lambrakis says .  xaratsi is like no other place . it is on the green line , sitting on the ` no man 's land . ' it carries the energy and history of the city . it is untouched and one can see how the time has stopped .  retail therapy . alongside the arts scene are the shops , many of which celebrate their location with an unmistakable irony . a kebab shop called berlin 2 sits right by a street blockade ; a little further down the road you can buy lingerie from no border underwear . on kleanthi christophides street anastasios gkekas runs a shop called the office -- a high end men 's fashion boutique and art gallery space . the shop has no mirrors , but asks its customers go outside and down the street to look at themselves in the mirrors inside the nearby u.n. guard station .  i find it necessary to expose my clients to this reality ,  gkekas says .  to make them see their reflection among the ruins , -lrb- and -rrb- get them to think about where it is they are standing , at a very particular level of history .  as there is a high turnover of guards , gkekas regularly has to explain what he is doing : .  officially the access to the guard station 103 is not permitted to anyone . in addition , the guards often change so i do not know several of them and anyway i always have to ask permission , explaining the nature of my request ... i do not know why they let me enter ,  he says . many younger people in nicosia see hope for the city and believe that reconciliation , while difficult , is certainly possible . antoniou believes that opening up the crossings and allowing the two communities to get to know one another has been key to the city 's healing .  for the first time in our lives -lrb- especially for us who were born after 1974 -rrb- we came to have first-hand experiences with the so-called ` other ' and create friendships ,  he says .  both the propaganda that spread amongst people all these years in both sides and the fact that we had no direct contact with this ` other ' , helped towards demonizing it . but now , people who manage to get rid of these prejudices are able to construct relationships and have built trust , so the future could be optimistic .  cnn on the road series often carry sponsorship originating from the countries and regions we profile . however , cnn retains full editorial control over all of its reports . read the policy .", "summary": " the u.n.-patrolled green line divides cyprus .   artists , poets and musicians are returning to the divided cypriot capital , nicosia .   new cafes and galleries are bringing life to the city , and with it hope of reconciliation .
