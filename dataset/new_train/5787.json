{"text": "desperate : jobless martin bailey from nottingham who has resorted to wearing with a sandwich board to try and attract potential employers . there 's no doubt that many people are finding landing a job difficult in the current economic climate . but one down-on-his-luck job hunter is resorting to desperate measures in a bid to find work and avoid claiming benefits . martin bailey , 50 , has taken to standing on a busy roundabout each morning wearing a sandwich board asking for someone to employ him . he hopes that his unorthodox way of looking for an income will not only win him a job but also help him win back the love of his life with whom he split last year because he was unable to offer her a stable life . the divorced father-of-two dresses in his suit and heads out in nottingham each day wearing the board which reads : ` quality worker seeks job ; honk if you can help ' . dedicated martin , who worked for more than two decades as a civil servant at the land registry until he was made redundant last year , has gone the extra mile in his bid to get a new job after dozens of application forms and more than 50 speculative cvs failed to find him work . he even attempted to set up his own business in an attempt to make an honest crust , running a fancy dress store until it was forced to close on saturday due to a lack of business . he said : ' i was made redundant a year ago from my job in the civil service . so i used the money to set up my own business . ` but it was a struggle since the day we opened and i had to shut up shop last saturday . ` unfortunately the day we opened a massive fancy dress centre opened in the city centre and , while our business did gradually improve , we just did n't get the visitors in . ' i do n't want to be unemployed and i do n't want to claim benefits . hopeful : martin bailey says that the response to his quest for work has been positive so far and that he has handed out business cards to several motorists . out of luck : martin hopes to find work after closing his business on saturday . he is also looking to win back the love of his life by offering her ` something stable ' ' i hate the idea of not being productive , i 'm prepared to do anything , i 'd love to do customer services but i can do driving jobs , admin , and jobs with anti-social hours do n't bother me . ' i thought i would show my initiative , get up first thing in the morning in the cold and get myself out there rather than standing in the dole queue . ' i felt a bit stupid to start with and it was bitterly cold , but i handed out at least half a dozen business cards yesterday and hopefully this will all end in a job . ` so far i 've had a great response , loads of people honking so it 's pretty loud round there , but i 've been given some fantastic business cards by people who want my cv and like my pro-activeness . ' martin is also determined to get back on his feet in order to win back a woman he broke up with last year . graduate adam pacitti also went to drastic measures in a bid to get a job , spending his last # 500 on this billboard . he added : ' i do have another slight push to do this , i met the love of my life last year called joan and we split because i could n't offer her anything stable . ' i am hoping that if i get a job i can win her back . ' martin is not the only job seeker to take such drastic action to find work . unemployed adam pacitti , 24 , spent his last # 500 on a giant billboard asking for a job after sending cvs for more than 250 posts . adam , who has a first class honours degree in media production from the university of winchester , also set up a website with a video cv and posted pictures of the billboard on twitter . he said that his phone ` exploded ' following the post and he had more than 7,000 re-tweets .", "summary": " martin bailey , 50 , closed his fancy dress shop in nottingham on saturday .   he has now taken to the streets wearing a sandwich board asking for a job .   the ex civil servant hopes to win back the love of his life by landing work .
