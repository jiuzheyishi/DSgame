{"text": "istanbul , turkey the party of turkey 's ruling prime minister sailed to an easy victory in parliamentary elections on sunday , winning a third term in office with 49.9 % of the vote with 99.9 % of the votes counted . but marring the night , 10 people were wounded at a post-election party , the country 's anatolian news agency said . for nearly a decade , recep tayyip erdogan has dominated turkish politics while also defining his country 's assertive new role as an economic and diplomatic power in the region . campaigning on his record of unprecedented economic stability and prosperity during nine years in power , erdogan and his justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- succeeded in slightly increasing his mandate . the akp won 49.9 % of the vote , an increase of nearly 4 percentage points from the party 's performance in the 2007 parliamentary election .  we are thrilled after winning one out of every two voters ' votes in the country ,  erdogan said late sunday night . in a victory speech delivered from the balcony of his party headquarters in ankara , erdogan made a pledge to serve all turks , regardless of ethnicity or religious sect .  to the turkish nation , whether you voted for akp or not , the real winner of the 2011 elections is turkey ,  erdogan roared , to a crowd of flag-waving supporters .  no one should have any doubt , whether you voted for us or not , all of your beliefs and values and lifestyles are our pride .   the obvious result is another landslide big victory for the incumbent , the akp ,  said omer taspinar , a turkish political analyst with the brookings institution in washington .  people voted overall for stability . it 's the same rule in most democracies , ` it 's the economy , stupid . ' people vote on bread and butter issues . they vote based on their living standards . the fact that turkey 's economy is growing at 9 % . the fact that interest rates are low . people can borrow , people can spend . consumption is very high .  prime minister erdogan added another electoral victory feather to his cap . but he fell short of capturing the two-thirds majority in parliament that would have allowed the akp to unilaterally rewrite turkey 's constitution . erdogan has made no secret of the fact that he intends to rewrite the constitution , a deeply flawed document drafted by a military junta that seized power in 1980 . and on sunday night , erdogan made it clear a new constitution would still be a top priority .  the nation has assigned us the task of creating a new constitution ,  he said .  we are not going to close our doors . we will go to the opposition . if they accept , we will sit down and work towards consensus with civic groups , with parties outside of the parliament , with academics .  the largest opposition party , the secular republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- won 26 % of the vote . that marked a boost of 5 percentage points over its performance in 2007 . but it also fell short of predictions by the chp officials that the rebranding of the party under new leader kemal kilicdaroglu would lead to a big win at the polls . nonetheless , kilicdaroglu declared victory during his own brief post-election speech to supporters .  within a short period our party won 3.5 million new votes ,  he said .  we wish akp success . but they should not forget . that there is a stronger chp now .  a big winner on sunday was the peace and democracy party -lrb- bdp -rrb- , the country 's most influential kurdish nationalist party . young men waving yellow bdp flags raced around istanbul in cars , celebrating the party 's capture of an additional 10 seats in parliament . a blast sunday night at a bdp post-election celebration in the southeastern town of sirnak wounded 10 people , six of them critically , the anatolian news agency said . the cause of the explosion was not immediately known . the party captured an additional 10 seats in parliament . turkey still bears the scars of a long guerrilla war waged between kurdish separatist guerillas and the turkish state . more than 30,000 people have been killed since the conflict broke out in the early 1980s .  we have a very difficult challenge ahead with the kurds ,  said taspinar of brookings .  they have high expectations . they really want radical reform . the new constitution will have to reflect a different understanding of kurdish citizenship . after polls closed sunday , clashes erupted in the predominantly kurdish city of diyarbakir . a city government official , speaking to cnn on condition of anonymity , confirmed reports that police fired tear gas and water cannons to disperse kurdish youths hurling firecrackers and gasoline bombs . in his victory speech , erdogan addressed the kurds , turkey 's largest -- and long-oppressed -- ethnic minority .  we will work harder to end mothers ' crying and end the bloodshed ,  he said .  we did away with assimilation policies ... we say peace , freedom and democracy in the region .  erdogan and the akp first swept to power in 2002 , after the party won 34 % of the vote , bringing an end to years of weak and crisis-prone coalition governments . the party won a much stronger mandate in 2007 parliamentary elections , capturing 47 % of the vote . in the run-up to sunday 's election , erdogan unveiled ambitious plans titled  turkey 2023 ,  which include digging a canal through istanbul from the black sea to the marmara sea , which would parallel the bosphorus strait . despite obvious flaws , turkey 's messy democracy and its booming economy are an inspiration for many in the turbulent middle east . during the height of the revolution in february in cairo 's tahrir square , many egyptians pointed to turkey as a possible model for future democratic development . and more than 5,000 syrians have fled across the border to turkey in recent days to escape a brutal crackdown on anti-government protesters by syrian president bashar al-assad . one of the big successes of the erdogan era in turkey has been the assertion of civilian control over the once-meddlesome military , which overthrew four elected governments in 50 years . cnn 's joe duran and jeremiah bailey-hoover contributed to this report .", "summary": " new : 10 are hurt in postelection blast .   prime minister 's party wins 49.9 % of parliamentary votes in final count .   but two-thirds vote was needed to unilaterally rewrite constitution .   strongest kurdish party captures 10 more seats .
