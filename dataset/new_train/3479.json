{"text": "when most people think of breast surgery , they envisage augmentations or reductions . but another cosmetic procedure is on the rise among women desperate for ` perfect ' breasts . areola reduction surgery is aimed at women who are unhappy with either the size or shape of their areolae , the brown or pink area surrounding the nipple . women who are insecure about the size or shape of brown or pink area surrounding their nipples are resorting to surgery . some women believe their areolae are too wide , raised , non-circular or uneven in colour and are now resorting to surgery to tackle the problem . the procedure is performed by removing a circular area of the outer area of the areola and bringing in the skin around it to reduce and tighten it . absorbable stitches are used inside the areola to reduce the diameter . in many cases , surgeons will use a permanent stitch which they place deep in the breast tissue to prevent the areola from widening after surgery . one woman who is considering surgery said her nipples has been compared ` hob nob biscuits ' helena , 33 , who lives in london , who had been hiding her nipple insecurity for years was ecstatic when she heard about the surgery . she said ` as soon as i hit puberty i . realised my nipples were unlike other girls . they just got bigger and . bigger -- and they were much darker than my friends ' nipples . ` getting changed for swimming was mortifying -- i was worried everyone was looking at me . ` my first boyfriend jokingly compared . them to hob nob biscuits . he meant it fondly but that description stayed . with me -- and i 've never been able to move on from it . i 've felt . self-conscious with every man i 've ever undressed in front of . ` they have also been compared to . scotch pancakes . they are so disproportionately large - it makes me so . paranoid . leteysha grace , of mtv 's the valleys , was so upset by comments about her breasts that she 's now considering nipple reduction surgery . ' i do n't feel at all sexy with my top off . i ca n't imagine how . any man could find them attractive . ` my friend told me her nipples got . larger and darker when she was pregnant and breastfeeding . the very . thought fills me with fear . ` i 'd never heard about nipple reduction surgery before - i thought i was stuck with them . ` now that i know it exists i 'm going to save up to have it done . ' the surgery involves removing skin from the outer area of the areola . and helena is not alone - leteysha grace , of mtv 's the valleys , is considering the surgery after suffering at the hands of bullies . leteysha was horrified by the onslaught of abuse she received on twitter after she appeared topless in a zoo magazine shoot . speaking to heat magazine , she said : ` i 'm having my nipples corrected because i 'm not happy with the way my boobs look . ' i ca n't even take my bra off during sex . i do n't know if i 'll still have sensitivity after the surgery , but , to be honest , i do n't really care . ' however , a loss of sensation is n't the main issue with this type of surgery . miles berry , co-author of the good boob bible explains : ` if too much skin is removed , scars can stretch so expectations are a key part of preoperative discussions . the average areola is approximately 4.5 . cm in diameter . sometimes an enlarged areola is caused by the natural . sagging of breasts due to age or breast-feeding . ` however , i feel the trend is growing and results are usually very good , if the above points are taken into consideration . ' plastic surgeon dr. yannis alexandrides , founder of clinic 111 harley street , said of the surgery : ` women who are self conscious because they have large areolae , need not worry because there is a simple correction that can be performed under local anaesthetic . ` an average areola is approximately 4.5 cm in diameter . sometimes a large areola goes together with natural sagging of breasts due to age or breast-feeding . ` if you want to have a breast reduction or a breast lift done , the areola may be reduced at the same time to the desired size . an areola reduction can also be performed without additional surgery . ` through an incision in the outer part of the nipple of the areola , the pigmented skin around the nipple or areola is removed . this procedure may leave a small scar around the areola . ` an areola reduction does not cause any problems with future breast feeding . ' dr. yannis alexandrides said : ` women who are self conscious because they have large areolae need not worry because there is a simple correction that can be performed under local anaesthetic '", "summary": " women now resorting to surgery to alter size or shape of the areola - the darker area surrounding the nipple .   performed under either local or general anaesthetic .   leaves minimal scarring .   lateysha grace from mtv 's the valleys is considering it .
