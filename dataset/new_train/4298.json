{"text": "washington the obama administration will not support a policy of taxing drivers based on their mileage , the transportation department said friday after a published interview in which secretary ray lahood called it an idea  we should look at .  the mileage tax idea involves tracking drivers through gps units in their cars . in a written statement , the department said ,  the policy of taxing motorists based on how many miles they have traveled is not and will not be obama administration policy .  the idea -- which involves tracking drivers through global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- units in their cars -- is gaining support in some states as a way of making up for a shortfall in highway funding . oregon carried out a pilot program and deemed it  successful .  speaking to the associated press , transportation secretary lahood , an illinois republican , said ,  we should look at the vehicular miles program where people are actually clocked on the number of miles that they traveled .  the remark was part of a discussion about various options to help make up for the highway funding shortfall on the federal level . when contacted by cnn , the transportation department said lahood was unavailable . a spokeswoman provided the department 's statement and said she could not elaborate . officials in massachusetts told cnn this week that there has been talk of proposing such a system for the state . colin durant , a spokesman for gov. deval patrick , said  privacy would be our top priority .  patrick on friday announced a different plan to help raise highway funds : a 19-cent increase in the state 's gas tax . but he said that alone  will not solve all our challenges ,  and some  major reforms  will be needed . under a vmt -lrb- vehicle miles traveled -rrb- tax program , gps units would allow the government to keep track of how much each car is driven and where -- though not necessarily with exact street locations . the government could also track other things , including the time each car enters a certain zone . for decades , the fuel taxes that drivers pay at the pump have been the central source of federal and state funding for roads and bridges . but they are no longer nearly enough . last fall , congress approved an $ 8 billion infusion into the depleted federal highway trust fund . the problem stems in part from something good : more and more americans are buying vehicles that have better gas mileage . that means less gas tax money from each car , though the car is causing the same amount of wear and tear on the roads . officials including lahood have opposed raising the national gas tax , particularly in the current recession , and have said a new system is needed . a report by the oregon department of public transportation , published in november 2007 , said a  road user fee pilot program  found that a vmt tax is  viable .   privacy is protected ,  the report argued , saying the pilot program included  engineering requirements to maintain as much privacy as practicable while still allowing a feasible way to audit and challenge billings .   no specific vehicle point location or trip data could be stored or transmitted  in the pilot program , and  the only centrally stored data needed to assess mileage fees were vehicle identification , zone mileage totals for each vehicle and the amount of fuel purchased .  some officials support using tracking zones and times of day in determining a vmt tax , so that more would be charged for driving on crowded roads during rush hour . but some people across the country have spoken up against a vmt tax .  is this a good idea ? in a word , no ,  columnist glenn reynolds wrote in january for popular mechanics .  at best , it 's overcomplicated and intrusive . at worst , it 's a threat to privacy and the environment .  reynolds added ,  gas taxes are a pretty good proxy for road usage -- the more you drive , the more gas you burn -- and there 's a bonus : gas taxes encourage people to use less gas . ... a mileage tax , presumably , does n't care whether you 're driving a prius or a hummer , giving no incentive to save .  the civitas institute in north carolina -- which describes itself as standing for  liberty and prosperity derived from limited government  -- said it carried out a poll in north carolina and found that voters disapprove of the idea . a federal blue-ribbon panel plans to issue a report next week on ways the country can make up for its highway funding shortfall . other possibilities include tolls , higher registration fees and other types of taxes . in its interim report , the national surface transportation infrastructure financing commission said new technologies could allow for a mileage gas tax that would take into account the type of vehicle and level of emissions . programs of that type are being developed in other countries , including germany and the netherlands , the report said . it added ,  such programs may not be ripe for widespread implementation in the u.s. yet , but are maturing rapidly .  cnn 's kara yates contributed to this report .", "summary": " mileage tax idea would use gps in cars to track drivers ' usage .   transportation secretary lahood calls it an idea  we should look at    transportation department says obama will not pursue the tax .   oregon carried out a pilot program and deemed it  successful  "}
