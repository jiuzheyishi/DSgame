{"text": "life-long battle : shobna gulati 's hair started falling out after her father died when she was 19 . she is known to millions of coronation street and loose women viewers for having a bollywood-worthy bouffant . but today shobna gulati reveals the truth : she has waged a life-long battle with thinning hair . although afflicted since her teens , her most severe bout began two years ago when she noticed visible patches of scalp and found clumps of hair on brushes and her pillow , and clogging up the shower plughole . shobna , 47 , says : ` an inch fell out from all around my hairline , and i had bald patches in my parting all over the top of my head that were up to a centimetre wide . ` i felt dreadful and unattractive , and panicked that it was all going to come out . ` i 'd leave my hair down to try to disguise it or use brown eye shadow to cover up the bald patches . ' i was miserable and hated looking at pictures of myself . ' about 40 per cent of women will experience some degree of hair loss by the age of 50 due to hormonal changes . but female pattern baldness remains a taboo subject , and shobna hopes that by speaking out she will reassure others . she also wants to offer hope as , using supplements made from sea algae , she is regaining her locks . shobna first discovered her hair was thinning after her father died and she moved out of her family home in oldham , greater manchester , aged 19 . ` both the trauma of my father dying and the change of diet had an impact on my hair , ' she recalls . ` i skipped meals and did n't eat as well as i could have done . ' temporary hair loss can be accelerated by stress , poor diet and weight loss . while it generally lasts only six months , shobna 's continued until , at 27 , pregnancy caused a rise in oestrogen . it stopped her hair falling out and it looked fuller again . but three months after the birth of son akshay , her hair started falling out again and shobna -- who split up with her baby 's father while she was pregnant -- struggled to cope . ` it was something else to deal with in addition to the upheaval of single motherhood , ' she says . ` it was a mess . ' when shobna found fame in 1998 playing anita in sitcom dinnerladies , her thinning hair was n't initially a concern -- it was neatly tucked away under a hat . but things changed when she joined coronation street in 2001 . receding : actress and loose women host shobna found that she had bald patches as her hair loss got worse two years ago . ` on screen , with it all blow-dried , it looked fine , ' she says . ` but i secretly hated what i looked like . as a shop girl i 'd be asked to wear my hair up . as i got more comfortable with the make-up girls , i 'd ask them to leave some curly bits at the front to make it look fuller . ' being subjected to the paparazzi forced shobna to fake a full head of hair . ` clip-in extensions became my favourite accessory , ' she says . in 2006 , on a three-year break from the soap , she cut her hair short and bleached it . but it ended up even more brittle . ` the peroxide killed it . as my hair grew i had weaves put in -lsb- in which hair extensions are sewn on to the hair -rsb- , but my hair was so weak it broke . ' she returned to the cobbles and the role of sunita in 2009 , dyeing her hair brown to make it look fuller . the hair loss shobna suffers is a surprisingly common problem and very distressing . nutritional deficiency can be the cause , particularly with iron store levels , which need to be at a certain level for good hair growth . if a diet is lacking in nutrients , supplements can help . commonly hair loss will be caused by thyroid problems or fungal scalp infections or will start post-pregnancy , and in these situations supplements would be unlikely to help . in many patients with female alopecia , there seems to be no obvious underlying cause , but often the hair loss spontaneously improves whether or not a supplement is taken , usually after six months . these pills are unlikely to completely reverse hair loss in most women , but for the chance of some improvement they are worth a try . ` the only way is essex was popular and everyone wanted big hair , ' she says . ` i bought into the trend with clip-in extensions -- i looked like a barbie doll . ' by 2012 , as she left the street , her hair had really started to fall out . ` during my last year i was under a lot of stress over the change in my career and my relationship , ' says shobna , who split with boyfriend anthony brown , 31 , last july . adrenal ` stress ' glands secrete male hormones into the body , causing hair loss . she was also approaching the menopause , which affects levels of oestrogen too . low iron levels and thyroid disorders can also contribute , but the most common form of female hair loss -- a condition called androgenetic alopecia -- happens when the follicles become sensitive to normal levels of male hormones in the body . the main treatment is minoxidil , which is applied to the scalp and stimulates blood supply to encourage regrowth . steroid injections can also help by suppressing the immune system , which is thought to damage follicles . but shobna says : ` i did n't feel ill and did n't want to waste my doctor 's time . i did n't see my hair loss as an illness . i was embarrassed and would have found it too difficult to talk about . it was like saying the word  balding  would make it worse . ' after finishing filming last march , shobna had extensions to boost her self-esteem . ` they were marvellous but they were n't good for my hair , she says . ` it grew dry and horrible , and every time the extensions came out i felt worse . ' in january she turned to supplements -- those on the market include nourkrin , nanogen , hairfollic and viviscal -- containing vitamins , minerals and marine extracts that can make hair grow stronger . ` i was sceptical , ' admits shobna . ` i worried it would be a waste of money . ' but , in conjunction with a healthy diet , she believes they have made a difference , and two months ago she took out her extensions . ` i 'm not saying this is the solution for everyone but it feels as if i have more hair , ' she says . ` it feels healthier and more invigorated . i feel like i have taken action and not let the beginnings of the menopause take control of who i am .
