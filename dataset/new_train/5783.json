{"text": "angry : peter rees , 62 , pictured with his partner annie brown , claims he was discharged from the west wales general hospital at 2am on new years day and left to walk the 23 miles home . a 62-year-old hospital patient who was suffering with breathing difficulties was told he would have to walk 23 miles home after being discharged in the middle of the night . peter rees was rushed to west wales general hospital in carmarthen west wales after he was hit by a fit of uncontrollable coughing and shortness of breath . he was diagnosed with a chest infection after tests and told he could go home at 2am . the father-of-three had arrived at hospital without his wallet and asked staff for help with transport home explaining that he lived 23 miles away in llanwrda and had no one to collect him . but he claims that he was offered no help and was told to leave the hospital for being aggressive by a nurse . having walked around 12 miles along pitch dark roads despite feeling unwell , mr rees was picked up by a passing police car and arrived home at 6.30 am on new year 's day . he said : ` it was dreadful - the most horrible night of my life . ' i had dark clothing on , i was feeling most unwell and i had to walk on unlit roads on one of the most dangerous nights of the year . ` hospitals are supposed to be caring places but the nurse sent me packing knowing my only way home was to walk . ' mr rees , who spent a week recovering in bed , has since made a formal complaint to the hospital . he had become unwell while at home on new year 's eve and was examined by a paramedic at home who took him to a & e at the 391 bed nhs hospital . he was later told he was allowed to go home following an examination , x-rays and a blood test . mr rees said : ` they told me i had a chest infection and released me with a course of strong antibiotics . distressed : peter rees , pictured , had been admitted to hospital suffering breathing difficulties and walked 12 of the 23 miles along pitch dark roads home to llanwrda in the early hours of the morning . long walk : mr rees lives in the village of llanwrda 23 miles from the west wales general hospital . ` when i explained that i lived 23 miles away and had no way to get home , the nursing sister told me to walk . ` when i said i could n't believe what was happening , i was accused of being aggressive . ' i was very tired , but i did n't raise my voice or swear . i was not aggressive , but they said i had to leave . ` there were ambulancemen there who saw my predicament but said they were not allowed to drive patients home . he added : ` even if i had money i would not have been able to get a taxi at that time on new year 's eve . ' i would have been happy to sleep in a chair until daybreak when i could have arranged a lift home . ` but i was virtually shown the door - the attitude of the nurse is something i will never forget . ` it was heartless and no way to treat a man of my age who had just been diagnosed with a chest infection . ' emergency : mr rees was rushed to the west wales general hospital in carmarthen . dropped off : mr rees eventually made it home to the village of llanwrda at around 6.30 am , four-and-a-half hours after he was discharged from hospital , having been picked up by police . mr rees , whose partner annie was unable to pick him up as she does not drive , walked ten miles before a passing police car stopped him and told him it was dangerous to be walking along the road . he said : ` the officers urged me not to walk any further because it was too dangerous , but i had no choice . ' i was literally clinging on to bramble bushes as i edged along the hedgerow in the face of oncoming traffic . ' i was shattered , freezing , i felt giddy and i lost my footing more than once . ' he walked a further two miles before a second police car stopped him and offered him a lift home . mr rees is now considering taking legal action against the hospital claiming that it failed in its duty of care . a spokesman for the hywel dda health board which runs the hospital said : ` we regret to hear about the situation mr rees found himself in on new year 's day . ` the health board has now received a formal complaint and , as the investigation is ongoing , we can not comment further at this time . ` we 'd like to reassure the public that there are a range of innovative transport schemes currently in place , or being piloted , for patients who require assistance with non-emergency transportation . ` improving access to transport is a key priority .
