{"text": "jerusalem officials at the hospital in israel where former prime minister ariel sharon is being treated described him thursday as being in  extremely critical  and  grave  condition , with his family is by his side .  in the last few hours there has been a deterioration in ariel sharon 's medical condition ,  said a spokesman for sheba medical center in tel hashomer .  he continues to be in critical condition .  earlier this week , the center 's director , zeev rotstein , had said doctors were unable to stabilize sharon 's kidney function and other vital systems and that the danger to sharon 's life had grown . the 85-year-old has been in a coma for eight years and is suffering from multiple organ failure . news broke last week that his health had recently worsened . sharon is a highly decorated -- if controversial -- israeli military figure who became prime minister in 2001 . he became comatose in 2006 , when he suffered a major stroke that led doctors to put him under anesthesia and on a respirator . his term as prime minister came to an end . rising through military ranks . born in 1928 in kfar malal -- a community that would later become part of israel -- sharon graduated from high school in 1945 and began working with the haganah , a militant group advocating for israel 's independence . he began his rise through the israeli military ranks in 1953 . sharon helped establish an elite commando unit and was eventually promoted to be an army major general . he held this rank during 1967 's six day war , which ended with israel controversially expanding its territory . sharon went on to play major roles in subsequent israeli military conflicts as well , including as head of the army 's armored reserve division during the 1973 yom kippur war . he then began transitioning into government roles that included stints as prime minister yitzhak rabin 's military adviser , agriculture minister and defense minister from 1981 to 1983 . invasion of lebanon . sharon also orchestrated israel 's invasion of lebanon , an effort aimed at palestine liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- fighters that also left thousands of civilians dead and led many in the arab world to call him the  butcher of beirut .  an official israeli inquiry found sharon indirectly responsible for the september 1982 killings of as many as 2,000 palestinians at the sabra and shatila refugee camps outside of beirut , lebanon . the report -- which led to sharon 's prompt resignation -- determined that the then-defense minister had done nothing to stop christian militiamen allied with israel from entering the camps , despite fears they might seek to avenge the killing of their leader the previous day . sharon did not stay out of the spotlight for long . his adviser ranaan gissin said sharon  felt betrayed by his government .  sharon also sued time for $ 50 million over a magazine article implying that he had foreknowledge of and played a greater role in the massacre . a new york jury in 1985 agreed that the article was negligent and defamatory , but ultimately ruled in the u.s.-based publisher 's favor , finding no evidence of actual malice or reckless disregard for the truth . becoming prime minister . sharon held several other cabinet posts between 1984 and 2001 , when he won a special election to become prime minister . by then , as head of the likud party , sharon was considered a hawk . and early on , he took the offensive by sending tanks and troops into palestinian territory and ordering the assassination of militant leaders . but sharon also took steps toward peace , such as agreeing with the plo 's then-leader , yasser arafat , on a timeline to halt israeli-palestinian violence and resume peace talks . but that effort was undermined by sharon 's own party , which backed a resolution to never allow the creation of a palestinian state . sharon later participated in talks with regional and world powers to discuss a  road map  for middle east peace . a significant moment for sharon was his decision to turn over gaza and portions of the west bank to palestinian control . while he had previously encouraged israelis to establish settlements on occupied palestinian land , sharon pushed for israel 's historic withdrawal , or disengagement , from 25 settlements in the west bank and gaza . the reaction in his own right-wing likud party to his order to the military to drag israeli settlers from their homes in gaza led sharon in november 2005 to form the centrist political party kadima , hebrew for  forward .  in grappling with the decades-long conflict between israelis and palestinians , sharon said a few years before ,  i can talk and look in the eyes of the citizens of israel and convince them to make painful compromises .  immediately after sharon fell ill in early 2006 , his power was transferred to vice premier ehud olmert . surgeons removed 20 inches of sharon 's intestine the following month and , that april , israel 's cabinet formally ended his run as prime minister after declaring him permanently incapacitated . the former prime minister 's health has fluctuated since then . in january 2013 , doctors said testing on sharon indicated some brain activity when he was shown photos of his home and heard his son 's voice . sharon brain results not proof he 'll wake up .", "summary": " the former israeli
