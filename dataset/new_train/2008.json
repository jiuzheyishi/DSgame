{"text": "here we go again . this week , israeli-palestinian negotiations will begin in israel and the west bank . having participated in my own fair share of these kinds of negotiations over the years , i would n't presume to discount secretary of state john kerry 's effort . but i also would n't get my hopes up . in 2001 , secretary of state colin powell assigned me to assist gen. anthony zinni , who had just been given a mission impossible : negotiate a cease-fire between yasser arafat and ariel sharon in the middle of the second intifada . i asked zinni straight out why he wanted to risk ruining a brilliant career on a goal he could n't possibly achieve . he replied that he loved hopeless causes . in that case , i told him , he 'd come to the right place . will these be the  star trek  negotiations and go where no man or woman has ever gone before ? it 's hard to say . but here are five signs that might offer clues as to whether there 's life -lrb- or not -rrb- on planet arab-israeli negotiations . opinion : americans , stay open to both sides in mideast talks . 1 . will the two sides maintain radio silence ? so far , kerry has done what no other u.s. official has ever accomplished : he 's gotten the two sides who have a pathological history of leaking to essentially shut up . that 's either because there 's something meaningful to protect , or alternatively , there 's nothing really there there , and that 's worth hiding . i suspect it 's the former . so watch the leaks from both sides . if the substance of what 's being discussed is being backgrounded to embarrass , pressure or undermine the negotiators , the negotiations are in serious trouble . because this process depends on things kerry has heard from each side that they ca n't say publicly yet or wo n't say to one another , radio silence is critical -- for now . 2 . are folks writing things down ? the famous hollywood mogul samuel goldwyn was right : an oral agreement is n't worth the paper it 's written on . oral exchanges and verbal commitments can be starting points . but serious negotiation requires stuff on paper . more than this , every negotiation needs a way to organize the effort , and an agreement must be reduced to a text . ideally , the united states would control that text -- as jimmy carter did at camp david or as james baker did with the terms of reference and invitations to the madrid peace conference . but the key question is whether the negotiators are working on language that will actually fill in the agreement . and what kind of agreement are they working toward : borders/security first or an accord on the basic principles on all the issues ? if the parties are n't crystal clear on where they 're heading , then any road will get them there -- and that 's a recipe for drift and disaster . the same is true for showing maps . borders of a palestinian state are a key element in these negotiations . if you hear that one side or the other wo n't produce them , start looking for a new conflict to mediate . 3 . what 's happening away from the negotiating table ? there was a time that we believed we could insulate the talks at the table from the environment outside . that was called oslo , and the process failed . there must be some correlation . that 's why kerry has tried to get each side to stop doing negative things for a period of time -- six to nine months . israelis are supposed to do a phased release of palestinian prisoners and limit settlement activity . palestinians are supposed to stand down from efforts to bring the issue of statehood to the united nations or press their claims against israel in international bodies , and stop incitement too . already , both sides are unhappy with nonobservance of these actions . a certain amount of dysfunctional behavior from both sides is built into the reality that one is the occupier and one the occupied . but given how little the israeli and palestinian publics seem to have invested in these talks , everything possible must be done to demonstrate that life on the ground is changing too . and we 're not off to a good start . 4 . watch what the tough guys say . israeli-palestinian negotiations are as much about domestic politics as anything else . and watching those in each camp react to what 's going on in the negotiations is important . a certain amount of bluster from each side is expected . but one way to gauge the seriousness of what 's happening is to look at how worried the opponents of the peace process are . the palestinians public is deeply skeptical of these talks . and hamas for sure will oppose them . so will members of israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's likud party . more important will be the reaction of the two newbies in israel in politics and in the coalition : naftali bennet and yair lapid . pay careful attention to bennet , whose right wing views count , and who will try mightily to make sure he knows what 's being offered at the table . if he 's relaxed and silent , you can bet the negotiations are remaining in pretty safe territory from benjamin netanyahu 's perspective -- or he 's being frozen out . either way , watch out , signs of trouble may be brewing at home for the prime minister . 5 . what 's the u.s. doing ? the odds against a conflict-ending accord that addresses all the issues are pretty long . it will require major moves from palestinian authority head mahmoud abbas and netanyahu and traveling to a place they 've never been before . but it will also require the u.s. to be in the middle of the mix . right now , kerry describes the u.s. role as a facilitator , a term that has very little meaning . -lrb- it 's the one we used to describe the american approach at the july 2000 camp david summit -rrb- . if this is going to work , both kerry , and at the right time , obama , will have to be all over these talks like a cheap suit . middle east peace is hard . and if the us wants an agreement -- assuming the two sides do -- they 'll have to push , shove and use ample amounts of vinegar and honey to get a deal , including developing formal proposals to bridge the gaps on tough issues such as jerusalem . and those u.s. positions need to be fair and reflect the needs of both sides . does the president want it that badly ? if he does , a high-level , pretty high-risk leaders ' summit is in his future . stay tuned . we may just have a chance this year to find out . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of aaron david miller .", "summary": " israeli-palestinian talks are set to begin this week .   aaron miller says there are signs to look for to see if the talks are going anywhere .   he says watching if the parties keep talks confidential is key ; so is the u.s. role .   miller : negotiators need to set out key principles , talk about borders .
