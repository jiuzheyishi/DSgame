{"text": "hamas and israel blamed one another for the lack of a cease-fire in a conflict that has left more than 1,200 people dead , raising questions about just what it will take to end the fighting in gaza . the violence continued wednesday morning , when israeli forces shelled the abu hussein school in northern gaza and killed at least 20 people , the palestinian health ministry said . the israeli military said they are looking into the incident . international efforts to broker a deal to end the violence failed again tuesday , with hamas rejecting a cease-fire proposal put forward by the palestinian authority that called for a 24-hour truce that could be extended to 72 hours . hamas maintains that any deal must include an end to israel 's blockade of gaza . israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has said any truce must allow for its protection against tunnels used by palestinian militants in gaza to make their way into israel .  hamas is responsible for all deaths on their side and on our side because they are the ones who kept this conflict going ,  mark regev , a spokesman for netanyahu , told cnn .  people are fighting and people are dying because hamas said no to a cease-fire .  israel is  ready for a period of sustained peace and security  regev said earlier in the day on cnn . but he asserted that hamas has consistently rejected truces and an egyptian initiative for a cease-fire put forth this month . on hamas-run television , mohammed deif , chief of the group 's military wing , said that  there is no middle ground  regarding a truce until israel ends its  siege  of gaza .  the israeli enemy will not have security as long as we do n't have security for our people ,  he said . hamas wants israel to lift a blockade it began on gaza in 2007 , a move israel has said was necessary to stop hamas and other allied militant group from bringing weapons into gaza . but israel has been under fire for sealing the borders , with aid groups saying the blockade has cut off basic supplies and created a humanitarian crisis . deaths mount as fighting rages . while leaders continued to talk , the lights in gaza flickered on and off in many homes after its only power plant was hit . palestinian officials blamed an israeli airstrike . but israel said the power plant was not a target . at least 40 % of gaza 's fuel had been burned by early tuesday , according to fathi al-sheikh khalil , deputy chairman of the palestinian energy natural resources authority in gaza . the plant will have to be reconstructed and will not operate as it did for at least a year , he said .  we can not supply electricity  for hospitals , sewage treatment or domestic use , he said .  this is a disaster .  hamas-run television reported early tuesday that israeli strikes hit the ministry of finance in western gaza and the house of ismail haniyeh , a senior political leader of hamas . a radio station run by hamas was bombed . at least 1,242 people in gaza have died and more than 7,000 have been wounded since the conflict between israel and hamas began , the palestinian ministry of health in gaza said . the number of militants killed is unclear , but the united nations estimates that 70 % to 80 % of the dead are civilians . fifty-three israeli soldiers have died since operation protective edge began july 8 , according to the israel defense forces . three civilians have been killed in israel as well . ` underlying kinds of issues ' in washington , u.s. secretary of state john kerry defended the obama administration 's efforts to seek a cease-fire and sloughed off strong israeli public criticism of his initiative . he also said netanyahu  consistently said he would embrace a cease-fire that permits israel to protect itself against the tunnels  used by palestinian militants in gaza .  we are working very carefully , and i think thoughtfully , with our israeli friends in order to be able to find a way to reduce the civilian loss of life , to prevent this from spiraling downwards into a place from which , you know , both sides have difficulty finding a way forward in order to address the underlying kinds of issues ,  kerry said . the official palestinian news agency wafa reported that palestinian leadership in the west bank was offering a 24-hour truce , which could be extended to 72 hours , and that the idea had support from hamas and islamic jihad , another militant group in gaza . but sami abu zuhri , a hamas spokesman in gaza , said the wafa report was not true and  not related to the resistance ,  which  speaks for itself .  when hamas gets a guarantee from israel for  international mediation regarding a humanitarian pause , then we can consider it ,  he said on hamas tv . israel repeatedly has condemned hamas for rejecting an egyptian proposal for a cease-fire that israel agreed to earlier this month . some temporary cease-fires have taken place throughout the conflict , with each side quickly accusing the other of violating the pauses in shooting . refugee camp hit , ` terror sites ' targeted . the jabaliya refugee camp in northern gaza was shelled tuesday , hamas said . a medical official said more than 10 people were killed .  witnesses have told paramedics that entire families are still buried under the rubble ,  said al-qidra , the spokesman for the gaza health ministry . meanwhile , israel reported that five people were seen emerging from a tunnel shaft in gaza . they fired at israeli troops , who  responded and engaged the perpetrators ,  the idf said .  in addition , forces uncovered ammunition which included ak-47 assault rifles , machine guns and explosive devices . since midnight , the idf targeted over 110 terror sites .  israel has uncovered 32 tunnels used by hamas to smuggle weapons and launch attacks , israel defense forces said . hamas has an estimated 10,000 rockets , more than a quarter of which have been fired into israel in the past few weeks , the idf said . a cache of rockets was discovered at a u.n.-operated school in central gaza that was closed for the summer , according to the united nations relief and works agency . the school was not being used as a shelter , it said . the rockets were discovered tuesday during a regular unrwa inspection , the agency said . it 's the third time the rockets have been discovered at a closed school in gaza .  because of fighting in the vicinity of the school we have been unable to get a u.n. munitions expert to the school , but we hope to do as soon as the security conditions allow ,  chris gunness of the unrwa said . inside a hamas tunnel . what is hamas ' endgame in gaza ? what is israel 's endgame in gaza ? opinion : gaza peace struggle drains me of hope .", "summary": " palestinian official :
