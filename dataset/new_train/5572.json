{"text": "officials recently found switches produced by h3c technologies in the network infrastructure of a leading u.s. nuclear weapons lab . a leading u.s. nuclear weapons laboratory recently discovered its computer systems contained chinese-made network switches and replaced at least two components because of national security concerns , a document shows . a letter from the los alamos national laboratory in new mexico , dated november 5 , 2012 , states that the research facility installed devices made by h3c technologies co. , based in hangzhou , china , according to a copy seen by reuters . h3c began as a joint venture between china 's huawei technologies co. and 3com corp. , a u.s. tech firm , and was once called huawei-3com . hewlett packard co. acquired the firm in 2010 . the discovery raises concerns about procurement practices by u.s. departments responsible for national security . the u.s. government and congress have raised concerns about huawei and its alleged ties to the chinese military and government . the company , the world 's second-largest telecommunications equipment maker , denies its products pose any security risk or that the chinese military influences its business . h3c technologies was formed as joint-venture between huawei technologies , a chinese company previously barred from owning an american corporation because of the risk to america 's national security . under scrutiny : house intelligence committee chairman mike rogers , r-mich. , left , discuss a year-long probe of china 's two leading tech firms , huawei technologies ltd. and zte corp . the intelligence committee 's ranking democrat , rep. c.a.  dutch  ruppersberger , -lrb- pictured on right -rrb- talks about a report that says , among things , that huawe technologies , ` can not be trusted ' switches are used to manage data traffic on computer networks . the exact number of chinese-made switches installed at los alamos , how or when they were acquired , and whether they were placed in sensitive systems or pose any security risks , remains unclear . the laboratory - where the first atomic bomb was designed - is responsible for maintaining america 's arsenal of nuclear weapons . a spokesman for the los alamos lab referred inquiries to the department of energy 's national nuclear security administration , or nnsa , which declined to comment . no risk : huawei 's vice president of external affairs william plummer has argued that h3c products contain no security risks to the united states . the november 5 letter seen by reuters was written by the acting chief information officer at the los alamos lab and addressed to the nnsa 's assistant manager for safeguards and security . it states that in october a network engineer at the lab - who the letter does not identify - alerted officials that h3c devices ` were beginning to be installed in ' its networks . the letter says a working group of specialists , some from the lab 's counter intelligence unit , began investigating , ` focusing on sensitive networks . ' the lab ` determined that a small number of the devices installed in one network were h3c devices . two devices used in isolated cases were promptly replaced , ' the letter states . the letter suggests other h3c devices may still be installed . it states that the lab was investigating ` replacing any remaining h3c network switch devices as quickly as possible , ' including ` older switches ' in  both sensitive and unclassified networks as part of the normal life-cycle maintenance effort . ' the letter adds that the lab was conducting a formal assessment to determine ` any potential risk associated with any h3c devices that may remain in service until replacements can be obtained . ' ` we would like to emphasize that -lrb- los alamos -rrb- has taken this issue seriously , and implemented expeditious and proactive steps to address it , ' the letter states . on the record : plummer speaks to reporters after a house intelligence committee meeting concerning the committee 's report on the security threat posed by chinese telecom companies to u.s. national security . corporate filings show huawei sold its stake in h3c to 3com in 2007 . nevertheless , h3c 's website still describes huawei as one of its ` global strategic partners ' and states it is working with it ` to deliver advanced , cost-efficient and environmental-friendly products . ' the los alamos letter appears to have been written in response to a request last year by the house armed services committee for the department of energy -lrb- doe -rrb- to report on any ` supply chain risks . ' in its request , the committee said it was concerned by a government accountability office report last year that found a number of national security-related departments had not taken appropriate measures to guard against risks posed by their computer-equipment suppliers . the report said federal agencies are not required to track whether any of their telecoms networks contain foreign-developed products . the house armed services committee -lrb- pictured -rrb- has asked the department of energy to evaluate whether it , or any of its major contractors , were using technology produced by huawei . the armed services committee specifically asked the doe to evaluate whether it , or any of its major contractors , were using technology produced by huawei or zte corp , another chinese telecoms equipment maker . zte corp denies its products pose any security risk . in 2008 , huawei and private equity firm bain capital were forced to give up their bid for 3com after a u.s. panel rejected the deal because of national security concerns . three years later , huawei abandoned its acquisition of some assets from u.s. server technology firm 3leaf , bowing to pressure from the committee on foreign investment in the united states . the committee evaluates whether foreign control of a u.s. business poses national security risks . much at risk : the chinese-made switches were discovered in the network infrastructure of los alamos national laboratory , which manages america 's arsenal of nuclear weapons . in october , the house intelligence committee issued an investigative report that recommended u.s. government systems should not include huawei or zte components . the report said that based on classified and unclassified information , huawei and zte ` can not be trusted to be free of foreign state influence ' and pose ' a security threat to the united states and to our systems . ' william plummer , huawei 's vice president of external affairs in washington , said in an email to reuters : ` there has never been a shred of substantive proof that huawei gear is any less secure than that of our competitors , all of which rely on common global standards , supply chains , coding and manufacturing . ` blackballing legitimate multinationals based on country of origin is reckless , both in terms of fostering a dangerously false sense of cyber-security and in threatening the free and fair global trading system that the u.s. has championed for the last 60-plus years . ' he referred questions about h3c products to hewlett packard . an hp spokesman said huawei no longer designs any h3c hardware and that the company ` became independent operationally ... from huawei ' several years prior to hp 's acquisition of it . he added that hp 's networking division  has considerable resources dedicated to compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements involving system security , global trade and customer privacy . ", "summary": " so-called network switches are used to manage data traffic on computer networks .   los alamos national laboratory manages america 's arsenal of nuclear weapons .   exact number of the switches within the labor 's network infrastructure is unknown .   at least two chinese-made ` components ' removed from the network .   chinese manufacturer insists its products pose no security threat to the u.s.   chinese company barred from buying u.s. corporation with officials citing national security risks .   house intelligence committee report says chinese manufacturer ` can not be trusted ' "}
