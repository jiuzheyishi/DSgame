{"text": "a new hampshire apartment complex is mandating that residents submit pet dna samples . why ? to check if any of them are abandoning their dogs ' waste on the property .  ninety-eight percent do what they 're suppose to do ,  property manager debbie violette said of her residents with dogs ,  but there are some that do n't and you do n't know who that is . that 'd be pretty foolish if they did that right in front of me .  timberwood commons in lebanon , new hampshire , says it is among a growing number of apartment complexes implementing pooprints . that 's a program that matches samples of unclaimed dog waste to dna collected through pets ' mandatory mouth swabs in the hope of imposing greater responsibility among pet owners . violette says her violators will first receive a warning if caught , paying a $ 60 fee to cover the dna costs . however , if it happens again , it 's a lease violation and the offender will be forced to live somewhere else .  they have a choice to rent here or not . if you live in that community you have to live by those rules and regulations ,  violette said .  it 's a privilege .  she said she got the idea from a residential community in boston . eric mayer , director of franchise development with biopet vet lab , says the program is currently assisting rental complexes in multiple states , with increasing interest as far away as canada and germany . the tests bought through pooprints , a subsidiary of biopet vet lab in knoxville , tennessee , match the dna already captured to a sample of each pet 's waste . poop that is n't scooped can then be analyzed . according to mayer , apartment complexes that impose a pet deposit or fee on residents could potentially cover the testing costs incurred with the initial dna registration . the cost of the dna analysis each time a sample is tested could theoretically be paid through a fee on convicted freeloaders . it 's a service violette admits to be potentially costly , but with more than 30 dogs on her property , some as large as a st. bernard ,  it 's really not about the money for us ,  she said ,  it 's about having a nice place to live .  and reaction has been positive , she said .  i did have one resident that thought it was completely over the top , who 's not a pet owner ,  violette said . but after considering the possibility of stepping in a mess he himself did n't leave behind ,  he changed his mind ,  she said . violette sees long-term benefits in the pooprints system , saying it could reunite lost pets and owners , especially in the aftermath of a natural disaster . mayer says he remains focused on both environmental and human health benefits through the system .  it 's a huge problem with growing environmental impact ,  mayer said of the waste . the pooprints website estimates a single pet creates 276 pounds of waste per year .  we want people to be responsible and not leave things behind . down the drain means it 's going into your lakes , rivers and streams ,  he added .", "summary": " apartment complexes use pooprints for residents who do n't always scoop .   dna is taken from swab of dog 's mouth .   it 's then matched to a sample of their waste .
