{"text": "most of the syrian fighters waging a guerrilla war against the regime of president bashar al-assad are ill equipped -- short on guns , ammunition and with no heavy weapons . but while peaceful opposition to the government has grown in the city of homs since the summer , military defectors , who call themselves the free syrian army , have now managed to kick al-assad 's forces out of one neighborhood and hold the area . baba amr is now possibly the first place in syria beyond government control . one freelance journalist and filmmaker -- who is not named for his own security -- has just left homs , and cnn is showcasing what he saw on the front lines of a city at war . view his images in high-res . he said fighters opposed to al-assad took him into a house , where their men -- one of whom had managed to take a rifle with a precision scope with him when he defected -- were engaged in a shootout with snipers from the syrian military . read how snipers rule the streets . they told him what was motivating them in their struggle against overwhelming force .  we might not have much ammunition ,  one fighter said .  but we are fighting for our liberty and those guys are fighting for money .  the men introduced him to one of their leaders , abdul razzaq tlas , who was one of the few willing to be identified . he was a first lieutenant in al-assad 's army before defecting and his uncle is a former syrian defense minister . he described why he decided to join the defectors .  we got orders in the army that went against my oath as a soldier . i had sworn to protect civilians . but when i saw what the government forces were doing to the people i defected , on june 2 .  people like abdul razzaq tlas are heroes for the people of baba amr and he was cheered at a recent anti-government demonstration . but baba amr is surrounded by the syrian military , and constantly shelled by tanks and artillery . at a meeting in a safe house abdul razzaq tlas insists that even though al-assad has not used his air force against the uprising , only a no-fly zone imposed by the international community could help the rebels win .  we are in contact with soldiers who are in the army .  they say  a no fly zone is essential to prevent them from getting bombed if they defect .  for now the men of the free syrian army smuggle fighters in and out of the neighborhood they control , evading government checkpoints . at night , they search everyone entering and leaving their area to stop government death squads , the so-called shabiyah , from entering .  the street you see over there is controlled by the shabiya ,  said one militia member .  they are known to kidnap our woman and childen . we try to prevent this . when strangers come here we stop and search them .  the people of this part of homs are not afraid to take to the streets -- there are regular night-time rallies -- but after months of casualties , they have long lost their faith in non-violent protest . in baba amr , many believe that real change in syria will only come from the barrel of a gun .", "summary": " syrian defectors kick president al-assad 's forces out of one neighborhood in homs .   one journalist has just left homs , and cnn is showcasing what he saw on front lines .   they told him what was motivating them in their struggle against overwhelming force .   in baba amr , many believe real change in syria will only come from barrel of gun .
