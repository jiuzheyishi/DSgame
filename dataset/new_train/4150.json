{"text": "the smell of incense burning and the sound of deep-throated chants greet you at the gate of one of kathmandu 's massive stupas , a buddhist holy place where tibetans gather to pray . for decades , nepal has been a safe haven for tibetans who escape china . but tibetan activists say their people 's peaceful existence here is being disturbed because of china 's growing influence in nepal . nepali-born tibetan sonam choden has lived in nepal her whole life , hearing stories from her parents about how her grandparents were killed by the chinese . she says she is overwhelmed with frustration over how tibetans are now being treated in nepal .  since china has given nepal a lot of money , the nepali government does n't let tibetans do much of anything . they do n't let us gather to mourn , or protest . they even pick up tibetans while they are walking on the street and send them to jail ,  sonam choden alleged . nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world , sandwiched between two behemoths : india and china . traditionally , india has had the biggest influence in nepal . but china 's influence is growing . it recently doubled its annual aid to nepal . china is also building a railway linking the countries and building roads in nepal , which is in desperate need of infrastructure . nepal 's prime minister , baburam bhattarai , said china 's biggest interest in nepal is the tibetan issue . but he said he and chinese premier wen jiabao have not specifically discussed repatriating tibetans who have escaped to nepal . in terms of tibetan refugees in his country , the prime minister said ,  we are not allowing anti-china or anti-indian sentiment on our soil , as per international law .  but he denies there is a crackdown on refugees ' rights . as china becomes a bigger factor in nepal , refugees from neighboring tibet say they are being squeezed . choden is one of the few tibetans willing to talk openly about what is happening . inside her home , she worships the dalai lama , the tibetan spiritual leader loathed by china and revered as a living god by many tibetans . she also speaks her mind on issues involving tibet and has paid a price for it .  since 2008 i went to jail many times , 30 times at least ,  choden said . at home , she keeps a picture of herself being lifted off the ground by several nepali police during a protest in 2008 . she says that 's the year things began changing for the worse for tibetans . others , including some nepalese citizens , say the same thing in hushed whispers . 2008 was the year of the uprising in tibet and subsequent crackdown by chinese authorities on tibetans , which sparked protests across the world and came as beijing prepared to host the olympic games . at one of the official nepal-china border crossings , trade is the main order of business . nepali citizens freely travel to china , and as we found out , the chinese freely cross into nepal too -- and enforce their rules on nepal 's territory . we were approached by several men in plain clothes , who put their hands over the camera as we tried to film on the border . the men were speaking chinese to one another and were clearly on the nepalese side of the border . nepal 's border police were also there . their security forces had warned us that if the uniformed chinese police came over the bridge , we 'd better watch out because our camera would likely get broken . however , the nepalese forces did n't try to stop us from filming ; nor did they stop the chinese men from following us deep into nepal 's territory . the same men later followed us far into the streets of the nepal border village , as we tried to talk to people there . we left unharmed and with all our equipment intact . the nepalese home ministry declined to comment on issues involving tibet . but one border police inspector who did not want to be identified told us above all else , china 's main interest in nepal is the tibetan issue . for more than 20 years , the nepalese government and the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- has had an informal agreement when it comes to tibetans who make it to nepal with or without documentation . the nepalese government agrees to allow tibetans transit through nepal to india , while unhcr agrees to facilitate that . the current representative in nepal says the government has not rescinded that agreement and officials continue to process newly arrived tibetans to help usher them legally to india . the numbers of tibetans coming to nepal has declined dramatically since 2008 , even as reports of unrest and self-immolations by protesting tibetans continue to leak out of tibet . stephane jaquemet , the unhcr representative in nepal , said annually between 2,000 and 3,000 people crossed over in the late 1990s and early 2000s .  it now has been 800 for the last three four years ,  jaquemet said , adding that it 's not clear why the numbers have declined . tibetan refugees say they know why . china is exerting pressure on nepal so that it is no longer a place of refuge for those trying to escape chinese rule , they say . a chinese foreign ministry spokesman said  nepal sticks to the one-china policy  and considers tibet a part of china .  we will not allow any party to conduct anti-china policies in nepal ,  spokesman hong lei said .  china appreciates that . china believes and hopes that nepal will continue to adhere to that commitment in the future .
