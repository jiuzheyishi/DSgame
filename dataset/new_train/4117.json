{"text": "anniversaries are useful moments to pause and reflect . for the 70th anniversary of d-day and subsequent campaign in northern france , it is also an opportunity to look at the past in detail and ask how much of what we think we know is true and how much is well-entrenched myth . not only is it more interesting , it is also of greater worth as we plan for the future and pray there will never be a conflict like world war ii again . 1 . myth : d-day was predominantly an american operation . reality : for many people , d-day is defined by the bloodshed at omaha -- the codename for one of the five beaches where allied forces landed -- and the american airborne drops . even in germany , the perception is still that d-day was a largely american show ; in the recent german tv mini-series ,  generation war ,  there was a reference to the  american landings  in france . but despite  band of brothers ,  despite  saving private ryan ,  despite those 11 photographs taken by robert capa in the swell on that morning of june 6 1944 , d-day was not a predominantly american effort . rather , it was an allied effort with , if anything , britain taking the lead . yes , gen. dwight d. eisenhower , the supreme allied commander , was american , but his deputy , air chief marshal sir arthur tedder was british , as were all three service chiefs . air marshal sir arthur  mary  coningham , commander of the tactical air forces , was also british . the plan for operation overlord -- as d-day was codenamed -- was largely that of gen. bernard montgomery , the land force commander . the royal navy had overall responsibility for operation neptune , the naval plan . of the 1,213 warships involved , 200 were american and 892 were british ; of the 4,126 landing craft involved , 805 were american and 3,261 were british . share your family 's d-day stories . indeed , 31 % of all u.s. supplies used during d-day came directly from britain , while two-thirds of the 12,000 aircraft involved were also british , as were two-thirds of those that landed in occupied france . despite the initial slaughter at omaha , casualties across the american and british beaches were much the same . this is not to belittle the u.s. effort but rather to add context and a wider , 360-degree view . history needs to teach as well as entertain . 2 . myth : american forces were ill-prepared . reality : by the end of world war ii the united states had the best armed services in the world . the 77-day normandy campaign did much to help them reach this point . northern france was a showcase for american tactical and operational flexibility . at the start of the campaign , the americans found themselves fighting through the norman  bocage ,  an area of small fields lined with thick , raised hedgerows and narrow , sunken lanes . they had n't trained for this ; instead they expected that the germans would quickly retreat after a successful allied landing . for the germans , the bocage offered cover and ambush opportunities for mortar teams and machine guns . even the american 30-ton sherman tanks could n't get through these hedgerows . then a u.s. sergeant came up with the ingenious solution of attaching a hedge-cutting tool built from german beach obstacles to the front of a sherman . gen. omar bradley , the u.s. first army commander , was impressed ; within a fortnight , the device had been fitted to 60 % of all u.s. shermans in normandy . this was but one example . during the campaign huge developments also were made in close air support , as well as in coordination between infantry , artillery and armor . medical services advanced so much that one in four casualties returned to the battlefield after treatment , remarkable for 1944 . 3 . myth : the allies became bogged down in normandy . reality : in the pre-invasion estimates for the normandy campaign , the allies expected to be roughly 50 miles inland after 17 days , based on german retreats in north africa and italy . but adolf hitler ordered his forces to fight as close to the french coast as possible and not give an inch . on paper it seemed that the allies were n't making much progress , but in reality the german strategy worked to the allies ' advantage as they pounded the enemy with offshore naval guns . for by 1944 the allies had realized that german tactics -- which dated back more than 100 years -- were rigidly predictable . striking back once the enemy had overextended itself was central to german dna throughout world war ii . the allies soon realized that this penchant for counterattack meant that the germans would eventually move into the open and get hammered . by the end of the normandy campaign the germans were hemorrhaging men and machines , with two armies all but destroyed . true , a handful of germans did escape the attempted encirclement around falaise , but it was still a massive allied victory . in the rapid advance that followed , the allies moved more quickly than germans had in the opposite direction four years before , during the invasion of france . 4 . myth : german soldiers were better trained than their allied counterparts . reality : at the start of world war ii the best german units were more than a match for their allied opposition -- but by 1944 that had changed radically . there were a few exceptions , such as the panzer lehr , but come d-day most german units were not as well trained as the allies . some allied units in normandy had been preparing for four years for this campaign . in contrast , many german troops had had little more than a few weeks ' notice . the german ad hoc battle groups known as kampfgruppen are traditionally regarded as showcasing tactical flexibility , but even these were borne of extreme shortages and desperation toward the end of the war . the german paratroopers , or fallschirmjäger , were acknowledged to be among the best of their armed forces , yet one veteran i interviewed recalled how he had barely any training , save a few route marches and practice at laying mines . he never trained with a tank , had no transport and had to march 200 miles from brittany when sent to the front . his case was not atypical : all infantry divisions in normandy were expected to move by either foot or horse-drawn cart . the veteran i spoke to reached saint-lô , a major normandy town , on june 12 with a company of 120 men . when he was captured on august 19 he was one of just nine men still standing . the germans had a doctrine during world war ii called auftragstaktik -- best described as the ability to use one 's initiative -- which has been hailed as what set their soldiers apart . but the paratrooper i spoke to knew nothing of it . by that stage of the war , german training was so skimpy that it was impossible to implement . 5 . myth : the germans had stronger tactical skills . reality : the dogged determination of the germans to fight during d-day is often confused with tactical skill . it should n't . the best analogy is with more recent conflicts like afghanistan or even vietnam , when western forces had the best training and kit yet struggled to defeat a massively inferior enemy . as the taliban have shown , it is very difficult to completely defeat your enemy if they do n't want to be defeated . the only way to do that is to kill them all . this is why the germans took so long to be defeated in normandy and , subsequently , despite a lack of training , they were still a very dangerous and deadly enemy with plenty of powerful weapons and a fierce determination to keep fighting . this was for a number of reasons : nazi indoctrination , a profound sense of duty and the threat of execution for deserters . in world war i the germans executed 48 men for desertion ; during world war ii that figure rose to 30,000 . 6 . myth : america and britain got off lightly in world war ii . reality : allied frontline troops suffered horrifically during world war ii . democracies such as britain and america tried to achieve victory with as few casualties as possible . for the most part , they did this very successfully using technology and machinery to shield lives wherever they could . however , short distances still had to be won by the infantry , tank units and artillery . although technology meant the allies needed fewer forces than a generation earlier , those in the firing line still pulled the very short straw . losses to frontline troops were proportionally worse during the 77-day normandy campaign than they were during the major battles along the western front during world war i. d-day veteran : i do n't want them to be forgotten .", "summary": " d-day signalled the start of the campaign which ended world war ii in europe .   many myths have subsequently developed about the events in normandy , says historian .   james holland says operation overlord was not just an american venture .   he also argues that german soldiers were not better trained than the allies .
