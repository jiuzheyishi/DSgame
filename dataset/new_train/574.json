{"text": "an antioxidant supplement may be an effective therapy for autism , according to scientists . the antioxidant - called n-acetylcysteine , or nac - lowers irritability in children with autism and also reduces their repetitive behaviour patterns . irritability affects 60 to 70 per cent of children with autism . future treatment ? an antioxidant called n-acetylcysteine , or nac , lowers irritability in children with autism and also reduces their repetitive behaviour . researchers at stanford university school of medicine and lucile packard children 's hospital studied 31 children with the disorder . lead researcher dr antonio hardan said : ` we 're not talking about mild things - this is throwing , kicking , hitting , the child needing to be restrained . ` it can affect learning , vocational activities and the child 's ability to participate in autism therapies . ' the study tested children with . autism ages 3 to 12 . they were physically healthy and were not planning . any changes in their established autism treatments during the trial . in a double-blind study design , children received nac or a placebo for 12 weeks . the nac used was a pharmaceutical-grade preparation donated by the neutraceutical manufacturer bioadvantex pharma . subjects were evaluated before the . trial began and every four weeks during the study using several . standardised surveys that measure problem behaviours , social behaviours , . autistic preoccupations and drug side effects . during the 12-week trial , nac . treatment decreased irritability scores from 13.1 to 7.2 on the aberrant . behaviour checklist , a widely used clinical scale for assessing . irritability . the change is not as large as that seen in children taking antipsychotics . ` but this is still a potentially valuable tool to have before jumping on these big guns , dr hardan said . in addition , according to two . standardised measures of autism mannerisms and stereotypic behaviour , . children taking nac showed a decrease in repetitive and stereotyped . behaviours . finding new medications to treat autism and its symptoms is a high priority for researchers . currently , irritability , mood swings and aggression , all of which are considered associated features of autism , are treated with second-generation antipsychotics . but these drugs cause significant side effects , including weight gain , involuntary motor movements and metabolic syndrome , which increases diabetes risk . by contrast , the side effects of nac are generally mild , with gastrointestinal problems such as constipation , nausea , diarrhoea and decreased appetite being the most common . the state of drug treatments for autism 's core features , such as social deficits , language impairment and repetitive behaviours , is also a major problem . dr hardan said : ` today , in 2012 , we have no effective medication to treat repetitive behaviour such as hand flapping or any other core features of autism . ' the researchers believe that nac could be the first medication available to treat repetitive behaviour in autism - if the findings hold up when scrutinised further . ` one of the reasons i wanted to do this trial was that nac is being used by community practitioners who focus on alternative , non-traditional therapies , ' hardan said . ` but there is no strong scientific evidence to support these interventions . somebody needs to look at them . ' dr hardan cautioned that the nac for sale as a dietary supplement at chemists differs in some important respects from the individually packaged doses of pharmaceutical-grade nac used in the study , and that the over-the-counter version may not produce the same results . he said : ` when you open the bottle from the drugstore and expose the pills to air and sunlight , it gets oxidised and becomes less effective . ' although the study did not test how nac works , the researchers speculated on two possible mechanisms of action . firstly , nac increases the capacity of the body 's main antioxidant network , which some previous studies have suggested is deficient in autism . in addition , other research has suggested that autism is related to an imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain . nac can modulate the glutamatergic family of excitatory neurotransmitters , which might be useful in autism . the scientists are now applying for funding to conduct a large trial in which they hope to replicate their findings . dr hardan said : ` this was a pilot study . final conclusions can not be made before we do a larger trial . ' stanford university is filing a . patent for the use of nac in autism , and one of the study authors has a . financial stake in a company that makes and sells the nac used in the . trial . the researchers said that the . findings must be confirmed in a larger trial before nac can be . recommended for children with autism . the study appears in biological psychiatry .", "summary": " scientists believe n-acetylcysteine , or nac , could be an effective therapy for autistic children .
