{"text": "two of saudi arabia 's best-known female advocates for lifting the ban on women driving were detained on friday after being caught behind the wheel in the country 's capital . aziza al-yousef , who was driving the car , and her passenger , eman al-nafjan , tell cnn they were pulled over and spent a few hours at a police station in riyadh until being released into the custody of their respective husbands . al-nafjan , one of saudi arabia 's most prominent bloggers , and one of the organizers of the popular october 26 women 's driving campaign , said she decided to go for a spin with al-yousef to attract more attention to her cause .  we were looking for the police . we drove by the police station on purpose ,  she explained , adding how she welcomed the detention . despite repeated attempts , cnn has been unable to reach riyadh police for comment . al-yousef and al-nafjan , who tweets as  saudiwoman ,  say they have grown tired of waiting for the saudi government to allow women to drive .  we are sick and tired of waiting to be given our rights ,  al-yousef told cnn .  it 's about time to take our rights .  al-yousef has driven before and was glad to get behind the wheel again on friday but says she was not deliberately looking to be detained by the police .  in a way it is good for the cause because you 'll the keep the issue in the mind of people ,  said al-yousef .  however , some people might understand wrongly that we 're confronting the government and that might slow the process .  why saudi arabia ca n't ban women from driving forever . al-yousef was initially concerned she and al-nafjan might go to jail , citing the presence of traffic police , regular police and secret police who were called to the scene . she says the mood of the police had lightened substantially by the time she and al-nafjan reached the station . when her husband came for her , he was asked to sign a statement pledging al-yousef would not drive again . al-yousef says her husband jokingly asked ,  how can i do that ? i ca n't prevent her from driving . only god can do that ,  before signing . she was then released . the issue of women driving is a particularly sensitive and controversial one in saudi arabia , the last country on earth where females do n't have that right . in recent years , though , more women have challenged the government , urging officials to overturn the ban and taking to streets in remarkable displays of civil disobedience . although women are not allowed to drive in the ultraconservative kingdom , there is , in fact , no law barring them from doing so . but religious edicts are often interpreted to enforce the prohibition .  we have tried all the legal channels ,  explained al-nafjan .  the government keeps promising us that all we have to do is be patient and quiet , and we 'll eventually get the right to drive . officials keep saying the women driving issue is one for saudi society to decide . we wanted to prove that really is n't the case and that the only people who really stop us is the police .  in may 2011 , manal al-sharif was jailed for more than a week after posting a video of herself driving in saudi arabia online . she quickly became a hero to many and inspired dozens of women to drive throughout the streets of various cities in june of that year . more recently , in september , a website for the october 26 women 's driving campaign launched , and within a few weeks , tens of thousands had signed an online petition calling for an end to the driving ban for women in saudi arabia . as october 26 approached , numerous women filmed themselves driving in the conservative kingdom and uploaded those clips to sites like youtube . opinion : give saudi women the right to drive . in the weeks leading up to october 26 , one saudi cleric gave an interview in which he warned that saudi women who drove risked damaging their ovaries . on october 24 , the country 's interior ministry issued a statement telling women to stay off the streets . despite strong opposition by conservative quarters in the kingdom , where a puritanical strain of islam is practiced , october 26 saw dozens of women taking to the streets and driving . the campaign 's backers insist the movement is ongoing and has been a success thus far , while its critics say it has failed . last week , al-yousef had an audience with saudi arabia 's interior minister , prince mohammed bin nayef , via teleconference . she conveyed a message on behalf of the growing number of women and men calling for an end to the driving ban . al-yousef was told the matter was now in the hands of saudi king abdullah , considered a cautious reformer .  i think it might have been a good thing ,  said al-yousef .  before the government had said the driving issue was a societal issue . but now that is not an issue anymore . the good thing is now we know clearly that society is not the decision maker .  al-yousef added :  we are trying to find a way to reach the king now . we have a letter signed by 3,000-plus people asking for permission to allow women to drive , and we want to find a way to get that letter to the king .  al-nafjan , who was detained before for the very same offense , says she will continue pushing the envelope , even if that gets her into legal hot water .  i would n't mind if they prosecuted me ,  she says .  i think it will further the cause . it 's good publicity for the cause -- to be prosecuted for being a passenger in a car driven by a woman . you ca n't get more medieval .
