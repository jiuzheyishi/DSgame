{"text": "a group of neanderthals killed and ate their fellow ancient humans , including young children , scientists have found . using modern forensics techniques , including dna analysis , the researchers found that 12 neanderthals , all from the same family , had been eaten by their peers . in research presented to the royal society in london , biologist carles lalueza-fox , said that the bones of the victims had been cracked open to extract the marrow , while the skulls were opened so brains and tongues could be eaten . butchered : scientists have found that a family of neanderthals were killed and eaten by their fellow ancient humans -lrb- file picture -rrb- . remains , discovered at the el sidr√≥n cave system , near asturias , in north western spain , included the bones of three female and three male adults , three teenage boys and three children aged between two and nine-years-old . ` all had been butchered , ' mr lalueza-fox told the royal society on thursday , according to the sunday times . ` it must have been a big feast . we think neanderthal groups were . about 10-12 strong so this may have been a complete family group , . although someone may have got away . ' discovery : the neanderthal remains were discovered accidentally at el sidron in northern spain in 1994 . researchers had considered whether the cannibalised neanderthals had been killed by modern humans , although this was ruled out when dating techniques revealed that the remains pre-dated homo-sapiens in spain by thousands of years . by analysing the stone tools used by the killers the scientists found that they had probably come from a few miles away , leading them to conclude that the culprits were probably neanderthals from a neighbouring group . revealed : scientists used the most recent scientific advances , including dna sequencing , to find out details such as the hair colour of the neanderthals . pictured is a model of a neanderthal man . ' i would guess they were killed in . winter when food was short . there is no evidence of any fire so they . were eaten raw immediately and every bit of meat was consumed . they even . cut around the mandibles of the jaw to extract the tongues , ' said mr . lalueza-fox . he said that as neanderthals lived in smaller groups this may have made them liable to eat each other when no other food sources could be found , rather than modern humans who lived in larger groups and worked together in tougher times . the remains were accidentally discovered by cave explorers in 1994 , with systematic excavations starting in 2000 . in total 13 individuals have been retrieved in a painstaking operation designed to prevent contamination of the remains with modern human dna . due to the cold temperatures in the cave , which is 60ft underground , and its remote location , the neanderthals dna was preserved for centuries , and had not come into contact with the dna of other neanderthals , animals , or humans . . the bones were found mixed up with gravel and mud in a small cave gallery , some 700ft from the entrance . mr lalueza-fox , of the institute of evolutionary biology in barcelona , said he believed the victims had been slaughtered in a rock shelter situated above where the remains were found , their flesh stripped from the bones , which were then dumped . he said that a powerful storm had then washed the bones , stone tools and sediments down a gap in the rock and into the cave where they were eventually discovered . mr lalueza-fox was able to use the most recent scientific advances , including dna sequencing , to see reconstruct the neanderthals ' genes , leading to information being uncovered about their hair colour and blood group .", "summary": " scientists used modern forensic techniques to analyse ancient remains .   bones were discovered in a deep cave , and had been stripped of meat .   neanderthal family , including a child of two , were killed and eaten .   killers believed to be from a neighbouring tribe .
