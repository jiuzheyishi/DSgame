{"text": "benjamin scot miller and his wife , lyndsey , did n't expect to be parents on july 16 , 2012 . the ohio couple 's son was n't due for another 3Ã‚ 1/2 months . but the cramps that lyndsey felt that day at work were actually contractions . doctors could not stop the baby from being born that day . ward miles miller was a delicate 12 inches long . he weighed 1 pound , 13 ounces , but soon dropped to 1 pound 7 ounces .  one doctor told us straight up the first night that there was a 50/50 chance that he would be normal ,  said benjamin miller , a professional photographer .  we definitely prayed and prayed .  miller captured some of the key moments in ward 's journey and stitched them together in a video running almost seven minutes long , now hugely popular on vimeo . watch the video of ward 's first year . miller 's footage shows how lyndsey miller first held her son , at 4 days old , when ward was covered in tubes and cords . hospital staff helped position the baby and the medical equipment so he could nestle against his mother 's chest . in the video , ward 's mother looks straight at the camera and smiles , gently stroking the baby , then suddenly tilts her head down and covers her mouth with her hand in a flood of tearful emotion . the early birth was n't ward 's only challenge . at 10 days old , a scan revealed blood in his brain tissue , meaning blood had gotten in there at some point . his father remembers crying and praying the whole way to the hospital that day .  and then you get there and you see him , and he 's laying there . he 's still the same old self ,  he said .  we just felt so bad . he has no control over this . it 's not his fault .  over time , the bleed did n't grow , and the blood was slowly reabsorbed by the brain . the problem has not persisted . ward finally got to go home after spending more than 100 days in the nicu at nationwide children 's hospital in columbus , ohio .  home  is displayed in large capital letters in the video .  when we finally brought him home , it was amazing ,  miller said .  that was the day . everything was leading up to that day , and to have him there was amazing . it was how it was supposed to be from the get-go . we had to wait 107 days before we could experience that , so it was just amazing .  miller had originally wanted to prepare a video for his son 's first birthday , but after that day went by , he found the next best opportunity : october 31 , the anniversary of ward 's homecoming and one day before lyndsey 's birthday . the video found a large audience online ; it 's been watched more than 3.6 million times .  it 's definitely spreading awareness about nicus ,  ward 's dad said .  people have no idea ... that there are these nicus with these babies holding on and parents scared out of their wits , and it 's going on every day all around the nation .  the main comments miller has been getting on the video are from other fathers who sharing their stories . miller is struck by how similar their tales are .  pretty much everyone is saying , like , ` that was me . this video could have been me . that is exactly what i went through , '  miller said . today , ward is technically 16 months old , but since he was n't supposed to be born until october 27 , 2012 , he seems just over a year old , miller said .  all the doctors who meet him and we say he was 15 weeks early , they just ca n't believe it ,  miller said .  he does n't even look like he was a preemie .  it 's possible that the brain bleeding could result in problems later on , miller said , but so far ward does n't need any speech or physical therapy .  he just had his 15-month developmental assessment , and he 's right on track with his age group ,  he said . the child has no major health issues except for one : an inflammation in his throat . he sometimes vomits once every two days , which may be related to an allergy , but the family is n't sure . they have  a great doctor  helping , though , miller said . ward has seen the video on his mother 's ipad and likes watching himself , miller said .  but yeah , he does n't understand it ,  miller said ,  and it 's not going to be until he 's probably 16 , 17 , 18 that it really sets in , what 's happened .
