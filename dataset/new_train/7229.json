{"text": "sonny carver , 11 , has been removed from school by his mother , sarah -lrb- both pictured -rrb- after she claims he was bullied for two years . a mother has removed her 11-year-old son from school after she claims he was subjected to a two-year campaign of bullying because he has ginger hair . sarah carver has called in police over the treatment she claims year six pupil sonny has suffered because of his hair colour . she said her son had regularly returned home from cobholm primary in great yarmouth , with scratches and bruises and cruel classmates called him ` ginger nut ' and ` a skank ' . one day she said he returned with a black eye and on another occasion had to wear his pe shorts after being dragged through a puddle , soaking his school uniform . the final straw came last month when she said sonny was attacked on his way home from school and a member of the public had to step in to save him . he was pinned against a wall and punched and a bicycle was ridden over his feet . worried ms carver , who had first alerted police last november , called them again after the incident . she had already taken sonny to a gp who told her he was ` depressed ' because of what he had been suffering . she has now moved him out the school and accused staff of failing to tackle the bullying . ms carver , 38 , a medical lab technician , said : ` as a parent you put your trust in the teachers when you send your children to school . you expect them to be looked after . ` it 's outrageous that sonny had to leave his friends behind and move to a different school and the boys that attacked him were not expelled or suspended even for just one day . ` the school have handled this so badly . i do n't want it to happen to another child . ' cobholm primary school in great yarmouth where it is claimed sonny carver was bullied . the school said it does not tolerate bullying and has a very strong anti-bullying policy . ms carver , a mother-of-three , added : ' i do n't know why the bullies chose to target sonny . ` they would call him a skank and ginger nut because of his hair colour - it was outrageous . ` his hair 's not bright orange , it is more of a strawberry blonde . ' i wonder whether it was because we did n't live close to the school so maybe they saw sonny as an outsider . ` but whatever their twisted reasons were there 's no excuse . ' i was so worried about him i took him to the gp and the doctor said he was depressed because of bullying . an 11-year-old boy should not be made to feel depressed . at first the worried parent urged her boy not to take any notice and ignore the playground yobs . but when sonny was pinned up against the wall and punched on his way home ms carver called in the police . ` no child should have to go through what he 's been through , especially when it 's affecting his mental state . ' i can not bear to imagine what sonny was going through being pinned up against a wall . he was helpless . ` i 'm so grateful to the member of public who got out and helped him and called the school . ' sonny has now moved to glebeland community primary school in toft monks near beccles , suffolk , where he started after half term . his mother said : ` sonny is really enjoying his new school . it is so lovely to see him with a smile on his face . ` we 're lucky that his new school has worked out and i am thankful as it could have been worse . ' norfolk police said they were investigating the reported attack on sonny on may 23 and a spokesman confirmed he was left with reddening to his face and arm . julie risby , head at cobholm primary school , said : ` we do not tolerate bullying in our school and have a very strong anti-bullying policy . ` staff are committed to the principle that bullying , in any form , is unacceptable and we investigate fully every reported incidence or allegation of bullying , as has happened in this case . ` we understand a complaint has been made to police following an alleged incident outside of school , and we are co-operating fully with their investigation . ' director of bullying charity kidscape claude knight said : ` schools are often in denial that they have a bullying problem . '  your child is over-sensitive  ,  you are an over-protective parent  ,  it 's just children being children  ,  ` we ca n't do anything unless we actually see it happening  are a few of the excuses used to avoid addressing the problem . ` the school has a duty of care to keep children safe ` in loco parentis ' , they should have an anti-bullying policy by law and parents have a right to ask for a copy , to find out how the bullying will be resolved .
