' astle 's family will be at the house of commons on monday , along with peter and carol robinson , whose 14-year-old son ben died in 2011 after sustaining serious head injuries while playing rugby but being allowed to play on . ` if anyone present at the ground that day had understood the risks associated with concussion ben would still be alive today , ' his father said . ` it was ben 's 18th birthday last week but instead of buying him a birthday cake i sent flowers to his grave .
