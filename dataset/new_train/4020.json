{"text": "ahead of a town hall meeting tuesday night , ferguson 's mayor said the aftermath of the shooting death of michael brown helped open the eyes of city officials to the town 's racial divide .  i think what it showed was ... even though i always knew again that african-americans had experiences that were frustrating , definitely frustrating , many of that never bubbled to the surface . so i think what really opened my eyes was how significant that can be for many people ,  mayor james knowles said . police chief thomas jackson echoed the mayor 's sentiment .  the things that have bubbled up since the shooting have really made us sit up and take notice and realize that there is a lot more work to be done ,  jackson said . one of those things that need to be done is community outreach , jackson said ; it 's one of the steps that the police department and the local government need to take for ferguson to be more cohesive . protests erupted last month after ferguson officer darren wilson 's fatal shooting of unarmed 18-year-old michael brown . they devolved into nights of looting , vandalism and violence before the tenor of the protests eventually calmed . jackson has tried to reach out more to residents , sometimes going to the daily protests in the city streets . one of those trips did n't go well . after issuing an apology thursday , jackson went to dialogue with demonstrators , but not everyone was eager to hear from him .  if you are not resigning tonight , go home ,  said one man on a bullhorn . it was shortly after jackson agreed to walk and talk with the demonstrators that a scuffle broke out somewhere behind the chief , and officers moved in to make arrests . there was no indication that jackson was threatened , but he was quickly escorted inside a building . for several hours , police officers stood shoulder to shoulder in front of the police department with protesters a short distance away , some milling about and others chanting . on tuesday , jackson said he 'll still go down to the protests .  i do n't think it 's ever a mistake for me to engage people are trying to talk to me and my police department and my city ,  he said .  i think it 's important to keep those lines of communication open . so if some people want to turn it into a hostile situation , that 's their fault , not mine . but i wish it would have turned out better than it did .  the chief blamed outsiders for the trouble . last week , jackson said he would n't resign , and the mayor , who was re-elected in april , said tuesday that now is not the time for that kind of change .  we 're moving forward as a community . if we change up now , i do n't know that that is going to help us down the road ,  he said . the town hall meeting , which is closed to the media , comes two nights after the most recent violent protests . protests come to the police station . eight people were arrested outside the police department on sunday night when demonstrations grew violent again , police say . each was charged with failure to disperse and resisting arrest , lt. ron miesner of the missouri state highway patrol said . only one of those arrested was from ferguson ; the others were from elsewhere in the st. louis metropolitan area . three were from st. louis , one was from richmond heights , one was from florissant , one was from bridgeton , and one was homeless , he said . last week , the burning of a memorial near the site where brown was killed reignited the demonstrations . sunday night 's protests unfolded in front of the police station , about 2 miles from the five-lane drag that typically plays host to the demonstrations . although previous protests at the police station have been largely peaceful , some demonstrators among a crowd of about 150 people began throwing rocks and bottles at officers about 10 p.m. , according to cnn affiliate ktvi . no injuries were reported . the eight people arrested were taken to a nearby jail , booked and released , ktvi reported .", "summary": " ferguson mayor : shooting aftermath revealed the racial divide in the city .   police chief says he 'll continue to walk and talk with protesters .   protests erupted after ferguson officer darren wilson 's fatal shooting of unarmed michael brown .   city is holding a town hall that is closed to media tuesday night .
