{"text": "reader 's digest seems to be on life support , filing for bankruptcy protection this week for the second time in four years . but at one time , what 's now seen as grandma 's magazine was an influential and powerful force in politics and culture . when i began my book on the reader 's digest , people were incredulous .  but no one takes that seriously ,  they 'd say .  people only read it when they 're waiting to see the dentist .  yet , those who dismiss the magazine as trivial underestimate the digest 's impact on millions of americans ' view of the world . from its humble beginnings in 1922 , reader 's digest became the highest circulating general interest magazine in the united states , reaching more than 16 million readers a month . from 1938 on , the digest could be read in 17 languages . in the u.s. , reader 's digest had the highest subscription rate of any magazine except tv guide . reader 's digest started life not long after the emergence of the ussr . initially , the magazine was sympathetic to the russian revolution , seeing it as a movement against what it regarded as undemocratic , aristocratic european society . by the 1930s , however , it had identified the ussr with communism . later , it began to publish stories that portrayed the soviet state as the primary danger to post-world war ii america . the digest presented the u.s. and ussr as polar opposites . as well as running clearly political articles that explained international relations and threats to peace , the magazine 's ostensibly apolitical stories reinforced this image of two incompatible societies . descriptions of everyday life in america and the soviet union detailed how different americans were from russians , how different russians ' music was , their food , their sense of humor -- even russian sex lives were different . at the extreme , in 1981 a story about an american in siberia seemed to suggest biological differences when it reported the american 's body rejected a russian blood transfusion . these types of stories earned the digest a reputation as a leading voice in anti-communism . as it gained prominence , reader 's digest drew criticism . despite the publication 's determination to celebrate individual freedoms , it was accused of being nothing more than state propaganda . there were claims of cia funding and editorial control , especially in its foreign editions in latin america . whether these accusations were true or not , the magazine 's influence in popular culture could perhaps be seen as even more powerful and pernicious . as a digest , the magazine sought not to reflect the immediate news but issues and ideas of  lasting interest .  famously , ronald reagan was said to have a box full of digest articles that he had collected for reference . reader 's digest meant to provide readers with all of the information they needed to know about what was important in the world , what america 's role in the world should be and what they , as good citizens , should do to preserve the american way . it became a trusted source of news . in the days before electronic communication , it was perhaps the only source that many people , particularly those in rural areas , could access regularly . reader 's digest presented itself as a guardian of american morality and values . in june 1960 , a reader 's digest advertisement quoted president dwight d. eisenhower as saying ,  our magazines are a leading force for moral and cultural growth in our country and one of the surest guarantees of an informed public .  exactly what the relationship was between reader 's digest and state foreign policy is unclear , but its role in encouraging american readers to think about and actively engage in world affairs is beyond doubt . in the february 1969 issue , apparently fearing a lack of support for the vietnam war , reader 's digest launched a  fly this flag proudly  campaign , inserting flag decals into the 18 million copies of the magazine . a follow-up survey indicated that 78 % of readers had detached the flag , and half of those people had put it to use . a few years earlier , an article on how brazil resisted a communist takeover was deemed to contain such  vital , useful information for every nation menaced by communist subversion  that readers were encouraged to send it -- and free reprints -- to friends abroad , or to place it into  the hands of concerned people -lsb- whom readers -rsb- may meet  on vacation . when relations with the ussr began to thaw , the digest feared that americans were overlooking the danger presented by the soviets . during detente and the beginnings of the end of the cold war , articles warned readers not to trust those who suggested that the soviets could change . the fall of the berlin wall heralded a collapse of the digest 's moral certainty about the difference between america and its old enemy . perhaps the decline of reader 's digest 's fortunes was inevitable with the longer-term social and political influences of 60s counterculture , the failure of general interest magazines , the rise of global media targeted at specific niches and the advent of the internet . but of equal importance was the end of the soviet threat : with the fall of its arch enemy , the evil empire , there was no mirror against which it could present an alternative image of america and its historic mission .", "summary": " joanne sharp : reader 's digest once had a huge role in shaping opinion .   sharp : digest propagated cold war view that ussr was a primary danger to american way .   reader 's digest was hugely popular , she says , but critics called it state propaganda .   sharp : it declined with the end of general interest magazines and fear of the evil empire .
