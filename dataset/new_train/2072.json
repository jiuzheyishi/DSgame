{"text": "after days of intense backlash from users over changes to its terms of service and privacy policy , photo-sharing service instagram has backtracked . on thursday , instagram co-founder kevin systrom said the company was switching one section of its updated terms of service back to its original text .  because of the feedback we have heard from you , we are reverting this advertising section to the original version that has been in effect since we launched the service in october 2010 ,  said systrom in a post announcing the change . on monday , the facebook-owned app updated its terms of service to say companies could pay instagram to use members ' images in ads without compensating the photographers . instagram claimed the update was to allow the company to experiment with possible future advertising options , and was not part of any current plan to sell images .  going forward , rather than obtain permission from you to introduce possible advertising products we have not yet developed , we are going to take the time to complete our plans , and then come back to our users and explain how we would like for our advertising business to work ,  systrom said in thursday 's post . opinion : instagram users should wise up . it is not a complete reversal . many of the other changes to the terms of service and privacy policy remain . the company still needs to work on ways to integrate ads into its free service , but for now it will tinker behind the scenes instead of prematurely sending users into a panic over the possibility that their likeness could show up in advertisements on the network . the old advertising section that has been reinstated still says the company can place ads on the service and that  the manner , mode and extent of such advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you ,  leaving the company with some wiggle room for future changes . this announcement comes two days after another mea culpa post by systrom , in which he apologized for the confusion and reassured instagram users that they still owned their images and that the company was hearing the feedback loud and clear . the severity of users ' reactions to the change seemed to catch instagram off guard , though the cycle of a policy change announcement followed by user backlash and then an apology is familiar territory for its parent company , facebook .", "summary": " instagram has reverted part of its terms of service in response to user backlash .   company will revert the advertizing language back to what it was in october 2010 .   other changes to the privacy policy and terms of service will go into effect in mid-january .
