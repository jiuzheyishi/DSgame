{"text": "rubbished , reviled , rejected . rafa . as he posed on the amsterdam arena pitch with the glistening europa league trophy in his hand , rafael benitez might have wondered what all the fuss had been about . branislav ivanovic 's dramatic late winner secured a 2-1 win victory over benfica and left chelsea 's interim manager with every right to feel proud . when he replaced champions league-winning coach roberto di matteo last november , he was welcomed into a cauldron of hate by chelsea supporters . despised by those in blue following his time with liverpool , the new interim manager was mercilessly mocked , abused and verbally attacked in the stands and on radio phone-in shows . perhaps more respect should have been afforded to a man who had led liverpool to champions league glory in 2005 and valencia to la liga success in 2002 and 2004 . instead , banners proclaimed  we 're just not interim  were unfurled , and benitez was left to fight an uphill battle against those who detested his very presence on the touchline at stamford bridge . but after securing champions league football for next season and claiming the europa league trophy , perhaps he will even be afforded a warm goodbye when he relinquishes his role after sunday 's game against everton . benitez 's latest triumph comes just two months after his infamous rant at the club 's supporters following his side 's fa cup victory at second division side middlesbrough . his attack on those who had delighted in criticizing his tenure may have raised eyebrows and earned him a censure from the club 's board , but it finally showed who was in charge . popularity has never been important to the spaniard . but benitez helped chelsea salvage a season which had threatened to fall apart after it became the first ever defending title holder to drop out of the champions league at the group stage . the blues became the first team to win europe 's top prize and then its secondary competition in successive seasons , though porto managed the feat in reverse order before coach jose mourinho -- widely tipped to rejoin chelsea -- moved to stamford bridge in 2004 . a third-place finish and victory in the europa league is more than respectable for benitez , who was forced to swim against a tide of hate from the very start . he is just the second man after giovanni trapattoni to win the competition with two different clubs following his triumph with valencia in 2004 when it was known as the uefa cup . all that , despite being faced with placards and posters calling for his head and being vilified at every opportunity . in the end , as he stood facing the chelsea fans with the silverware in his hands , he could afford a little smile . if jose mourinho is the man to come in , then at least benitez can be content with leaving his old adversary with a winning team .  that was a great performance in the second half , against a very good team ,  benitez told itv following the victory .  i 'm really pleased for the players and everyone involved .  we did n't have the legs in the first half , so we had to adapt . they players have worked so hard , all season . i am proud - it was not easy . i 'm really pleased , really proud .  it could have been different had chelsea 's opponent , benfica , managed to take some of the chances afforded to it on a night of drama . benfica began the brighter of the two , its players producing some sumptuous one-touch football which left chelsea chasing shadows . as in munich 12 months ago , chelsea spent much of the first half ensconced in its own half , desperately trying to prevent the portuguese side from making the breakthrough it so badly craved . but for all the wonderful flowing football , benfica 's deficiencies in front of goal were all too evident as it failed to convert any of the chances which came its way . instead , it was chelsea in a rare foray into the benfica half which almost took the lead seven minutes before the break when frank lampard 's rasping effort was clawed away by artur . that scare appeared to reinvigorate benfica and the portuguese side almost moved ahead just minutes after the restart . nicolas gaitan found space on the right and his exquisite cross was headed home by oscar cardozo -- only for his celebrations to be cut short by an offside flag . while the decision was the correct one , cardozo was millimeters offside , it was the source of much frustration to a benfica side which quickly found itself behind . there appeared little trouble when chelsea goalkeeper petr cech threw the ball out towards juan mata and when he failed to take control , fernando torres nipped in to run at the benfica defense and coolly slot the ball home . to its credit , benfica refused to buckle and jorge jesus ' side hit back within nine minutes to level when cardozo fired home from the penalty spot following a handball by cesar azpilicueta . buoyed by its equalizer , benfica pushed forward in search of a winner and cech produced a fine save to push cardozo 's fierce drive over the crossbar . but while the red shirts poured forward , chelsea looked dangerous on the break and frank lampard came within inches of winning the tie after his rasping 20-yard effort smashed against the crossbar with two minutes remaining . the game appeared destined for extra time with the scores still level going into the final minute of stoppage time . but after ramires won a corner on the chelsea right , ivanovic rose highest to meet mata 's corner and head a dramatic winner .  it 's a great feeling ,  ivanovic told itv .  this team deserved this , because we have had a very difficult season and a lot of games .  in the end , today was a very hard game and benfica played very well . but we scored from set pieces and work very hard preparing that part of our game . we deserve that trophy .  it was fitting that ivanovic should score the winner after he was forced to miss last year 's champions league final triumph over bayern munich through suspension . frank lampard , who became the club 's record goalscorer last weekend after taking his tally to 203 , was quick to praise the serbia defender and reveal he is close to signing a new contract .  it 's been an amazing time for all of us involved ,  he told itv .  talk about ups and downs in the last two years ! but this is a big up . we 're a group , a team , and it was tight tonight after the long season we 've had .  no-one deserves this more than ivanovic -- he has been fantastic . you make your own luck , and we stick together in this group . the club deserve it .  i really , really hope to be around next year . with a game tonight and coming up we have n't sat down and signed anything , but i really hope so and things are looking good . the club have been brilliant .  for torres , it means he is now a reigning world cup winner , european championship winner , champions league winner and europa league winner -- the first for any player .  i am very happy ,  the spain international told itv .  it was a very tough game , and benfica were much better in the first half . the first half was not good enough at all . we really wanted to win this europe league , and maybe this was going to be our only chance .  this defeat caps a miserable week for benfica , which looks set to lose out on the portuguese league title following a dramatic late defeat by rival porto . benfica has now lost its past seven major european cup finals -- all of which have come since being hit by the infamous  bela guttmann curse  . guttmann , a hungarian coach , led benfica to glory in the european cup , winning the competition in 1961 and 1962 . but after his request for a pay rise was turned down by the newly elected president antonio carlos cabral fezas vital , guttmann placed a curse on the club and declared it would not win the european cup for another 100 years . not even the great eusebio , one of benfica 's most famous sons , was able to help lift the curse when he visited guttmann 's grave before benfica 's defeat in the 1990 european cup final . the curse appears to now include europe 's second trophy -- much to the dismay of the club 's manager jesus .  the benfica fans were better than the chelsea fans ,  jesus told a press conference .  they deserved a benfica victory for their passion and their feelings and the patriotism they showed .  this defeat is difficult for me because of the benfica fans . for most of the 93 minutes , benfica was always better than chelsea . ", "summary": " chelsea wins the europa league following 2-1 win over benfica .   branislav ivanovic scored in the final minute of stoppage time .   fernando torres had given chelsea the lead on 59 minutes .   oscar cardozo equalized from penalty spot before late ivanovic winner .
