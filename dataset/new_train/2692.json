' a complex man ' wearing a skullcap and sunglasses , biden sat alongside israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu . in his speech , biden praised the tenacity of sharon , a divisive figure in the middle east .  prime minister sharon was a complex man ... who engendered strong opinions from everyone ,  he said .  but like all historic leaders -- all real leaders -- he had a north star that guided him , a north star from which he never , in my observation , never deviated . his north star was the survival of the state of israel and the jewish people , wherever they resided .  the memorial was followed by a funeral procession that included a stop in latrun for a special meeting of the israel defense forces and ended with a military funeral at sharon 's shikmim ranch . sharon was wounded in latrun in 1948 during israel 's war for independence . he was buried at the ranch in the southern negev desert . security was tight throughout . lt. col. peter lerner , spokesman of the israeli military , said that two rockets fired from gaza landed around sha'ar hanagev in southern israel . he could not confirm the proximity of where the rockets landed to the funeral . there were no reports of injuries . ` one of the giants ' thousands of people sunday paid their last respects to sharon as his body lay in state outside the parliament .  he was one of the giants . he was very special ,  said ayala weisel , who said she grew up learning of sharon as a widely admired soldier who fought for his country . she was one of many mourners who shared memories of sharon . chaim friedman , a tour guide , described sharon as a decisive leader .  he was known as the bulldozer because he got his way and he made things happen . he 's well respected for that ,  friedman said .  sometimes in israel , you have to do it the straight way , or you have to find the other way to get things done , and he managed to do it .  read more : sharon 's life on the front lines . a darker view . but others have painted a darker picture of sharon 's legacy . and the same decisions that made sharon a controversial figure during his lengthy tenure as a military man and politician were back on display in the initial reactions to his death . these moments include his role as defense minister during the 1982 war in lebanon . during that conflict , he was held indirectly responsible by an israeli inquiry in 1983 for the massacre of hundreds of palestinians at the sabra and shatila refugee camps . he was forced to resign . he also raised ire in the arab world by encouraging israelis to build settlements on occupied palestinian land but later did an about-face and pushed for the historic withdrawal from settlements in the west bank and gaza , which were turned over to palestinian rule for the first time in nearly four decades .  we deal with the death of sharon as an end for the crimes he committed against the palestinian people ,  said isra almodallal , a spokeswoman for hamas , the palestinian movement that runs gaza .  the biggest crime was the sabra and shatila massacre in lebanon , and we deal with sharon as a criminal person .  read more : five things to know about sharon . cnn 's ben wedeman reported from jerusalem , and jethro mullen reported and wrote from hong kong . cnn 's kareem khader , mariano castillo , saad abedine and faith karimi contributed to this report .", "summary": " new : former israeli prime minister ariel sharon is buried at his ranch in the negev desert .   sharon added  an unforgettable chapter  to israel 's history , shimon peres says .   joe biden says sharon was committed to the survival of israel and the jewish people .   sharon is remembered for his controversial military and political career .
