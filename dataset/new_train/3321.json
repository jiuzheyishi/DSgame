{"text": "a woman who stunned a courtroom this week by admitting to three murders has two young daughters , the mail can reveal today . joanna dennehy , 31 , pleaded guilty to stabbing three men to death and trying to kill two others in a rampage of violence . the mail has discovered she has two children she abandoned more than four years ago when she descended into a life of drink and drugs . family : convicted murderer joanna dennehy with her two girls , whose identities have been concealed . revelation : how the mail reported on dennehy this tuesday . the girls - 14 and seven - live with their father , john treanor , 37 , and their step-mother vicky and enjoy school and spending time with friends . but their lives were turned upside down when their mother was arrested on suspicion of a triple murder earlier this year . mr treanor had to break the news to his eldest daughter after police came round to their house in glossop , derbyshire , to take statements about his time with the killer . he spent 12 years in an on-off relationship with dennehy before finally pulling the plug on their chaotic relationship in 2009 . since then dennehy has not tried once to visit the girls . ` we 've not heard a peep out of her in years , ' said mr treanor said . ` my eldest daughter knew her mother had been arrested and we were all very , very shocked . she read about the murders in the papers and then she searched for it on the internet , but when she pleaded guilty this week she was devastated . ` my youngest is only seven and i 've chosen not to tell her about it as she is too young to understand . she does n't even know jo is her mother . ` it has been a dreadful time for us all . just when it seemed we had got rid of their mother 's damaging influence she rears her head again . ` the girls both love school and have a circle of friends and we are trying to live a normal life . this will not help things at all . ' lovers : dennehy and john teanor pose lovingly together in 2004 . mum : dennehy with her first daughter , who is now 14 and read about her murders in the papers . mr treanor decided to flee to safety with his two daughters after putting up with years of drinking , drug-taking and infidelity . the final straw came in 2009 when dennehy , who had left the family home , turned up drunk late one evening and pulled a dagger from the inside of her knee-length leather boot . she plunged the knife , which had a decorated handle , into the living room floor and yelled , ` i wish i could kill someone ' . terrified , mr treanor broke off all contact immediately and fled to safety with his children more than 140 miles away and has not seen dennehy since . but he never imagined the angry outburst would become a dreadful reality and she would become one of the few female multiple killers in british criminal history . on monday she pleaded guilty to brutally stabbing to death her landlord . new life : john teanor , pictured , fled from dennehy with his daughters after she came home in a drunken rage one night in 2009 . mr lee , who died from stab wounds to the chest , was found in a ditch in newborough , cambridgeshire , on easter saturday , march 29 . her other two victims , who were also stabbed to death , were found dumped a short distance away four days later . she will undoubtedly be handed one of the biggest prison sentences ever for a woman at the conclusion of the court case . it is a far cry from the lively 15-year-old that mr treanor met in 1997 when she bounded up to him in a park as he walked his german shepherd and exclaimed : ` i really love dogs . ' the pair immediately hit it off and , despite mr treanor being six years her senior , they became a couple . they lived a nomadic lifestyle , finding work where they could and moving from house to house until dennehy became pregnant at 16 . periods of stability were interspersed with breaks in the relationship when dennehy 's drinking , promiscuity and reckless behaviour drove them apart . a final three-year period of calm saw the birth of their second daughter in 2006 but her descent into drugs , drink and casual sex led to a permanent break in 2009 . mr treanor , who this year married girlfriend vicky in a ceremony in australia , said : ` i still ca n't believe it . her life was pretty crazy but i never expected this - it shows how far she had fallen . ` it was inevitable that something was going to happen .
