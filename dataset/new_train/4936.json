{"text": "the alleged terror incident aboard a passenger flight from amsterdam to detroit has raised questions as to how a nigerian man carried explosives through stringent security measures . umar farouk abdulmutallab has been charged with attempting to destroy a passenger plane after he detonated a device on board a jet on friday . authorities in the united states are investigating whether abdulmutallab had any connections with terrorist organizations or was acting alone . airports intensify security after plane attack . with dutch officials scrutinizing security procedures at amsterdam 's schiphol airport that allowed the 23-year-old man to smuggle the explosives on the aircraft -- here are some of the key questions still hanging over the incident . where did the explosives come from ? the man charged with igniting the device claims he obtained the explosives in yemen , along with instruction on how to use it . he carried these onto a flight from lagos , nigeria , to amsterdam , netherlands where he transferred to northwest flight 253 to detroit . was he on any security watch lists ? u.s. authorities say they were contacted by the man 's father ahead of the attack , but whether he was placed on any so-called no-fly list maintained by the united states is unclear . dutch officials say the passenger 's name appeared on a manifest supplied by the airline , which was passed to u.s. authorities , who cleared the flight to depart . were the proper security checks performed ? yes , say dutch authorities , who say he passed through normal procedures and that  security was well-performed .  he is known to have passed through a metal detector and his luggage was x-rayed . extra attention is normally applied to passengers arriving from nigeria because of concerns over fraud and smuggling . nevertheless airports around the world have stepped up security procedures in the wake of the incident , increasing pat-downs and secondary searches . so how did the explosives get through ? dutch authorities are at pains to point out that if the passenger had powders concealed upon his person or secreted bottles of liquid somewhere else , they certainly would not have been picked up by the metal detector . is there any way of detecting these kind of explosives ? a preliminary fbi analysis indicates the device contained petn , also known as pentaerythritol tetranitrate , a highly explosive chemical . experts say this would have been picked up using a swab commonly used in secondary screening . a body scan , particularly the new 3d imaging scanners being trailed at some airports , would also have spotted something strapped to his body , even in the crotch area . why were there no u.s. air marshal security officers on the flight ? u.s. homeland security secretary janet napolitano told cnn federal air marshals are not posted on all flights . she said this was not due to budgetary constraints , but down to standard procedures , which see marshals posted randomly on certain routes . cnn 's jeanne meserve , richard quest and barry neild contributed to this report .", "summary": " dutch authorities say normal security procedures were carried out .   authorities say they would not have picked up secreted powders or liquid .   secondary checks should pick up similar devices .
