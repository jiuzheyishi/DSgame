{"text": "many strains of norovirus are circulating the population but most people taken ill have contracted the newest variant . most of the 1.2 million people taken ill with the winter vomiting bug caught a new strain of the virus that came from australia , according to health experts . the variant , called sydney 2012 , has become the ` dominant strain ' and may explain the huge rise in the number of cases . in october , when the number of cases started to increase , the health protection agency -lrb- hpa -rrb- performed genetic testing of norovirus strains in england and wales . they found a ` cocktail of different strains ' that were circulating around the population . but according to recent analysis published in eurosurveillance , sydney 2012 - first identified in australia last year - has overtaken all others to become the dominant strain . while other strains are still in circulation , sydney 2012 is responsible for the majority of recent cases in england and wales . recent figures suggest that it affected 150,000 people over christmas . but health officials said that sydney 2012 , which has also been identified by health experts in france , new zealand and japan , does not cause more serious illness than other strains . the hpa said yesterday there have been 4,140 laboratory-confirmed cases of norovirus so far this season - but for every reported case , an estimated 288 are not flagged up . this means as many as 1.19 million people could have contracted the illness this season - a 63 per cent rise on the previous year . dr david brown , director of virology reference department at the hpa , said : ` it is always difficult to predict the norovirus season and this year is no different . ` noroviruses mutate rapidly and new strains are constantly emerging . ` at the start of the season it is normal for outbreaks to be caused by a range of different strains . however , as the season progresses particular strains are more successful and become dominant . ` the emergence of a new strain does not mean that it causes more serious illness . ' prevention : frequent hand washing is the best way to stop contracting norovirus . he said there is no treatment for norovirus other than to let the illness take its course with symptoms normally lasting about two days . norovirus is highly contagious and can be transmitted through contact with an infected person or contaminated surfaces and objects . it is known to spread rapidly in closed environments such as hospitals , schools and nursing homes . last month hospitals said they have been so overwhelmed by people suffering fromsickness bugs that paramedics were forced to care for 999 patients . ambulances were left queuing outside several hospitals in greater manchester - including wythenhsawe hospital , pennine acute trust ` snorth manchester general , royal oldham , rochdale infirmary and fairfield hospital in bury . symptoms include sudden vomiting , diarrhoea , or both , a temperature , headache and stomach cramps . the bug usually goes away within a few days . although people can suffer from norovirus at any time of the year , activity increases in the winter months , with most cases seen between january and march . in the united states , the centers for disease control and prevention say norovirus causes 21 million illnesses a year , with 70,000 cases requiring hospitalisation and around 800 ending in death . ian goodfellow , a scientist who has studied norovirus for 10 years , describes it as  the ferrari of the virus world  and  one of the most infectious viruses of man  .", "summary": " most people taken ill with norovirus caught the strain sydney 2012 .   the variant was first identified in the uk in october but is already dominant .   number of cases of the winter vomiting bug rose as much as 63 per cent compared to last year .
