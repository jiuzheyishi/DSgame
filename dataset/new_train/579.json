{"text": "it was an embarrassing start for president obama 's re-election campaign yesterday as he held his first political rally of the 2012 race in a half-empty arena . with wife michelle dressed head to toe in campaign colors at his side , obama targeted swing states ohio and virginia that are critical for his bid to remain in the white house . the president formally launched his chicago-based re-election effort last year but his official political events have been confined to fundraisers since then . scant support : obama 's rally for the 2012 presidential race at ohio state university appeared to have a poor turnout . rousing : president obama addressed his first official campaign rally in ohio saturday after releasing an email to encourage supporters to watch the rally and donate money . that changed this weekend , however , with results which may have surprised obama . the president , who was propelled to power in the 2008 election thanks in part to huge rallies across the nation , hoped to regain that momentum with events in large arenas in columbus , ohio and richmond , virginia . come game time , however , with his first event - which was free and open to the public - held at ohio state university , his numbers appeared to fall flat , according to several reports . one photo taken and posted to twitter by republican rival mitt romney 's campaign spokesman ryan williams showed the floor and seats with more space than people . the venue holds 20,000 and according to figures from obama 's campaign , 14,000 attended the event - 70 per cent of the stadium 's seating capacity . according to the paper , event organisers busied themselves moving people from the stage 's surrounding seats to the arena 's floor to depict a better crowd to television cameras . gop forecast : the republican national committee earlier released their own prepared remarks for the president which forecast a tepid audience . aiming to encourage his supporters , obama released an email prior to his rally reminding them to watch his first rally and donate money . ` the . crowd 's starting to form in columbus , and they 're ready to go , ' he said . in the email . ` in a little while , i 'll go on stage for the first rally . of 2012 . ' obama 's campaign is eager to get the president on the road and at the center of the political battle . ` we 're ready to go , ' campaign manager jim messina told reporters in a recent conference call . ` while . mitt romney has been busy endearing himself to the tea party and making . promises he ca n't keep , we 've been busy building the largest grassroots . campaign in modern american history .
