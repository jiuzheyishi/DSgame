{"text": "fewer foreign criminals are being deported despite a pledge by david cameron more than two years ago to ` intervene personally ' . since 2010 there has been a spectacular fall in the number sent home after committing serious offences here . in the year of the general election , 5,342 were deported . in 2011 , in the coalition 's second year of office , the figure was down 13 per cent to 4,649 . broken : the prime minister has failed to deport foreign criminals as he promised . figures from the first three quarters of 2012 show that 3,382 were deported . if the trend continued in the final quarter , it would mean the 2012 total is around 4,509 -- again , down on the previous year , and 16 per cent down on the election year figure . last year the number of foreign prisoners in our jails went up . the number stood at 10,861 as of june 2012 , up from 10,779 the year before . it is the first time in at least four years that the number of foreign prisoners in our jails has increased . one in eight inmates are now foreign nationals -- costing almost # 500million a year to house . failure : labour spokesman sadiq khan said that cameron 's promises have rung hollow . in september 2010 , mr cameron pledged he would ` intervene personally ' to ensure convicted offenders are sent home to spend the rest of their sentences in their own country . in october last year the daily mail revealed that since the promise was made , just 62 prisoners had been returned to their home country to serve the rest of their sentences . now the latest figures show that ministers are also failing to deport foreigners after they have served their sentences here . labour 's justice spokesman sadiq khan , who obtained the figures , said : ` david cameron 's promises to send back thousands of foreign prisoners and to take a personal interest in this matter ring hollow . ` not only has he failed to send more prisoners home , but the number in our prisons has actually risen . ` over half a billion pounds a year is now spent on keeping foreign prisoners in our prisons , and because of cameron 's failings , money that would be better spent elsewhere in our justice system to keep our communities safe is being wasted . ' some 2,220 foreign offenders are in jail for violence against the person while 1,287 are sexual offenders . there are 947 robbers , 517 burglars , 738 thieves and 434 fraudsters . some 2,110 of the foreign prisoners are there for drug offences while 105 have committed motoring offences.it costs around # 45,000 a year to keep an offender in prison . the figures , released by justice minister jeremy wright , show that the second most common nationality of overseas prisoners is now polish -- overtaking the irish . jamaicans top the nationality table , with 900 last year , followed by poland on 750 , and ireland , 737 . over the past five years , there has been a trebling of the number of romanian offenders in our jails , even before the eu restrictions on immigration from that country and bulgaria are lifted at the end of the year . romanians are now the fifth most common nationality in our prisons . david green , from the think tank civitas , said : ` if you have more immigration , it is not surprising that a proportion of them will be offenders .
