{"text": "rosalyn , already a mother of six children , is waiting to give birth . but she will not enjoy the privacy of her own delivery room , her husband eduardo by her side . instead , rosalyn will be one of the 300 new mothers crammed into the wards at the dr jose fabella memorial hospital in manila , the capital of the philippines , which sees , on average , 60 new babies come into the world every single day . space at the maternity wing is at a premium , so rosalyn and her new baby will share with other mothers , usually five to a bed but sometimes more , and she will give birth as part of a group of six when the time comes . scroll down for video . crammed : the wards at the dr jose fabella memorial hospital are packed - with more than five women per bed . dubbed the ` world 's busiest maternity ward ' , the natal wing at the dr jose fabella memorial hospital serves the nearby tondo slum , a former rubbish dump now home to half a million people . here , rosalyn and her husband eduardo eke out a living on his daily salary of 380 pesos -lrb- # 6 -rrb- , augmented by rosalyn 's embroidery work which brings in around 280 pesos -lrb- # 4 -rrb- every few days . ` even if you have no work , you still . have to pay the bills , ' explains eduardo . ' i have two jobs . for my family 's sake . ` i 'll do anything to earn more money for my . family , odd jobs - even if it 's on a sunday . ' back at the hospital , rosalyn is having her final check up with one of the nurses at the dr jose fabella . watched by documentary film maker anita . rani , rosalyn discusses the blood donors she will need to bring to the . birth with a brisk , efficient nurse . queued up : labouring women have to share the delivery suite with at least five other expectant mothers . documentary : film maker anita rani surrounded by some of the new mothers at the manila hospital . the philippines is chronically short of blood which makes bagged blood enormously expensive and out of reach for someone like rosalyn . but with a seventh baby on the way , haemorrhage is a real risk so she 's arranged for a friend to be at the hospital during the delivery along with eduardo . ` it would be better to have three . donors , ' chides the midwife . ` because here in fabella , three donors is the . equivalent of the amount of blood that would be used for you . ` we prepare . for your delivery because we do n't know if you will bleed at the time . of your delivery . remember it 's your seventh pregnancy . ' seven children is not unusual in the philippines . in tondo , families of 10 or even 12 are common , and as a result , at peak times , midwives at the dr jose fabella can deliver as many as 100 babies within a 24-hour period . ` sometimes , during high season , 13 to 16 babies are in the delivery room at the same time , ' arlene matanguihan , a resident doctor , said . ` it 's chaotic but an organised chaos . we can still manage -- no baby drops out on the floor . ' privacy : for mothers like rosalyn , there 's no room where they can spend time alone with their newborn . experienced : chief midwife anna prebus , left , has delivered an estimated 200,000 babies . chief midwife anna prebus has delivered so many babies , she finds it impossible to remember how many she has brought into the world . ` i 'm sorry but i ca n't remember -lsb- how . many babies i 've delivered -rsb- , ' she tells rani . ` it 's so many ! maybe 200,000 . i 've been here . since 1986 , almost 28 years . ' one in five of central manila 's mothers come here to deliver their babies , and midwives work day and night . as a result , conditions in the hospital are grim , with queues of pregnant women waiting in the reception area and hundreds more squeezed into the tiled wards . those on the verge of giving birth are packed into a tiny labour room . ` there are five in a bed , sometimes we have more , ' notes prebus , who points to women being wheeled into the delivery room , at the very last minute , in groups of six or more . but for rosalyn , giving birth in front of five others is the least of her worries . although the dr jose fabella is a public hospital , operations have to be paid for . as a result , she and eduardo live in fear of complications and a hugely expensive caesarian section . uncomfortable : post partum mothers are crammed into beds while their babies wait in a nearby nursery . labour : a group of nurses and midwives cluster around a mother giving birth - there 's no privacy at all . ` i 'm worried because it 's her . -lsb- rosalyn 's -rsb- due date , ' explains eduardo as he waits nervously by his wife 's side . ' i am also concerned with the child , whether it 's . going to be a normal delivery or by caesarian . ` if she does n't have a . normal birth , we will be in financial trouble . the budget is our number . one problem . ' ' i will force myself to give birth by normal delivery , ' adds rosalyn . ' i just want a . normal delivery . i can not accept a caesarian section . ' i hope to have a . problem-free delivery . that 's what i pray for - that we will be ok when i . give birth .

' i do n't know what that says . about filipino women , something about their psyche ... just like that , . another baby is born . ' when rosalyn 's baby boy finally makes his appearance , the new mother is relieved , if apprehensive about his future . ` if the child can finish his studies , i . hope he wo n't be like us where you need to work just to be able to eat , ' she says . ` there should be a limit on the amount of children you have . that is why i am . teaching them not to follow in my footsteps and have lots of babies .
