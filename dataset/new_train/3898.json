{"text": "the bird flu-hit farm where 6,000 ducks have been culled waited almost a week to sound the alarm - after staff first thought the animals were spooked by bonfire night . egg production dropped at the cherry valley breeding site in nafferton , east yorkshire , on november 8 , but a vet only sounded a formal bird flu alert with the government on november 14 , last friday . the firm said staff first thought the noise of fireworks might have stressed the birds into laying fewer eggs . then a vet suspected a bacterial infection , but antibiotics did n't work . delay : the east yorkshire farm where 6,000 ducks were culled yesterday -lrb- above -rrb- in a bird flu outbreak only sounded a formal alarm six days after the first problems were spotted , operator cherry valley has confirmed . hosed down : ducks are disinfected at the farm today . three days before the first signs of the virus , a shipment of 15,000 eggs left the farm . they are now being tested for the virus in incubators 50 miles away . only three days before the first problem was seen , a shipment of 15,000 eggs left the farm . they are now being tested for the virus in incubators 50 miles away amid fears they may have to be destroyed . a drop in egg numbers is one of the six key warning signs for spotting bird flu listed by the department for environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- . but cherry valley , which breeds 7million ducks a year for ready meals sold in tesco , m&s , lidl and aldi at 33 sites across britain , said many factors could have been responsible . a cherry valley spokesman told mailonline : ` on november 8-9 the farm first noticed problems and notified a consultant -lsb- private -rsb- vet , who was in touch with the animal and plant health agency -lrb- apha -rrb- . ` there was no suspicion of bird flu originally , party because it was around bonfire weekend and there were fireworks . grim operation : workers wore protective clothing as they disposed of 6,000 carcasses from the stricken farm . a cherry valley spokesman defended the delay , telling mailonline : ` it could have been one of many things rather than jumping to the very worst conclusion straight away , like a person feeling ill and going to the gp ' ` these are one of the external factors which cause stress in animals and egg production to drop . ` so it could have been one of many things rather than jumping to the very worst conclusion straight away , much like a person feeling ill and going to the gp . ' the private vet first contacted the apha on november 11 , but both parties agreed it was probably a bacterial infection and prescribed the ducks with antibiotics the same day . when ducks continued to die and the antibiotics did n't work , the vet reported a suspected bird flu case on november 14 , the spokesman added . tests then confirmed the disease the next day and a public warning went out a day after that . in a statement , the firm added : ` there are well-established robust processes in place and they were closely followed . ` there was no suspicion of bird flu initially as a fall in egg production can be a symptom of several different things . these include general stresses , such as disturbance due to such things as fireworks which were a feature of that weekend . ' defra confirmed yesterday the virus was the same h5n8 strain found in germany and the netherlands . a leading health expert claimed there will ` probably be human cases ' of the strain - despite it never infecting a human before . elizabeth mumford from the world health organisation warned the virus was ` unpredictable ' as all 6,000 white pekin ducks on the farm were gassed to death and dumped in metal containers . dr elizabeth mumford -lrb- left -rrb- said although the risk of human infection was low , ` flu viruses are unpredictable ' red signs were placed around the small east yorkshire village as environment secretary liz truss told mps : ` whilst we 're never complacent about such an important issue , we do have a very strong track record ' wednesday , november 5 . shipment of 15,000 eggs leaves cherry valley farm in nafferton , east yorkshire , for incubators near market rasen , lincolnshire . saturday/sunday november 8-9 . egg laying begins dropping at nafferton farm . at first staff suspect ducks have been ` spooked ' by loud noises on bonfire weekend . tuesday , november 11 . vet contacts animal and plant health agency -lrb- apha -rrb- ; both agree it is probably a bacterial infection and prescribe antibiotics . friday , november 14 . with deaths continuing , vet sounds first bird flu alarm with apha . tests taken the same day . saturday , november 15 . tests confirm the virus is bird flu of type h5 . later tests rule out lethal h5n1 strain . sunday , november 16 . public alert declared late at night after emergency meeting involving the chief vet . tuesday , november 18 . 6,000 ducks culled as defra confirms virus is same h5n8 strain found in germany and the netherlands . she said there could be ' a few sporadic cases ' , adding : ` we believe any time that humans are in close contact with poultry , there 's a possibility of transmission to humans ' . although the possibility of seeing human cases was low , she said : ' i do n't see why we would n't . if it 's really circulating widely , there 's no reason we should n't see human cases . ' it was the first time an expert had claimed the h5n8 strain could pass to humans . other top scientists , including britain 's chief vet and public health england , have stressed repeatedly that the risk of transfer to humans is negligible . yesterday a second site owned by cherry valley was drawn into bird flu fears for the first time . the firm 's usselby hatchery near market rasen , lincolnshire , incubating between 14,000 and 15,000 duck eggs which left the stricken farm on november 5 and are due to hatch in two weeks . defra is now set to test the eggs and work out whether they need to be destroyed . a spokesman said : ` as part of our robust action in response to the confirmed case of avian flu , we are considering a range of measures including destroying a shipment of eggs sent to a separate farm for hatching earlier in november . ` this is in line with our tried and tested procedures for dealing with avian flu outbreaks . ' cherry valley admitted the move but insisted : ` as the world health organisation , the minister , the food standards agency , public health england and others have made clear , there is absolutely no risk to humans and people should continue to eat all forms of poultry . ` any eggs that are destroyed are done so to protect the integrity of the supply chain and ensure that the disease does not affect more birds . ' dr colin butter , head of avian viral immunology at the pirbright institute for animal health , said : ` it 's certainly possible that eggs from an infected flock could carry influenza on their surface . ' final moments : ducks are packed into crates and taken to be culled today at a bird flu-hit yorkshire farm . operation : the farm is run by lincolnshire firm cherry valley , whose products from the 7million ducks it breeds in britain every year include frozen duck meals for supermarket shelves such as the one above . he added : ` in chickens you would know very fast because they die . with highly pathogenic bird flu , which this is , the can die within a couple of days , so you know very fast that you have a problem in the flock . ` however , with some water fowl such as ducks , the symptoms of influenza can be much less severe , so farmers have to be on a very sharp lookout . ' but he added : ` there 's all evidence to suggest this farm picked it up extremely quickly ... -lsb- and -rsb- i 'm quite sure the scientists from defra have this question in hand . ' a defra spokesman said : ` the advice from the chief medical officer and public health england remains that the risk to public health is very low . the food standards agency have said there is no food safety risk for consumers . '", "summary": " bird flu alarm was not sounded at yorkshire farm for almost a week .   issues began just three days after 15,000 eggs were sent 50 miles away .   operator cherry valley insisted egg loss can be a sign of many things .   but it is also one of the six danger signs of bird flu listed by defra .   6,000 ducks culled after h5n8 strain became uk 's first case in six years .   who scientist claimed it could pass to humans for the first time .
