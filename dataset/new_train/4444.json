{"text": "sen. rand paul made clear to his team of political advisers wednesday that he 'll run for re-election to the senate in 2016 and reiterated that he wo n't make a decision on a presidential run until next spring , according to a spokesman . his strategists met behind closed doors at a washington hotel wednesday to sketch out a road map for 2015 and review the past two years , during which paul traveled to 35 states campaigning for candidates and raising his national profile . paul , a republican from kentucky , attended most of the meetings as well as a group dinner in the evening , said spokesman sergio gor . the sessions , led by rand pac executive director doug stafford , covered fundraising performance , grassroots engagement , communications , outreach and other areas of interest , though gor did not give specifics . paul has long made it known that he plans to campaign for a second term in the senate , but questions have emerged over whether he can run for his seat and for the white house at the same time . kentucky law prohibits candidates from appearing on the same ballot for two different offices . attempts to change the law were made last year in the gop-controlled state senate but stalled in the democratic-controlled state house . attempts by republicans to retake control of the state house in last week 's elections were unsuccessful , meaning the law will likely stay in the books for 2016 . some of paul 's supporters have argued the law could be challenged , while others say there are ways he can get around it so that his name wo n't appear on the ballot twice . one such scenario would mean the state party changes its presidential primary to a caucus system . attendees at wednesday 's meeting included michael biundo of new hampshire . biundo , who previously chaired rick santorum 's presidential campaign , was one of a number key hires this year by rand pac in early primary states . the team also added steve grubbs and a.j. spiker -- both former chairmen of the iowa republican party -- as well as republican consultant john yob in michigan .", "summary": " rand paul meets with his advisers to lay out a road map for 2016 , his spokesman said .   paul plans to campaign for re-election and is strongly considering a presidential run .
