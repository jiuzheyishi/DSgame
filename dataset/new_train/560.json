' but the police say they are only targeting ex-cons who offended before the database was created -- and others who avoided being added to it . the samples - normally taken from a saliva swab - will be kept even if the suspect is not charged . forensic scientist jasmine thomas prepares blood samples for dna extraction for evidence in a sexual assault case . there are 1.8 million samples on the database , set up in 1996 , and 3,000 names a month are added . statistics show that more than 1.2 million arrests are made each year for recordable crimes , which include many motoring offences , breaching the trade descriptions act , the dangerous dogs act and britain 's ancient blasphemy laws . defence lawyers have warned of the risk of innocent people being linked to an offence under the new system if their dna was found at a crime scene by accident , such as on a stolen mobile phone .", "summary": " officers have visited 200 ex-offenders in the manchester area to take dna samples .
