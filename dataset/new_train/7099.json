{"text": "slim hope : lydia with her malory band . on my birthday , my mother cooked me a celebratory dinner . the highlight was my favourite fish pie . a wantonly gorgeous creation made with lashings of cream , it 's a dish i 'd argue my mother is the best at cooking , probably in the whole world . politeness as well as greed demanded i do full justice to her efforts ; but as i reached out for a second helping - homing in on the lovely crispy , cheesy bits around the edges - an ominous tightness in my stomach warned me to put my plate down immediately . my new weight-loss aid was making its presence felt again . from surgery to drugs to smart bracelets which monitor calorie intake and output , the scientific solutions for tackling obesity seem to get ever more complex . which makes it all the more surprising that the latest weight-loss wonder to capture the public imagination is very little more than a piece of string . the malory band is a woven polyester cord that you wear around your waist . eat too much at one sitting , and the cord digs into your stomach . and that 's basically it . at # 39.95 , it is n't cheap . the woman behind it , tv presenter and life coach penny mallory , calls it ` your best friend if you want to change the way you eat and exercise ' . and , amazingly , it 's proved a smash-hit . the bands have been flying off the shelves in more than 100 countries after receiving worldwide attention from the press . online forums are now filled with women praising its simplicity and miraculous effects on their waistlines . a similar technique was said to have been used in egyptian times , and our victorian great-grandmothers also apparently tied cords around their waists to keep track of their tums . so is it , literally , just money for old rope ? or is there method behind the apparent madness ? having tried innumerable weight-loss regimes , the simplicity of this solution really appealed to me . no banned foods , no mandatory exercise , no need even for willpower : it just relies on inflicting mild discomfort to discourage overeating . it would be like having a gastric band , but without any risk of post-operative complications . my waist measurement is 75cm , so i ordered a malory band in a size 10-14 . it measured just under 90cm , and looked like a rather sophisticated belly chain . in plaited grey and white cord , it has loops along its length and silver stops at either end . you fit the cord around your waist , then push the stop through the loop to keep it at the desired circumference . it 's invisible , except when worn under the tightest of body-con dresses -lrb- which you probably wo n't be wearing if you think you need a malory band . -rrb- i tied it so that it sat comfortably around my muffin top and went to show it to my husband . ` hell-o ! ' he said in his best leslie phillips manner . ' i like it ! ' he 's never said that about any of my control-top knickers . i think he liked the belly-dancer look . at first , the band and i got along fine . when i went to my fitness class at the gym , i was briefly aware of the metal ends knocking against my hip before i forgot about it . ` the band was n't so much a . best friend as an ill-informed dietitian who disapproved of whatever i . chose to put into my mouth - however healthy it might be . and . my reaction to this constant nagging was to eat more . ' i showered with it on - it dried quickly - but afterwards , getting dressed , i became aware of some rather strange looks from my fellow gym-bunnies . either they were all aware of the malory band and were checking out how effective it was , or i looked as though i was working the belly-dancer vibe too hard for a women-only changing room on a rainy monday morning . afterwards , i decided it was time to set the band a test , so i popped into a caf√© for a cappuccino and a croissant . as i munched , i waited tensely for something to happen . but my waistband felt as loose as ever , which perversely made me feel as though i was still being healthy . lunch was a different story . i made myself a large but blameless broccoli salad , but as my stomach filled up , the band began to make its presence felt . clearly , the fibre in the raw veg was making me bloat . i now realised that the low-tech qualities of the malory band obviously had their limitations ; if i 'd eaten a chocolate bar instead i 'd have taken in far more empty calories without discomfort . the band also appeared to have issues with my posture . returning to my desk to work , i found i had to sit bolt upright to prevent it digging in . by the time i went to bed , i had an unflattering red line etched into my stomach . i slept in it , and had wild nightmares of being trapped somewhere . at 4am , waking in a rage , i took it off and flung it to the floor . jumping on the malory band wagon : a mistake . the next day , i reluctantly put it on again . my stomach had slimmed down overnight . once again , it felt comfortable -lrb- although i 'd lost track of my original waist measurement -rrb- . but by the end of the day , i had to loosen it once more . there were interesting aspects to wearing the malory band . now i know which foods make me bloat : pasta , apples and broccoli were particular culprits . i made a mental note to avoid eating any of them before a party . otherwise , the band was n't so much a best friend as an ill-informed dietitian who disapproved of whatever i chose to put into my mouth - however healthy it might be . and my reaction to this constant nagging was to eat more , just to prove i was in charge of my body , and had n't handed over control to this bossy piece of string . so when it started to bite into me at my birthday dinner , it was the final straw . i took it off with a sense of enormous relief . which is possibly why , when i stepped on the scales after a week of wearing the malory band , i discovered to my dismay that i 'd actually put on 1lb . in the longer term , i can see how wearing the band might work . numerous scientific studies have proved that waist measurement is an important indicator of health . and if you 've reached your target weight and are determined to stay there , that constant reminder not to eat another mouthful might be very helpful . but my personality does n't work like that . i hate being niggled at , and my waist size seems to fluctuate quite significantly over the course of a normal day , whatever i 'm eating . and as the band made me feel permanently fat and rather glum , i found myself reaching for the consoling biscuits rather more than i usually do . the technique might have worked for the egyptians and the victorians , but personally i 'm still putting my faith in science rather than string . maloryband.com .", "summary": " the malory band is a polyester cord worn around your waist .   the more you eat , the more it digs into your stomach .   lydia slater tries out the slim string ...
