{"text": "retired policeman ian richardson -lrb- pictured -rrb- told a libel trial the plebgate affair was ` trivial nonsense ' a retired policeman has described the plebgate affair as ` trivial nonsense ' which he could not be bothered to record because he was eating his sandwiches . ian richardson told a libel trial yesterday that it was merely a ` quirky incident ' involving ` a gentleman on a bike who had the hump ' . the former police marksman was on duty in downing street when conservative mp andrew mitchell allegedly called officers ` f ****** plebs ' . he did not hear the former chief whip use the ` toxic phrase ' , but was given an account of what happened moments later by colleague pc toby rowland . asked why he did not write a full account of the conversation , mr richardson replied : ` i was eating my sandwiches and i could n't be a **** to write too much more -- laziness . ` it was a trivial nonsense incident . it was n't a murder scene where tape was being put up . ' mr richardson said the confrontation turned into a ` mexican stand-off ' after his colleagues refused to allow mr mitchell to cycle through the main downing street gate . he told the high court yesterday : ` i heard toby say ,  please do n't swear at me sir  . i said ,  hello , i think it 's going off over there  . ' he said his team tried to track down members of the public who allegedly witnessed the incident . when asked why , he said : ` i was anxious to prove that we had been decent , honourable officers that night . ' earlier pc rowland , the only officer who claims he heard mr mitchell use the word ` pleb ' , was accused of inventing his account of the incident . the police marksman claims ` several ' members of the public heard the mp 's outburst and were ` visibly shocked ' . pc toby rowland -lrb- pictured left -rrb- denied inventing the words ` f ****** plebs ' attributed to andrew mitchell -lrb- right -rrb- as he cycled out of the front gates of downing street . both are pictured arriving at the high court in london . but james price qc , representing mr mitchell , accused pc rowland of inventing his account to justify giving the mp a warning under the public order act . mr price said the officer 's witness statement was ` a carefully constructed account ' . in a written submission to the court , mr price added : ` pc rowland , either on his own , or with the encouragement of others , fabricated the toxic phrases , lied about seeing visibly shocked members of the public , and falsely claimed to have been alarmed by what mr mitchell said . ` in other words , he lied about what was said , where it was said , what he saw and how he felt . ' david davis mp -lrb- right -rrb- and mr mitchell 's wife sharon bennett -lrb- left -rrb- arrived at the high court with him today . the scotland yard officer , a policeman of 22 years , replied : ` no , the evidence i have given is the truth .

' mr mitchell denies this , but admits saying ` i thought you guys were supposed to f ****** help us ' after officers refused to open the gate in september 2012 . news group newspapers argues its article was substantially true . pc rowland is suing the mp for suggesting that he made up the allegations . the case continues . sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article .", "summary": " retired pc ian richardson described plebgate affair as ` trivial nonsense '   told trial he did not record incident as he was eating his sandwiches .   pc toby rowland is accused of inventing words used in ` plebgate ' row .   he had claimed andrew mitchell called downing street police ` f ****** plebs '   police officer accused of fabricating words to justify giving him a warning .   mr richardson told the trial he did not hear the ` toxic phrase '   pc rowland is suing mr mitchell for saying he made up allegations .
