{"text": "the american bears a broad grin , flashing an  ok  sign to the russian support team tending to him after his descent from space . it 's not exactly the image of two countries at extreme odds over the ukraine crisis . but in the world of u.s.-russian relations , space is impervious , as demonstrated by the joint effort to bring american astronaut mike hopkins and his cosmonaut counterparts , soyuz cmdr. oleg kotov , a native of crimea , and fellow flight engineer sergey ryazanskiy , home to earth . the soyuz tma-10 spacecraft landed in kazakhstan early tuesday after the trio spent more than five months aboard the international space station , leaving the multinational astronaut delegation of japan 's koichi wakata , america 's rick mastracchio and russia 's mikhail tyurin to finish the orbital laboratory 's expedition 39 . those three are expected to return home in mid-may , after being joined by another international team : steve swanson -lrb- u.s. -rrb- , alexander skvortsov -lrb- russia -rrb- and oleg artemyev -lrb- latvia -rrb- are in star city , russia , training for their march 25 launch from baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan , nasa says . kotov is a space veteran returning from his third mission and 526th day in space . hopkins and ryazanskiy are rookies . this mission marked their first 166 days in space , nasa says . hopkins conducted a pair of u.s. spacewalks for a total 12 hours and 58 minutes . ryazanskiy conducted three russian spacewalks during his mission working outside the station for 20 hours and five minutes . on earth , the united states may be trading bitter accusations with russia over ukraine , but in space , it 's a different story . putin vs. obama : facing off over facts in ukraine . the space collaboration between the two nations has survived other diplomatic kerfuffles -- most recently , the war in syria and asylum for nsa leaker edward snowden -- and there 's no need to worry , nasa says .  we do not expect the current russia-ukraine situation to have any impact on our civil space cooperation with russia , including our partnership on the international space station program ,  said allard beutel , a nasa spokesman , pointing out that it 's in both countries ' best interests not to disrupt  operations that have maintained continuous human presence on orbit for over a decade .  beutel added ,  nasa and its russian counterpart , roscosmos , have maintained a professional , beneficial and collegial working relationship through the various ups and downs of the broader u.s.-russia relationship and we expect that to continue .  ` reluctant co-dependency ' the two nations ca n't afford temporary tussles to upend a costly relationship -- one that james oberg , a former space engineer , describes as  reluctant co-dependency .  in 2011 , nasa retired its space shuttle fleet , its only means of getting to and from the station . now , russian soyuz capsules ferry u.s. astronauts and cosmonauts , together with supplies that can fit in the smaller craft . in turn , the united states brings to the table technology far more advanced than russia 's capabilities , oberg told politico . at the same time , many of the russian systems are more reliable because they are simpler and have been operating longer , leroy chiao , former nasa astronaut and international space station commander , told cnn . the space station itself has an intricate blend of both countries ' contributions -- from u.s. solar arrays and power systems to russian core life-support systems , to a navigation system that comes from both countries , he said . americans and russians train on each other 's systems , but one country ca n't run the station alone , he said . the mission control centers in houston and korolyov , near moscow , have to coordinate commands sent to the station , he said .  we need each other to operate the station ,  chiao said .  otherwise we run the risk of losing that asset .  a pretty penny . what 's more , the agreement between the two nations is n't exactly cheap . according to a new deal nasa signed with the russian space agency , the united states will pay russia $ 71 million to ferry each astronaut to the space station . the emergence of private companies in the space transport business may change the game . nasa has a $ 1.6 billion contract with spacex to fly at least 12 cargo resupply missions to the space station , and a $ 1.9 billion contract with orbital sciences for eight such missions . spacex is gearing up for its third commercial resupply mission this month ; orbital sciences completed its first in february . as for transporting astronauts , nasa said in november that it 's seeking to partner with u.s. companies for human trips to the station as well , by 2017 . that could end u.s. reliance on russia for space voyages . but for now , experts say , the u.s.-russia relationship on space remains a marriage of convenience .", "summary": " american mike hopkins returns to earth with russian , crimean cosmonauts .   even if u.s. , russia are at odds , space collaboration endures , nasa says .   u.s. astronauts have no way to get to and from the international space station .   in return , u.s. brings money , more advanced technology to table .
