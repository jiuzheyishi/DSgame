{"text": "the nhs has made an urgent appeal for o negative blood donors after the early norovirus outbreak and the festive period caused a drop in donations . the national blood service -lrb- nbs -rrb- said it had increased stocks of the blood type before christmas but high demand meant it was running low . more than one million people are believed to have been affected by the vomiting bug outbreak , which led several hospitals to close their doors before christmas in a bid to contain its spread . an urgent appeal has been made for donors as stocks of o negative blood are in low supply . an nbs spokesman said : ` blood stocks can often dip around holiday time as people get distracted and ca n't always attend their sessions . ` in addition , the recent outbreak of norovirus has led to a dramatic increase in the number of people correctly cancelling their appointments . ` non-attendance by o negative donors increased by 50 per cent just before new year . ' donors with o negative blood make up around seven per cent of the population and are known as the ` universal donor ' as their blood can safely be given to patients with a different blood group . this can prove vital in an emergency situation where there may not be time for an immediate blood group testing to be carried out . about 100,000 people were struck down with the winter vomiting bug over christmas according to the latest figures , with the number of confirmed cases 72 per cent higher than this time last year . the dramatic rise was attributed in part to an early outbreak of the illness which closed dozens of hospital wards as it swept across the country . 1.1 million people are said to have been affected by norovirus -lrb- shown here under a microscope -rrb- . during the two weeks up to december 30 , there were 29 hospital outbreaks reported , compared with 70 in the previous fortnight , bringing the total for the season to 590 . a total of 3,877 laboratory-confirmed cases of norovirus have now been recorded in england and wales - up on the 2,255 of last year . but the health protection agency -lrb- hpa -rrb- said that for every reported case , an estimated 288 were not flagged up , meaning about 1.12 million people could have contracted the illness this season . blood stocks are also needed for patients being treated for diseases like cancer and leukaemia , with anyone aged 17 upward who is in generally good health a potential donor . jon latham , assistant director of marketing for nhs blood and transplant , said : ` we would like to urge all o negative donors to walk into their most convenient donor session to give blood to help rebuild stock levels . ` we are always grateful to donors who respond to calls such as this and appreciate that in doing so they do give up some of their precious time . ` waiting times may vary in the next few days as we try to accommodate all donors . ` demand for blood never stops and o negative donors can help to ensure healthy blood stocks in the upcoming weeks , by giving blood now and in the next few days .
