{"text": "the vast blue sky stretched above clara bohitile 's pick-up truck as it trundled down a dirt road deep in the kalahari bushveld . stopping in a whirl of red dust , one of her workers jumped off the back to open the wire gate to her ranch . it was a typical african rural scene , but with a difference : traditionally the driver would have been a white afrikaans male farmer , but bohitile is a black woman . originally from a township in the capital windhoek she now runs her own cattle farm , known locally as a  kraal  . bohitile represents the changing face of namibia . under both german colonial and south african apartheid-era rule , political power , wealth and the ownership of productive land were deliberately dominated by whites . but since the country 's independence in 1990 there have been concerted efforts to change the legacy of discrimination .  the percentage of black farmers is still very small in comparison to white farmers ,  said bohitile .  but , indeed , we are entering that market , as black farmers we go through a lot of training , we do practicals on farms and we just get wiser and wiser and we try to do the right thing .  land reform in namibia is one of the county 's most emotive issues and changing the old patterns of ownership is not easy . bohitile is making a success of her venture , but she is former deputy minister of education and a prominent businesswoman today , which gave her access to capital and a head start . ireport : send in your views on the country . next to bohitile 's ranch is a former white-owned farm on which eight resettled black families are struggling to make a living . some assistance came last month when a white namibian mentor , sponsored by german money and directed by the government-owned agricultural bank of namibia arrived to advise one of the new owners , naftali katjiuongua .  we are making money ,  said katjiuongua .  but its not enough to help us . things are very expensive . we need more help from the government .  problems remain but namibia has come a long way from when i first visited the country as a teenager in 1976 . i will never forget the long rows of dusty , mostly dilapidated cars parked in the port of walvis bay . they had been left behind by white portuguese settlers fleeing the revolution and civil war in neighboring angola . read more : moving on from a difficult past . in south africa , the flames of the soweto uprisings were filling the air , while the war against white rule raged on the namibia borders . the future for many in southern africa seemed hopeless then . there seemed to be no way out of the conflict between white and black over who should rule the land and own the wealth . i could never have imagined that over 35 years later namibia would be such a peaceful country , although serious issues remain : unemployment is estimated to be over 50 % and over 70 % among youth , the gap between rich and poor is too high , and skills development is low . test your knowledge of namibia . yet black namibians have made huge strides . the ceo of the country 's largest diamond mining company , namdeb , is inge zaamwani-kamwi , a black woman who is leading a new struggle in the country .  the war for talent is an ongoing challenge ,  she says .  we do n't believe we can ever say we have trained enough . when there is progress and you are moving forward you will need to keep up with skills development .  bohitile and zaamwani-kamwi are two women who encapsulate the new namibia , and the possibilities open to them today were virtually unimaginable in the past . namibia 's success is that black advancement has not meant white diminishment . german and afrikaans culture is still strong . there remains a strong sense of shared identity among namibians of all races , and a common belief that their future can be better . hamilton wende is a freelance writer and television producer . he has written six books and is a producer for cnn 's eye on namibia coverage .", "summary": " namibia is slowly moving on from its history of discrimination .   land ownership remains emotive issue .   efforts being made to encourage more black farmers and gender equality .   possibilities today were unimaginable in the past , says wende .
