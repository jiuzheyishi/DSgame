{"text": "tokyo a japanese government report monday heaped fresh criticism on the operator of the nuclear power plant where a disastrous accident was set off last year by the devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit the country . the measures taken by tokyo electric power co. -lrb- tepco -rrb- , the plant operator , and the japanese nuclear regulator to prepare for disasters were  insufficient ,  the report by a government-formed panel of investigators said , and the response to the crisis was  inadequate .  the crippled fukushima daiichi plant spewed radiation and displaced tens of thousands of residents from the surrounding area in the worst nuclear accident since the 1986 chernobyl disaster in ukraine . even now , more than one year after the disaster began , tepco does not seem aggressive enough in examining the causes of the accident at the plant to prevent a recurrence , the 10-member panel , led by tokyo university engineering professor yotaro hatamura , said in the report monday . the report , the fourth and final one on the nuclear disaster , comes amid growing anti-nuclear protests in japan . it said interference by the prime minister at the time , naoto kan , created confusion in the response to the crisis . it recommended that all nuclear operators in the country conduct a comprehensive risk analysis of their facilities . the results of the investigation monday follow a damning parliamentary report earlier this month that said the crisis was a  man-made disaster  resulting from collusion between tepco , regulators and the government . that report said the disaster should have been predicted and prepared for . video : what caused the fukushima disaster . a february report by independent scholars and journalists also concluded the plant operator could and should have done more . only tepco 's own internal report in may said no one could have predicted the scale of the earthquake or the devastating tsunami that followed . however , it did admit it was not fully prepared and acknowledged criticism it took too long to disclose information . tepco also found itself under further scrutiny over the weekend when the japanese ministry of health , labor and welfare said it was investigating a report that subcontracted workers at the damaged fukushima nuclear plant were told to use lead covers in order to hide unsafe radiation levels . as the official investigations into the causes of the disaster at the power plant conclude , attention is shifting to what comes next for the nuclear power industry in japan . video : japan ends nuclear freeze . the government has been holding public hearings around the country to try to gauge public opinion regarding three options it has put forward for a medium-term energy plan . it is expected to decide next month whether to reduce the country 's nuclear power to zero as soon as possible , aim for a 15 % nuclear role by 2030 or a 20-25 % share by the same date . whichever is chosen , it will be a far cry from the energy policy in 2010 , which aimed to raise nuclear power 's role to account for more than half of electricity needs by 2030 . the anti-nuclear movement is very clear about which option it wants : the grassroots opposition says japan must become nuclear-free and the number of people making this call is growing . tens of thousands are gathering outside the prime minister 's residence every friday . last friday was the seventh protest that nagisa saito has attended .  what impresses me most is ... people never gave up and the crowd is getting bigger and bigger ,  she said .  even on a bad rainy day like today , we see this many people gathered , it 's amazing .  video : nuclear disaster spreads to houses , food . prime minister yoshihiko noda hears the voices , but so far he is not being swayed by them . he authorized the re-activation of two nuclear power plants earlier this month , claiming that without nuclear power , the country and the economy will suffer .  japanese society will not be able to function if there is a decision to permanently halt nuclear power generation ,  noda said last month . but one anti-nuclear protester , who gave his name only as ozaki , said it was not a simple choice between nuclear and blackouts .  if there is a power shortage , there are alternatives ,  he said .  what about coal-fired power stations , hydro-electric power stations , or we can just survive with what we have . we have to be patient , but even with blackouts , we can survive without nuclear power .  cnn 's junko ogura contributed to this report .", "summary": " the latest report comes from a government-formed panel of investigators .   it follows a scathing parliamentary report that described a  man-made disaster    the report monday criticizes the plant operator 's lack of preparedness .   japan faces questions over the future of its nuclear power industry .
