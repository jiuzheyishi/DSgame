{"text": "tehran , iran security forces wielding clubs and firing weapons beat back hundreds of would-be demonstrators who had flocked to a square in the capital on wednesday to continue protests against an election they have denounced as fraudulent , witnesses told cnn . hard-line iranian students mock british , u.s. and israeli flags outside the british embassy in tehran on tuesday .  they were waiting for us ,  one source said .  they all have guns and riot uniforms . it was like a mouse trap .  another witness told cnn that hundreds of people were chased by security forces and clubbed about a mile from the square . they were among the more than half a dozen witnesses who told cnn that security forces outnumbering protesters used overwhelming force to crush a planned demonstration in baharestan square , in front of the parliament building . the witnesses said police charged against the demonstrators , striking them with batons , beating women and old men and firing weapons into the air in order to disperse them . the melee extended beyond the square , according to one woman , who told cnn that she was traveling toward baharestan with her friends as evening approached  to express our opposition to these killings these days and demanding freedom .  but the black-clad police , they stopped everyone . they emptied buses that were taking people there and let the private cars go on ... and then , all of a sudden , some 500 people with clubs of wood , they came out of the hedayat mosque and they poured into the streets and they started beating everyone .  people were heard yelling  death to the dictatorship , death to ahmadinejad , death to khamanei and death to basiji ,  she said . government-run press tv gave a starkly different account , saying only about 200 protesters had gathered in front of the parliament and 50 others in a nearby square -- all were dispersed by security forces .  a heavy presence of police prevented violence in the area ,  press tv said . watch an ahmadinejad supporter describe the protests  at the nearby bank of melli hospital , a person who answered the phone said no one had been admitted as a result of any clashes . the number of demonstrators who ventured into the streets of tehran appeared to have fallen since sunday , said cnn 's reza sayah , who flew wednesday to the united states from tehran . he said exhaustion after eight consecutive days of massive protests may have combined with fear of government reprisals to limit the number of protesters . the key to what happens next , he said , depends on what role is assumed by mir hossein moussavi , whose supporters say was robbed of a victory in the june 12 elections . wednesday 's protests came as iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad met in tehran with a delegation from belarus in his first official meeting since the disputed june 12 election triggered widespread unrest . the official results of the election gave the incumbent president a landslide victory , but his challengers have declared it was rigged and are seeking a new vote . ahmadinejad 's claim of victory got renewed support from ayatollah ali khamenei , iran 's supreme leader , who endorsed the results and reiterated wednesday that the government will not back down . demonstrators must follow the law , he said . according to official figures , 17 people have been killed in clashes with government forces over the past 11 days . anti-government demonstrators have taken to the streets in at least four cities outside tehran . but cnn has received unconfirmed reports of as many as 150 deaths related to the popular uprising . the government 's response to it appears to have hardened in recent days . cnn has received numerous accounts of night-time roundups by government forces of opposition activists and international journalists from their homes . some tehran residents said they were too afraid to talk about the political crisis over the phone to anyone in the united states or europe . many protesters debated whether to venture into the streets .  i am not going outside my house at all ,  a 21-year-old college student from tehran said .  the streets are too dangerous , and just so very busy with police . ahhhh , when will our lives get back to normal ?  worried the government was monitoring their phone conversations , some residents said the internet was the best way to transmit information . however , the spotty connection made it difficult to rely on the web .  it 's beyond fear ,  said a woman who arrived at a u.s. airport from iran , but still did not want her name used for fear for her safety .  the situation is more like terror .  watch arrivals describe the situation  khamenei urged parliamentarians wednesday to tolerate the voices of the opposition , government-run press tv reported . khamenei made the remarks to a group of lawmakers in tehran , press tv said . but khamenei added that the islamic establishment and people  will never give in to coercive demands with regards to iran 's presidential elections ,  press tv said . the newscast added that a spokesman for the guardian council , which oversees elections , had declared that  no major irregularities took place  in the elections . though  minor irregularities  were found , they were not significant enough to change the results , the council spokesman said , according to press tv . iran 's ambassador to mexico defended his country 's actions , saying wednesday that the anti-government protesters represent but a small minority of the nation .  the minority ca n't impose their opinion on the majority ,  mohammad hassan ghadiri told cnn en espa√±ol .  they ca n't impose a dictatorship saying that the majority is not going to govern .  there are acceptable ways of addressing electoral fraud , if any occurred , he said .  but they go out on the street , they attack buses , they attack banks ; that affects the security of the country .  asked why the government has made it impossible for nearly all international journalists to report from iran , he accused the media of not accurately reporting events .  in tehran , there were much bigger demonstrations in favor of the government that you did n't report about ,  he said . asked about the shooting of 26-year-old neda agha-soltan , whose death , captured on video , has become emblematic of the crackdown on protesters , he said ,  it is not clear who killed whom .   terrorists  were among the demonstrators , he said .  some armed people have attacked police . ... naturally , we have to respond .   we do not beat up our people and we do not kill them ,  he said in a separate interview with cnn international . iran said the agha-soltan might have been shot by  mistake ,  the state-run islamic republic news agency reported wednesday . the report said the investigation into the death of agha-soltan is continuing ,  but according to the evidence so far , it could be said that she was killed by mistake . the marksmen had mistaken her for the sister of one of the monafeghin who had been executed in the province of mazandaran some time ago .  monafeghin refers to the people 's mujahedin organization of iran , which promotes a marxist government for iran and has waged a campaign against the fundamentalist islamic tehran government -- including bombings that killed politicians , judges and cabinet members . meanwhile , iranian authorities said they have arrested several foreign nationals , some with british passports , in connection with the country 's post-election unrest . intelligence minister gholamhossein mohseni-ezhei told reporters that some people with links to the west and israel had planned a series of bombings in iran ahead of the june 12 election , the government-funded press tv reported wednesday .  england is among the countries that fan the flames with their heavy propaganda , which is against all diplomatic norms ,  mohseni-ezhei was quoted as saying by the semi-official fars news agency .  and the bbc farsi has also played a major role . also , a number of people carrying british passports have played a role in the recent disturbances .  watch a report on iran 's history with the west  the british foreign office said it was looking into the claims . earlier wednesday , press tv said police raided a building in central tehran used as a  headquarters  to foment post-election unrest . the television station , citing unnamed sources , said the building was used by campaign staffers of opposition leader mir hossein moussavi . and evidence indicated that  foreign elements  were behind the planning , press tv said . the iranian government has long blamed other countries , especially britain , for  meddling  in its affairs but has offered no proof . tehran said wednesday it was temporarily recalling its ambassador from london , another move in escalating tit-for-tat gestures between the governments . on tuesday , britain expelled two iranian diplomats . a day earlier , iran told two british diplomats to leave . the difficulty in getting information has been compounded by a government clampdown on representatives of the international news media , who have been banned from covering protests . that has led some news outlets including cnn to rely on information from people who are disseminating information via social networking web sites . according to reporters without borders , 36 journalists have been arrested , 26 of them iranian , since the election and  many others  are missing .",
