{"text": "don hartsell knows his idea could be considered crazy .  i thought this project was so large , so ambitious , that no one would take me seriously ,  says the texas resident and aircraft enthusiast .  in fact , i was concerned they would think i was insane .  hartsell is talking about his world sky race , which as conceived would be a grand global spectacle . if all goes according to plan , a fleet of airships will take off from london in 2014 and race each other around the world , watched by millions of spectators , before finishing six months later just outside of paris . the event is planned as a series of 18 back-to-back races that will circumnavigate the globe . although the route is n't finalized , the proposed path will take pilots over at least four continents and about 130 united nations education , scientific and cultural organization -lrb- unesco -rrb- world heritage sites -- among them the egyptian pyramids , the taj mahal , the statue of liberty and the palace of versailles . hartsell , founder of a group of blimp enthusiasts known as the world air league , expects celebrations in each of the cities where the airships touch down , with wide-eyed children gathering to see the blimps float overhead . he estimates 140 million people around the world will witness the race -- a number that dwarfs the 5 million or so spectators for the london olympic games . the first-place prize for the speediest airship ? hartsell promises at least $ 5 million and the title of world sky champion . he plans to officially announce the race at versailles this fall , giving interested competitors almost two years to prepare . a far-fetched dream ? as you can imagine , there are still a lot of  ifs  surrounding the world sky race . skeptics might rightly wonder if it will ever happen . start dates have been thrown around for years -- september 2011 was one that was widely reported -- and yet hartsell 's race has yet to get off the ground . hartsell says he is still securing sponsors and raising prize money , as well as negotiating with princes and politicians for permission to fly airships over their landmarks . the market crash of 2008 caused delays and led potential sponsors to walk away , he says . hartsell estimates there are 30 to 35 airships in the world , and he hopes to rally at least five of them to participate in the race . each blimp will represent a nation , region or city , which he believes will encourage fan and sponsor support . he expects the race to cost about $ 50 million , to be financed by donations and sponsorships .  it 's being funded purely by that good old mechanism we call capitalism ,  he said . for each of the 18 legs of the race , the blimps will have to follow a set flight path . they will fly about 2,000 feet above sea level , making them visible to people on the ground . the airships expect to average about 70 miles per hour , which would allow them to travel about 1,000 miles a day , hartsell says . competitors will be timed from the moment they depart to the moment they arrive at an official endpoint . the blimp with the shortest cumulative time will be crowned the victor . from the hindenburg to goodyear . mention of airships brings to mind the 1937 hindenburg disaster , in which a german passenger airship went up in flames while attempting to dock in new jersey , killing 36 people . the hindenburg was a rigid blimp , with an aluminum frame containing hydrogen-filled bags that lifted it into the air . many airships today are non-rigid vessels that have no frame and are instead filled with helium -- which , unlike hydrogen , is not flammable . tim crouch , senior curator of aeronautics at the smithsonian 's national air and space museum , said airships had their heyday during the first 40 years of the 20th century because they were more capable than airplanes of carrying heavy loads over long distances . but as airplanes grew larger and faster , blimps were used less often to ferry cargo . the military used blimps for surveillance and reconnaissance until the 1960s , said crouch , noting that the u.s. navy has been experimenting with a blimp again in recent years . in recent decades airships such as the goodyear or directv blimps have been used for commercial purposes , usually at parades and sporting events . crouch said using airships as advertising is an age-old tradition he can see investors buying into , especially in a race around the world .  those kinds of aeronautical challenges always pique people 's interests ,  he said .  i mean , i 'd watch that -- would n't you ?  unesco 's role . the idea for the world sky race first came to hartsell when he was 23 years old and in new york city for the u.s. bicentennial celebration of 1976 . as he watched the goodyear blimp hover over tall-masted sailing ships in the harbor , he envisioned creating an airship race that would unite and inspire people like the bicentennial did . but it was n't until 30 years later , after he worked as a accountant , an attorney and an entrepreneur , that hartsell decided it was finally time to make the world sky race a reality .  i started this out with , ` ok , you 're at a point in your life where either you can retire or you can do something worthwhile . ' i went , ` are you still crazy ? ' then the next question i asked myself was , ` how 's your health ? ' because to put this together has turned into a large undertaking . then the third question : ` if not now ? ' and so with that , it started .  hartsell has found backing for his venture from such heavyweights as the former ceo of lockheed martin , a member of jordan 's royal family and officials at unesco . francesco bandarin , unesco 's assistant director general for culture , said the race would allow the u.n. to highlight its world heritage sites , which range from natural wonders such as the grand canyon to man-made landmarks like the sydney opera house .  this offers a great opportunity to publicize the sites , and ... the need to rally international support for their conservation ,  bandarin said .  this race would be a world premiere -- something never tried .  ` he thinks big ' as hartsell sees it , his event is n't just about racing blimps . he has enlisted the help of scott mcnealy , former chairman of tech giant sun microsystems , to use the world sky race as a teaching tool for children around the world . since his days in silicon valley , mcnealy has helped create cirriki , a nonprofit that allows educators to share k-12 curricula on its website . mcnealy hopes to use cirriki.org to help teachers and students track the race and to give them lesson plans about geology , ecology , history and culture related to the airships ' travel around the world .  anything that gets students out of the rut of the physical textbook i think is a good thing ,  mcnealy said .  i never would have come up with a blimp race as a way to do that , but you can see that it would be very fascinating to young kids .  hartsell also hopes the race will spur the development of new airship technology . he sees these vessels , which require less fuel and infrastructure than many other means of transportation , as the future of aviation .  it makes so much sense for the environment , and it also makes so much sense for not having to build the roads and not having to dredge the harbors ,  he said . even as a member of the world sky race 's advisory council , mcnealy confesses he does n't know exactly when , or even if , the race will happen . but he hopes hartsell 's dream for this one-of-a-kind event comes to fruition someday .  you 've got to give him credit ,  mcnealy said .  he thinks big .
