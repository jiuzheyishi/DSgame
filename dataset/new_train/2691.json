{"text": "washington in 1980 , nelson mandela was sitting in a south african prison cell , serving a life sentence . on the other side of the world , a young college student named barack obama was riveted by the anti-apartheid movement in south africa and the brewing crusade to free the renowned activist . little did they know that nearly three decades later , the two would have something in common : they would be the first elected black presidents in their respective countries . u.s. president barack obama has made it no secret that he considers nelson mandela one of the greatest influences -- if not the greatest -- in his life and in the lives of countless others . throughout his first five years in office , he has repeatedly referenced mandela , either invoking quotes from the anti-apartheid icon or spreading his messages of freedom and equality .  we have lost one of the most influential , courageous , and profoundly good human beings that any of us will share time with on this earth ,  the president said thursday while marking mandela 's death .  he no longer belongs to us -- he belongs to the ages .  left and right use mandela 's death as opportunity to bash their favorite bogeymen . answering a ` call ' at occidental college in los angeles around 1980 , obama first forayed into political activism â $  a protest against apartheid . it was the beginning of what would become years of studying mandela 's speeches and writings .  in the most modest of ways , i was one of those people who tried to answer his call ,  he wrote in the forward to mandela 's 2010 memoir  conversations with myself .  obama has acknowledged that none of the obstacles he faced growing up compared to those of the victims in south africa , but mandela 's  example helped awaken -lrb- obama -rrb- to the wider world ,  he wrote in the forward .  through his choices , mandela made it clear that we did not have to accept the world as it is -- that we could do our part to seek the world as it should be ,  he added . in his own book ,  dreams of my father ,  obama recalls giving his first public speech , in which he made a plea for the trustees at occidental to divest from south africa .  i really wanted to stay up there , to hear my voice bouncing off the crowd and returning back to me in applause .  following his involvement with the demonstrations , obama began pursuing his interests in public policy , transferring to columbia university where he dug deep into books and courses about race and social justice . after graduation , he became a community organizer in chicago . making history . when mandela was released from prison in 1990 , obama was well into law school at harvard and getting ready to start the next phase of his career . mandela 's funeral , farewell plans : a day by day breakdown . that same month , obama made history of his own â $  though on a much smaller scale . he became the first african-american president of the harvard law review , a story big enough to elicit a headline in the new york times . in his interview with the times , obama said ,  i personally am interested in pushing a strong minority perspective . i 'm fairly opinionated about this ,  he said .  but as president of the law review , i have a limited role as only first among equals .  four years after graduating law school , and not long after mandela won a nobel peace prize and was elected president , obama published  dreams of my father  in 1995 . in the memoir , he lumped mandela in with a group of men whose attributes obama aspired to emulate .  it was into my father 's image , a black man , son of africa , that i 'd packed all the attributes i sought in myself , the attributes of martin and malcolm , dubois and mandela ,  he wrote . a year later , obama was elected to the illinois state senate , a path that would set him on a fast-moving track that landed him a spot on the presidential ballot just 12 years later . ' a personal hero ' as obama made his way up the political ladder , mandela was continuing to spread his influence , campaigning for justice and human rights around the world . he did n't seek reelection in 1999 -- keeping his promise to serve only one term -- and he became intimately involved with aids awareness , a disease that killed his son at the age of 55 in 2005 . obama met mandela for the first time in 2005 . obama , a senator at the time , was riding to a washington event when his office called ; mandela was in town and asked to see him . the two men met at the four seasons hotel . obama : mandela was influential , courageous . after that , obama and mandela had occasional interactions and conversations , including a phone call from mandela after obama was elected president in 2008 . obama called mandela in 2010 after his great-granddaughter was killed in a car crash . while obama considered mandela a champion , he frequently noted he was not alone in his views about the icon .  he 's a personal hero , but i do n't think i 'm unique in that regard ,  he said in senegal .  i think he 's a hero for the world .  during his first year in the oval office , obama was awarded the nobel peace prize -- a decision that sparked controversy , considering that his career on the world stage was only at its infancy at that point . obama was keenly aware of where he stood in line .  compared to some of the giants of the history who 've received this prize , schweitzer and king , marshall and mandela , my accomplishments are slight ,  he said in his acceptance speech , also paying tribute to those who were suffering in their respective fights for freedom and justice around the world .  i can not argue with those who find these men and women -- some known , some obscure to all but those they help -- to be far more deserving of this honor than i.  ` that 's what brings me back here ' on a trip to africa this summer , obama and his family visited mandela 's cell on robben island , a spot obama visited as a senator in 2006 . but this time , he got to bring his two daughters , sasha and malia . life under apartheid : demeaning , often brutal .  for me to be able to bring my daughters there and teach them the history of that place and this country ... that 's a great privilege and a great honor ,  obama told students at the university of cape town in june . with mandela gravely ill , obama did not get to visit him during his trip ; he met with mandela 's family instead . while in south africa , obama noted the  outpouring of love  for mandela , saying it spoke to  the yearning for justice and dignity that transcends boundaries of race and class and faith and country .   that 's what nelson mandela represents ,  he said at a town hall-style meeting with young people in soweto .  that 's what south africa , at its best , can represent to the world , and that 's what brings me back here .  cnn 's gabriella schwarz , brianna keilar and faith karimi contributed to this report .", "summary": " obama has said he considers mandela one of -- if not the -- greatest influence in his life .   in  dreams of my father ,  obama recalls pleading with college trustees to divest from south africa .   obama met mandela for the first time in 2005 .   with mandela gravely ill , obama did not get to visit him during his last trip to south africa .
