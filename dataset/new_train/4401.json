{"text": "basma jandali spent days consumed with fear . her brother was stranded in the syrian city of homs , where government forces have killed hundreds of people this week . she did n't know he was alive until they spoke friday .  i feel relieved now ,  she said . her brother is one of the lucky ones . several hundred thousand people remain in homs , a city suddenly peppered with snipers and surrounded by soldiers . syrian forces unleashed an assault this week that has destroyed clinics and homes . it has dramatically altered the rhythm of everyday life . parents keep their kids at home , afraid to send them to school . they get food from activists delivering flour and sugar at night . those who do venture out use street smarts -- doctors make rounds at night , for example , jumping walls to avoid checkpoints . people have a tough time getting soap , toothbrushes , shampoo , and medications .  the simple act of opening your door could be the last thing you do in your life ,  said dima moussa , an attorney in chicago and syrian activist who opposes the regime of president bashar al-assad . the syrian government blames the 11-month-old nationwide uprising on terrorist groups . video images from citizen journalists and accounts relayed to the outside world by phone suggest otherwise . mohamad al homsy , an activist from homs who fled to turkey before coming to the united states , said he gets a sense of the danger and desperation in homs in phone calls home . his wife told him that their 6-year-old daughter in homs has nightmares from the sounds of bombing . she told him the girl drew a picture with crayons of the family , a tank , and a fire .  can you imagine kids drawing this instead of the tree ?  al homsy said .  that made me so angry .  malaz alatassi , a doctor who lived in homs before moving to detroit , said friends and family tell him it 's hard to go out and buy or find supplies , like bread or heating oil .  if you look out the window , you risk being shot ,  he said . smugglers and activists wait until night to deliver flour , sugar and medicine to people huddled in fear at home , he and al homsy said .  that 's risky ,  alatassi said .  there are reports that many of those people are killed .  businesses have closed . government employees work on and off . along with a breakdown of medical care , there 's no psychiatric help for stress , alatassi said . many people read the quran or the bible , jandali said . most syrians are muslim . about 1 in 10 are christian .  the only thing they do is pray ,  said jandali , who lives in new jersey  that is the only thing available to them .  fear pervades life in other parts of syria , too .  we all have martyrs and injuries in our families ,  said abu omar , who lives in the southern syrian province of quneitra . because of that , he said ,  we can all relate to each other .  gas and food are hard to find , he said . medicine is scarce . hospitals have little equipment -- and what they do have is old .  people depend on each other and help each other with simple medicine ,  omar said . relatives have lost track of each other in the chaos that has engulfed syria for nearly a year .  i have n't seen my mother for a month and a half even though she lives about seven or eight kilometers away ,  omar said . yasmeen , an activist in the west , said most of her relatives in syria dropped out of school and left their jobs . she recounts tales of regime forces using violence to bring the opposition to its knees . thugs attacked and pummeled a cousin involved in the protest movement , she said , and his dad was arrested and beaten , as well . she 's heard of people who died after burning wood at home to keep warm -- they had no other fuel to use . aside from the shelling and gunfire , she said , a lack of money and health care is taking a toll , too .  a lot of people die ,  she said .", "summary": " everyday life in syria is a struggle .    opening your door could be the last thing you do in your life ,  an activist says .   one child has nightmares , draws picture of a tank , a fire and her family .   people suffer from shortages of food and medications .
