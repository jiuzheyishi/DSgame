{"text": "washington a compromise amendment intended to ease congressional passage of sweeping immigration legislation easily won senate approval wednesday . the 69-29 vote set up a procedural motion immediately afterward to limit debate on the roughly 1,200-page bill , which would provide an eventual path to citizenship for millions of immigrants living illegally in the country . while some further amendments still could be considered , the measure appeared headed to a final senate vote by the end of the week after the procedural motion passed in a 67-31 vote . backers of the bill want the democratic-led senate to pass it with a solid majority to demonstrate growing bipartisan momentum as the measure heads to the gop-controlled house of representatives . the compromise amendment by republicans john hoeven of north dakota and bob corker of tennessee would increase border security , a demand by conservative opponents of the immigration bill . justices could put an end to hard choice for gay couples .  i hope our colleagues in the house of representatives will follow the senate 's lead , and work to pass bipartisan reform that both democrats and republicans can support ,  senate majority leader harry reid , d-nevada , said before wednesday 's votes . conservative gop sen. chuck grassley of iowa , an opponent of the senate bill , conceded it s likely to pass and called on house republicans to make things right .  i expect the house of representatives to fix this miserable failure ,  grassley said . republican leaders say the house will consider the issue in several smaller proposals instead of a comprehensive single measure , a process that would allow more debate and votes on specific provisions . earlier wednesday , house speaker john boehner reiterated to gop members that he opposes having the house take up any senate immigration legislation , according to rep. john fleming . fleming , a louisiana republican , said boehner told the weekly policy meeting that the house would work on its own immigration bills . if enacted , the bill would create a path to citizenship for roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants while enhancing security along the border with mexico . among other things , the compromise border security amendment would add 20,000 border agents , complete 700 miles of fence along the boundary with mexico , and deploy $ 3.2 billion in technology upgrades similar to equipment used by u.s. forces in iraq and afghanistan . opinion : protect rights of immigrant whistle-blowers . the proposal also includes stronger worker eligibility verification standards and border entry-exit controls . most undocumented immigrants would be eligible for permanent residency only after those five conditions have been met and verified by the department of homeland security . hoeven and corker introduced the compromise amendment last week , saying it incorporated proposals from other senators to try to fix a broken immigration system . grassley and other opponents argued the legislation amounts to an amnesty for immigrants who broke the law by living illegally in america . they argued the promises of increased border security before giving undocumented immigrants permanent residency would end up proving empty .  it does nothing to change the legalization-first philosophy and does little more than offer false promises that the american people can no longer tolerate ,  grassley said . if eventually passed into law and signed by president barack obama , the bill would be the first major immigration reform since 1986 , during the second reagan administration . grassley conceded he voted for the 1986 measure , which also called for increased border security , and called his support then a mistake he regrets . farm bill failure portends problems for immigration in the house . the 2013 version was drafted by a senate  gang of eight  composed of four democrats and four republicans motivated by political and policy needs . both parties concede the nation 's immigration system is broken , and some republicans believe that gop refusal to work with democrats on the matter would mean a repeat of the 2012 presidential election in which obama won a strong majority of the hispanic vote . however , other republicans fear that providing a path to legal status for millions of undocumented immigrants would bolster support for democrats from the new voters . florida sen. marco rubio , the most prominent republican in the  gang of eight ,  told cnn 's dana bash last week that he understands  why conservatives are upset .   they 've seen all these promises in the past that have n't been delivered ,  rubio said . but the status quo on immigration  is hurting america ,  he added .  and if nothing passes , then this disaster that we have now , that 's what 's going to stay in place .  opinion : why cops should back immigration reform . cnn 's alan silverleib , ted barrett and deirdre walsh contributed to this report .", "summary": " new : a separate vote limits further debate , setting up a final vote as soon as thursday .   the senate easily passes a compromise amendment to increase border security .   a final vote on the immigration bill could occur by the end of the week .   it would increase border security and provide an eventual path to citizenship for millions .
