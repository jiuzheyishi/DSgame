{"text": "many people intending to get fit this year will have already seen their resolution crumble as the effort to actually get to the gym proves as exhausting as a workout itself . but help is at hand in the form of the irrepressible 80s lycra legend mr motivator who has come up with a way for people to get fit quick in the comfort of their own homes . with the assistance of denise van outen , the fitness guru has created a series of two minute workout videos - one of which you can view below - which can be done every morning in the time it takes to cook your breakfast porridge in the microwave . scroll down for video . putting her through her paces : mr motivator shows denise van outen how his two minute workouts can be done in the kitchen . denise , who recently made it to the final of strictly come dancing , told mailonline the routines are a great way to incorporate exercise into your life if , like her , you do n't enjoy going to the gym . she said : ` i 'm not a gym bunny , i do n't have time and i find the gym a bit boring . but i ca n't use the excuse that i ca n't get to the gym with this workout because you can do it in your kitchen . ` it 's free and a good way to . kick start your day . you can even do it in your pyjamas before you have a . shower and get dressed . ' specialist equipment not needed : water bottles can double as weights . the 38-year-old , who is mother to daughter betsy , aged two , said she finds gym workouts too time consuming . ` i 've always tried to keep fit , especially since i became a mum , ' she admitted as she teamed up with mr motivator for the campaign for quaker . ` but going to the gym can take half the day by the time you 've got there , worked out , showered and changed afterwards . ' i try to incorporate fitness into my daily routine instead . for example , i power walk up a steep hill with the pram when i take betsy to nursery rather than driving . ' the tv presenter admitted she needed to be in shape for her stint on strictly - and the upcoming arena tour - because of the skimpy costumes she has to wear . working up a thirst : mr motivator said the workouts are perfect to do before breakfast . ' i felt really exposed in the charleston costume because it was cut away , ' she said . ` i 'm pushing 40 , standing against dani harmer who is 23 ! my legs are quite toned from exercising but i did n't want to show off my stomach . ' now thanks to her training for strictly , she admitted she 's the fittest - but also the most exhausted - she 's ever been . as she does n't have a nanny , her and husband lee mead had to juggle care of betsy around her strictly training and his work commitments . denise said while she enjoyed every minute of strictly , she had ` mother 's guilt ' for the time it took her away from her little girl . now she has more free time again , denise said the two-minute exercises are a great way for her to spend time with betsy while also teaching her about the benefits of exercise . mr motivator - real name derrick evans - agrees it 's important for both young and old people to keep fit , and his two minute workouts are a great way for people to begin . revealing : denise said she 's glad she 's currently in shape given the skimpy outfits she had to wear in strictly . he said : ` two minutes is no time at all . it wo n't get you super fit but it will give you a start and that could be the start to a new you . ` if you can do two minutes of exercise that you have never done before , you 'll feel great about that and then you 'll want to build upon it . ' he said it 's important to make exercise a habit and then it will become as second nature as personal hygiene . ` when people ask me if i have days when i do n't want to exercise , i ask them ,  do you have days when you do n't want to brush your teeth ?  . ` if i went out and forgot to brush my teeth , i would n't feel same , i 'd have to go and buy . a toothbrush or some chewing gum . and until i brush my teeth , i do n't feel right . it 's the same with exercise if you get into that zone and . make it second nature . ' mr motivator said his ` message from 20 years ago is still the same - let 's get moving ' , but admits they ` have n't re-invented the wheel ' with the two-minute routines . ` there 's burpies , star bursts , press up . and sits ups , it 's about keeping the intensity for 30 seconds without specialist equipment , ' he said . he added that he loved working with denise . ` she was great . if i was n't married and she was n't married , we could become an item ! ' he joked . ` she picked it up quite easily which goes to show you can do it even if you have n't done this kind of exercise before .
