{"text": "a recent dust-up at msnbc is driving the latest round of  gotcha  between the right and the left . a host has apologized , actually tearing up as she tried to make amends for a segmet that did n't provide information , only insult . and yet , even as the target of the attack says it 's time to move on , the right is still incensed . and the left still seems uncomfortable talking about what happened . and it prompts me to kick off the new year with a confession : i 'm bored with both the right and the left . in politics , everyone lies . no one tells the truth . they all push their own agendas . everything is divided into these camps of blue and red , liberals and conservatives . the order of the day is situational ethics . your guy says something wrong , and you defend him because he 's your guy . next week , your opponent says the same exact thing , and you excoriate him because , well , he 's your opponent . where is the consistency ? you wo n't find much of it in the game of gotcha . the first rule is that you can constantly reinvent yourself . the second rule is that no other player can remind you of the person you were 10 minutes ago . the third is that , once you catch someone on the opposing team saying something intolerant or insensitive , you get to jump all over them and act high and mighty -- that is , until the next time that someone on your team says something intolerant or insensitive . when that happens , you get to act surprised that anyone took offense and accuse the offended of having thin skin . to be sure , there was plenty of offensive material in phil robertson 's recent comments to gq magazine appearing to liken homosexuality to bestiality and other deviant behavior . as if that were n't bad enough , the star of the a&e network 's  duck dynasty  also appeared to minimize the mistreatment that african-americans suffered in the south before the civil rights movement . the left could n't wait to pounce . now consider what happened when msnbc host melissa harris-perry and her equally self-righteous guests took a break from portraying themselves as morally superior to conservatives and decided it would be hilarious to turn a baby -- specifically , an adopted african-american baby -- into a punchline . the three used a year-end segment dubbed  look back on 2013 and laugh  to poke fun at the adoption of kieran romney , who this year found himself in a family christmas photo , atop the lap of his new grandfather , mitt . to some on the left , the fact that kieran is black , and his grandpa is n't , is a real side splitter . opinion : why romney adoption jokes hurt . upon seeing the photo , guest pia glenn was so tickled that the actress burst into song :  one of these things is not like the others ! one of these things just is n't the same . and that little baby , front and center , would be the one .  harris-perry laughed at that crack and joked that she 'd like to see kieran grow up to marry north west , the daughter of reality star kim kardashian and rapper kanye west .  can you imagine mitt romney and kanye west as in-laws ?  she said . the other guest was not to be outdone . comedian dean obeidallah chimed in with this :  i think this picture is great . it really sums up the diversity of the republican party , the rnc . at the convention , they find the one black person .  liberals like to think of themselves as more enlightened than anyone else . but if this is what passes for  enlightened  these days , i 'd hate to hear what ignorant sounds like . it 's pretty clear that while the focus was on the baby -lrb-  one of these things ...  and  one black person  -rrb- , the real target was mitt romney . that is , this was about politics . it was about left and right , and that 's boring . what interests me now is how people treat one another , how we interact with each other during the relatively short time we have here on earth . that is what is going to endure when we 're gone , not who we voted for in a given election or our party affiliation . if you 're still looking for a new year 's resolution , how 's this one ? let 's treat each other better . using a baby -- let alone an adopted baby -- to score cheap political points is not how we should treat one another . that 's what happened here . once politics took over , common decency and good manners went out the window . harris-perry , glenn , and obeidallah all apologized . but , would n't you know it ? even that was a mixed bag . first the good news . harris-perry did a great job . a day after the incident , she apologized on twitter  without reservation or qualification .  then , she opened her show saturday with more of the same and veered off into the larger issue of keeping the families of political figures off limits .  adults who enter into public life implicitly consent to having less privacy ,  she said .  but their families , and especially their children , should not be treated callously or thoughtlessly . my intention was not malicious , but i broke the ground rule that families are off-limits , and for that i am sorry .  now the bad news . her guests were not nearly so gracious . in fact , their apologies were less about contrition and forgiveness , and more about politics . glenn tweeted :  in a spontaneous reaction to a photo , my disdain for mitt romney 's political platform led me to inadvertently insult adoptive families .  in a piece for the daily beast , obeidallah -lrb- who has appeared on cnn shows and written op-eds for cnn.com -rrb- explained that he was in hot water because  i told a joke that many on the right -- and even a few in the middle -- did n't like  and because  those on the right who monitor msnbc were outraged  and because  right-wing media outlets  had piled on . he said that  being attacked by right-wing publications  is not new for him and vowed  to the self-appointed right-wing pundits  that he will  never stop calling out the wrongs and hypocrisy of the right .  all right , then . still , obeidallah wrote ,  i want to sincerely apologize to the romney family if anyone was offended by my joke .  for his part , romney told fox news that he 's ready to move on from the controversy . so should we all . interestingly , the three jokesters only apologized after word of the segment got out and conservative media outlets kicked up a fuss . you see , apparently when you have a show on msnbc , no one watches or hears what you have to say until someone else repeats it . now , that 's funny . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of ruben navarrette .", "summary": " ruben navarrette : dust-up over msnbc segment is latest round of  gotcha  in right-left wars .   he says the predictable cycle of insults exacts a price in the way we treat other people .    duck dynasty  star 's comments and the romney adoption  jokes  should be off-limits , he says .   navarrette : in 2014 , let 's transcend mean-spirited efforts to score political points .
