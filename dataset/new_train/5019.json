{"text": "thousands of gay couples in civil partnerships will be able to ` convert ' their relationships to marriage in return for a # 100 administration fee . around 50,000 couples will be able to change the legal status of their relationship by simply filling in a form and popping it in the post along with a cheque to cover the cost of issuing a marriage certificate . in effect , the change in the law will mean that some gay couples will be able to get married without even having a wedding , with the result that some couples could become married in secret . love-ly law : the new legislation means civil partners will be able to change the legal status of their relationship to marriage . but tory mp peter bone said the decision would further undermine the status of marriage . mr bone said : ` the government is sending out the very dispiriting message that it does n't care about marriage . ` the idea that people will be able to get married by simply filling in a form and paying # 100 is a further dilution of the institution of marriage that the government claims to care about . that is clearly not what marriage means to millions of married couples in this country . ' criticism : tory mp peter bone says the government 's decision undermines the status of marriage . documents issued by the department for . culture , media and sport yesterday suggested that couples in civil . partnerships will have a choice about whether or not to hold a separate . ceremony to mark the conversion of their relationship to marriage . ` we will enable couples to have a ceremony upon conversion should they wish to do so . ` the ceremony would have no legal effect and would be similar to existing ceremonies allowing couples to renew their vows -lrb- and would therefore incur a separate cost -rrb- . accordingly a couple would be able to have such a ceremony on religious premises , if agreed with the religious organisation and any representatives of that organisation who would be involved in the ceremony . ' despite the change , married couples will not be able to convert their relationships into civil partnerships . officials said there was ` no justification or requirement for introducing such a process ' . and , to the dismay of some campaigners , ministers refused to extend civil partnerships legislation to cover heterosexual relationships . gay rights campaigner peter tatchell . condemned the decision , saying : ` retaining the ban on opposite-sex civil . partnerships is a huge failing . it deprives heterosexual couples of . legal equality . i strongly support the right of straight people to equal . treatment . ' wedding bells : if civil partners so wish they can have a ceremony to mark their conversion which would function as a renewing of their vows and not have any legal effect . he added : ` under the government 's plans , gay couples will soon have legal privileges over heterosexual couples . ` there will be two forms of official state recognition for lesbian and gay couples : the present system of civil partnerships plus marriage . heterosexual couples will have only one option - marriage . ' in a further change , heterosexual couples will no longer have to divorce if one partner has a sex change . if both partners agree they will be able to retain their married status . the government announced today that it will introduce a bill next year legalizing gay marriage - but banning the church of england from conducting same-sex ceremonies .", "summary": " conversion would see same-sex couple able to change the legal status of their civil partnership .   equality campaigners condemn decision not to allow straight marriages to convert into civil partnerships .   tory mp peter bone say it undermines marriage .
