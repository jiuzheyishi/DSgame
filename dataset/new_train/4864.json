{"text": "iran has named a member of the radical student group that seized the u.s. embassy in tehran and held americans hostage for more than a year to be its next ambassador to the united nations . hamid aboutalebi , was a member of the muslim students following the imam 's line , the group of militants who seized the u.s. embassy on november 4 , 1979 , holding 52 americans hostage for 444 days . a u.s. official said the state department has not yet responded to aboutalebi 's visa application to represent iran at the united nations . aboutalebi is a veteran diplomat who has served as iran 's ambassador to australia , belgium , italy , and the european union . he has also held high-profile posts in the iranian foreign ministry . he currently works in the political affairs office of president hassan rouhani and is believed to be close to the iranian leader , who is widely viewed as a moderate with a reformist agenda . but the choice of aboutalebi could complicate president barack obama 's efforts to re-engage with tehran after the election of rouhani and negotiate a comprehensive agreement to curb iran 's nuclear program with five other world powers . with no formal relations between the united states and iran , the iranian mission to the united nations is tehran 's only diplomatic operation in the united states and has played a role in facilitating unofficial exchanges of messages between the two nations . in an interview with iranian media , aboutalebi said he served as translator and negotiator , but denied taking part in the initial occupation of the embassy . state department spokeswoman marie harf declined to comment if the united states was aware that aboutalebi was a member of the group which seized the embassy . she said the united states has a process to review all visa applications , but the applications themselves remained confidential .  anyone can submit a visa application , and it will be evaluated as we do all visa applications , in accordance with our procedures ,  she said .  we do n't speculate on what the outcome might be .  but the controversy , first reported this weekend by bloomberg , could spark demands from congress to deny aboutalebi 's visa . that would be an unusual step given the united states is obligated to grant entry visas to representatives of u.n. member-states in accordance with a 1947 agreement signed with the world body . last year , sudanese president omar al-bashir decided not to attend the u.n. general assembly when the state department failed to respond to his visa application . the international criminal court has issued warrants for bashir 's arrest and referral for trial in the hague for crimes against humanity . although the united states is not a party to the court , the icc has asked the united states to surrender him if he enters american territory . even if the united state granted aboutalebi a visa , he would not be free to move about the united states . as a representative of a country listed as a state sponsor of terrorism by the state department , aboutalebi would be confined to a radius of 25 miles from manhattan , just as diplomats from north korea and syria are . still , former american hostage barry rosen said it would be a  disgrace  if washington gave a visa to aboutalebi and called on the obama administration to deny his application .  it may be a precedent but if the president and the congress do n't condemn this act by the islamic republic , then our captivity and suffering for 444 days at the hands of iran was for nothing ,  he said in a statement .  he can never set foot on american soil . ", "summary": " member of group who seized american hostages in 1979 now a diplomat .   hamid aboutalebi named as iran 's next ambassador to the united nations .   the state department has not responded to his visa application .   he 's a veteran diplomat who has served in posts in europe .
