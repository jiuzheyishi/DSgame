{"text": "an alabama man convicted of raping his former neighbor and friend was sentenced november 13 to 20 years in a state penitentiary on the lead charge , and 10 years each on the lesser offenses . except that he was n't . the victim , courtney andrews , told cnn she was outraged by the sentencing .  i do n't know how any of this is possible .  austin clem , 25 , was convicted of one count of forcible rape and two counts of second-degree rape for attacks that andrews said started when she was 13 .  honestly , i did n't understand when i first heard the sentence ,  said andrews , now 20 .  i was expecting him to spend a long time in prison .  she said she had n't talked about the abuse because of threats .  i had to grow up at a very , very young age , and i know what it 's like to have your life threatened and that no one will understand me .  even though the sentencing order says on its face that clem will serve his time in a state penitentiary , that same order adds that he will serve none of his time in a state penitentiary . people are outraged . moreover , they are confused . was this a legal sentence ? if so , was it a moral sentence ? ` suspended ' sentences : when ` incarceration ' means anything but . people have every reason to be confused . sentencing statutes are routinely complex , and alabama 's is no exception . most state sentencing schemes follow a common theme , arriving at an individual 's punishment based on the 1 -rrb- gravity of the offense ; and 2 -rrb- the defendant 's prior record ; which can then be aggravated or mitigated by any other factors the court wants to consider . lately , in light of the marissa alexander case , mandatory minimum sentences have been harshly criticized .  mando-mins  as they are sometimes called , force a judge to sentence a minimum number of years , preventing a judge from considering the individual defendant 's unique circumstances , and showing mercy where appropriate . the austin clem case highlights the issue at the other end of the spectrum : whether judges can have too much discretion in sentencing convicted felons . in the clem case , the judge 's discretion came from his authority to impose a  split sentence .  let 's look at the lead charge and the sentence , taken verbatim from the order of sentence :  count i - twenty -lrb- 20 -rrb- years in the state penitentiary , split sentence , to serve two -lrb- 2 -rrb- years in -lsb- a community-based program -rsb- , balance suspended and placed on three -lrb- 3 -rrb- years supervised probation .  yes , you read that right . it essentially says : twenty years in prison -- except that it will be zero years , and none of it in prison . the judge likely relied upon section 15-18-8 of the alabama code , which explicitly gives judges discretion to suspend a significant portion of a defendant 's sentence . a suspended sentence is incarceration in name only : the defendant will serve that time out of custody . clem received 20 years . in this jurisdiction , for sentences between 15 and 20 years , it appears that a mandatory minimum applies : the judge must order at least three and up to five years , and then may suspend the rest . here 's where it gets strange : the alabama supreme court has held that even the incarceration portion of a split sentence -lrb- the three-year minimum -rrb- may be suspended . so 20 years can mean zero years . why give so much discretion to judges ? in alabama , the rules of procedure direct judges to consider alternatives to long prison terms . why ? the rules cite skyrocketing costs associated with actual confinement and call attention to prison overcrowding . that prison overcrowding leads to uncertainty : in other words , the judges do n't know that the prison can even accommodate their sentence , so they might as well mete out a sentence that can actually be carried out . an illegal sentence vs. an immoral sentence . for many , it does n't matter that this might have been a legal sentence . the outrage is directed not at the legality , but the morality of the punishment . did the judge have a moral obligation to incarcerate clem ? what would you have done ? would you have given credence to the defense 's argument that the sex was consensual ? is it more important to you as a judge that clem get the counseling that sex offenders desperately need ? or is it more important that he be isolated from society ? the idea of punishment for criminals is justified by a few different goals . incarceration serves to quarantine criminals and protect the rest of us in society from them . another goal of punishment is rehabilitation . like it or not , most sex offenders will eventually serve their sentences and be back on the street . given the risk of repeat offenses , rehabilitation of these felons could be the most critical factor in protecting society . but punishment also recognizes simple retribution as a goal . retribution is the idea that a punishment should , in theory , be equivalent to the crime . while retribution can also achieve vengeance , it serves a more practical purpose . a society that fails to punish offenders risks citizens taking matters into their own hands -- which threatens the stability of the society itself . so , if you are a retribution-type judge , you 'd probably sentence clem to long-term incarceration -- even though the legislature has effectively told you that , because of overcrowding , he might not serve that whole sentence . if you are a rehabilitation-type judge , or you worry about clem 's dependents , you might do as this judge did , and focus on the rehabilitation , with the idea that more progress can be made on the outside than on the inside . as long as the sentence is legal , as a judge , the choice is yours : do you focus on retribution ? or rehabilitation ? one thing is for certain , you may not agree with the judge 's sentence in the austin clem case . indeed , the prosecution in this case is not going gently into the good night . the prosecution has now asked an appeals court to fix what it calls an illegal sentence , claiming the judge had no authority to impose the two-year minimum , and should have at least imposed the three year minimum . that appears to be a correct reading of the law . of course , if the judge can suspend the entire sentence anyway , including the mandatory minimum , is it a distinction without a difference ? the prosecution also claims that felons convicted of first-degree rape are excluded by law from community-based programs , because rape is so fundamentally a crime of violence . if the judge misread the law here , the prosecution may succeed . if so , the court will have to resentence clem -- but if the judge can still suspend the entire sentence , could clem get an even better deal ? if you ca n't accept it , then your beef is not only with the judge . your beef is with the alabama legislature and the alabama courts that enacted not only the rules , but warned the justice system that it simply could not accommodate prison terms . your beef is with the same prisons that do n't have enough beds , leading to the crisis . finally , your beef is with the alabama supreme court , which sanctioned this practice . because even if this sentence is ultimately legal , you may still conclude that it is an immoral one . unfortunately , there 's no appeals court for that . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of danny cevallos .", "summary": " an alabama man was sentenced to no prison time for rape conviction .   danny cevallos says alabama law , rules give judges discretion to suspend prison terms .   he says even if the sentence is legal , it may not be a moral one .   cevallos : people who object should blame legislature and courts , in addition to judge .
