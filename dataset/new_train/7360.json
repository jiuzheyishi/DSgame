{"text": "britain could open up to 12 new ` superjails ' with room for 3,000 inmates each . officials are studying plans by the influential policy exchange think-tank to close 30 ` run down and poorly located ' prisons which are hugely expensive to run . kevin lockyer , an ex-prison governor and deputy director at the ministry of justice , said they should be replaced by 10 -12 giant new jails . with up to 3,000 prisoners each , they would be twice the size of the existing largest institution in the country , 1,600 place hmp oakwood near wolverhampton . changing the prison system : ` old and inefficient ' prisons like victorian-era wormwood scrubs could be closed down . mr lockyer claims the plan could save more than # 600 million a year on completion - 20 per cent of the prison budget and equivalent to around 9 per cent of the moj 's entire departmental budget . justice secretary chris grayling said it was ` absolutely right ' to try to find ways of reducing the cost of the country 's ` old and inefficient ' prison estate . the idea of opening huge jails has proved hugely controversial in the past - with critics claiming they would be more likely to suffer from riots . but mr lockyer said the new prisons would be ` materially different ' from labour 's 2007 plans for titan prisons , which would have held 2,500 inmates . they would have a campus-style design with space for education and employment . mr lockyer , who was governor at two victorian-era prisons , said : ` we are busting the myth that small is beautiful when it comes to prisons . in fact , newer prisons outperform older ones , regardless of their size . largest : oakwood prison near wolverhampton currently holds the most inmates in the country . ` we need to build larger , newer facilities that use the most up-to-date technology to monitor inmates . ` new hub prisons will not only reduce reoffending and improve safety - they will also deliver vast financial savings and better value for money for the taxpayer . ' mr lockyer said the construction of the new prisons could be financed through public sector borrowing , private finance or development finance and claims the savings would amount to around # 10 billion over a 25-year repayment period . he said the government should focus on cutting the cost per prisoner , rather than simply closing prisons and reducing prisoner numbers . the report shows that a quarter of prisons are victorian or older while a further quarter were built in the 1960s and 1970s , often to poor standards and designs with poor materials . reform : justice secretary chris grayling said it was ` absolutely right ' to investigate ways of reducing the cost of our old prisons . it recommends locating new prisons on brownfield sites near main transport routes and to hold more prisoners as close to home as possible . the prisons should be designed using cutting-edge architecture , with technologies such as biometric security systems , he added . mr lockyer also recommends allowing private providers to compete on a level playing field with the public sector to manage and run the new establishments . among the prisons recommended for closure by mr lockyer are brixton , feltham , holloway , pentonville , wandsworth and wormwood scrubs . last night , mr grayling said : ` the report is absolutely right to highlight that much of our prison estate is old and inefficient , and that we need to bring its cost down . upgrade : old prisons such as wormwood scrubs in london may be replaced with cutting-edge architecture and technologies like biometric security systems . ` we are constantly reviewing it to ensure that it meets the needs of the prison population and provides the best value for money for the taxpayer . ' i never want the courts to be in a position where they can not send a criminal to prison because there is no place available . so we have to move as fast as we can to replace the older parts of our prison system . ` that 's why we are moving ahead with immediate plans for new capacity and developing proposals for the next generation of prisons . ' but juliet lyon , director of the prison reform trust , said : ` with crime falling and community sentences and treatment to tackle addictions working to reduce reoffending , it would be a gigantic mistake to pour taxpayers ' money down a super-sized , big brother prison building drain . ` there is scope to close some outdated prisons and reinvest the money saved into effective community solutions to crime . '", "summary": " ` superjails ' would be twice as large as 1,600-place oakwood prison .   prisons including pentonville and wormwood scrubs recommended to close . "}
