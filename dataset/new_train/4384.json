{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- a black man who was physically stopped from getting on the paris metro by soccer fans says they should be  locked up  and that he intends to make a complaint . filmed on a mobile phone by a bystander waiting on the platform of richelieu-drouot station , the incident took place before a champions league tie between english club chelsea and paris saint-germain on tuesday . the group , who appear to be chelsea supporters , can be heard chanting :  we 're racist , we 're racist and that 's the way we like it .  the french newspaper le parisien has tracked down the metro passenger at the center of the incident , identifying him only as souleymane s , a father-of-three who was born in paris .  what happened should not go unpunished ,  he told le parisien .  these people , these english supporters , should be found , punished and should be locked up .  having talked about it now gives me the courage to go to the police with a complaint . in any case , i intend to go to anti racism associations .  on his way home from his work as a chief operating officer in business near the metro station , souleymane s says he was not surprised to find himself a victim of an apparent racist incident .  they said things to me in english but i did n't really understand the meaning of what they said ,  he explained to le parisien .  i do n't speak a word of english .  i understood that chelsea supporters were involved and i made the link with the psg match .  i also understood that they were attacking me because of the color of my skin .  you know , i live with racism , i was n't really surprised by what happened to me , even if it was the first time in the metro .  i stayed for a long time in front of them . one person came to say that i had been brave to resist people like that .  no -lrb- metro -rrb- user took up my defense but , in any case , what could one do ?  while the metro moved out of the richelieu-drouot station with the chelsea fans on board , souleymane s waited to catch the next train and went home . the 33-year-old said he did not tell anyone about what happened , even though he realized he had lost his phone during the scramble with the soccer supporters . he did not know the altercation had been filmed by british expatriate paul nolan , who broke the story by sending the video to british newspaper the guardian , which then posted it on its website .  i returned home without telling anyone about what had happened , not my wife nor my children ,  said souleymane s told le parisien .  what would i say to my children ? that papa was shoved in the metro because he was black ? that 's useless .  souleymane s may have been unaware of the ramifications of the incident but it has acted as a catalyst to more soul searching about soccer 's seeming inability to root out racism in the global game . chelsea has vowed to support any criminal action brought against its fans involved in the paris altercation .  such behavior is abhorrent and has no place in football or society ,  the english premier league club said in a statement released wednesday .  we will support any criminal action against those involved in such behavior , and should evidence point to the involvement of chelsea season ticket holders or members the club will take the strongest possible action against them including banning orders .  both french and british police have said they will analyze the footage . uefa , the body which governs european football , said it was appalled by the footage , but as it occurred outside of the stadium it could not take any punitive action . sepp blatter , the president of football 's global governing body fifa , also took to twitter to register his disapproval .  i also condemn the actions of a small group of chelsea fans in paris ,  tweeted blatter .  there is no place for racism in football !  queens park rangers boss chris ramsey -- the only black manager in the english premier league -- was asked to comment on the incident in paris during his media conference , thursday .  i do n't believe they are chelsea fans or fans of football ,  said ramsey .  i believe they are acting in a manner which we all think is a thing of the past .  those views are intrinsic in everyday life . i 've been saying for a long time these are social issues which manifest themselves in the football world .  it would be good to see what the authorities are going to do to either weed these people out , what sanctions they 're going to enforce , to try to make this an avoidable situation in the future .  this is not the first racism allegation to be leveled against london club chelsea in recent times . in 2012 , team captain john terry was banned for four matches and fined $ 356,000 for racially abusing queens park rangers defender anton ferdinand . terry was , however , found not guilty of any criminal wrongdoing at westminster magistrates ' court in july of the same year . former manchester united and england defender rio ferdinand , the brother of anton ferdinand , questioned whether football has the power to eradicate racism .  the racist scene on the metro with the chelsea fans - disgraceful behavior obviously . but can football change this ? does it have the power ?  he wrote on twitter , thursday .  football has come a long way since the 70 's & 80 's but are we all guilty of becoming a bit complacent ?  football has done a lot over the years to combat racism . . but society has to do more to make change or is there too much hatred in society ?  opinion : not all soccer fans are racist hooligans .", "summary": " a black man abused on paris metro by chelsea ` fans ' wants his attackers to be punished .   the man identified as souleymane s. intends to make a police complaint .   he was speaking in interview with le parisien newspaper .
