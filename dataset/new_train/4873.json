{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- shin dong-hyuk 's horrific descriptions of his time in a north korean prison camp became a best-selling book , made him a key witness before the united nations and grabbed headlines around the world . he was one of the most high-profile north korean defectors , winning several human rights awards and inspiring a documentary as his memoir was translated into 27 languages . now the publisher of the book and its author say shin -- who claims to have been born in and escaped from a north korean prison camp -- has revealed that parts of the story he told were n't true . shin may have spent most of his life in north korea at a different prison camp , rather than the total control zone that formed the title of his biography . shin 's accounts of his time in the gulag have been widely reported in interviews with media including cnn . he also wrote an opinion piece describing his experiences for cnn digital . do n't discount n. korean stories after defector 's recanting , advocates say . blaine harden , author of the book  escape from camp 14 ,  said in a statement on his website over the weekend that shin had changed  key parts of his story .   on friday , jan. 16 , i learned that shin dong-hyuk , the north korean prison camp survivor who is the subject of ` escape from camp 14 , ' had told friends an account of his life that differed substantially from my book ,  harden said .  i contacted shin , pressing him to detail the changes and explain why he had misled me .  harden declined to provide additional details to cnn , but published a lengthy explanation on his website . a washington post story based on information harden said he had provided to the newspaper said  the most horrific details  of shin 's story  still stand ,  but some of the times and places of the events in his accounts were wrong .  from a human rights perspective , he was still brutally tortured , but he moved things around ,  harden told the post , where he worked as a reporter for 28 years . shin did not immediately respond to a request from cnn for comment . in a post on his facebook page , he does n't go into details about the purported discrepancies , but he includes a link to the post 's story and apologizes to his supporters .  this particular past of mine that i so badly wanted to cover up can no longer be hidden , nor do i want it to be ,  he says .  to those who have supported me , trusted me and believed in me all this time , i am so very grateful and at the same time so very sorry to each and every single one of you .  inconsistencies highlighted . shin  significantly revised details of his early life ,  said harden in a statement . the inaccuracies include the following : . • in the book , in his united nations testimony and in interviews with media including cnn , shin has detailed torture and abuse he claimed occurred in a notorious prison known as camp 14 . shin told harden on friday that he 'd actually been transferred with his mother and brother to a less restrictive prison camp , camp 18 , when he was six years old . it was there , not at camp 14 , where shin now says he witnessed authorities execute his mother and brother . • shin had previously said that he had lived his entire life in camp 14 before escaping in 2005 . he now says he escaped from camp 18 twice before -- in 1999 and 2001 , wrote harden in his statement . during his second escape attempt from camp 18 , he was caught in china and repatriated to north korea . first , he was sent to camp 18 and later transferred to camp 14 for torture and punishment , wrote harden . • shin now says he was 20 years old when he was tortured as a punishment for escaping , wrote harden . his original account indicated that he was tortured when he was 13 for plotting to escape . shin had been saying that he was tortured when he was a teenager since his arrival to south korea in 2006 . • shin had described in the book that his finger was chopped off by an angry guard after he dropped a sewing machine in camp 14 . now , shin told harden that his finger was mangled as a guard pulled out his fingernails as punishment for escaping .  when i agreed to share my experience for the book , i found it was too painful to think about some of the things that happened ,  shin told harden .  so i made a compromise in my mind . i altered some details that i thought would n't matter . i did n't want to tell exactly what happened in order not to relive these painful moments all over again .  shin told harden that he thought that dates , places and circumstances were not all that significant , according to the author 's statement . challenges with north korea accounts . accounts from north korean defectors are often difficult to confirm , with lack of documents and the regime 's general secrecy . harden stated that he was working with the publisher to amend the book . it 's unclear what action the book 's publisher will take in response to the discrepancies in shin 's story .  viking , the publisher of  escape from camp 14  by blaine harden , has been apprised that there were some inaccuracies in the story shin dong-hyuk , the subject of the book , told the author ,  penguin books spokeswoman louise braverman said in a written statement sunday .  we are working with the author on an accurate understanding of the facts . north korea has repeatedly denied shin 's claims and described testimony before a united nations commission by him and others as  slander  put forward by  human scum .  in a video posted last year on a website that carries pro-pyongyang propaganda , shin 's father denied that his son was ever in a prison camp . shin said in response that his father had been taken hostage and was being used in a campaign to discredit him . human rights activists argue that changes in shin 's account do not ultimately affect his testimony , saying they still believe he was tortured and that his story highlights the horror of prison camps . the new york times reported sunday that shin said he had held back about revealing inaccuracies in his story out of concerns that it could hurt his advocacy work .  i dithered because friends feared the damage my coming out might do to the movement for north korean human rights ,  he said , according to the times . in his facebook post , shin said he was not sure if he would be able to continue his efforts to end political prison camps in north korea .  but instead of me , you can all still fight ,  he said .  i still have faith in you .  cnn 's carma hassan , brian walker , paula hancocks and kj kwon contributed to this report .", "summary": " shin dong-hyuk has changed  key parts of his story ,  the author of a book about him says .   shin 's accounts of his
