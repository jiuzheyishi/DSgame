{"text": "while gay rights activists are lauding the president 's public show of support for same-sex marriages , it has drawn and surprising apology and counter-intuitive criticism from some high-profile figures . vice president joe biden reportedly met with mr obama in the oval office on wednesday to apologize for essentially forcing the president 's hand on the issue after he made his own demonstration of support earlier than the commander-in-chief . the same day , mr obama was the target of republican ire for the move , including one such blast from the bristol palin . while her criticism is expected as she is the daughter of former republican vice presidential candidate sarah palin , it was seemingly hypocritical for her to promote the need of fathers and mothers in children 's lives while she herself is raising her own son on her own and forbidding his father from seeing their child . apology : vice president joe biden met with mr obama on wednesday to apologize for ` forcing his hand ' on the same-sex marriage debate and turning it into a campaign issue before the white house wanted it to be . the meeting with mr biden was seen as an attempt to smooth tensions that were raised between the president and his vice president after he spoke out on gay marriage without white house consent , leaving obama aides deeply frustrated . mr biden 's comments pushed gay marriage to the forefront of the presidential race and focused a fresh spotlight on obama 's vague position on the matter . the president , who once opposed gay marriage , had been saying for more than a year that his personal views were ` evolving . ' in an interview with abc news , obama said he was n't angry at biden , though he thought the vice president had gotten ' a little bit over his skis ' by voicing his support for gay marriage ahead of his boss . ` would i have preferred to have done this in my own way , in my own terms , without i think , there being a lot of notice to everybody ? sure , ' obama said . ` but all 's well that ends well . ' change of heart : president barack obama said he once thought civil unions were sufficient rights for gay couples , but he no longer believes that . the white house and obama 's presidential campaign at first tried to play down biden 's remarks , insisting that the vice president had gone no further in support of equal rights for same-sex couples . but gay rights advocates latched onto biden 's remarks , which occurred on friday during a taping of an interview that aired on sunday , declaring him the highest-ranking u.s. official to support gay marriage . by tuesday morning , the president came to the conclusion that he could n't stay silent on the issue any further . the white house hastily arranged a television interview with abc news for wednesday , during which obama explained to the public that he had decided it was important for him to ` affirm that same-sex couples should be able to get married . ' in response , bristol palin took to her blog to lambast the move , claiming that a child needs a mother and father - even though she is a single mother . ` we know that in general kids do better growing up in a mother/father home , ' the daughter of former alaska governor sarah palin wrote on her blog . ` ideally , fathers help shape their kids ' worldview . ' despite this lecture , she has largely raised her three-year-old son tripp on her own , after splitting with his father levi johnston three months after the birth . criticism : bristol palin has criticsed obama for supporting gay marriage , saying a child needs a mother and a father . she split with levi johnston , right , the father of her son tripp , left , three months after he was born . ` he 's seen tripp twice in the past four months , ' she told in touch magazine in a recent interview . ` he once went an entire year without seeing him at all . ' it comes a day after the president endorsed same-sex marriage in an interview with abc news . many deemed the move as a political calculation for his re-election campaign as it draws a clear distinction between himself and republican mitt romney , who opposes gay marriage . ` at a certain point i 've just . concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and . affirm that i think same sex couples should be able to get married , ' the . president said . obama said his daughters and their friends were a major reason he changed his mind about gay marriage - a factor that bristol palin ridiculed in her blog . ` malia and sasha , they have . friends whose parents are same-sex couples , ' he said on wednesday . historic : president barack obama is the first sitting us president to publicly support gay marriage . president george w bush opposed it and president bill clinton signed the defense of marriage act into law . ` there have been times where . michelle and i have been sitting around the dinner table and we 're . talking about their friends and their parents and malia and sasha , it . would n't dawn on them that somehow their friends ' parents would be . treated differently . ` it does n't make sense to them and frankly , that 's the kind of thing that prompts a change in perspective . ' palin objected : ` while it 's great to listen to your kids ' ideas , there 's also a time when dads simply need to be dads . ` it . would 've been helpful for him to explain to malia and sasha that while . her friends parents are no doubt lovely people , that 's not a reason to . change thousands of years of thinking about marriage . ' she . continued : ` sometimes . dads should lead their family in the right ways of thinking . it . would 've been nice if the president would 've been an actual leader and . helped shape their thoughts instead of merely reflecting what many . teenagers think after one too many episodes of glee .

' other celebrities have applauded the move , including gay stars neil patrick harris and ricky martin . during his speech , obama claimed the change is a personal one only , and that he still believes . the issue of gay marriage should be left up to the states to each decide . currently , six states allow gay couples to wed and 30 states have constitutional amendments explicitly banning it . it appears that the president is . banking on the issue , which is heavily supported by younger americans , . to mobilize the youth vote , which has become disaffected during his term . in office . obama had long . been suspected of supporting gay marriage , but was thought to be afraid . to make it public because of the political backlash . but he had been under intense pressure . to clarify his view toward gay marriage after vice president joe biden . publicly supported it on sunday .
