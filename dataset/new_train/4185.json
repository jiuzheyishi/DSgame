{"text": "a distressed-looking woman sits on a bed in a dark hotel room . a caption reads ,  do n't let a candy bar ruin your vacation .  prominently on display at a busy denver intersection , the billboard is a warning about the dangers of marijuana-infused edibles .  with edibles , start low and go slow ,  it reads . it 's part of a public education campaign launched wednesday by the marijuana advocacy group , marijuana policy project , urging adults to consume pot responsibly in states where marijuana is legal . the woman on the billboard , red-headed with her forehead in her palm , is an allusion to maureen dowd , a columnist for the new york times who wrote in june that a  bite or two  of a chocolate-caramel candy bar left her  curled up in a hallucinatory state  for eight hours .  the problem is that people have just never really been educated about the actual effects of marijuana and marijuana products . they 've simply been told to never use it and they are stupid if they do . and that 's not a very useful education ,  said mason tvert , spokesman the marijuana policy project . serious concerns over marijuana edibles have surfaced since colorado became the first state in the nation to legalize the sale of marijuana for recreational use . there have been at least two reported deaths following the consumption of marijuana-infused edibles . a 19-year-old foreign exchange student fell from a balcony and died after consuming a cannabis cookie in march . about a month later , a man allegedly shot and killed his wife while reportedly high on pot and other drugs . the victim told a 911 operator moments before the shooting that her husband was scaring her and their children after eating some marijuana-laced candy . dowd described her own personal experience of eating too much of a marijuana-infused candy bar : .  i was thirsty but could n't move to get water . or even turn off the lights . i was panting and paranoid , sure that when the room-service waiter knocked and i did n't answer , he 'd call the police and have me arrested for being unable to handle my candy .  the column gained national exposure , not all of it positive as many pot advocates and late-night hosts mocked the columnist . her experience was the inspiration behind the new  consume responsibly  billboard campaign , organizers say .  like most americans , ms. dowd has probably seen countless silly anti-marijuana ads on tv , but she has never seen one that highlights the need to ` start low and go slow ' when choosing to consume marijuana edibles ,  tvert said . with edibles , it takes longer to feel the effects of thc , marijuana 's psychoactive ingredient , which can lead people to eat too much , then being hit hard by serious side effects that include delirium and psychosis .  if you smoke -lrb- marijuana -rrb- it 's in your brain almost immediately . so , the effects start very rapidly . you can have an edible and not feel much right away . up to an hour or two hours , three hours later you can start feeling the effects . it 's slower onset , and it lasts longer ,  said paula riggs , director of the division of substance dependence at the university of colorado school of medicine . colorado state regulators are looking into stricter requirements for marijuana edible manufacturers that include better labeling and limiting each package to a single dose , about 10 milligrams of thc . currently , marijuana dispensaries are selling recreational pot products that contain up to 100 milligrams of thc in a single candy bar . tvert said he hopes people see the billboard and take the time to really educate themselves about marijuana edibles . the billboard directs people to the campaign 's website , consumeresponsibly.org , which has information about marijuana laws , products and their effects , including negative effects like  increased heart rate and a sense of paranoia .  campaign organizers also plan to put out print and online ads , along with educational materials in marijuana dispensaries .", "summary": " marijuana policy project aims to educate people on the dangers of marijuana edibles .   nyt 's maureen dowd 's column on nightmarish experience with candy bar was inspiration .   there have been at least two reported deaths following the use of pot-infused edibles .   pot 's effects take longer with edibles than smoking , leading some users to eat too much .
