{"text": "for young striker jordan moore , when the diagnosis finally arrived , it was brutal and unexpected . despite having lingering doubts about a mole on his cheek , the-then 19-year-old had been told by no less than four medical professionals that there was nothing to worry about . even when moore finally convinced his doctor to arrange a biopsy , the information given out as he waited on his results was that there was a nine in ten chance that everything was fine . so when the dundee united striker , who was on loan at dunfermline at the time , learned in january , a month before turning 20 , that he had melanoma skin cancer , it was news that would have shaken a far older man to his very core . fighting spirit : dundee united 's jordan moore has overcome skin cancer . instead , moore steeled himself and stayed strong as parents angela and gordon fell to pieces in front of him at learning their little boy was suffering from the most dangerous skin cancer of all . after briefly succumbing to shock himself , the courageous moore instinctively knew the key to overcoming the biggest battle of his life was straightforward . no matter what lay ahead , this impressive and eloquent youngster simply vowed that cancer would never be allowed ruin his childhood dream of becoming a professional footballer . ` it was just a little freckle to begin with but it grew into a mole ' , said moore , who mercifully has been given the all-clear and is now on a mission to raise awareness of melanoma . ` people . were telling me to get it checked out because it was getting bigger but i . put it off . then it started bleeding so i went to the doctor , but he . said it was nothing . i actually went to three or four doctors and they . all said the same thing -- none of them thought it was anything to worry . about . they thought it looked like a regular mole . hammer blow : moore discovered the news while he was on loan at dunfermline . ` but i kept going back until they took a biopsy in january . i was n't prepared for what they were about to tell me because they said when the biopsy was done that there was a 90 per cent chance it was nothing . ` but when i went in for the result , with my mum and dad , they told me i had melanoma skin cancer , which is the worst kind you can get . the doctors were shocked . ' i did n't know a thing about it so i googled ` melanoma skin cancer ' when i came out of the surgery . but that was the worst thing i could have done . i read the first line and closed the page immediately because i did n't want to read any more . ' i knew i had to be strong for my mum and dad but when they both burst into tears , that was harder for me . then i went out and phoned -lrb- dunfermline coach -rrb- neil mccann and i started crying down the phone myself . raising awareness : moore is speaking up to warn people of the danger of skin cancer . ` my emotions took over , i did n't know what else to do . but i was able to push myself on by thinking about my football . nothing will stop me playing football . ` being back fit and playing for united is what drove me on throughout the whole thing . i actually feel bad for people who do n't have a goal like that to aim at because it must be even more difficult for them to cope with something like this . i do n't know how they deal with it because mentally cancer is at you constantly . ` now , all i want is to get fit for pre-season and score goals for dundee united this season . if i get the chance i think i can do it . and all i can say to people out there is that if they have any moles they think might be something then definitely go out and get it checked . ' for moore , the pain of living with cancer was not confined to just mental torment . ' i had two operations , the second one lasted for 11 hours and was major surgery , ' he said . ` they took lymph nodes out of my neck and i have scars on my neck . i do n't have any nerves on one side of my face and my bottom lip does n't work properly . ` but that 's nothing , and anyway having no feeling in one side of my face means i can take elbows to the face easier . ` i 've been given the all-clear now . but i still get scanned every three months from now on and i have to check myself every week in case anything comes back . ` but hopefully that 's it for me now and i can focus on playing for dundee united . i have just been looking forward to getting back to playing football . that 's all i want to do . ' side by side : stevie campbell -lrb- left -rrb- and dave bowman helped moore during his dark days . moore still marvels at the way the football families at east end park and tannadice rallied round for him . the youngster 's ordeal clearly placed the emphasis on ` united ' at dundee united , particularly when his teammates all wore jordan moore t-shirts in his honour during a thrilling 5-1 premiership win over motherwell at home in april . ` it was such a great feeling to see the lads wearing the t-shirts for me , ' he said . ` when nadir ciftci scored and lifted his t-shirt up it definitely made me feel stronger . it made me know that everyone was behind me pushing me on . ' i had been told in the morning that they were doing something like that . i grew up with -lrb- dundee united first team defender -rrb- john souttar and the rest of the lads so they arranged it . ' i will never be able to repay everyone for the support they gave me . all the boys came down to see me in the hospital . they came in a mini-bus . the gaffer -lrb- jackie mcnamara -rrb- , sid -lrb- simon donnelly -rrb- , jacko -lrb- darren jackson -rrb- and the whole coaching staff came down as well . support : dundee united manager jackie mcnamara and his players rallied around moore . ` our captain sean dillon was up straight away and the dunfermline lads came along too . there were so many people there all the nurses swarmed up to the ward as well to see us . sometimes i had 15 people at once in the room but the nurses did n't bother . ' united youth-coach stevie campbell praised moore for his mental fortitude in fighting such an illness at such a young age , and for raising awareness of such a deadly disease . ` it 's very admirable how jordan and his family have coped with such an incredibly tough situation , ' said campbell . ` jordan 's humour and positivity were a major help . when i told him the news had broken in the local paper , he said he knew but he was annoyed that they 'd got his goals tally wrong . that 's just typical jordan and it 's great that we are now talking about his football again . he 's a terrific striker and hopefully he ' s now got a great career in front of him .
