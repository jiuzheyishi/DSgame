{"text": "the nfl is expected to adopt penalties for using the n-word on the field that will be enacted starting this upcoming season . a proposal currently circulating through the league 's competition committee seeks to impose a 15-yard penalty against the team of a player using the racial slur , with a second utterance resulting in ejection . john wooten , head of the fritz pollard alliance , which monitors diversity in the nfl , first disclosed the initiative to cbs sports . something must be done : miami dolphins guard richie incognito -lrb- 68 -rrb- and tackle jonathan martin -lrb- 71 -rrb- stand on the field during training camp prior to last season - one in which martin left the team amid claims he was bullied . he said the league is seeking to completely remove the word from league workplaces and make it a fineable offense -- from the front office all the way down to the field . ` i will be totally shocked if the competition committee does not uphold us on what we 're trying to do , ' wooten said saturday to a standing ovation during the nfl scouting combine in indianapolis . ` we want this word to be policed from the parking lot to the equipment room to the locker room , ' he continued . ` secretaries , pr people , whoever , we want it eliminated completely and want it policed everywhere . ' the nfl declined to comment , but told the site workplace ` respect ' is a key aspect of changes the league is seeking to make in the fallout from the miami dolphins bullying and riley cooper scandals . wooten said that next month 's competition committee meeting is the first step to making the penalty the law of the land . ` i think they 're going to do what needs to be done here , there is too much disrespect in the game , ' he added . fired : dolphins offensive line coach jim turner -lrb- pictured during a practice last season -rrb- was fired after being found to have also taken part in the bullying - also gone are martin , incognito and others . baltimore ravens general manager ozzie newsome , himself african-american and a member of the competition committee , also spoke about the proposal saturday during the combine . ` with any rule that we put into play , we have to look at it from a to z and find out what are the unintended consequences as much as the consequences , ' he said , according to nfl.com . ` but as it was stated in our meeting , there are mics everywhere , ' newsome added . ` if something is being said , it 's probably going to be captured somewhere . so , it would be an opportunity to get it verified if we had to . ' newsome , one of only seven black gm 's in a predominantly african american league with 32 teams , also expressed a desire to see the rule further discussed . former new york giants great harry carson , now the executive director of the fritz pollard alliance , told the new york daily news that use of the word already results in an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty , but that more needs to be done . ` it needs to be put a halt to in the locker room , on the field , whether it 's staff , whether it 's a player , there is no room for it , ' said the hall of famer . infamous : philadelphia eagles wide receiver riley cooper was caught using the word at a concert , he received no fine or penalty for his actions , he also did not miss a single game . fans who spoke to the paper had mixed reactions . ` i am sure that word gets thrown around all the time every game so how would you even enforce that ? ' giants fan brian ellis wondered aloud , adding ` i do n't think it should be banned . ' a friend of ellis ' said ` the whole idea is stupid . ' a philadelphia eagles fan told the paper he is in favor of policing the word 's use . ` there are a lot of ways to trash talk without saying certain words to people ... the players will learn to comply with the rules . ' cooper , who plays for the eagles , was infamously caught on video repeatedly shouting the slur at an african-american security guard while attending a concert at the team 's stadium prior to last season . twitter reactions ranged from surprise to calls of hypocrisy as many compared it unfavorably to the ongoing washington redskins name saga . ` saying the n-word on the field is a 15 yard penalty . wearing a racial slur on the front of your jersey ; totes cool , ' a fan wrote . hypocritical ? : many fans wondered on social media how a racial slur - redskins is a derogatory term for native americans - can be used as a team name but not spoken on the field . ` please tell me the nfl is n't seriously considering a penalty if a player says the n word . games would take 6 hours , ' said another . ` latest nfl recap : n-word , 15-yard penalty ; r-word , marketed ; caught dragging unconscious fianc√© out of elevator , employed . got it , ' tweeted one more . others said teams would run out of players and be forced to look into the stands for players to finish out the second half of games . the rule must be backed by the competition committee to go to the owners for a final vote , which would take place prior to the upcoming season .", "summary": " the proposal still has yet to be voted on by team owners , it would go into effect next season if approved .   it is one of several ideas being considered to reduce bullying in the league .   fans had mixed reactions to the idea , and many claimed hypocrisy when compared to the redskins team name scandal .
