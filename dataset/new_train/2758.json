{"text": "since president xi jinping assumed power , he 's reshaped china 's foreign policy by recalibrating its stresses on sovereignty and stability , what the chinese call wei quan and wei wen . on the one hand , china has stepped up its emphasis on sovereignty , especially concerning its territorial dispute with japan over the diaoyu islands -lrb- or the senkakus , as they 're known in japan -rrb- . beijing has streamlined its various maritime agencies to make them more efficient and better coordinated , and it keeps sending government vessels to the area to demonstrate its jurisdiction over this region . more recently , it announced a new air defense identification zone -lrb- adiz -rrb- in the east china sea to assure its sovereign security over territory , territorial water and space in the adiz . on the other hand , china has attached more importance to its peripheral stability . despite its earlier skirmish over ladakh with india in may , it cut a border defense co-operation agreement with new delhi , to avoid mutual tailing between their patrols in border areas where there is no common understanding of the line of actual control . and recently , president xi and premier li keqiang visited five out of 10 asean countries , and wrapped up a cooperative deal with vietnam to jointly develop an oil well in the mouth of the gulf of tonkin . china has also furthered its relations with major powers -- xi visited russia and the u.s. within the first three months of coming to power , promoting a  new type of major country relationship .  however , the quest for sovereignty and stability at the same time could prove challenging . china 's adiz announcement is turning into such a case . origins of the adiz . the concept and practice of adiz are not china 's invention . rather , it was invented by the u.s. in 1951 , with a purpose of identifying , through various means , incoming aircraft toward north america . an adiz would usually be much bigger than one 's territorial space , to allow sufficient time for such identification . last weekend , the chinese government announced its east china sea adiz , asking foreign military planes flying over this area to identify themselves or , if necessary , the government would take defensive military action to enforce their identification . it is noted that the adiz is a national mandate , rather than demanded by any international law . therefore , any other country has to make its own sovereign choice to follow or not . the establishment of the east china sea adiz looks to be china 's latest attempt to stress sovereignty and stability . the purpose of such identification is to assure china 's sovereignty over its airspace without disrupting the international law of freedom of flight through international airspace . obviously , china is able to identify those foreign civilian airlines which routinely fly to and from china . china will also be able to monitor and identify some foreign military aircraft flying over this zone . establishing such a zone would allow china , ideally , additional time to predict if some of the flights over the area would be harmful and , consequently , if its defense establishment should take precautionary measures . challenge to status quo ? as establishing an adiz is a national endeavor rather than one mandated by international law , it is predictable other stakeholders could view it a challenge to the status quo , which suits their national interests . soon after china 's adiz was announced , the u.s. sent two b-52 bombers into the new air zone on what the u.s. says was a pre-planned trip . it is understood that the u.s. strategic bombers neither loaded bombs nor were escorted by jet fighters , and did n't go too close to china 's territorial space , signaling that the mission was not intended as a military threat . such a restrained challenge seems to have led china to properly balance its quest for sovereignty and stability . if and when china 's newly declared adiz is truly challenged , as long as china could identify the incoming foreign aircraft and manage the challenge to a certain degree , china would not send aircraft to  greet  them . but certainly , if the incoming foreign aircraft did not respond to china 's query of identity , and if china detected a threatening posture , its air force would act in a defensive way . though the u.s. has presented its challenge to china establishing such a zone , the country 's adiz may have more to do with japan . japan 's own adiz has been as close as to 130 kilometers from china , and includes the diaoyu , or senkaku , islands . if china 's inclusion of diaoyu islands is intolerable to japan due to their dispute over this area , japan 's inclusion of the same islands , some four decades ago , has much earlier provoked a similar degree of irritation . japan 's establishment of its adiz was a breach of the status quo at that time . japan further pushed the envelope last year by  nationalizing  the main islands , representing another effort to break the existing status quo . its persistent changing of the status quo can not go unchallenged . china 's efforts to strike a balance between sovereignty and stability are destined to be difficult . however , facing increasing security challenges , beijing is likely to respond in kind , while abiding by international law . the opinions in this article are solely those of shen dingli , a professor and associate dean of the institute of international studies at fudan university in shanghai .", "summary": " president xi has reshaped china 's foreign policy , stressing sovereignty and stability .   shen dingli : east china sea adiz looks to be china 's latest attempt to stress this approach .   facing increasing security challenges , beijing is likely to respond in kind , shen dingli says .
