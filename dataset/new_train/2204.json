{"text": "supreme court justice sonia sotomayor was thrust into the national spotlight on two hot-button issues this week . it had nothing to do with the cases involved -- same-sex marriage in utah and a requirement for contraceptive coverage under obamacare . the two emergency appeals on new year 's eve came her way because the cases originated in western areas of the country -- colorado and utah -- that fall under her jurisdiction for reviewing time-sensitive federal motions . sotomayor sought more information on an appeal from utah to uphold its voter-approved ban on same-sex unions in the state . but she made headlines on the politically charged case around the affordable care act just as new rules were about to take effect . sotomayor issued an order that , for the moment , stayed a requirement under the sweeping health law for certain religiously affiliated groups to ensure that employees receive coverage for contraception at no cost . the denver-based organization that cares for elderly poor , the little sisters of the poor , objects to complying with rules under the law that would guarantee it an exemption but , in theory , still require a third party to provide contraception insurance . ultimately , it believes authorizing a form that passes the ball to another entity still means contraception coverage for its employees and that , to the nuns , is objectionable on moral grounds . the catholic church opposes artificial contraception . while sotomayor 's emergency injunction or any follow up to extend it or seek the opinion of her fellow justices for additional review may seem like a blow to the politically charged health care law , it is n't . nor does it convey any meaning about where sotomayor , a liberal jurist , may stand on the larger issues raised in the appeal overall .  she just placed a single case on hold . she did not overturn obamacare ,  cnn legal analyst jeffrey toobin said . her decision late on tuesday simply put the brakes on compliance for the little sisters of the poor and enabled the obama administration to file its arguments . the justice department said on friday the appeal lacked merit . the charity , it said , is eligible for an exemption and moreover , the entity that administers its insurance plans , the non-profit christian brothers services , is also exempt under certain conditions in the obamacare rules applying to religious institutions . toobin said sotomayor acted  based on her view of the law  in holding up the rule in this case . sotomayor voted to uphold the affordable care act in 2012 in a blockbuster supreme court ruling that gave obama an enormous political victory . obamacare seeks to extend health coverage to millions of americans without it and is the president 's signature domestic achievement . it is relentlessly under attack from conservatives who have made numerous attempts to repeal or otherwise sink it , and is the focus of numerous legal challenges .", "summary": " sotomayor upheld obamacare last year , now she 's in the spotlight again in another appeal .   she issued stay to give denver nuns reprieve on providing birth control to workers .    she just placed a single case on hold . she did not overturn obamacare ,  analyst says .   sotomayor got the case because the nuns live in denver , a town in her  region  "}
