{"text": "the governor of the bank of england last night launched a stinging attack on the bankers who caused the financial crisis and ` got away without sanction ' . mark carney said the bosses of the banks behind the 2008 global financial crash should have paid a higher price for their errors . instead -- despite facing limited social embarrassment -- they were still on the ` best golf courses ' . speaking in washington , mr carney said : ` the individuals who ran the institutions got away with it . they got away with their compensation packages and without sanction . ` maybe they are no longer at the most esteemed table in society , but they are still on the best golf courses and that has got to change . ' bank of england governor mark carney -lrb- pictured -rrb- has told a washington audience the bankers who caused the 2008 global financial crisis have ` got away without sanction ' during a panel discussion on financial ethics , mr carney made it clear he had no sympathy for board-level bankers who would not take personal responsibility for the actions of their organisations . the bank governor , who has been in washington for a series of international monetary fund meetings , complained that the authorities had been unable to jail any of the bankers whose failings led to the global financial crisis . his rebuke came as two senior executives of hsbc are poised to quit their jobs over new tough rules that would see ` reckless ' financial executives facing jail for their actions or omissions in the event of a major failing by their bank . but mr carney said such rules were necessary because the heads of banks during the crisis had got away with huge amounts of money without criminal sanction . he made it clear he rejected the complaints of the hsbc board members without naming the pair or specifically referring to their bank . while it was difficult to come up with acceptable compensation schemes and incentives , he said one thing that was vital to make the system safer was clearer personal responsibility . curtailing financial rewards alone was not enough . two senior hsbc executives are poised to quit their jobs over tough new rules on ` reckless ' bank actions . he said : ` if you are the chairman or the head of the risk committee , you have a responsibility for the activities of that institution . ` if you do n't think you can do it , you should n't be on the board . ' the new regulation regime of senior managers is designed to make it easier to bring criminal charges in a future banking crisis . mr carney added : ` it does focus the mind of directors and it should . i would like to think that the minds of directors are being focused . some of them might not like it -- that 's okay . ' it emerged last week that two hsbc executives are preparing to leave the bank amid concerns over the potential personal and criminal responsibility they would face in future . directors at britain 's biggest companies saw their average earnings rise by a fifth last year despite a nationwide wage squeeze . boardroom executives at ftse 100 companies pocketed huge bonuses , according to a survey published today by pay research group incomes data services -lrb- ids -rrb- . these helped push their average total earnings to # 2.4 million -- 21 per cent higher than last year . the staggering sum is almost 100 times higher than the average wage of # 26,500 per annum . ftse 100 chief executives now typically earn 120 times more than their full-time staff , the report said . critics said the findings showed a ` huge gap ' in pay levels between boardrooms and ordinary workers . most british staff have seen their pay lag behind inflation since the financial crash . the basic salary for most ftse 100 directors rose last year by 2.5 per cent -- just below the 2.8 per cent level of inflation at the time , the ids report said . top directors also enjoyed a 12 per cent rise in bonuses . ftse 100 chief executives -- who are generally the highest paid in any organisation -- receive an average basic salary of # 832,000 and an average bonus of # 1million . they also benefit from share payouts of around # 2million . deborah hargreaves from the high pay centre think-tank said : ` there 's a huge gap opening up . we 've seen workforce wages stagnating across the board , while chief executives ' remuneration continues to go up . ` this is not healthy for our economy , our country or our society . ' alan thomson , who sits on the audit and risk committees of hsbc , has resigned and will leave the board of the bank 's uk subsidiary in january . john trueman , its deputy chairman , is also preparing to resign . mr carney has always taken a tough stance on personal responsibility and has a history of standing firm in the face of complaints from financial sector employees . meanwhile , the taxman has ramped up prosecutions against individuals suspected of tax dodging -- but is still accused of letting corporate giants off the hook . the number of court cases hmrc brought for illegal tax evasion rose last year by almost a third -- from 612 to 795 -- data from thomson reuters shows today . it is not yet known how many were successful . but it is claimed the taxman has done deals with google that allow it to avoid paying millions in the uk .", "summary": " governor mark carney launches stinging attack on irresponsible bankers .   claims those responsible for 2008 financial crisis got away without sanction .   mr carney : ` they are still on the best golf courses . that has got to change ' "}
