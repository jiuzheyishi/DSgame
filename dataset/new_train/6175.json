{"text": "a pioneering scientist hailed as the ` godfather of ecstasy ' for creating the dance drug in its modern form has died aged 88 . for more than 40 years alexander shulgin experimented at his home in berkley , california , testing his chemical creations on himself , friends and family before they could be outlawed . last night his wife and research partner , ann , said he had died peacefully while listening to buddhist meditation music after being diagnosed with liver cancer . pioneer : dr alexander shulgin refined the composition of mdma , which had been created in 1912 , and turned it into a form which much more closely resembled the ecstasy of today . in just a few years it flooded nightclubs . venerated : though a controversial figure for many , dr shulgin was revered by those in favour of legalisation . thanking his fans for their support , she wrote : ` sasha died today , at exactly 5 o'clock in the afternoon . ` he was surrounded by family and caretakers and buddhist meditation music , and his going was graceful , with almost no struggle at all . thanks to all of you , and blessings . ' she previously wrote : ` sasha knows that he 's dying , but that does n't bother him . ` he does n't know he has cancer of the liver , and there 's no need for him to know ; that knowledge would give him nothing useful . peaceful life : dr shulgin with his wife and research partner ann , who announced his death . ` after all , as he has said ,  we all have to die of something !  ' dr alexander ` sasha ' shulgin refined the composition of mdma , which had been created in germany in 1912 , and turned it into a form which much more closely resembled the ecstasy of today . in just a few years the drug had flooded the nightclubs of the world and was closely associated with the party island of ibiza . but the early life of dr shulgin , the son of a russian immigrant , was more humble and mainstream . after gaining a doctorate in biochemistry from the university of california , he began working for the giant dow chemical company in the late 1950s . while he developed industrial chemicals in his day job - including the world 's first biodegradable pesticide - his time off became increasingly devoted to researching psychoactive compounds . he synthesised and fine-tuned hundreds of drugs , most famously methyl-enedioxy-methylamphetamine -lrb- mdma -rrb- . although the drug was more than half a century old , he was the first person to extensively test its effects on the brain . he was astounded by the results - and word of the formula quickly spread around the world . he became celebrated among those campaigning for drugs to be legalised , and wrote several books . career : the scientist , from california , began his long career at the dow chemical company in the 1950s . the drug shot its way into national headlines after the death of essex teenager leah betts , below , who took just one tablet at her 18th birthday party in 1995 . an inquest heard she died of swelling on the brain because she drank too much water to counter the effects of the drug . toxicologist professor john henry told the inquest : ` if leah had taken the drug alone she might well have survived . if she had drunk the amount of water alone she would have survived . ' the verdict - used as ammunition by both sides of the drugs debate - was all too common . although ecstasy has been mentioned on dozens of death certificates , it is notoriously difficult to determine whether the drug alone is responsible because of other factors . the debate has since shifted to more powerful drugs in the same family , which are often sold as ecstasy with devastating results . in october an inquest heard how bolton car welder chris goodwin , 30 , and his friend emma johnson , 21 , died within minutes of each other after taking up to five times a lethal dose of para-methoxyamphetamine -lrb- pma -rrb- - almost certainly without realising what it was . a spokesman for drug advice service frank said : ' a big problem with ecstasy is that it 's rarely pure . sometimes , there is no mdma at all . sometimes , it contains other drugs , like pma , which can be fatal . ` regardless of what it looks like and what it is called , you ca n't be sure what 's in a pill or a powder and you ca n't predict how you 'll react . ' but he . became a controversial figure after the death of leah betts , an essex . schoolgirl who died after taking a single tablet of ecstasy at her 18th . birthday party . a . 2001 profile in the mail on sunday described him as a . grandfather-of-five who walked with a fragile shuffle , drove a battered . vw and had passion for mozart which included playing the viola . at the time - when fears over the drug in britain were at their height - he said : ` if they keep it a class a drug it is sad but i am heartened there has been a debate over lessening controls . ` it demonstrates a slow shifting of attitude . it may take time but britain will eventually realise there 's no danger from ecstasy . he added : ' i think it 's very healthy to explore the legalisation of cannabis , to see if it helps or hurts . the real trouble comes from the social damage done by enforcing these unfair laws which break up families when drug users are jailed . ` people are hurt far more by that than by the drugs . ' at one time he was venerated by the u.s. establishment , writing the classic reference book controlled substances , a chemical and legal guide to federal drugs laws . but when dr shulgin pronounced his personal belief in psychedelics and advocated that all drugs should be legalised , officials changed their tune . federal drugs agents raided his lab , took away most of his equipment and revoked his permit . in 1995 , dr shulgin expressed regret that the drug - banned in the u.s. in 1986 - had attracted controversy . ` these rave scenes have added kindling to the fire of governmental disapproval , ' he said . ` its very excellent potential for being used as medicine has been badly jeopardised .
