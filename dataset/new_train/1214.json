' doll , kitten and brynn young married in a ceremony in august 2013 , when each of their fathers walked them down the aisle . all three women wore white wedding gowns and exchanged rings . the so-called ` throuple ' worked with a specialist family lawyer who drew up the paperwork and drafted the ceremony so that all three of them were obligated and bound to each other . while brynn and kitten are legally married , doll is handfasted to both so the threesome are as equally married to each other as legally possible . the ` married ' lesbian threesome on their wedding day in august 2013 . doll , 30 , says : ` as far as we know , there are n't any other three women who are married like us . ' it was back in 2009 that brynn first met doll through an online dating site . senior software designer and engineer , brynn had been married twice before to women and both experiences had made her acknowledge that monogamous relationships were n't for her . meanwhile fashion designer , doll had known that she was polygamous since high school . she explains : ' i had always dated girls - who although they had boyfriends or girlfriends - were also allowed to date me . ' i never thought that much about it and i had never really ` come out ' as poly to my friends and family . to me , it was just how i was . ' brynn and doll dated for eight months before moving in together . two years later , they purchased a house together . having both enjoyed polygamous relationships before , doll and brynn looked for a third woman to join them . after a few failed liaisons , doll and brynn created an okcupid couple 's profile . eventually , they received a message from kitten . before meeting doll and brynn , kitten had been in two long-term relationships with men . her first relationship lasted ten years and she had been engaged to her second boyfriend . fashion manager , kitten says : ` my second boyfriend and i had been together for several years but a few months before our wedding , he called the whole thing off without explanation . at first , i was distraught but now , i 'm grateful for what he did . ` the whole break-up forced me to really think about who i was and i realised that i had not been honest to myself . on reflection , i realised that i had n't been happy in my previous monogamous relationships and i discovered that i was poly . ' i set up an okcupid profile for myself and began dating an awesome woman with the happy consent of her husband . they were a lovely couple but we ended the relationship after i had to move away . ` soon after that amicable break-up , i came across doll 's and kitten 's okcupid profile and saw they were looking for a third member to join their ` super hero group ' . ' the ` throuple ' are eventually hoping to have three babies , one for each ` wife ' doll , brynn and kitten went for dinner at a chinese restaurant for their first date and immediately liked each other . doll says : ` there was an instant attraction with kitten but i think we all really bonded when we baked cookies together on our fourth date . i did n't know what love was until the three of us clicked like that . ' brynn adds : ` with doll and kitten , things finally made sense . it was as if the puzzle was finally complete with all three pieces . ' within a few months , kitten moved in with doll and brynn . two years later , they decided to get married after kitten proposed the idea to them . kitten says : ' i had always wanted to get married and i guess doll and brynn indulged my wishes ! i had a very traditional upbringing and marriage had always been an important symbol of commitment for me . we wanted to celebrate our love in a wedding like everyone else . ' the threesome insist their relationship is like that of any normal couple : having breakfast with one another , watching tv after work and sharing a bed together . being married to more than one person is not currently legal . while brynn and kitten are married , doll is handfasted to both , so the threesome are as equally married to each other as legally possible . doll says : ` the only difference is that communication is a lot more difficult for us than others . there are three people so our relationship takes detailed scheduling - everything we do goes on the calendar ! ` whilst communication is tricky , household chores are a lot easier with three people ! you can slack off on your errands and another person can pick them up . ' brynn adds : ` each of us has our own allocated chores and roles - i like to think of us a romantic committee . in our relationship , i 'm the traditional breadwinner . i work a forty hour week and make the majority of the family 's income . ` doll does the cooking and kitten does the cleaning . sometimes , kitten also helps me with my hair and make-up before i go to work . ' the threesome spent several date nights planning their dream wedding - making decorations and shopping for matching traditional , white gowns . brynn says : ` planning our wedding was hectic . it took a lot more organizing because there were three brides involved . kitten , brynn and doll had to work with the legalities of the state to get married to each other . as being married to more than one person is not currently legal , they had to combine handfasting , legally binding documents and legal marriage . a family lawyer drew up paperwork - in terms of assets , wills and legal rights to children - to bind them all together as much as they could without an actual three way marriage . while brynn and kitten are legally married , doll , far left , is handfasted to both . brynn explains : ` just because we are n't the atypical configuration , i did n't want to not get married . we 're very traditional people and that sense was reflected in our wedding . ' when doll , kitten and brynn walked down the aisle , each of their fathers gave them away . this moment was especially memorable for kitten as her father had previously disowned her due to his disapproval of her poly-lifestyle . kitten explains : ` my father had stopped talking to me for a period of time after i came out not only as gay , but as also dating two women . ` but shortly before the wedding , the bonds began mending and he agreed to walk me - his youngest daughter - down the aisle . it was wonderful . ' after saying their vows and exchanging rings , the girls had a drinks reception . the trio did their first dance to kitten 's favourite love song , ` i 'll stand by you ' by the pretenders ' . it was only three months after their beautiful wedding day that kitten fell pregnant , after undergoing ivf treatment using a sperm donor . they hope to conceive using the same method with all of their future pregnancies . doll , kitten and brynn showing off their wedding rings . kitten says : ` the three of us have always wanted kids . doll , brynn and i are committed to each other and we wanted to grow our family . ` we decided that i would be the one to carry the babies because i am more than happy to become a full-time mum . when our daughter arrives in july , i 'll be the one changing the nappies and doing the feeds ! ' the trio also plan on homeschooling their children to prevent them getting bullied by peers for having an unconventional family . doll - who was herself teased at school - explains : ` traditional school 's tough enough for a normal kid and i do n't want my child to be picked on because they 're raised differently . i ca n't stomach the idea of putting them in the crossfire like that . ' brynn adds : ` through homeschooling , i think we can also educate our kids to have the same strength that doll , kitten and i have . ` the three of us have been brave enough to stand tall and go against what society calls normal . i hope our child will feel free to do the same thing if they wish . ' doll , kitten and brynn are faithful to each other and say they do n't plan on adding anyone else to their throuple . they hope to show the world that polyfidelity is an acceptable choice of love . brynn says : ` doll , kitten and i may not be the norm but we are perfectly normal . we are simply people trying to live the life that we feel is best for us and we deserve the rights afforded to others .
