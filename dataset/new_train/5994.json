{"text": "retailers have been accused of craftily overplaying discount claims to draw shoppers in to post christmas sales . boxing day saw a record sales high for high street shops and online retailers with many offering discounts of between 50 and 70 per cent . but a survey of half price sales has found many had been much less generous than their claims had suggested . retailers have been accused of craftily overplaying discount claims to draw shoppers in . boxing day saw a record sales high for high street shops and online retailers with many offering discounts of between 50 and 70 per cent , but many had been much less generous than their claims . the sunday times conducted a survey between boxing day and december 27 , analysing sales at some of the country 's leading retailers including john lewis , marks & spencer , debenhams , and house of fraser . it found that in many sales categories - including shoes , bags and dresses - less than half were available at the headline discount . christine cross , chief retail adviser to accountancy firm pwc told the paper retailers were being very clever , by ` shouting about discounts ' more than they were discounting . she said : ` they 're saying  up to 50 per cent off  but it is very much  up to  rather than  50 per cent off  . it is the first time it has been marked as this because retailers are trying to win market share amid thin sales . ' david mccorquodale , head of retail at the professional services firm kpmg , said while retailers wanted to attract customers , they had to cover costs . and clare francis of comparison website moneysupermarket said shoppers should be careful not to get drawn in to headline discounts without researching to ensure they were getting the best deal . in the ` biggest ever half price sale ' at debenhams , just 21 of 121 pairs of shoes - 17 per cent - were discounted , and just 25 per cent of bags . the m & s sale offered discounts of up to 50 per cent both online and instore . but the survey revealed only 20 of 126 shoes were cut by 50 per cent or more , and just 27 per cent of bags and 46 per cent of dresses were half price . at john lewis , which also advertised up to 50 per cent off , there were more items at 30 per cent off . but next generally offered at least 50 per cent off all the items in the categories and house of fraser also had more than half of items at the headline discount . all retailers have insisted they complied with advertising rules and made it clear 50 per cent discounts applied only to selected items . christmas spending got off to a slow start in early december , but trading improved in the latter part of the month . but this year has seen the shortest ever post christmas sales . tomorrow is expected to see just half the high number of shoppers recorded on thursday , as stock levels fall . british retail consortium spokesman richard dodd said : ` weekly sales figures drop very dramatically after christmas , with a quick tail-off . by january , retail spend is half what it is in december . ` the relentless no-growth sales environment means big difficulties for retailers and there are no signs that will change . ' ipsos president peter luff said : ` retailers have significantly cut back on stock . we expect there to have been quite a drop in footfall from saturday . ' professor joshua bamfield , director of the centre for retail research , said : ` we do n't think christmas sales have ever tailed off this quickly . post-christmas sales first happened in the pre-war years and lasted through january , before moving to late december in the late 1990s . ` this year , we have sales starting on christmas eve and tailing off days after christmas - with key indicators including the greater availability of parking spaces this year compared to previous years . ` high sales occurred immediately post-christmas - but these were concentrated in a shorter period than usual . the survey found at john lewis , which also advertised up to 50 per cent off , there were more items at 30 per cent off . ` in previous years , customers have been enticed to keep on spending money . but this year , customers have spent the money they had in mind and they 're not keeping on spending . ` sales are falling away and , from what retailers have told us , footfall is expected to be down 50 per cent between december 27 and 31 . new year 's eve may be quite dead . ` sales were initially high in big cities but only good in smaller cities . the retail industry has been saying ` it 's great , it 's fantastic ' - but it will be a different story when they add up the figures in january . ` we expect a fall in retail sales totals to mid-january compared to last year . ' the advertising standards authority -lrb- asa -rrb- say to substantiate a 50 per cent sale claim , at least 10 per cent of discounted products must have the discount . marks & spencer said all reductions were ` clearly marked ' on each product , and debenhams said it ` far exceeded ' the requirement , with some items reduced by 70 per cent . john lewis said there were ` roughly the same ' number of 50 per cent and 30 per cent discounts .", "summary": " study reveals less than half of sale items were available at the headline discount at shops surveyed .   it is also thought to be the shortest ever post christmas sales period .   visitor numbers at shops tomorrow are expected to be half thursday 's record high .
