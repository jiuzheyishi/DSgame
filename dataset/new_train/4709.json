{"text": "in many ways , the 2012 election was the year of the woman . women -- who have historically formed one of president barack obama 's key constituencies -- once again united behind him in large numbers and helped fend off defections from white male and independent supporters . a record 20 women will hold u.s. senate seats next year -- including newly-elected wisconsin democrat tammy baldwin , the first openly lesbian senator . the new hampshire congressional delegation will be all female and , in obama 's home state of hawaii , democrat mazie hirono will represent the islands in the senate .  i 'm not sure if it was as much a coincidence as a perfect storm ,  said jennifer duffy , a senior editor with the nonpartisan cook political report .  the conditions were right and the republican nominee gave women pause .  according to cnn 's exit polls , 55 % of women and 45 % of men voted for obama and 44 % of women and 52 % of men voted for romney . that level of female support for the president made an especially big impact in swing states like ohio where the gender breakdown mirrored the national figures . big gains for women in 2012 . it is a gender advantage obama clinched even as early as mid october when data showed that among white women , the president led 52 % -46 % . back in 2008 when obama carried ohio , he received 47 % of votes from white women in that state . nationally , obama received 56 % of the female vote in 2008 .  i think it 's one of the things republicans have to look at ,  duffy said .  ` why are we the party of white men . '  political experts also say romney , who saw an early october surge of support among female voters , may have undone those gains during the second presidential debate when he said he used  whole binders full of women  as a hiring tool as governor , whiffed on an equal pay question , and alluded to helping women get home to cook dinner .  that a presidential candidate in 2012 can utter such superficial answers to a serious question about women 's economic equity and autonomy reveals a lack of serious thought about issues of substantive importance to women ,  kathleen dolan , a political science professor at the university of wisconsin , and jennifer l. lawless , an associate professor of government and director of the women & politics institute at american university , wrote recently for cnn .  it also demonstrates a lack of commitment to the change necessary to allow women and men to lead fully integrated professional and personal lives ,  they said . but republican woes with women can not be blamed solely on romney . opinion : women gain wider access to power . verbal gaffes from down-ballot candidates such as rep. todd akin , whose comments about a woman 's body preventing pregnancy after  legitimate rape  may have cost him the election , also reinforced for some voters concerns that the gop is out of touch with women .  part of the reason democrats had a good day was some conservative republicans said some stupid things and it made some issues more salient than they usually are ,  said andra gillespie , an associate professor of political science at emory university in atlanta .  when people are making comments about legitimate rape ... it scares women who might not have thought about it . even the conversation about contraception ... this was a way to make women 's health issues very , very personal ,  gillespie said . the first portion of this year 's political season saw a heated partisan showdown over a federal mandate requiring religious institutions to offer contraception insurance coverage to employees . the ensuing back and forth sparked a  war on women  fight between democrats and republicans that bled into congressional hearings , the campaigns and talk radio and re-ignited the gender wars . democrats were able to use the rhetoric to suggest that republicans would threaten the right to contraception -- something studies indicate the majority of the public supports , said michele swers , a georgetown university american government professor . move over boys , new hampshire goes to the women .  the debate can be more framed on the aspects of the debate that were more popular with the general public ,  swers said , adding that democrats were also able to connect other gop positions on abortion as extreme . there are some indications that social issues directly impacting women might have helped sway votes in some states . tuesday 's early exit polls showed 51 % of missouri voters said they believed abortion should be legal all or most of the time . of those voters , exit polls showed 76 % supported democratic incumbent claire mccaskill , who won tuesday night , while 19 % voted for akin . forty-seven percent of missouri 's voters said abortion should be illegal . exit polls showed akin netted 67 % of this group 's votes while 27 % of people who think abortion should be illegal supported mccaskill . but much more than social issues , pocketbook economic issues most concerned women voters , exit polling showed .  women like all voters felt the economics were most important ,  swers said .  women tend to be more supportive of government spending -lrb- such as cutting things as medicaid , and food stamps -rrb- than men are ... so they were less responsive to romney in that way and more responsive to obama 's message on empathy and helping the middle class .
