' she now knows it was the first sign . there was a grave threat to her baby 's life , and her own . four weeks . later her daughter , autumn , was born prematurely and later died . then . hayley was found to have bowel cancer . doctors now think autumn 's . death was linked to her mother 's cancer , with a blood clot breaking away . from the tumour , damaging hayley 's placenta and cutting off the food . supply to her unborn baby . however , it took four months after . autumn 's death for hayley to be diagnosed . the problem was her age - she . was ` too young ' for bowel cancer to be considered . hayley , who lives . in fareham , hants , with her husband paul , a 35-year-old it consultant , . says : ` looking back , i had textbook symptoms - exhaustion , intermittent . stomach pains , increasingly bad diarrhoea , blood in my stools and . bleeding . the disease is britain 's second-biggest cancer killer , . claiming 16,000 lives a year . the number of under-50s diagnosed has been . gradually rising - to around 2,100 a year . but a recent survey by . the charity bowel cancer uk of patients under 50 found that 42 per cent . of the women had visited their gp at least five times before being . referred for tests . indeed , hayley , a supply planner for an it firm , . was examined five times by different doctors and midwives , who all . missed her symptoms , despite a golf ball-sized lump appearing on her . stomach after her pregnancy . by the time she was diagnosed , hayley had . stage three to four cancer , meaning the tumour had broken through her . bowel wall . she had to undergo a seven-hour operation to remove the 6cm growth , followed by six months of chemo and radiotherapy . but . her experience is not uncommon , says deborah alsina , chief executive of . bowel cancer uk : ` we hear from many younger people who express . frustration at not getting a diagnosis and support .

' national gp guidelines state only patients aged . 60 and over should be automatically referred to hospital for tests if . they have one symptom . patients aged 40 to 60 must exhibit two or more . symptoms . for under 40s , there is often an assumption the symptoms . must be something else , says mark flannagan , chief executive of the . charity beating bowel cancer . ` we 've had patients with red-flag symptoms . - such as blood in their stools - being told  you 've got ibs  or .  you 're too young to have cancer  by their gps .

' i got the impression they did n't take me very seriously , ' she recalls . soon . after , she was vomiting up to ten times a day , feeling dizzy and weak , . passing blood and experiencing chronic diarrhoea . at an emergency gp . appointment , she was examined by a different doctor who immediately . referred her to hospital ; after several days of tests , she was diagnosed . with cancer . four days before christmas , hayley underwent surgery . ` we thought we 'd be enjoying our first christmas as a family , but . instead i was in hospital , grieving for the loss of our little girl and . terrified about the future , ' she recalls . ` my treatment might have been . less of an ordeal if my cancer had been picked up sooner . it makes me . quite angry to think if i 'd been 60 , it would have been picked up more . quickly . ' but even obvious symptoms are often missed by doctors , . says mr flannagan . ' i am not blaming gps , but we need to not be shy of . pointing out where things are going wrong . the default position should . be for a gp to rule out cancer , just to be safe . ' ` it can also be problematic if patients do n't have obvious symptoms such as bleeding ' , says dr monahan . ` they may instead have vaguer symptoms such as tiredness , unexplained weight loss or abdominal pain , which could be attributed to being symptoms of other conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome or crohn 's disease . ' public awareness . is also an issue . a survey in march by health insurer axa ppp found . nearly half of men could n't name one symptom of bowel cancer . indeed , . martin vickers , 49 , had never heard of it before his diagnosis in 2008 . ' i was totally shocked , ' says the father of four , who lives in . burton-on-trent with wife andrea , 48 . ' i did n't know bowel cancer . existed . it was hugely traumatic . ' martin visited his gp five times . in nine months with extreme tiredness and loose stools . his symptoms . were attributed to stress - his mother had recently died and he has a . high-pressure job as head of capital investment for cambridge and south . staffordshire water - and then ibs . joining friends and family to complete a guinness book of records challenge creating hearts with hands . ` but i knew something was n't . right , ' says martin . ` it was instinctive . ' he was finally diagnosed with . stage three bowel cancer in november 2008 , after his gp did an internal . examination and felt a lump . martin underwent three months of . chemotherapy and radiotherapy , followed by surgery , another six months . of chemotherapy and a second operation . he now has to use a colostomy . bag but has been in remission for five years . currently , screening is . only available to people aged 60-plus . they are sent home tests , which . involve sending a stool sample to a lab . but the department of health is . now looking at a new procedure , bowel scope screening , which involves a . partial colonoscopy - examining only the lower bowel . a major uk . trial of 55 to 64 year olds showed that people screened this way were 43 . per cent less likely to die from bowel cancer , and 33 per cent less . likely to develop it . this is because the procedure is usually successful at detecting small growths known as polyps , which can become cancerous . the . screening - which would be offered to everyone aged 55 and over - is . now being piloted . campaigners hope it will be made available nationally . by 2016 . ` this is a really important development and should make a big difference to bowel cancer outcomes , ' says dr monahan , who runs the family history of bowel cancer clinic at west middlesex university hospital , specialising in hereditary components of the disease . it wo n't , however , help younger patients such as hayley . before her chemotherapy , she and paul had nine embryos frozen via ivf . however she is worried she may pass on lynch syndrome , so the couple are . considering what to do . but she says : ' i am still here , i have a life ahead of me - and i hope my story will help others to be diagnosed in time .
