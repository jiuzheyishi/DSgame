{"text": "as millions of taiwanese headed for the polling stations across the nation last weekend , there was a general sense that change was at hand . as the results of the vote started trickling in during the evening , it soon became clear that the political scene in taiwan was about to become a much different place . it was a rout . when it was all over and done , the ruling kuomintang -lrb- kmt -rrb- had merely won six of the 22 constituencies in the mayoral and commissioner elections , while the opposition democratic progressive party -lrb- dpp -rrb- won 13 , and did so with sizable leads . moreover , the kmt had lost control of taipei , the capital city it had run for 16 consecutive years , to an independent with no political experience , and also saw safe cities in the northern half of the island , such as hsinchu and taoyuan , slip through its fingers . in all , it lost nine of the 15 cities and counties it used to control . overall , the dpp garnered 5.83 million votes , or 47.6 % , against the kmt 's 4.99 million -lrb- 40.7 % -rrb- . however , if we factor the votes that went to independent candidates who are ideologically close to the dpp , the  green camp  accounted for a solid 6.88 million votes . discontent with the kmt alone does n't sufficiently explain the dpp 's performance ; the latter , including leader tsai ing-wen , worked tirelessly in the lead-up to the elections , and for the most part fielded candidates of quality . in the wake of catastrophe , premier jiang yi-huah and kmt secretary-general tseng yung-chyuan , as well as 80 members of the cabinet , have resigned , and it is now rumored that president ma ying-jeou , who doubles as kmt chairman , could step down from the latter position on wednesday . lazy campaigns ? there are sundry reasons for the defeat . in many constituencies , including taipei , the kmt ran lazy campaigns and spent more time attacking its opponents than trying to convince voters of the virtues of its own candidates . more importantly , ma and his party have become highly unpopular . after six years of rapprochement with beijing , and the signing of as many as 20 cross-strait agreements , the promised  revival  of taiwan 's stagnating economy never materialized . furthermore , the benefits of increasing trade with china tended to fall in the lap of magnates who were close to the administration , while for the majority of taiwanese -- especially youth -- the prospects for their future seemed grim . many voters appear to have blamed the kmt 's inability to deliver domestically on the administration 's single-minded focus on china . undeniably , relations between the two sides have improved since 2008 , when ma stepped into office , but many have become increasingly aware of the inherent political risks of doing so . taiwanese of all stripes know that beijing continues to regard taiwan as a  renegade province ,  but many were nevertheless willing to liberalize ties with it , though many faulted ma for not paying enough attention to safeguarding the island 's sovereignty and democracy in the process . more and more , local problems were seen to be tied to the external china factor . from the media to major infrastructure projects ,  black box  trade agreements to pro-beijing gangsters menacing the population , china 's hand suddenly became a major issue . a red line had been crossed , and civic organizations fearing the administration had gone too far , took action . in march , scores of protesters stormed a key government building to urge the government to scrap a controversial trade deal with china in what was dubbed the sunflower movement . the ma administration reacted to all this with repression , then indifference , and consequently paid a high price on november 29 . one of the sunflowers ' greatest achievements was to raise awareness about the perceived failures of government and the  black hand  of china . sunflower generation . candidates like ko wen-je in taipei had great appeal with the sunflower generation . the fact that the dpp chose not to field a candidate to run against him was a masterful move on chairperson tsai 's part : it signaled the party 's willingness to cooperate with this  third force .  several young candidates , some of them from smaller parties or running as independents , were also elected and will be part of that coalition . this green coalition will undoubtedly be more attuned to civil society , and their control of a majority of the municipalities across taiwan will make it more difficult for the central government to implement policies that are unpopular with the public -- something it has done repeatedly since the beginning of ma 's second , and last , term in 2012 . in an early sign that things may be already changing , mayor-elect ko has already said he would fire the police chief in xinyi district if pro-beijing activists continued to physically assault practitioners offalun gong -- a spiritual movement banned in china -- and pro-taiwan independence activists outside the taipei 101 skyscraper . facing much greater resistance from  below ,  and confronted to an emboldened pan-green coalition , ma 's ability to press ahead with further unpopular agreements with china likely has been severely compromised . with a little more than a year left in office , he may have reached the limit of what he can give to beijing , even more so if he steps down as party chairman . there is no doubt that civil society , and the many that it inspired , punished the kmt in the elections . unless the kmt wants to go through a similar embarrassment in the 2016 presidential election , whoever is in charge will have to ensure that the party better reflects public wishes . and that means being more careful with china .", "summary": " taiwan 's ruling party routed in local elections in  black saturday .    they lost control of taipei for first time in 16 years .   lazy campaigns and the  china factor  caused their defeat , says cole .    sunflower generation  wary of closer ties with china .
