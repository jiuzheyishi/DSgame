{"text": "san diego , california -lrb- cnn -rrb- political attacks have really gone to the dogs . they used to have more style and substance . it was considered bad form to just weave an attack out of whole cloth , counting on the fact that the mark was so despised by a segment of society that people would be anxious to believe the worst . it used to be that when you wanted to sling mud at someone whose politics you did n't agree with -- chiefly as a way of making them look bad and yourself look good by comparison -- you 'd try to dig up dirt , find a skeleton in a closet or challenge the person 's integrity . these days , you do n't have to work that hard . the whole process is do-it-yourself . you just go to facebook and see what embarrassing family photos can be linked to the person you intend to slime . the target does n't even have to be in the photo . just the fact that they posted it , or thought it was humorous , or in any way condoned the act is good enough . in our narcissistic look-at-me-and-mine culture , social media networks are veritable treasure chests of blunders , blushes and blemishes . even with our best efforts to use these sites to showcase our best features , there is plenty of embarrassment to go around . once you find the photos , you do a little cut and paste . then you can scribble a few sentences about how shocked -- shocked ! -- you are that people could behave in such a manner . be sure to include a line from the head of some nonprofit that raises funds by advancing the idea that , without a group like theirs , our entire society would be in dire straits . if you 're attacking someone on the left , you might hunt around on social media for a photo where they 're not wearing a flag pin and accuse them of being unpatriotic . if you 're trying to smear someone on the right , you can fall back on the old standby and accuse them of being uncaring . how uncaring ? enough to use a dog as a food stool . the offender in question is 6-year-old trig palin , who became an instant target of supposedly tolerant liberals when he wound up being born to mother sarah , one of the most popular political figures for conservatives and a constant thorn in the side of liberals . this time , what put trig in the liberal 's version of  timeout  is a photo on his mom 's facebook page of him standing barefoot on his new pet dog -- a black labrador oddly named jill hadassah -- so he could reach the kitchen sink and wash his dish . the liberal organization , people for the ethical treatment of animals , was not amused . peta blasted palin in a statement , calling her  hard-hearted  and  bizarrely callous .  the statement read ,  it 's odd that anyone -- let alone a mother -- would find it appropriate to post such a thing , with no apparent sympathy for the dog in the photo .  you know who deserves sympathy ? the journalists who got that statement and had to whip up a story based on faux outrage . palin struck back by zeroing in with the real reason that groups like peta have lost influence and credibility : the double standard they employ , denouncing certain behavior by the people they oppose while excusing the same behavior by people they support . where was the organization last year , she asked , when the liberal talk show hosted by ellen degeneres , posted a similar photo of a girl standing on a dog ? back then , peta was awol . she is right about the double standard . and i admire her spunk . in a world of politicians and even former politicians who are so careful about what they say and do that they do n't say or do anything , palin unplugged is a refreshing exception . there is more to the story . according to media reports , the canine is a service dog that was trained to care for trig , who has down syndrome . the little guy does n't just need special care . it seems that he also needs constant protection -- from liberals who hate his mommy . trig was first targeted by the left in february 2010 , when he was just shy of 2 years old . that 's when seth macfarlane , creator of the fox animated comedy ,  family guy ,  thought it would be a hoot to air an episode that demolished all the preaching that liberals have done over the years about tolerance and the importance of defending those with special needs . in the episode , the character chris is dating a teenage girl with down syndrome , and when he asks her what her parents do , she says ,  my dad 's an accountant , and my mom is the former governor of alaska .  david tolleson , head of the atlanta-based national down syndrome congress , called the gag  hurtful and stereotypical .  and palin 's daughter bristol wrote on her mom 's facebook page that the joke was especially cruel given that her brother already faces a life filled with intolerance and prejudice . on the defensive , macfarlane claimed at the time that he was  an equal opportunity offender .  sure . in 2008 , the comedian had spoken at an obama-biden rally at a university in ohio , where he took potshots at republicans and touted the democratic ticket . as all this unfolded , we learned -- thanks to trig -- a valuable lesson about how the tolerant left has a much stronger stomach for intolerance if its aimed at one of its enemies . now the little guy is at it again , teaching us that liberals are creative enough to make smears out of thin air . in a perfect world , i 'd prefer that children not mistake their household pets for a step ladder . but whatever else can be said about the world that trig palin is likely to face in the years to come , this much we know : it wo n't be perfect .", "summary": " peta criticized posting of photo of sarah palin 's child standing on a dog .   ruben navarrette : animal rights groups targeted palin unfairly .
