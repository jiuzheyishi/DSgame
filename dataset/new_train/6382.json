{"text": "nasa has released a stunning new panorama that shows the cosmos at its most colorful . the incredible image was captured by the hubble space telescope and , for the first time , includes ultraviolet light , which is normally not visible to the human eye . it shows up in the photo as bright baby blue with spinning galaxies , which are about five to 10 billion years old , not too old or young in cosmic terms . the hubble team have unveiled the most colorful view of universe yet after it was captured by the space telescope . the photo - made from 841 orbits of telescope viewing time - shows about 10,000 multi-colored galaxies , extending back in time to within a few hundred million years of the big bang . hubble astronomer zolt levay said by adding ultraviolet and infrared to the pictures , people can now see the universe in the broad spectrum of color ` and then some . ' astronomers previously studied the hubble ultra deep field in visible and near-infrared light in a series of images captured from 2003 to 2009 . but using ultraviolet light , astronomers have combined the full range of colors available to hubble , stretching all the way from ultraviolet to near-infrared light . principal investigator harry teplitz of caltech in pasadena , california , said : ` the lack of information from ultraviolet light made studying galaxies in the hudf like trying to understand the history of families without knowing about the grade-school children . ` the addition of the ultraviolet fills in this missing range . ' the hubble space telescope is seen in this picture taken from a space shuttle . the hubble space telescope was carried into orbit by a space shuttle in 1990 . hubble 's four main instruments observe in the near ultraviolet , visible , and near infrared . its orbit outside the distortion of earth 's atmosphere allows it to take extremely high-resolution images with almost no background light . hubble 's deep field has recorded some of the most detailed visible-light images ever , allowing a deep view into space and time . the telescope is one of nasa 's great observatories , along with the compton gamma ray observatory , the chandra x-ray observatory and the spitzer space telescope . hubble is the only telescope designed to be serviced in space by astronauts . its scientific successor , the james webb space telescope is currently scheduled to be launched by nasa in 2018 . ultraviolet light comes from the hottest , largest , and youngest stars . by observing at these wavelengths , researchers get a direct look at which galaxies are forming stars and where the stars are forming within those galaxies . studying the ultraviolet images of galaxies in this intermediate time period enables astronomers to understand how galaxies grew in size by forming small collections of very hot stars . because earth 's atmosphere filters most ultraviolet light , this work can only be accomplished with a space-based telescope . ` ultraviolet surveys like this one using the unique capability of hubble are incredibly important in planning for nasa 's james webb space telescope , ' said team member rogier windhorst of arizona state university in tempe . ` hubble provides an invaluable ultraviolet-light dataset that researchers will need to combine with infrared data from webb . ` this is the first really deep ultraviolet image to show the power of that combination .
