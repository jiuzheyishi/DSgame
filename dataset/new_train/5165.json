{"text": "welfare handouts to those languishing on the dole have risen almost twice as fast as average wages over the past five years . out-of-work benefits have jumped in value by an astonishing 20 per cent since 2007 while wages have crept up by just 12 per cent , official figures released last night reveal . work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith said the figures proved that automatically increasing benefits by the rate of inflation , as has previously been the case , was ` not fair ' on working people whose taxes fund the handouts . no work pays off : jobseeker 's allowance has risen by 20 per cent , from # 59.15 a week in 2007 to # 71 . ministers are now battling to reform the system and impose a 1 per cent cap on out-of-work benefit increases for the next three years , but face opposition from labour . mr duncan smith said yesterday : ` working people across the country have been tightening their belts after years of pay restraint while at the same time watching benefits increase . that is not fair . ` the welfare state under labour effectively trapped thousands of families into dependency as it made no sense to give up the certainty of a benefit payment in order to go back to work . ' the disparity between those in work and those on welfare is laid bare by the figures from the department for work and pensions . while working families have faced a . greater squeeze on their income from inflation , benefit claimants have . been cushioned from the soaring cost of living by automatic . inflation-linked rises in their payments . ` not fair ' : work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith said the new 1 per cent cap on jobseekers ' handout increases was necessary to make the system fair towards taxpayers . over the past five years , jobseeker 's allowance rose by 20 per cent from # 59.15 a week in 2007/08 to # 71 in 2012/13 . last year alone , out-of-work benefits rose by 5.2 per cent , while average earnings increased by 1.7 per cent -- just one-third the rate . meanwhile , across the whole economy , weekly earnings went up from # 392 in 2007 to # 441 in 2012 . ministers argue that the figures underline their case that labour 's welfare system provided a disincentive to claimants to take a job . a new universal credit scheme , to be introduced in stages from april , will replace most existing out-of-work benefits and is designed to ensure that it always pays to work . unifying taxes and benefits into one system , it will also prevent total benefits from exceeding the average wage . the new figures will also strengthen the case for the government 's decision to cap benefit increases to 1 per cent . unfair increase : whilst state handouts for jobless have risen by 20 per cent , wages are only up by 12 per cent since 2007 . chancellor george osborne faced criticism from labour and the unions for the decision , announced in his autumn statement last month . labour has vowed to vote against the 1 per cent rise when the measure is debated in parliament early this year . but ministers insist it would be unaffordable to allow benefits to continue to outstrip wages , as well as unfair . private sector pay has stagnated during the recession , while the public sector has been subject to a three-year pay freeze . labour argues that the new benefits cap will hit millions of working families on low incomes whose tax credits will also be capped . the party 's work and pensions spokesman , liam byrne , said the move would mean some part-time workers would be better off on benefits . mr duncan smith said the new universal credit system would ensure fairness , adding : ` this government is restoring fairness to the system and universal credit will ensure it always pays to be in work . ' mr osborne is determined to shave a further # 10billion from the welfare bill , on top of an # 18billion reduction in benefits already in place , after a more downbeat than expected economic forecast . the cost of increasing benefits in line with inflation since the 2008 recession has been # 6.3 billion . in 2009 alone , the labour government raised means-tested benefits -- not pensions -- by 6.3 per cent . overall , more than # 90billion is spent on working age welfare every year , the same as the entire education budget .", "summary": " jobseeker 's allowance up 20 per cent from # 59.15 a week in 2007/08 to # 71 .   in the same five-year period wages only rose by 12 per cent .   iana duncan smith said the system is not fair on workers .
