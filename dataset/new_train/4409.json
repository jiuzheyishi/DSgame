{"text": "the fbi caught the man accused of creating silk road -- the shadowy e-commerce site it describes as  the most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the internet today  -- after he allegedly posted his gmail address online , according to court documents . federal agents swooped on ross william ulbricht in a san francisco public library tuesday afternoon , charging the 29-year-old american with narcotics trafficking , computer hacking and money laundering . they allege he is  the dread pirate roberts ,  the silk road 's mysterious founder , who drew his pseudonym from the feared , fictitious character in the film the princess bride . the fbi claims the former physics and engineering student even publicly alluded to his alleged criminal enterprise on his linkedin profile , with a statement describing how his goals had  shifted  in accordance with his libertarian economic views since leaving grad school at pennsylvania state university . ulbricht 's linkedin profile states that , since completing his studies in 2010 , he has focused on  creating an economic simulation to give people a first-hand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without the systemic use of force  of the kind imposed by  institutions and governments .   i want to use economic theory as a means to abolish the use of coercion and agression -lrb- sic -rrb- amongst mankind ,  he wrote . in the indictment against ulbricht , filed in a new york court , the fbi cyber-crime specialist who led the investigation , christopher tarbell , stated that he believed  that this ` economic simulation ' referred to by ulbricht is silk road .  the amazon.com of vice . the fbi swiftly shuttered the site , an underground digital marketplace that , since its inception in 2011 , has allowed users to anonymously trade illegal goods and services in near total secrecy , using the digital currency bitcoin , and an encryption network called tor that routes traffic through a  hidden  area of the internet known as  the dark web .  time.com : online drug markets alive and thriving . tarbell said the site  sought to make conducting illegal transactions on the internet as easy and frictionless as shopping online at mainstream e-commerce websites ,  and carried listings for hard drugs , hackers , counterfeit cash , forged id documents , firearms , ammunition , even hitmen -- one of whom ulbricht is alleged to have enlisted to kill a blackmailer . according to the indictment , silk road had acquired nearly a million registered users worldwide -- about 30 % of whom were based in the u.s. -- in its two and a half years of operation , providing them guidance on how to encrypt their communications and vacuum-pack their wares before shipping through the postal service to avoid detection by law enforcement . last year , it said , the site added a  stealth mode  for users who considered themselves  at risk of becoming a target for law enforcement .  the indictment said the site had generated over 9.5 million bitcoins in sales revenue and over 600,000 bitcoins in commissions for its owner , allowing the site to employ a team of administrators . the value of bitcoins has fluctuated dramatically since the digital currency was created -- it plummeted after ulbricht 's arrest -- but tarbell estimated silk road 's turnover to be worth about $ 1.2 billion in sales , and $ 80 million in commissions . in february , an australian drug dealer became the first person to be convicted in connection to silk road after using the site to import cocaine and mdma from europe . catching the dread pirate roberts . in the section of the indictment outlining how the link between ulbricht and dread pirate roberts was established , tarbell detailed how an fbi expert codenamed agent-1 had located an early online mention of silk road dating to january 27 , 2011 , when a user under the handle  altoid  made a post on a forum for users of magic mushrooms .  i came across this website called silk road ,  wrote altoid , in a post which linked to the site .  i 'm thinking of buying off it ... let me know what you think .  two days later , someone using the handle  altoid  made a similar post on a forum called bitcoin talk , recommending silk road and providing a link .  has anyone seen silk road yet ? it 's kind of like an anonymous amazon.com . i do n't think they have heroin on there , but they are selling other stuff ,  it read . the posts , said tarbell , were an attempt to drum up interest in silk road , employing the online marketing tactic of  astroturfing .  investigators were given a major break when , eight months later ,  altoid  made another posting on bitcoin talk , stating he was looking for  an it pro in the bitcoin community  to hire in connection with  a venture backed bitcoin startup company .  the posting asked interested parties to contact rossulbricht@gmail.com . the indictment also noted that ulbricht and dread pirate roberts were both vocal adherents of the libertarian theories of austrian school economist ludwig von mises , with ulbricht 's public google + account linking to youtube videos posted by the ludwig von mises institute , and dread pirate roberts repeatedly crediting von mises with  providing the philosophical underpinnings for silk road .  from a san francisco internet cafe . tarbell said that while dread pirate roberts used a  virtual private network ,  or vpn , to create a  false  ip address , the vpn server 's records indicated a user had accessed it from a san francisco internet café near the home of a friend ulbricht had gone to live with around september last year . records obtained from google showed ulbricht had regularly logged into his gmail account from the internet café , he said -- including on the same day in june that the vpn was accessed . in july , ulbricht was visited in san francisco by homeland security agents who had intercepted a package from canada containing fake id documents in nine different names , each bearing a photograph of ulbricht . according to the indictment , ulbricht -- whose roommates knew him as  josh ,  and said he was always at home on his computer -- refused to answer questions about the ids , but told the agents that  hypothetically  anyone could go on the silk road and purchase them . in the weeks prior to the encounter , said tarbell , dread pirate roberts had been inquiring with silk road users about buying fake ids , saying he needed them in order to rent extra servers for the site . a killing for hire ? it was not the only time ulbricht is alleged to have used the site to procure illegal services . tarbell claimed that in march , dread pirate roberts solicited the killing of a silk road user who was attempting to blackmail him by threatening to release the identities of thousands of users of the site . the fbi alleges that the canada-based extortionist , known as friendlychemist , demanded $ 500,000 to prevent the release of the information , prompting dread pirate roberts to contact another user and order a hit on friendlychemist .  in my eyes , friendlychemist is a liability and i would n't mind if he was executed ,  he is alleged to have written , before attempting to haggle down the price .  do n't want to be a pain here , but the price seems high . not long ago , i had a clean hit done for $ 80k .  the fbi claims the hitman later sent a picture of the victim after the job was done -- for approximately $ 150,000 in bitcoins -- although tarbell said canadian authorities had no record of a canadian resident with the name passed to the alleged hitman , nor any record of a homicide around that location and time . ulbricht 's lawyer , brandon leblanc , declined to comment on the case . silk road 's closure is unlikely to bring an end to the trade of illegal goods on the  dark web ,  as similar sites operate on the tor network .", "summary": " alleged creator of the internet 's biggest criminal marketplace arrested in u.s.   the fbi claims ross ulbricht , 29 , earned $ 80 million in commission from the shadowy site .   it had nearly a million registered users , responsible for an estimated $ 1.2 billion in sales .   despite the site 's secrecy , ulbricht was tracked after a number of online slip-ups .
