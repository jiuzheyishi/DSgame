{"text": "a very wise district attorney once gave a piece of pragmatic advice to a young assistant prosecutor investigating a prominent political figure . the case involved evidence that could possibly support a criminal indictment yet was unlikely to result in a conviction . that da 's advice to his young assistant :  if you are going to shoot at the king , you 'd better be able to kill the king .  the wisdom of that literary caveat , self-evident to those who pursue the powerful , is particularly relevant to the gov. chris christie scandal involving traffic delays at the george washington bridge . in the days and weeks to come , prosecutors with potential jurisdiction over a criminal investigation of christie and his political acolytes regarding the agonizing traffic tie-up -- and a possible subsequent cover-up -- will be carefully screening the evidence . they would be wise to consider the pragmatic advice about king-slaying , which has been quietly observed by sensible prosecutors for years . three prosecutors have potential jurisdiction : manhattan district attorney cyrus vance jr. ; bergen county , new jersey , prosecutor john molinelli ; and u. s. attorney paul fishman , the man who replaced christie as new jersey 's federal prosecutor . opinion : a lesson for chris christie from richard nixon . vance is a democrat , known for nonpartisanship . molinelli was appointed bergen county prosecutor by christie 's predecessor , a democrat . and fishman is the appointee of a democratic president with the blessing of new jersey 's two u.s. senators , both democrats . all three prosecutors enjoy reputations for fairness and integrity in the conduct of their offices , but it would be a deft trick for each of the three to reassure residents of new york , new jersey and the nation that any investigation -lrb- and possible prosecutions -rrb- will be free of political influence . though vance may have a shred of a right to prosecute -lrb- because the bridge touches land in new york county -rrb- , i suspect he is wise enough to know that his manhattan da 's office has no business interfering in this jersey mess . molinelli , though , has more legitimate concerns -- the individuals most affected were those living in the bergen county towns he serves . there is even a new jersey criminal statute entitled  official misconduct  relating to the abuse of governmental authority by public servants for personal gain that may be relevant to the bridge brouhaha . as a lame duck prosecutor appointed by christie 's predecessor , democrat john corzine , molinelli will face heavy scrutiny if he tries to slay the king -- in this case , the governor . enter fishman , the u.s. attorney and potential white knight . though a registered democrat appointed by president barack obama , he was sworn into office by justice samuel alito , a conservative icon . opinion : christie 's bogus ` stages of grief ' fishman has sterling credentials and a reputation for fairness . he 's vowed since 2009 to keep politics out of his powerful office and to depoliticize it after many prosecutions by his predecessor were criticized as having been political in nature . that predecessor ? chris christie . the legal bloodlines of this case are more mixed than the contents of a meadowlands landfill . fishman , as the ranking fed , can force local jersey prosecutors out of the ring through a variety of tactics , if he chooses to do so . bergen 's molinelli could insist on proceeding -- but , in the face of a potentially more serious federal intervention , most local prosecutors would back off . why would the locals defer to fishman ? the answer is entirely pragmatic . these prosecutors have to work together on many overlapping cases as they each seek to round up new jersey 's notorious collection of bad guys . and a local da generally defers to a federal prosecutor who can supersede him in a variety of ways . politics and pragmatism enters every field in our system , even criminal prosecutions . given christie 's political prominence -- both in new jersey and nationwide -- you are certain to see , in coming days and weeks , a steady stream of information discreetly leaked to news media regarding ongoing criminal and civil investigations . though christie will endure potentially embarrassing legislative hearings , predictable federal subpoenas , and possible damage to his promising presidential candidacy , i think it 's safe to say the governor will not be indicted . there is a greater downside to that scenario : voters may be convinced it is indeed a political witch hunt intended to cripple a leading presidential candidate . despite some titillating hints from insiders , the bulk of evidence relating to the bridge fiasco probably remains undisclosed . christie , as a former prosecutor , is far too smart to have left his fingerprints or interoffice  dna  on any specifics of the bridge fiasco . even if a former aide or political pal testifies against the governor as part of a prosecutorial deal , most jurors would want to see corroboration . nobody likes a snitch , even a political one . the case will look like a political hatchet job and the wounded , angry  king  may strike back with political vengeance . the public will doubt the integrity of the prosecutor destroying his reputation . opinion : christie 's choice -- be seen as a crook or a schnook ? more of his political aides may fall as the search for scapegoats continues , but the governor will not be taken away in handcuffs . why ? because as that wise prosecutor once said ,  if you are going to shoot at the king , you 'd better be able to kill the king .  the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of paul callan .", "summary": " paul callan : prosecutors are loath to charge a powerful political figure .   he says it 's unlikely that chris christie left his fingerprints on the bridge issue .   the rule is that if you charge a powerful figure , you 'd better be able to win the case , he says .   callan : prosecutors will be wary of perception that they are on a political witch hunt .
