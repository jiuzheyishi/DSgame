{"text": "this is it - the end . i imagine the scissors , now mere centimetres from my neck , making a sound like the rush of a guillotine blade . for i am about to lose , if not my head , then the signature style that has defined me for the past 15 years . my shoulder-length , honey-coloured tresses . my pride and joy . ` stop ! ' i squeal . the long and short of it : an initially dubious petronella now loves her pixie cut . but it is too late . my life in hair flashes before my eyes : how i used to stroke it like a beloved pet when i was 13 and it had finally grown enough for me to tease it into a pinned-up style ; how i loved using hot rollers when i was 17 in an attempt to look like american actress veronica lake . so when i eventually look down and see my luscious locks on the floor , i think for one crazy moment something inside me has been murdered . ` it 's better to get it over with quickly , ' says tess boyle , my brilliant hairdresser from the jo hansford salon in mayfair , london . i 've long been visiting tess for haircuts , and the duchess of cornwall and liz hurley get their coiffures tended to here , too . but neither of them have done anything so drastic as to have the anne hathaway pixie crop . so what on earth possessed me ? well , it was n't fashion , despite the popularity of actress anne hathaway 's crop , which she had done for her role in the film les miserables . no , my decision was based on crude practicalities . for a start , my hair makes me late . on a holiday to jamaica , where the climate is devastating to long , frizzy hair like mine , i struggled with a hairdryer , hot irons and a heap of products to tame it into a semblance of a style every evening . ` have you never thought of cutting your hair ? ' asked my travelling companion , who 'd just waited an hour for me to turn up for dinner . top of the crops : anne hathaway 's pixie crop has become one of the top ten most copied celebrity hairstyles . i knew she was joking . but before i 'd left london , a male friend said : ' i like you best with you hair tied back , like a boy . ' i had been mildly annoyed ; now i wondered if he actually had a point . so when i returned to london , i confessed to a couple of friends that i was thinking of cutting it all off . they told me to go for it - after four glasses of wine . that 's when i broke the first rule of tonsorial decision-making : never text your hairdresser when drunk . the next morning i find myself , sweating , having a ` consultation ' with tess . ` right , ' she says . ' i was thinking anne hathaway . definitely anne hathaway . ' tess has been cutting my hair for 15 years and has been itching to chop it short for ages . but a pixie crop ? firstly , i worry that i 'll look more gruesome than gamine . my bone structure is good , but it 's not classical like hathaway 's . my nose has a bump in the middle - will such an unforgiving cut accentuate it ? secondly , i worry i 'll lose my sex appeal . do n't men love long , tangled hair that they can use to drag you back to their caves ? in the middle ages , english queens , no matter what they really looked like , were automatically endowed by painters and poets with very long , fair hair . the length indicated fertility and the light colour virtue . i had the length and the colour if not the virtue . so why did i want to lose those as well ? tess ignores my tortured bleating and says she believes long hair is not the most flattering style for women over 35 . she says it pulls down the face , making it appear older . short hair will ` take years off you ' . tess does n't even wash my hair before she begins to chop - apparently that gives people too much time to change their mind when going for something this drastic . ' i feel the back of my neck : there is . nothing there . i recall ronald reagan 's line in the 1942 film king 's . row . he finds out both his legs have been amputated and duly cries :  where 's the rest of me ?  ' she turns my chair away from the mirror . ` no peeking till it 's ready , ' she says , clearly worried i might faint from shock . then i am shampooed and my hair combed , parted and cropped with a small blade that brushes the back of my neck . i feel the back of my neck : there is nothing there . i recall ronald reagan 's line in the 1942 film king 's row . he finds out both his legs have been amputated and duly cries : ` where 's the rest of me ? ' tess begins to blowdry what 's left of me . it takes three minutes . it used to take me at least 25 . by this time i 'm almost sobbing . i realise that such a drastic change in hairstyle will require a whole new way of life . during the day , i almost never wear make-up because i can hide behind my hair . if my eyes are puffy , i simply shake some tendrils over them . if i get a spot on my forehead , i 'll artfully pin my hair to cover it . now i 'll need to wear lots of make-up at all times . i 'll need a new wardrobe , too . with a pixie crop , pared-down elegance is crucial . think fifties-style silk capri pants and fitted tops . but while i 'll save money on all those anti-frizz hair-styling products , my new wardrobe and enhanced make-up collection will cost another # 2,000 at least . oh lord ! ` you can look now , ' tess cries . i do not recognise the face staring back at me . my nose seems longer and larger . for one awful moment , i think i look like anne robinson . on the plus side , my eyes appear bigger and my cheekbones higher . in fact , i have n't seen my cheekbones for years - they were always hidden by hair . ` hello cheekbones , ' i say feebly trying to seem happier than i am . i go to the bathroom and apply thick black eyeliner in a vain imitation of audrey hepburn . when i add a slick of lipstick , i do feel a little better . while i look nothing like anne hathaway , i do look younger by at least five years . meanwhile , tess is ecstatic . ` it 's wonderful ! ' she gushes , ` it really suits you . ' my mother 's reaction is surprisingly enthusiastic , too . ` that 's nice , darling . i never noticed what a long neck you had before . ' cute cut : getting the chop can be nerve-wracking , but ultimately refreshing . still , i go out food shopping in dark glasses and a cap . no one recognises me , not even the butcher i owe money to . the following morning i have a coffee appointment with an old male friend . he screams . ` when did you do that ? ' the blood in my veins turns cold . ` it 's fabulous . it 's taken years off you , ' he continues . my spirits begin to rise . another friend says i look ` fresher ' . then i test it on a date with a man i 've been seeing for a while . nervously , i put on lashings of black eyeliner and flick my hair up at the ends . even with the agonising about clothes and make-up , it takes me only 15 minutes to get ready . gone is the need for backcombing , tonging and spraying my hair . when my date sees me , he hollers : ` hey , you 're on time . what happened ? ' i point to my hair . ` well it was about time you did something with it . your hair looked like an unmade bed . now you look sort of cute . ' cute ? i ca n't help but be thrilled . i have n't been called that since i was 22 . perhaps my pixie cut is n't so hair-raising after all .", "summary": " petronella wyatt 's shoulder-length hair do defined her signature style .   but maintaining it was time-intensive , so she got the lop !
