{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- all eyes were glued to the big guy in the gym . red-faced and sweaty , he must have been benching more than 300 pounds . but the weights were slipping . just as it looked as if he was going to get crushed by the immense burden dangling over his head , he tossed the weights up like it was no problem at all and popped up from the bench . he may have looked down for a minute , but he would not be defeated . the gym was silent . everyone was impressed . but the thing i noticed most as he strutted around gasping for air was his penn state university t-shirt .  that 's right ,  i thought as i rode the elliptical machine at my local gym a few days ago .  that 's how we do . we are penn state .  it was the first time since 2011 , when the horrific jerry sandusky child abuse scandal was revealed , that i felt any pride or connection to my alma mater . in 2012 , sandusky , the former assistant football coach , was sentenced to 30-60 years in prison for the sexual abuse of 10 boys after tearful testimony from his victims . since then , i 've wanted no association with the school or the culture that valued winning football games above protecting children from rape . and when my son was accepted to penn state that year , we tossed the acceptance letter in the trash . my own penn state sweatshirt was stuffed deep in the back of the closet . i am a nittany lion and i was ashamed . sadly , my new-found pride was short-lived . in an attempt to restore the university 's reputation , pennsylvania state officials led by senate majority leader jake corman and state treasurer rob mccord , filed a suit against the ncaa . they wanted all sanctions the ncaa placed against the school be lifted . the ncaa had reached beyond its authority in punishing penn state , they argued . in other words , their lawsuit had nothing to do with the boys who were raped or abused by sandusky . it had nothing to do with the fact that head football coach joe paterno , who died in 2012 , and others at the school had been alerted to this abuse as early as 1998 and did very little to make sure it stopped . nope , corman and others wanted redemption for penn state , based on a loophole over the authority of the ncaa to punish the football program . the ncaa caved , ruling last week to restore penn state 's 112 wins wiped out during the sandusky scandal , including the 111 wins erased from the record of head football coach joe paterno -- all the victories after the first time police were called by a mother reporting that sandusky had showered with her 10-year-old son on the penn state campus back in 1998 . and the $ 60 million dollar fine the ncaa levied against the school ? well , now instead of the ncaa collecting the fine and spending the dollars nationally , the ruling allows the university to keep the money but commit to spending the $ 60 million in pennsylvania to fund in-state child abuse programs only . other sanctions lifted by the ncaa ruling , include ending a five-year probation period and scholarship and transfer rules . we teach our kids when they do wrong to face up to it , take their punishment without complaint or excuses and move on . then , go out into the world and show everyone you are better than your lowest moments . it takes courage , integrity and leadership . that is what penn state needed to do . and so , for me , this is not a proud day for penn state . we 've cheated the system , bullied our way back into the record books . and we 've told the world once again that in happy valley winning is more important than anything . all those boys who were raped ? well , that 's not our problem . what 's important is making sure coach paterno 's 409-136-3 is restored .  the whole thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth ,  said mister mann frisby , a penn state alum , and track coach for more than 11 years .  the ncaa sanctions athletes for the smallest things -- you take a parent to lunch , it 's a violation . you help a student-athlete pay for airfare for their parent to see a game , it 's a violation . students lose eligibility , sports programs are punished . and now , the ncaa is lifting sanctions after boys were molested and raped on his watch and he did little or nothing to stop it . this sends a terrible message ,  said frisby , who was the first person in his family to graduate from college . this weekend , social media is abuzz with penn state fans applauding the ncaa decision , feeling vindicated . for many others , me included , this ruling and the reaction from the nittany lion nation wipes away any bonhomie the university was gaining over the past three years .  it is hard to believe that the ncaa and the school could take the most nauseating , the most horrifying , the most indefensible institutionalization of corruption in american sports -- the jerry sandusky scandal -- and make it worse , but today they just did ,  said espn 's keith olbermann said on his show friday . it seemed that the university was trying to clean up its act . joe paterno and university president graham spanier had been fired . both of those things needed to happen . the board of trustees had ushered in changes . the sandusky trial ended after months of testimony almost too unbearable to watch as abuse victim after abuse victim told their painful stories about being raped and molested by sandusky . a new coach was brought in and the team started winning . that 's how healing happens ; how forgiveness happens . one day at a time , trying to do better , be better than you were yesterday . there is no short cut on the road to redemption . even coach paterno knew that : .  success without honor is an unseasoned dish ; it will satisfy your hunger , but it wo n't taste good .  -- joe paterno . joepa may be back atop the record books as the  winningest coach ever ,  but he was not an honorable man -- not when it came to putting the lives and safety of children above football . and no ncaa ruling can change that history .", "summary": " roxanne jones : ncaa agreed to restore penn state 's wins under joe paterno .   she says settlement shows that university and its supporters still have n't accepted responsibility for scandal .
