{"text": "if you 've ever spilt water on a hot pan , you 've seen the leidenfrost effect in action . the skittering and fizzing that takes place happens because the surface is super-hot - about twice as hot as the liquid 's boiling point . this causes the water to levitate on the evaporated gas vapour which acts a barrier that keeps the droplet and the hot surface separated . scroll down for video ... the skittering of water occurs because a surface is about twice as hot as the liquid 's boiling point . this causes the water to levitate on the evaporated gas vapour which acts a barrier that keeps the droplet and the hot surface separated . when a liquid hits something really hot - about twice as hot as the liquid 's boiling point - it never comes directly in contact with its surface . this is because vapour acts as a barrier that keeps the two separated . the skittering of water you see when it hits a hot pan is the leidenfrost effect . bath university 's alex grounds and richard still looked at how droplets travel on different textured surfaces , heated at varying temperatures . they found that they could change the direction of the droplets ' movement by changing the temperature of the ratcheted surface . they also found that droplets can be made to climb up a steep incline -- the sharper the teeth of the surface , the steeper incline they were able to climb . and so the leidenfrost maze was created . the maze guides the water droplets in different directions using specially-arranged grooved hotplates . ` we think the droplets change direction depending on how fast the gas evaporates from the surface of the droplet and how much the droplet is levitating , combined with the effect of the textured surface that allows it to be propelled along and even go uphill , ' said researcher alex grounds . the . research could be used to develop more sophisticated methods for . controlling small droplets and heat transfer , such as cooling systems . without moving parts . researchers at bath university have found that water droplets can be made to climb up a steep incline using the leidenfrost effect -- the sharper the teeth of the surface , the steeper incline they were able to climb . the leidenfrost maze guides water droplets in different directions using specially-arranged grooved hotplates .", "summary": " this is because of something known as the ` leidenfrost effect '   the effect causes the water to levitate on the evaporated gas vapour .   movement can be changed by adjusting the surface texture and temperature .
