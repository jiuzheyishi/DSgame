{"text": "mitt romney won all three of tuesday 's republican presidential primaries , putting more distance between himself and his closest contender , rick santorum , who indicated he plans to fight on to his home state of pennsylvania and beyond . romney 's wins in wisconsin , maryland and the district of columbia put him past the halfway mark to the 1,144 delegates needed to clinch the nomination and add to a wide delegate lead that he holds over the other major gop presidential candidates , according to cnn estimates . yet santorum indicated tuesday night he would compete in the april 24 primaries in five states , including pennsylvania , where his campaign hopes a win would be a gateway to a run of may primaries in states where he can capitalize on higher percentages of conservative voters . romney , in a speech to supporters in milwaukee , made no mention of his gop rivals and instead mostly contrasted himself with president barack obama .  this has really been quite a night . we won a great victory tonight in our campaign to restore the promise of america ,  romney said . he continued his criticism of obama 's economic polices and what he repeatedly called obama 's plan for a  government centered society .   there is a basic choice that we 're going to face : the president has pledged to transform america , and he spent the last four years laying the foundation for a new government-centered society . i will spend the next four years rebuilding the foundation of an opportunity society led by free people and free enterprises .  the former massachusetts governor is expected to take the majority of wisconsin 's 42 delegates and maryland 's 37 delegates , with some designated solely for the winner and the rest to be awarded proportionally . he will take all 16 delegates at stake in the district of columbia . counting partial allocations for wisconsin and maryland , and full allocations for d.c. , romney has collected 648 delegates since the primary and caucuses began in january , according to cnn estimates . that 's more than twice the 264 delegates santorum is estimated to hold . gingrich and paul trailed well back . gop delegate count | delegate calculator . with 93 % of the vote reported in wisconsin , romney had 42 % and santorum , a former u.s. senator from pennsylvania , had 38 % . u.s. rep. ron paul of texas had 12 % , and former house speaker newt gingrich had 6 % . in maryland , with 75 % of the vote reported , romney had 49 % . santorum had 29 % , gingrich had 11 % and paul had 10 % . in the district of columbia , with 99 % of the vote reported , romney had 70 % . paul had 12 % and gingrich had 11 % . santorum was not on the d.c. ballot . maryland results | d.c. results . pre-primary polls appeared to show wisconsin 's contest was the only one tuesday that santorum had a chance to win . and analysts said wisconsin might be santorum 's final chance to slow romney 's march toward the gop nomination . wisconsin exit poll | maryland exit poll . but santorum told supporters in mars , pennsylvania , on tuesday night that the race was essentially at halftime , with only roughly half the available delegates awarded .  pennsylvania and half the other people in this country have yet to be heard , and we 're going to go out and campaign here and across this nation to make sure that their voices are heard in the next few months ,  santorum said . santorum , who has touted himself as a more conservative candidate than romney , also warned supporters that the republican party often has fielded moderate republicans against incumbent democratic presidents , only to see the moderate republican lose . he appeared to raise ronald reagan , a conservative who defeated jimmy carter in 1980 , as an example for a way forward .  if we 're going to win this race , we ca n't have little differences between our nominee and president obama . we have to have clear , contrasting colors ,  santorum said .  ... time and time again , the republican establishment and aristocracy have shoved down the throats of the republican party and people across this country moderate republicans because , of course , we have to win by getting people in the middle . there 's one person who understood we do n't win by moving to the middle . we win by getting people to the middle to move to us and move this country forward .  president barack obama , meanwhile , clinched the democratic presidential nomination tuesday with primary wins in maryland , the district of columbia and wisconsin , cnn projected . unlike the republicans , obama faces no serious opposition in his race . according to cnn 's delegate estimate , the president had 2,735 of the 2,778 delegates needed to secure his party 's nod before tuesday 's contest . he is expected to win most or all of the 119 delegates at stake in maryland and d.c. , as well as the 100 delegates at stake in wisconsin . on the republican side , since romney 's double-digit victory in illinois two weeks ago -- followed by a wave of some of the republican party 's major names and elder statesmen endorsing him and urging a quick conclusion to the divisive nomination battle -- the conversation seems to have changed : the gop front-runner increasingly being called the inevitable nominee . wisconsin exit polls show that endorsements might have helped romney . about 60 % of respondents said the romney endorsements were a factor in their votes , and 33 % called them an  important  factor . most of those voters broke for romney . cnn chief political correspondent candy crowley reported that romney 's campaign was prepared to spend  a lot of money and a lot of candidate time in pennsylvania ,  where polls show santorum 's once-large lead has shrunk . santorum 's campaign points toward may , which looks friendlier for him . he could be the favorite in primaries in north carolina and west virginia on may 8 , nebraska on may 15 , arkansas and kentucky on may 22 and texas a week later . but it could be too little , too late by may . sen. hillary clinton won most of the final contests against sen. barack obama in the marathon 2008 democratic presidential nomination battle . but in the end , it did n't matter . and ari fleischer , a cnn contributor and former george w. bush white house spokesman , said that while he believed that santorum earned the right to fight through pennsylvania , the race was all but over .  i think the writing is on the wall . does rick satorum want to read it is the question ,  fleischer said . romney and obama on tuesday seemed to be turning their attention to november 's general election , with romney blasting the president during a campaign stop in wisconsin and obama mentioning romney in a speech for the first time this year . speaking at a restaurant in waukesha , wisconsin , romney suggested obama wants to duck responsibility  for what 's happened in this country ,  saying the president should get full credit or blame for  what 's happened in this economy , and what 's happened to gasoline prices under his watch .   it is time to have somebody who will take responsibility , and if i am president , i will not only get things right again , i will take full responsibility for my errors and make sure that people understand we have a president in the white house again where the buck will stop at his desk ,  romney said , while standing with house budget committee chairman paul ryan , a prominent wisconsinite who endorsed romney . later tuesday , obama mentioned romney while slamming a house-passed budget proposal that ryan drew up and romney embraced . obama , speaking at a media luncheon in washington , said the plan , which would lower tax rates and cut spending while reforming the medicare and medicaid government-run health care programs , was  thinly veiled social darwinism  and  antithetical to our entire history as a land of opportunity and upward mobility for everyone who 's willing to work for it .   one of my political opponents , gov. romney , has said that he hoped a similar version of this plan from last year would be introduced on day one of his presidency ,  obama said .  he said that he 's very supportive of this new budget and he even called it marvelous , which is a word you do n't often hear when it comes to describing a budget .  while romney is far ahead of santorum , gingrich and paul in the hunt for delegates , exit polls have indicated romney still has a problem locking in the conservative base of the party . that continues to fuel santorum 's campaign , in which he continually depicts himself as the lone true conservative going up against the republican establishment and liberal media bias . as in previous contests , wisconsin 's early exit polls showed romney doing better among higher-earners and santorum better with lower-income voters . among exit-poll takers making $ 100,000 to $ 200,000 annually , romney led 55 % -30 % , with santorum winning the under - $ 30,000 voters , 44 % -34 % . the wisconsin exit polls showed santorum is more popular in rural areas and romney in urban areas in wisconsin . according to the exit polls , santorum was winning the rural vote , 37 % -27 % , and romney was winning big-city voters , 43 % -23 % . about 24 % of the vote in wisconsin came from urban areas and 22 % from rural areas , according to the exit polls . the rest is suburban . wisconsin 's primary was open to any registered voter in the state , regardless of party . exit polls showed that 58 % described themselves as republicans , 30 % said they were independent and 12 % said they were democrats . santorum was doing best among self-described democrats with 32 % of their vote , while romney had 22 % and paul had 16 % . cnn 's john helton , paul steinhauser , tom cohen , phil gast and peter hamby contributed to this report . watch piers morgan live weeknights 9 p.m. et
