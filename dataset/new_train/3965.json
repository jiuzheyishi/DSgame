{"text": "more than 55 million birds are killed by cats every year in the uk alone . but researchers have discovered that dressing felines in multi-coloured collars could drop this kill rate by 54 per cent . during tests , an anti-predation collar known as birdsbesafe -lrb- bbs -rrb- was found to give birds more warning about an impending attack due to their advanced colour vision . scroll down for video . the anti-predation collar cover is called birdsbesage -lrb- bbs -rrb- and is designed to be easily spotted by birds , reptiles and amphibians - known as herpetofauna . these animals have advanced colour vision compared to mammals . during tests the collar -lrb- pictured -rrb- reduced captures by 54 % in one year . the $ 9 collar is sold by a vermont-based firm of the same name . it is available in yellow , red and rainbow designs and claims to ` save birds from cats . ' researchers from the school of veterinary and life sciences at murdoch university , australia -- led by catherine hall - wanted to put this collar to the test . during a two-year period , ms hall and her team asked cat owners to report on the number and type of prey caught by their pets . birds can see certain light frequencies - such as ultraviolet - that humans can not see . many songbirds have feathers that reflect ultraviolet light to communicate and attract a mate . both birds and humans have photoreceptive ` cones ' in the retina located at the back of the eye that help the eyes see colour light . in humans , there are three types of photoreceptive cones which are sensitive to red , green , or blue , and this is called trichromatic colour vision . birds have an additional cone for tetrachromatic colour vision . this expands the visible light spectrum . birds also have up to 12 times the number of cones - around 120,000 cones per square millimetre - compared to humans . in the first year they studied the effectiveness of each individual colour and in the second year they concentrated on the rainbow collar . they discovered that the number of birds , reptiles and amphibians were reduced by 54 per cent across the board , but the rainbow and red bbs were more effective than the yellow . during the second year , captures were reduced by 47 per cent . however , captures of mammals such as mice and rats were not reduced significantly . the researchers said this is because birds , reptiles and amphibians have a more advanced colour vision meaning they could spot the collar more easily than animals with limited colour vision . birds , for example , can see certain light frequencies - such as ultraviolet - that humans can not see . many songbirds have feathers that reflect ultraviolet light to communicate and attract a mate . both birds and humans have photoreceptive cones in the retina located at the back of the eye that help them see colour light . the $ 9 collar is available in yellow , red and rainbow designs and claims to ` save birds from cats . ' researchers discovered that the number of birds , reptiles and amphibians killed were reduced when cats wore any collar colour , but the rainbow and red bbs were more effective than the yellow . in humans , there are three types of photoreceptive cones which are sensitive to red , green , or blue , and this is called trichromatic colour vision . birds have an additional cone for tetrachromatic colour vision . this expands the visible light spectrum . birds also have up to 12 times the number of cones - around 120,000 cones per square millimetre - compared to humans . the researchers also said they found no evidence that cats maintained a lower predation rate once the bbs was removed . the researchers said this is because birds , reptiles and amphibians have a more advanced colour vision meaning they could spot the collar -lrb- range pictured -rrb- more easily than animals with limited colour vision . ` the bbs is an option for owners wishing to reduce captures of birds and herpetofauna by free-ranging cats , especially where mammalian prey are introduced pests ' explained the study . ` to date , the bbs is the only predation deterrent that reduces significantly the number of herpetofauna brought home . ' almost 80 per cent of the pet owners said their cat showed no signs of distress when wearing the collar , and another 17 per cent said their cat got used to the collar within two days . the research was published in january in the journal applied animal behaviour science .", "summary": " the anti-predation collar cover is called birdsbesafe -lrb- bbs -rrb- .   it 's easily spotted by birds , reptiles and amphibians - or ` herpetofauna '   these animals have advanced colour vision compared to mammals .   during tests the collar reduced captures by 54 % in one year .   rainbow and red bbs collars were more effective than the yellow collars .   the $ 9 collar did not prevent the cats catching mice and rats .
