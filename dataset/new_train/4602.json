{"text": "after years of controversy , the latest version of the  psychiatric bible  -- the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders -- has been released . the dsm-5 -lrb- fifth edition -rrb- 's introduction , over the weekend at the american psychiatric association 's annual meeting , marks  the end of more than a decade 's journey in revising the criteria for the diagnosis and classification of mental disorders ,  the association says on the dsm-5 website . the manual includes the criteria used by mental health professionals to diagnose patients . it 's also used by insurance companies , schools and other agencies responsible for covering and creating special provisions for individuals with developmental or mental disorders . the overhaul -- the first for the dsm since 1994 -- has not come without opposition from activists , some grass-roots organizations and even the national institute of mental health , which last month said it was launching a project aimed at laying the foundation for a new classification system and would be  re-orienting its research away from dsm categories .  are we over-diagnosing mental illness ? here are five ways the dsm changes may affect you : . bereavement or depression ? previously , clinicians were advised against diagnosing major depression in people within two months after the death of a loved one : the  bereavement exclusion .  the dsm-5 removes the exclusion , a move the psychiatric association says  helps prevent major depression from being overlooked and facilitates the possibility of appropriate treatment including therapy or other interventions .  research has shown that for some people , the death of a loved one can precipitate major depression -- much like other stressors such as losing a job , the association says on the dsm-5 website . but  bereavement is the only life event and stressor specifically excluded from a diagnoses of major depression  in previous manuals . binge eating is officially an eating disorder . binge eating was approved as its own category of eating disorder in the dsm-5 . it 's defined as  recurring episodes of eating significantly more food in a short period of time than most people would eat under similar circumstances , with episodes marked by feelings of lack of control .  according to the association , the move is aimed at  increasing awareness of the substantial differences between binge eating disorder and the common phenomenon of overeating . while overeating is a challenge for many americans , recurrent binge eating is much less common , far more severe , and is associated with significant physical and psychological problems .  binge drinkers may be diagnosed as mild alcoholics . the revised dsm collapses the medical distinction between problem drinking and alcoholism . some experts say this could lead college binge drinkers , for example , to be mislabeled as alcoholics , a diagnosis that may follow them into adulthood . prior dsm editions included  alcohol abuse ,  along with the more serious  dependence .  however , the dsm-5 will make  alcohol use disorder  a single condition .  the field of substance abuse and addiction has witnessed an explosion in important research in the past two decades ,  said dr. david kupfer , chairman of the dsm-5 task force , in a february statement . the changes  reflect the best science in the field and provide new clarity in how to diagnose these disorders .  asperger 's syndrome becomes autism spectrum disorder . the proposal to group asperger 's and other developmental conditions together generated a flurry of comments and concerns . in 2010 , when the change was proposed , the asperger 's association of new england , a nonprofit organization with more than 3,000 members , wrote a letter to the american psychiatric association emphasizing that asperger 's should remain separate . but  the revised diagnosis represents a new , more accurate , and medically and scientifically useful way of diagnosing individuals with autism-related disorders ,  the national group says on the dsm-5 website . the work group that recommended the change  believes a single umbrella disorder will improve the diagnoses of asd without limiting the sensitivity of the criteria , or substantially changing the number of children being diagnosed .  in a statement on its website tuesday , the new england association assures its members ,  regardless of your diagnosis or label , we will continue to provide a gathering place where members of the asperger 's community can connect to one another .  doctor : why we 're making changes to autism diagnosis . being transgender no longer a mental disorder . the dsm-5 eliminates the term  gender identity disorder ,  which mental health specialists , along with lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender activists , had considered stigmatizing . it refers to  gender dysphoria ,  which focuses attention only on those who feel distressed by their gender identity .  i think it 's a significant change ,  jack drescher , a member of the psychiatric association group that recommended the change , said late last year .  it 's clinically defensible , but it reduces the amount of stigma and harm that existed before .  homosexuality was removed from the dsm in 1973 , a move he believes changed global views . some lgbt activists applauded the change , while others have questioned whether it goes far enough .", "summary": " the new diagnostic and statistical manual was released over the weekend .   the  psychiatric bible  overhaul has not been without controversy .   autism , binge eating and drinking and grief will all see changes in the new manual .
