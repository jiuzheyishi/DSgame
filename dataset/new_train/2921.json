{"text": "for now , alireza m. is a lucky man . but , like life itself , that may not last . convicted by an iranian court of possessing a kilogram of crystal meth , the 37-year-old man was sentenced to death by hanging at bojnurd prison in northeastern iran , according to jam-e-jam , an official newspaper that offered this wince-inducing account : . on the morning of october 9 , alireza m. was taken from his cell to the gallows , where the judge who had issued the order read his sentence aloud and official papers were signed . then , a rope was placed around his neck and he was hanged for 12 minutes , after which his body was lowered and a doctor declared he was dead . the doctor , the judge and the prison head then signed the death certificate , and the body of alireza m. was taken to a morgue for delivery the following day to his relatives . but the next day , a worker at the morgue noticed that plastic encasing one of the bodies had steam in front of the mouth . the worker told the doctors at the morgue , who took alireza m. to imam ali hospital in the town of bojnurd , where he was reported to be feeling better . alireza m. 's family told the newspaper they had been preparing to pick up the body when they heard that he was still alive , that his daughters had rejoiced and that they were hoping for a reprieve . but the judge who issued the sentence , mohammad erfan , was unmoved .  the sentence is approved and the sentence is death , so we will follow through with the execution order again ,  he said . a legal expert cited in the article said a law that mandates the death sentence for anyone possessing more than 30 grams of any illegal drug was passed three years ago . in a statement issued wednesday , amnesty international called for a reprieve .  the horrific prospect of this man facing a second hanging , after having gone through the whole ordeal already once , merely underlines the cruelty and inhumanity of the death penalty ,  said philip luther , director of amnesty international 's middle east and north africa program .  the iranian authorities must immediately halt alireza m 's execution and issue a moratorium on all others .  this year , iran is thought to have executed at least 508 people , most of them convicted of drug offenses , the group said .  carrying out a second execution on a man who somehow managed to survive 12 minutes of hanging -- who was certified as dead and whose body was about to be turned over to his family -- is simply ghastly . it betrays a basic lack of humanity that sadly underpins much of iran 's justice system ,  said luther . the organization human rights watch opposes execution as an inherently cruel and unusual form of punishment that violates fundamental human rights , said faraz sanei , a researcher in the organization 's middle east and north africa division . he said the group is particularly opposed to execution of alleged drug offenders because cases like alireza m 's are tried in revolutionary courts , which tend to include violations of due process , . in addition , the group considers hangings to constitute torture , he said . iran 's interpretation of sharia law allows for individuals to be spared from a second execution attempt in certain circumstances , like stoning in cases of adultery that fails to result in death . human rights groups estimate that the iranian authorities currently hold at least 10 women and men who face possible execution by stoning on adultery charges . at least 70 people have been executed by stoning in iran since 1980 . the last known execution by stoning was in 2009 , sanei said . but iranian judiciary officials say there is apparently nothing in law that would prevent alireza m. from being executed again . others have a different interpretation . according to the semi-official iranian labor news agency , ayatollah saafi golpayegani said saturday -- a high-ranking cleric who was being pressed on his position -- said ,  if a person is executed for drug smuggling and returns to life , his second execution is not allowed .  according to the u.n. 's 2010 drug report , a massive increase in seizures of high-purity crystalline methamphetamine from iran began in 2008 . that same year , for the first time , the country seized four clandestine meth labs . cnn 's neda farshbaf and shirzad bozorgmehr contributed to this report .", "summary": " hanged for 12 minutes , alireza m. is declared dead .   official papers are signed , and the body goes to a morgue .   but steamed plastic reveals that he is alive .   the judge is unmoved .
