{"text": "angry david cameron has accused ed miliband of resorting to childish taunts about his posh background -- as he described labour as ' a complete shower ' . the prime minister said mr miliband 's ` personal abuse ' did not bother him and insisted he was ` proud ' of his privileged background . at last week 's labour conference , mr miliband accused the pm of being a ` pr man ' for the rich . he said mr cameron only stood up for ` conservative supporting , gold mining , luxury hotel owning , putin award winning , russian oligarchs ' . but mr cameron said : ` there is quite an interesting difference - my argument about ed miliband is that he has not got a plan . that is substance . as far as i can see from his speech , he just had personal abuse . well after nine years of being party leader , i can cope with personal abuse . it does n't seem very grown-up . ' scroll down for video . david cameron , at the tory conference in birmingham , told party supporters that labour were a ` complete shower ' mr cameron made clear the next election would be a direct choice between him and ed miliband . mr cameron , who was in the conference hall to watch george osborne 's speech , insisted he did not live a ` totally rarefied existence ' he added : ` but at the end of the day , the election will be decided upon who has got the best plan , who is going to take the country forward . it is not about where i went to school . ' mr cameron , 47 , speaking to the sun newspaper insisted he did not live a ` totally rarefied existence ' -- but said he was not going to pretend he was not posh . he said : ` you ca n't change who you are , and i am not going to change who i am . ' i ca n't change the school i went to , or the upbringing i had , or the parents i have - and nor would i want to . ' mr cameron 's anger with the labour party came to the surface at a fringe event at the conservative party conference in birmingham last night . the pm , speaking to party activists , said the labour party was so poor it would be embarrassing not to beat them in may 's general election . he said : ` we saw last week what we are up against , and i have to say , after that labour leader 's speech , after that labour conference , if we , the conservative party , can not defeat that complete shower of an opposition we do n't deserve to be in politics . ' the remarks echo tony blair 's final conference speech as labour leader , in which he said of the tories : ` if we ca n't take this lot apart in the next few years we should n't be in the business of politics at all . ' ed miliband 's tried a similar tactic in his 2012 conference address , in which he asked : ` have you ever seen a more incompetent , hopeless , out-of-touch , u-turning , pledge-breaking , make-it-up-as-you-go-along , back-of-the-envelope , miserable shower than this prime minister and this government ? ' mr cameron said ` personal insults ' about his background did not bother him . but the tory party has targeted ed miliband as labour 's weak link . labour leader ed miliband resorted to digs about mr cameron 's background because he did n't have a ` plan ' for the economy , mr cameron said . in his interview with the sun , mr cameron said there were bits about him voters ` absolutely hate ' , but insisted not everyone was against him . he said : ' i think people have got to know me a bit . ' i am sure there are bits they like , bits they do n't like . ' but hae added : ` when i go round the country , you obviously get some good reactions you get some bad reactions . ` but generally people have a sense that the government is trying to do something , trying to sort things out . ' he added : ' a lot of people shout ` stick at it . ' that is probably what i hear more than anything else .
