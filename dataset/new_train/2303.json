{"text": "snapchat will add new privacy features after a hack last week that exposed millions of phone numbers and user names from the popular photo - and video-sharing app . the company said in a blog post it will be updating the app to allow users to opt out of a  find friends  feature that uses their mobile phone number . they 'll also be adding internal restrictions that will make it more difficult to employ the method hackers say they used to expose 4.6 million accounts .  the snapchat community is a place where friends feel comfortable expressing themselves and we 're dedicated to preventing abuse ,  snapchat said in the post , which did not include an apology to its users . on tuesday , hackers posted user names and phone numbers , with the final two numbers redacted , to a website called snapchatdb.info . the site had been suspended by its web host but , by friday , appeared to be back online with phone numbers and user names both partially disguised . the site made the data available for download and offered , by request , to consider releasing unredacted info , which matched the user names with the phone numbers associated with them . the hack appears to have been an effort to push snapchat into improving its privacy protections .  our motivation behind the release was to raise the public awareness around the issue , and also put public pressure on snapchat to get this exploit fixed ,  the hackers said in a statement released to news outlets .  it is understandable that tech startups have limited resources but security and privacy should not be a secondary goal . security matters as much as user experience does .  last week , gibson security -- a group of  white hat  hackers , meaning they do n't exploit the security gaps they find -- published what they said was code that would enable such a hack . the snapchatdb group said snapchat implemented  very minor obstacles  after that . in the blog post , snapchat said it had added security measures after gibson suggested in august that such a hack was possible , but that the group 's christmas eve post had more details that made snapchat 's system easier to exploit . sources told business insider last month that snapchat has about 30 million monthly active users and more than 16 million daily users .", "summary": " snapchat will let users opt out of  find friends  after last week 's hack .   hacker 's say they matched 4.6 million user names with phone numbers .   move was meant to urge snapchat to improve security .
