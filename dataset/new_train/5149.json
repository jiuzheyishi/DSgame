{"text": "a shetland pony who spent decades pulling carriages and sleds has retired , allowing him more time to engage in his favourite pastime - drinking pints of beer . the 28-year-old pony , called toby , has developed tastes slightly more luxurious than a mouthful of grass , loving nothing more than munching on mince pies and drinking a pint . toby 's owner amos putt said he has already taken the animal to every pub in his home village of fowey , cornwall and now plans to spend more time with his equine friend after 20 years of work . retired : toby , a 28-year-old shetland pony , enjoys nothing more than a pint and may be doing even more socialising after retiring . the pony spent 20 years working at carnivals and fetes . companions : toby with his owner amos putt from st blazey , cornwall . mr putt pours beer into a plastic cup , while the pony laps it up . the 71-year-old often brings the pony to the pub to enjoy a pint with him . to consume the drink , mr putt pours the beer into a plastic glass and holds it while the animal laps it up . the unusual habit began when toby worked as a carnival pony and has continued at the pair 's local at st. blazey football club . drinking partners : toby and mr putt at the par inn , cornwall where they often enjoy a drink . mr putt , 71 , a retired welder , said : ` we go out for a walk and then we go for a pint together in the pub afterwards . ` if it gets too busy he 'll go outside for a drink . he does n't get drunk . he would if he could , but i do n't let him .
