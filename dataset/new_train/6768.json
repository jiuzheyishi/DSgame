' the liliger cubs weighed approximately 3.5 pounds and were 11.25 inches long . the zoo plans to build a special exhibit of the rare animals , but the new liligers litter will be kept separate from the other cubs for now . joe added : ` they will be on exhibit in about six to eight weeks - we 're excited to see their progress . ' in many countries , such as thailand , breeding rare cats such as lions and tigers is illegal as it does nothing to preserve either species . the offspring serve no purpose and can not be introduced into the wild , so are usually bred only as a tourist attraction in order to make money for zoos , according to liger.org . there are several ligers in u.s. zoos , but oklahoma are the only zoo to breed liligers , a cross between a male lion and a female liger . the gender of the animal decides how the name is formed . while ligers are the mix of male lions and female tigers , tigons are male tigers and female lions . the controversial world of hybrids also includes ` leopons ' - the spawn of female leopards and male lions , along with several zebra-horse-donkey zebroids such as zorses , zonkeys , and zonies . camas are a mix of camels and llamas ; grolars and pizzlies are combinations of polar bears and grizzlies ; and there are also ` wolphins , ' bottlenose dolphins mated with false killer whales .", "summary": " male and female liliger cub born in oklahoma zoo on may 31 .   they are second set to be born to father sima and mother akara .   akara is a ligress , a crossbreed between a lion and a tiger .
