{"text": "zeppelins were once considered the future of air transport - but after the horror of the hindenburg disaster , they disappeared from the skies for more than 75 years . now a pioneering aviation firm hopes to bring back the airships in a bid to revolutionise the global market in transporting freight . the aeroscraft is built using innovative technology which allows it to control its flight better than previous airships , so it should avoid the problems experienced by the first generation of zeppelins . scroll down for video . revolutionary : the aeroscraft airship , pictured during testing , is set to reintroduce the zeppelin to the world 's skies . nearly ready : the zeppelin is set to have its first full test flight , and will roll off the production line from mid-2015 . it requires only a third as much fuel as an aeroplane carrying cargo , and it can take off and land anywhere even without a formal airstrip - including on water - making it well suited to war zones and disaster areas . the aircraft has been designed thanks to a $ 3million grant from the u.s. government , and it will soon be ready for its first test flight , according to business insider . the aeroscraft is designed by worldwide aeros corp. , who predict that it will change the way that goods are moved around the world by providing a mode of transport which is cheaper than planes but faster than ships . the key technological breakthrough came when the firm 's founder igor pasternak came up with a way to compress helium , which allows the airship to control its weight . impressive : the new age of the zeppelin relies on technology which compresses helium to allow better control of the aircraft . pilots : similar to a conventional aeroplane , the aeroscraft has a pilot and a co-pilot sitting in the cockpit . lift-off ! the appeal of the new-style blimp comes from the fact that it costs just a third as much to fly as an aeroplane . watch more videos about the aeroscraft here . the aeroscraft can take off and land vertically , like a helicopter , so it can visit destinations which do not have an airport . this means that even though its 115mph average speed is much slower than a jet aeroplane at 500mph-plus , the overall travel time could be lower because it can travel directly from where goods are produced to where they are needed . worldwide aeros hope that this will make it useful to the military and aid charities operating in parts of the world with poorly developed infrastructure on the ground . market : the firm behind the airship insists that it will be perfect for any company involved in transporting goods . testing : the manufacturers will be hoping to avoid the safety problems which plagued early generations of zeppelins . it may seem flimsy compared to a metal jet , but the aeroscraft has bulletproof skin , and even if its exterior is breached it does not deflate like a balloon . the firm claims that its first airships will be available to customers in mid-2015 , when they will be rented out for a year at a time . a model of the zeppelin which carries 66 tonnes will cost more than $ 25million per year , while a 250-tonne version will be $ 55million .", "summary": " the aeroscraft can take off and land without an airstrip meaning it can operate even in war zones and disaster areas .
