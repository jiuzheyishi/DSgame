{"text": "` he should get out a bit more ' : homosexual actor rupert everett -lrb- pictured -rrb- has drawn criticism from gay rights campaigners after rubbishing the idea of single-sex parents . he was seen as a champion for gay actors when he decided to come out of the closet two decades ago . now rupert everett finds himself in a somewhat less enviable position . the 53-year-old actor has been rounded on by gay rights groups after saying : ` i ca n't think of anything worse that being brought up by two gay dads . ' everett 's comments are likely to offend celebrity parents such as sir elton john and his partner david furnish . the couple have a 21-month-old son zachary , born to a surrogate mother . ben summerskill , chief executive of the gay rights group stonewall , said : ` rupert should get out a little bit more to see the facts for himself . ` there is absolutely no evidence that the kids of gay parents suffer in the way they are being brought up or in how they develop . ' in a provocative interview , everett -- who played a gay father opposite madonna in 2000 comedy the next best thing -- said his mother sara , 77 , wishes he had a wife and children . ` she has met my boyfriend , but i 'd imagine she still wishes i had a wife and kids , ' he said . ` she thinks children need a father and a mother and i agree with her . ` some people might not agree with that . fine ! that 's just my opinion . controversial views : everett , who came out of the closet 20 years ago , starred as a gay man who makes madonna pregnant after a one-night stand in the film the next best thing -lrb- above -rrb- . strong views : everett , an army major 's son , has in the past rubbished the idea of homosexuals having children through a surrogate . the wife of a businessman who became a sperm donor for a lesbian couple has spoken of the heart-breaking consequences of conceiving a ` baby to order ' . the woman said she initially supported her husband 's decision to help the gay couple have a child through a surrogate mother.but when it later emerged that the lesbian couple were not legally the baby 's parents , she and her husband launched a court battle to help them formally adopt the child.at one stage , she and the husband of the surrogate mother were left holding the baby at the high court while a judge ruled the lesbians could become its legal guardians . ` to hold your husband 's child , that is n't yours , in your arms , felt like a kick , ' said the 45-year-old . ` it is not something you can ever recover from . ` i knew my husband was a sperm donor and supported him in this but when i knew a child had been conceived my heart broke . it is like your husband having an affair . no one ever thinks of the wives . 's he said partners of sperm donors should receive consultation and counselling and criticised the determination of the middle-aged lesbian couple to have a baby.she added : ` one thing i have learnt about couples who want to have children at any cost is that they are ultimately selfish and the only thing they think about is their need for a child . ' ` i 'm not speaking on behalf of the gay community . ` in . fact , i do n't feel like i 'm part of any  community  . the only community . i belong to is humanity and we 've got too many children on the planet , . so it 's good not to have more . ' in the same interview , mrs everett said she wished her son -- who came out in 1989 -- was not homosexual . in the past i have said that i wish . rupert was straight and i probably still feel that , ' she said . ` i 'd like . him to have children . he 's so good with children . ` he 'd make a wonderful father . but i also think a child needs a mummy and a daddy . ` i 've told him that and he takes it very well . ' she added : ` from what i 'm told , rupert . can be a little outspoken , but i do n't think he tries to upset anyone . on purpose . he just says what 's on his mind and does n't suffer fools . gladly . ' in 2009 , everett advised young gay . actors not to come out because it would damage their careers . ` it just . does n't work and you 're going to hit a brick wall at some point , ' he . warned . shortlisted for dad of the year : sir elton john and david furnish , pictured with son zachary , have not yet responded to everett 's remarks . ` you 're going to manage to make it . roll for a certain amount of time , but at the first sign of failure , . they 'll cut you right off . ` the fact of the matter is , and i do n't care who disagrees , it does n't work if you 're gay .
