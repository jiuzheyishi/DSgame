{"text": "over-running engineering work , signal failures and packed trains have been heaping misery on rail passengers today as they returned to work after the christmas break . a train at crewe , cheshire , was so full some passengers were ordered off before it could continue . at some other stations trains were so packed that passengers could not board , with some lucky enough to have got on earlier forced to sit in the aisles . misery : passengers were left looking at information boards in hope at london paddington today . the late-running engineering work meant that the heathrow express was not able to run until late morning , and when it did start there were delays to the service . the heathrow express issue was due to a power supply problem at maidenhead in berkshire which meant delays to the finish of engineering work and no services - to start with - between paddington station in london and reading in berkshire . there were a number of other problems as well . a late finish to platform work at balham in south east london also caused delays to london-bound commuters this morning . in the midlands , a freight train derailment at barrow-upon-soar meant trains were unable to call at that station , with buses replacing trains between loughborough and barrow-upon-soar . the derailment also led to delays to services between east midlands parkway , leicester and peterborough . in scotland a broken-down train at neilston meant no trains were able to run between neilston and glasgow central , while arriva trains wales reported delays between neath and swansea due to signalling problems . london midland services in the birmingham area were also delayed today , with the company saying there were limited platforms available at birmingham new street after engineering work . later , a signalling problem near milton keynes central in buckinghamshire led to delays to london midland and virgin trains ' services between london and milton keynes . london midland passengers also had to put up with a broken-down train at coventry which led to a suspension of services between coventry and nuneaton . there were also delays to services between hereford and worcester due to late-running engineering work . welcome back : overcrowded greeted commuters returning to work today -lrb- library image -rrb- . more late-running engineering work at haymarket in edinburgh led to delays of up to 40 minutes . elsewhere in scotland , buses replaced trains between aberdeen and inverurie after someone was hit by a train . planned engineering work that was due to carry on was affecting services on a number of routes , while the effects of the flooding were still being felt in some areas - particularly the west country . fgw advised passengers not to travel to and from devon and cornwall . routes still closed included liskeard to looe in cornwall and exeter st davids to barnstaple in devon . the line between exeter st davids and tiverton parkway was also shut and there was only a very limited service running between newton abbot and exeter st davids . in early afternoon , the southeastern train company said that due to the over-running of engineering work in the medway area of kent that had been expected to finish at 4am tomorrow , it would be running a similar amended timetable tomorrow , as it had today . hold-up : the entrance to the platforms at paddington was unusually quite because of the delays . nr said there had been problems with bridge work being carried out at rochester . before the floods and the late-running engineering work , nr said about half the number of bus replacement services would be needed this year compared with the 2011/12 festive season . in recent years , nr 's festive season engineering work , and other bank holiday projects , have generally finished on time . however , there was severe disruption when work was not completed in time for the big return to work in january 2008 . this led to nr being fined a record # 14 million by the office of rail regulation . the most damaging overrun in the 2007/08 festive season was on the west coast main line - a route where major work is being carried out during this festive period .", "summary": " one train was so full passengers were ordered off before it could continue .   heathrow express was not running earlier because of over-running works .   power problems also hold up services between reading and london .   train derailment in the midlands meant services were replaced by buses .   works also lead to platform problems at birmingham new street station .   a broken-down train brought hold-ups for passengers in scotland .   railways in wales suffer delays because of signalling faults .
