{"text": "scientists at columbia university found children exposed to high levels of air pollution during pregnancy are five times more likely to have adhd . children exposed to high levels of pollution in the womb are at greater risk of suffering attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , a new study has found . scientists at columbia university studied 233 non-smoking pregnant women living in new york . they found children exposed to high levels of air pollution during pregnancy were five times more likely to have adhd by the time they were nine years old . the nine-year study looked at levels of common pollutants polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons -lrb- pah -rrb- . researchers measured the levels of pah in maternal and umbilical cord blood shortly after delivery . and they repeated tests when each of the children were three and five , measuring levels of pah in their urine . thirty-three children who had high levels of exposure to pahs , as measured at birth . of those , 13 were diagnosed with adhd hyperactive-impulsive subtype , seven the inattentive subtype , and 13 had both . professor frederica perera , first author of the study , said : ` those children born to moms who were exposed to high levels of pah during pregnancy had five times the odds of having an increased number of symptoms . ' pahs are created when products like coal , oil , gas and rubbish are burned but not completely . they do n't burn easily , and as a result remain in the environment for long periods of time . most are used to conduct research though some are used to make dyes , plastics and pesticides . one of the most common ways they enter the body is through breathing in contaminated air . to establish children 's exposure to pahs in the womb , the scientists measured levels of fragments of the mothers ' dna bonded to pah molecules , also known as dna adducts , in umbilical cord blood . previous studies carried out by professor perera and her team identified links between higher levels of prenatal pah exposure and developmental delays in children by the age of three . they also noted lower iq scores at five , and increased risk a child will suffer anxiety , depression and attention problems at six and seven . the new study , published in the journal plos one , looked at the children 's adhd symptoms using the child behavior checklist and the conners ' parent rating scale - two screening tests used to diagnose the condition . they studied 233 non-smoking pregnant women living in new york , measuring levels of a common pollutant in umbilical cord blood and then levels in the children 's urine at ages three and five . professor perera said this is the first time a link has been established between prenatal pah exposure and adhd symptoms . she told livescience : ` if replicated , then these findings could lead to new ways or stronger ways , better ways , to prevent adhd . ` by nature , environmental exposures are preventable , this we consider one possible contributor to adhd and one that 's preventable , and the findings should be followed up so that necessary preventive strategies could be taken . ' she said pregnant women concerned about the effect of pollution levels on their unborn babies , can eat plenty of fresh produce which helps offset the effects of pollutants .", "summary": " scientists at columbia university found children exposed to high levels of pollution were five times more likely to have adhd by the age of nine .   nine-year study looked at levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons -lrb- pah -rrb- .   they measured levels of pah in umbilical cord blood , then in children 's urine at the ages of three and five .
