{"text": "he had grand plans on how to rebuild his broken land , but haitian president michel martelly ca n't even get over the first hurdle : forming a government . haiti 's parliament rejected tuesday the new president 's pick for prime minister , daniel rouzier , sending martelly back to the drawing board . meanwhile , it has been more than six months since haitians first went to the polls to vote for new leadership after last year 's devastating earthquake . martelly , a former pop star , nominated rouzier , an entrepreneur who also helped lead a christian charity in haiti , on may 20 . many haitians had expressed hope the pair would be a jolt of fresh energy . after days of hearings and required documentation , 42 members of the assembly of deputies voted against rouzier 's nomination , while 19 deputies voted for him and three abstained , the agence haitienne de presse news agency reported . those who opposed rouzier questioned his allegiances for his appointment as honorary consul for jamaica and alleged that the millionaire businessman -- his family owns a car business in port-au-prince -- had failed to pay proper taxes . the latter charge made longtime observers of haiti laugh aloud . who in haiti has ever been honest about that , asked jocelyn mccalla , a haitian-born political strategist and human rights expert . the real problem , he said , seems to be more of a political stalemate between martelly , who appealed to the masses for his political novice , and veteran politicians who are perhaps resentful of that .  the legislature is flexing its muscle in anticipation of the battles to come with martelly ,  mccalla said . and that , said mccalla , does not bode well for an impoverished nation struggling to recover from the enormous setback it suffered last year . haiti was the most worsened nation on this year 's index of failed states released this week by the fund for peace in washington .  the process of rebuilding haiti is essentially stalled ,  mccalla said . that process has already been painfully slow for the haitian people . tens of thousands of haitians continue to live in makeshift camps ; rubble still soars high on some streets -- schools , hospitals , roads , houses have yet to be rebuilt . frustration with a lack of progress contributed to defeat for former president rene preval 's party . at first , preval 's protege , jude celestin , was named the no. 2 vote getter in the november election . but after charges of widespread fraud and weeks of review , martelly won that spot and a right to face former first lady mirlande manigat in a march runoff . by then , haitians were anxious to get a new government installed and get on with the task of piecing their nation back together . garry pierre-pierre , editor and publisher of the new york-based newspaper the haitian times , said preval stocked parliament with his own people . and they are likely to challenge martelly on every move at the expense of haiti , he said .  how do you govern in that situation ?  pierre-pierre asked .  there 's so many compromises you can make . i 'm not sure this parliament is going to be cooperative at all .  the u.n. mission in haiti issued a statement wednesday urging haiti to pick a new prime minister quickly . every day that passes , it said , is to the detriment of the people .  there is no doubt that all haitians are united in their desire to see future major projects -- including those related to improving their living conditions -- moving as quickly as possible ,  the statement said .", "summary": " new president michel martelly nominates daniel rouzier as prime minister .   but haiti 's parliament rejects rouzier 's nomination .   observers say parliament 's move does not bode well for haiti .   some say martelly will face many more challenges from politicians .
