{"text": "the smallest boat moored at the hemingway marina in havana may hold the most intrigue . hunkered down inside a blue , 25-foot sailboat named salty are josh hakken and his wife , sharyn , and their two boys , 2-year-old chase and 4-year-old cole . theirs is no ordinary visit to the historic port , where they have eluded capture but where cnn found them tuesday . the hakkens have been on the lam after they allegedly snatched the two boys from their grandmother 's home in florida . the couple lost custody of their children last year . there is an international manhunt for this family , and here they are , blending in among the other boats . but their stop appears likely to be temporary , as cuban officials announced tuesday afternoon that they plan to turn the family over to u.s. authorities . josh hakken glared through his sunglasses at the cnn reporter who found him and said nothing beyond confirming his identity . the two boys are ok , said a woman matching the description of his wife , and she left it at that . josh and sharyn hakken are wanted by u.s. authorities and were not in custody in cuba . but that does n't mean they are n't being watched . cuban security officials wearing sidearms appeared as the cnn video crew was filming and ordered them to stop . at the security guards ' request , cnn stepped away from the boat , which looked just like the photo that florida law enforcement officials had circulated , except more battered . a statement from the cuban foreign ministry said the boat put in to the marina , located a few miles west of havana , in bad weather on sunday .  from the first moment , diplomatic notes were exchanged and a permanent and professional communication has been maintained between minrex  -- cuba 's foreign ministry --  and the u.s. interests section in havana , with the goal of guaranteeing the integrity and well-being of the minors ,  the statement said . joshua hakken : libertarian washed ashore in the worker 's paradise . u.s. government officials have told the sheriff 's office in hillsborough county , florida -- which includes the city of tampa from which the boys went missing -- that  they are receiving exceptional cooperation from the cuban government ,  the sheriff 's office said tuesday afternoon . earlier in the day , u.s. state department spokesman patrick ventrell said the state department is aware of the case , though it could not provide additional information because of privacy concerns .  but what i do want to say , more broadly speaking , is that one of the department 's highest priorities is the welfare of u.s. citizens overseas , and this is particularly true for children who are our most vulnerable citizens ,  ventrell said . some worried that recovering the children will be difficult .  unfortunately , these parents and these poor children , these innocent ones , will now be in a country where there are no laws , there is no redress , and that has been a refuge for fugitives and wanted criminals for many years ,  rep. ileana ros-lehtinen , r - florida , told cnn . the boys had been removed from the care of the florida couple last year , and on april 2 , the couple 's parental rights were terminated in louisiana , investigators say . the hillsborough county sheriff 's office described josh hakken as an anti-government protester , and he was believed to be armed , according to the hillsborough county sheriff 's office . there is no extradition treaty between cuba and the united states , although there have been recent cases in which americans sought for crimes in the united states and discovered in havana have been sent back by the cubans . the fbi currently estimates there are around 70 fugitives from u.s. justice in cuba , which is one of the reasons cuba remains on the u.s. list of countries that support state terrorism . most of the american fugitives in cuba have been there for decades and have ties to revolutionary movements or radical groups . last week , the police department in slidell , louisiana , issued its own statement offering background on the hakkens and why the boys were taken from the parents last year . in june of 2012 , slidell police responded to a disturbance report at a hotel where josh and sharyn hakken were staying with their sons , the police statement said .  when police arrived , both mr. and mrs. hakken were acting in a bizarre manner that alarmed officers . they were talking about ` completing their ultimate journey ' and were traveling across the country to ` take a journey to the armageddon ' ,  the slidell police statement said , adding ,  let it be noted that both of their children were present in the hotel room at the time .  because of the parents ' behavior and  the fact that narcotics and weapons were located inside of the hotel room ,  the children were taken by child welfare officers , and joshua hakken was arrested on drug charges , the statement said .  approximately two weeks later , slidell police were notified that mr. hakken had shown up to the foster family home ... with a firearm demanding the return of his children ,  the slidell police statement continued .  the foster parents called 911 , and mr. hakken fled without his children . we have heard nothing until -lrb- wednesday -rrb- .  at some point over the past few months , the children were sent to live with their grandmother , patricia hauser , the mother of sharyn hakken . sheriff 's investigators say josh hakken entered hauser 's home at 6:30 a.m. last wednesday . she told police that he tied her up and fled with the children in her silver 2009 toyota camry . that vehicle was found later that day just a couple of blocks away from the home . those investigators told cnn they believe hakken joined up with his wife , who was waiting in their pickup truck , and the family drove to a parking garage . a short time later , investigators said , hakken is believed to have taken a sailboat out of a private slip in nearby madeira beach . surveillance images showed the boat sailing into the gulf of mexico about three and a half hours after the boys disappeared from their grandmother 's home , investigators said , adding that the photos showed adults and children on board .", "summary": " first on cnn : a man on a boat in havana tells cnn he is josh hakken .   cuba says it will turn the hakkens back over to the united states .   authorities believe hakken abducted his two small sons last week .   the boys were taken from their parents by child welfare officials in louisiana last year .
