{"text": "war and toys : two words rarely associated with one another . but veteran photographer brian mccarty is bringing the two together in photography and a documentary film to explore what children in the war zone endure every day . with simple toys and drawings , the war-toys project explores the daily struggles of palestinian and israeli children through their own eyes , with the help of local humanitarian organizations . mccarty , who has used toys in art projects in the past , takes the drawings from children 's art therapy and recreates some of those scenes with toys and photographs them . cnn 's asieh namdar talked to mccarty about how art therapy is helping kids open up about war , living with fear and day-to-day reality for them . cnn : how did this idea of  war-toys  get started ? mccarty : it started 14 years ago at an exhibit in zagreb , after the croatian war of independence . i chose to do a study of war toys as cultural artifacts , and as a tool for getting perspective on war . but it was in the abstract form ; it was n't tied into cultural or personal experiences . over the years i started to see the potential of toys for healing and communication . so war-toys in a nutshell allows children to articulate their experiences of war , occupation , terrorism through a collaborative process . it 's all based on art therapy and play therapy . i essentially go and interview kids , working with established therapists . you ask them to draw a picture or write a letter , and somehow they express what they 've seen , what they feel , what they 've heard . and from those drawings , i then go and buy local toys , and recreate at the actual locations , what they 've described . -lrb- cnn photos : see images from the war-toys project -rrb- . cnn : what drew you to kids in the israeli-palestinian conflict ? mccarty : i chose the israeli-palestinian conflict because the region has been in conflict since the dawn of humanity . it is a reflection of the flaws of human nature -- a place where there is a very definite two sides . it 's a place ruled by passions and faith . so far i 've only been to the west bank and israel . i 've worked mostly with the palestinians . going forward , i want to work with the israelis . it 's really important to me that the project is completely neutral . i want to show all sides of the conflict , and show the cost of the conflict from the kids , who are just stuck in the middle of this whole mess . cnn : how does art and play therapy work ? mccarty : art therapy is a way to really have a child be in control and express his or her feelings and emotions from a very safe place . i 've been working with some amazing art therapists . art therapy bridges so many gaps . children are smart . they know what 's going on , they know what 's happening -- they have emotions attached to it all . but their language abilities may not be there , so they can never sit there and tell you ,  this is what happened to me , this is what i feel about it .  so as a result , their accounts of war are n't seen or are n't valued . what they draw brings their experience to life , and i try to capture that . same can be said for play therapy -- it 's even harder to quantify . it 's children in a room playing with toys , and a trained therapist watching how they play with toys , asking questions and getting them to explain what happened . it 's really the only recognized way to deal with children in ptsd -lrb- post-traumatic stress disorder -rrb- situations , war and that sort of thing . we 'll pick the drawings we can capture in a photograph . cnn : what is your role during therapy sessions ? mccarty : in the therapeutic setting , my role is observer . i rely on humanitarian organizations with ongoing art therapy and play therapy programs . it 's not wise for me to work with the kids directly . in that moment , it would be irresponsible for me to get involved in that way . my biggest fear is to be exploitative , or cause any more harm than these kids have already gone through . it 's a real danger , and i 'm kind of walking a fine line . cnn : what 's been the kids ' reaction so far ? mccarty : children in the therapeutic process in the art process are generally excited , because they 're drawing -- it 's fun . they rush to grab the pastels and the pieces of paper , and they carve out little spots on the floor , and it 's adorable . but the drawing can also be disturbing . i watched a little girl coloring in pools of blood . it was hard , it took a lot out of me . after i 'd done some of the photographs , i brought them back to the kids and showed them the drawings they had done next to the photographs that i did , and their reaction was wonderful . the kids loved them , they went crazy for them :  this is exactly what we 're feeling , this is wonderful .  the art , for as painful as it was for me to watch , -lrb- the kids -rrb- were expressing themselves , and able to do so freely . i absolutely saw a release when they were doing the art . one asked ...  why toys ?  he was offended -- he asked me why i was shooting toys , and not the reality on the ground ? that gave me the chance to conceptually defend the project to a child . and it was a challenge . i was not expecting it . i was able to say this is my method of communication , this is how i get context and boil down what 's happening -- a new way of thinking and seeing . it takes quite a long time for the therapeutic process to really have an effect . but to have someone interested in their perspective , to have someone listening to them and someone who wanted to see what they were drawing , that alone kind of validates humans and makes it better . cnn : what is the most memorable experience so far ? mccarty : the most overwhelming experience was just shooting video at the barrier wall just inside of the west bank at the kalandia checkpoint . the day that i picked happened to be a day that there was a giant protest . i 'll never forget a child who drew an account of a shooting by the wall : a little boy being shot in the head . when the boy drew it , you could tell he was really emotional , and he went so far as to cross out the drawing after making it , so i really wanted to do it right . so i went to the wall and set up some toy soldiers , set up a little boy , put down fake blood . right about then , the protesters showed up en masse , marched on the checkpoint . it was chaos , screaming , running , tear gas . what 's remarkable to me looking back , my own reaction . i did n't acknowledge them , just focused on my own shoot . the project is n't about my experiences of war , it 's about the kids , it 's about articulating what they felt and what they 've seen ; so my experiences are secondary . cnn : where do you want to see yourself in a few years from now ? mccarty : it 's hard to say exactly where i 'll end up . it depends on funding , of course , but i 've thought about somalia , thought about afghanistan , i 've thought about iraq , i 've thought about mexico and the drug wars . really wherever these things are happening and i think that children 's perspectives are either underserved or unseen . that 's the motivation for it . my goal for war toys is to use locally bought toys , to really go to the markets and the places where the children who live there buy their toys , or in some cases , make their toys . but the idea has been to use the toys to reflect socioeconomic conditions . if it 's a poor neighborhood you 'll have cheaper toys . those differences to me just add another layer of commentary to the project . cnn : and finally , you 've had success with your photography using toys as subject matter . why toys ? mccarty : i am definitely still a kid at heart . my house looks like a rich fourth grader lives there . i 'm still a kid . i think through toys . it 's how i view the world , it 's how i interact with the world , it 's how i make sense of the world .", "summary": " photographer brian mccarty has used toys in his art projects for years .   his latest work is combined with a children 's therapy effort .   his photographs aim to show the conflict from the kids ' perspectives .
