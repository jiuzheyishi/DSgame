{"text": "boise , idaho  first , please let me apologize to my family , friends , staff and fellow idahoans for the cloud placed over idaho . i did nothing wrong at the minneapolis airport . i regret my decision to plead guilty and the sadness that decision has brought to my wife , family , friends , staff , and fellow idahoans . for that i apologize .  in june , i overreacted and made a poor decision . while i was not involved in any inappropriate conduct at the minneapolis airport or anywhere else , i chose to plead guilty to a lesser charge in the hope of making it go away . i did not seek any counsel , either from an attorney , staff , friends , or family . that was a mistake , and i deeply regret it . because of that , i have now retained counsel and i am asking my counsel to review this matter and to advise me on how to proceed .  for a moment , i want to put my state of mind into context on june 11 . for eight months leading up to june , my family and i had been relentlessly and viciously harassed by the idaho statesman . if you 've seen today 's paper , you know why . let me be clear : i am not gay and never have been .  still , without a shred of truth or evidence to the contrary , the statesman has engaged in this witch hunt . in pleading guilty , i overreacted in minneapolis , because of the stress of the idaho statesman 's investigation and the rumors it has fueled around idaho . again , that overreaction was a mistake , and i apologize for my misjudgment . furthermore , i should not have kept this arrest to myself , and should have told my family and friends about it . i was n't eager to share this failure , but i should have done so anyway .  i love my wife , family , friends , staff and idaho . i love serving idaho in congress . over the years , i have accomplished a lot for idaho , and i hope idahoans will allow me to continue to do that . there are still goals i would like to accomplish , and i believe i can still be an effective leader for idaho . next month , i will announce , as planned , whether or not i will seek re-election .  as an elected official , i fully realize that my life is open for public criticism and scrutiny , and i take full responsibility for the mistake in judgment i made in attempting to handle this matter myself .  it is clear , though , that through my actions i have brought a cloud over idaho . for that , i ask the people of idaho for their forgiveness .  as i mentioned earlier , i have now retained counsel to examine this matter and i will make no further comment .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": " idaho senator apologizes to state , family , friends .   senator says he did no wrong , but pleaded guilty without seeking counsel .   senator says he has retained a lawyer to examine the matter .
