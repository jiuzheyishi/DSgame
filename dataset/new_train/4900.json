{"text": "yvonne hampton is 69 years old , and lives clear across the country from her older brother , bill . but she can still rely on him to look out for her -- just as he did when she was growing up .  the way our parents raised us , we stood up for ourselves , and my brother always protected me ,  hampton said . even though bill stuck up for his little sister as they came of age in poughkeepsie , new york , he could n't always protect himself , or her , from the cruel words of playmates who viewed their dark skin as offensive .  we were made fun of , called ` little black sambo ' -- that was our introduction to kindergarten ,  she said .  you were made to feel ` less than ' because your skin was darker , and -lrb- that -rrb- being dark brown or black was ugly .  hampton 's experiences as a  dark girl  were an inspiration for bill duke 's documentary that explores the sometimes painful , undercover story of colorism -- discrimination based on skin tone -- inside and outside the black community . now a respected actor and filmmaker , duke used his industry clout to bring attention to the issue . duke , along with d. channsin berry , co-directed and co-produced  dark girls ,  which will be released on dvd september 24 . when it premiered on the own channel earlier this year , the film stirred spirited conversation about black beauty , just as it did at screenings around north america .  dark girls is a phenomenal documentary that opens the door on that light skinned/dark skinned thang ,  oprah tweeted in june . after the trailer hit the web in 2011 , the filmmakers soon learned that the issue did not only resonate among darker-hued american women .  i started getting e-mails from women in poland , and i was thinking to myself , i do n't know any black women in warsaw , or poland or other places around there ,  berry said .  and i kept getting -lrb- correspondence -rrb- from women 's groups in the netherlands asking us to talk about this , and screen the movie . and it was deep .  in this edited conversation , co-directors bill duke and d. channsin berry shared with cnn what they learned making the film and how the conversation began . cnn : how did two male directors become interested in making a film about  dark girls  ? duke : i saw the things that my sister went through -- she 's dark skinned -- with boys not considering her attractive in her youth and the pain that it caused her . you have to explain to people the damage that it does to a young woman , and to see it and experience it is something that you do n't forget : her crying in her room alone , her trying to lighten her skin , her feeling ugly , me having to beat up young boys because they said she was ugly , that type of thing . cnn : how do you define  dark girls  ? the documentary begins by looking at the issues of intracultural colorism within the black american community , but also touches on issues of color in india and around the world . berry : it changed , it really changed through my research . it was about sisters who were dark in complexion . but the more i started to do interviews around the country and around the world -- and this is the crazy thing i found out , it was so enlightening -- that all women around the world are  dark girls  at some point in time in their lives . it has nothing to do so much with the complexion of one 's skin . it has everything to do with the lack of women 's self-esteem . that 's what i learned . and i also learned that pain is pain : if you 're dark , you 've got some pain , if you 're light in complexion , you 've got some pain . cnn : was there a particularly emotional or difficult time for you , personally , in your process of filmmaking ? how did it impact you ? duke : i think the footage that came in with the children . the little girl , when she 's asked ` what 's beautiful ? ' points to everything that is opposite of -lrb- what -rrb- she is . that one got to me because she 's already saying that she is ugly and she 's 6 or 7 years old . at that age , you 're seeing -lrb- this -rrb- instilled in their consciousness , and what it does to their spirit and what it does to their self-esteem . it 's a very difficult thing to digest . and that 's what motivates me to do something . because our children are at stake . cnn : you did the film in 2011 and screened it in major american cities before it was picked up by own and aired earlier this year . what was the reaction from audiences ? was there any resistance to a topic that is rarely discussed across racial lines ? duke : are you kidding me ?! of course . i was at a theater , and an elderly lady -- beautiful woman -- stands up and says : ` mr. duke , i really appreciate your film , but why are you airing our dirty laundry ? ' and i said to her : ` because it 's stinking up the house . ' the things that kill us as a -lrb- black -rrb- community is our silence . cnn : how has the conversation around this issue changed from when you began the project in 2011 to now in 2013 ? berry : the conversation is now open , and that 's all we can do . i 'm not a psychiatrist or psychologist or a sociologist . i 'm a filmmaker who decided to point a lens -lrb- on this topic -rrb- . i do n't have all the answers . i 'm just supposed to present what i think is an issue and have dialogue start . and that was good enough . that was good enough that people recognize that there is an issue . the best thing to do is start conversation about it , so the healing can begin .", "summary": "  dark girls  looks at colorism in the black community and beyond .   the documentary was co-directed by filmmakers bill duke and d. channsin berry .   duke and berry say the film was inspired by personal experiences .   berry said he learned  pain is pain  and  all women  can be dark girls .
