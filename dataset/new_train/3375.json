{"text": "these pictures show the hidden life on your phone -- the bacteria that lurk on your mobile . long after we 've swiped and tapped our smart phones , or sent and received texts , our devices retain a biological history of our actions . students studying bacteriology at the university of surrey imprinted their mobile phones on to petri dishes to see what they might carry . yuck : students from the university of surrey . imprinted their phones on petri dishes to culture any bacteria on them . here the whole plate is covered by the spreading growth of a bacterium . called bacillus mycoides . although the results after just three days looked pretty grim , thankfully most of the bacteria were harmless - nevertheless , it just shows the invisible life that can lurk on your phones . some disease-carrying bacteria were occasionally found , such as staphylococcus aureus - a common cause of staph infections including food poisoning , impetigo and even septicaemia . it is thought that 20 per cent of people are long-term carriers of the bug , which often lurks inside the nasal passages . the colonies of bacteria that form after the phone has been imprinted are from the body 's invisible bacterial flora . mostly harmless : but some disease carrying bacteria were . occasionally found , such as staphylococcus aureus - a common cause of staph . infections including food poisoning , impetigo and even septicaemia . the invisible life on your phone : the colonies . of bacteria that form after the phone has been imprinted are from the . body 's invisible bacterial flora ; they are a tangible and biological . residue of our hellos and goodbyes . now that the messages have been electronically received or delivered , they represent a tangible and biological residue of our manifold hellos and goodbyes . bacteria can utilise many different things as vectors in order to promote their transmission . insects , water , food , coughs and sneezes , sexual contact , and rain are just a few examples . the mobile phone appears to be no exception this rule . unusual but effective way of engaging students : surrey university lecturer dr simon park got undergraduate students in his practical and biomedical bacteriology class to imprint their mobiles in the growth medium . dr park said : ` it seems that the mobile phone doesn Â¿ t just remember telephone numbers , but also harbours a history of our personal and physical contacts such as other people , soil and other matter ' dr simon park , senior lecturer in molecular biology , said : ` as part of a course called practical and biomedical bacteriology , an undergraduate module that i run , i get the students to imprint their mobile phones on to bacteriological growth petri dishes so that we might determine what they might carry . ` it 's unusual but a very effective way of engaging our students with the often overlooked microbiology of everyday life . ` the ecological niche on the body for staphylococcus aureus is the nostrils , so a furtive pick of the nose , and quick text after , and you end up with this pathogen on your smartphone . ` you can clearly see the outline of the phone on this , but the whole plate is covered by the spreading growth of a bacterium called bacillus mycoides . ` this pattern of growth is unique to this bacterium and because soil is its natural habitat , we know that this phone or its user had recently been in contact with soil . each phone tells a story . ` from these results , it seems that the mobile phone does n't just remember telephone numbers , but also harbours a history of our personal and physical contacts such as other people , soil and other matter . '", "summary": " surrey university students imprinted their phones into petri dishes .   results showed the devices retain a biological history of our actions .   most bacteria were harmless , though some could cause blood poisoning .
