' i have to take him where he wants to go . he ca n't go anywhere by himself . ' she fears her son will never work again after the devastating assault . ` his right hand ca n't work at the moment but he 's practising with the xbox controller , ' said mrs etheridge , of yarmouth . ` he ca n't use a knife and fork or a pen . ` we 've only just been able to get him to go out , up town . he would freak out . ` he was always out with his mates before - he liked pool and nights out . ' she said michael 's memory is now so poor he could not recognise his two-year-old niece when she visited him . ` michael is a different lad completely . the way he talks is different , his laugh is different , ' she added . happier times : michael , at the back , pictured with his mother , linda , stepfather andy and his younger brother . ` he was convinced he was batman and could jump off buildings but luckily that 's passed , ' said mrs etheridge . ` as he 's got better we 've had to explain things to him . when we explained how his injuries had affected him he was apologetic . ' ` he remembers places he used to go and places he used to work . he used to work at a hotel in essex and he remembers it like yesterday . but he could n't tell you what he did yesterday . ' mr evans was out with friends in the town centre when his group was involved in a bust-up with brzozowski and his friends . michael was walking away with his hands in his pockets when he was hit in the head by the amateur boxer . brzozowski after he was arrested . recorder mark dennis told the thug as he jailed him : ` it was yobbish , violent behaviour ' brzozowski , who moved here from poland eight years ago , went home after the vicious attack , calmly got changed and was going out to a nightclub when he was arrested after police tracked him on cctv . mr evans ' stepfather , andy , 60 , said the last seven months since the late-night attack last november have been ` hell ' . he said : ` nobody could tell us if michael was going to live or die . it was constant stress . ' michael is due to have a special titanium plate fitted in his skull on june 27 , but his parents are taking events day by day . ` hopefully there will be a bit more improvement then , but really they ca n't tell us , ' said mr etheridge . ` it 's all in the lap of the gods . ' ` michael 's still struggling to walk , as he has a fused hip , and had learned a special way of coping with it before the attack . ' ` he 's a 28-year-old 12-year-old at the moment . ` he has no memory of the incident and he has no idea of what this guy looks like or anything . ` it 's been hell , ' said mr etheridge . ` if we were n't so strong it could have easily divided us . ' mr etheridge attended yesterday 's court hearing and has watched cctv footage of his son being attacked . he said of brzozowski 's three-year jail term : ` it 's what i expected . ` he was charged with it being gbh without intent as it was one punch . i do n't think it 's right , but i suppose that 's the law . ' chris youell , prosecuting , said mr evans nearly died from the unprovoked attack , had to have an emergency operation and spent three months in hospital . recorder mark dennis told the thug as he jailed him : ` it was yobbish , violent behaviour , late at night , when in drink . ` it was a life-changing event for the victim , who will never be the same person again . ` you know how to punch and how to hurt someone , and you know the consequences of a heavy punch . ' mr burrows said after the case : ` this is a very sensitive case with devastating effects all round . ` no-one ever minimises the level of injury or wider impact it has on the victim 's family members . ` this single punch in drink will haunt daniel for many years , if not the rest of his life . ' ross burrows , defending , said brzozowski ` misjudged the situation and felt threatened ' . ` he threw the punch because he was trying to protect his group . his intention was to punch and run . ` it will stay with him for the rest of his life . he has not been out since and does not drink . it was a moment of madness . ' inspector nick cheshire , of norfolk police , said last night : ` this was an unprovoked attack which left an innocent man with serious head injuries , having been enjoying a night out with friends in yarmouth . ` brzozowski was arrested a short time later and was still drunk whilst in custody . ` the majority of people drink responsibly . but the minority who do drink to excess and behave violently or anti-socially cause a disproportionate amount of trouble and distress to the local community .
