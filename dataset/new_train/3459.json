{"text": "it is the perfect excuse to raise a glass to a long and active life . scientists from the ecole polytechnique fédérale de lausanne in france have shown that resveratrol , the ` miracle ingredient ' in red wine , extends lifespan and provides an infusion of energy . in this case , worms were the beneficiaries but it is thought that a similar technique could help people live longer . a ` miracle ingredient ' found in red wine , called reservatrol , has been found to increase the lifespan of worms by up to 60 % . reservatrol is found in plants such as the japanese knotweed . the findings , from scientists at the ecole polytechnique fédérale de lausanne , were published in the nature journal . they think similar results could be seen in humans . resveratrol is a natural phenol produced naturally by several plants , especially the roots of the japanese knotweed . it is extracted from these plants for commercial reasons and is produced when the plant is under attack by pathogens such as bacteria or fungi . the effects of resveratrol have been studied in various studies . in mouse and rat experiments it was shown to have anticancer , anti-inflammatory , blood sugar-lowering and other beneficial cardiovascular effects . in humans studies , resveratrol is shown to be less effective . although , in one positive human trial , extremely high doses -lrb- 3 -- 5 g -rrb- of resveratrol were found to significantly lower blood sugar levels . and with treated worms more energetic , it might be that we can also look forward to sprightly old age . researcher professor johan auwerx said : ` you do n't want to live longer and just sit in front of the television . we want to have active lives . ' the swiss researchers began by searching for genes involved in the ageing process . by studying mice that live for different lengths of time , they hit upon three genes whose activity was key to lifespan . when the genes only worked at half-power , the animals eight months longer , the journal nature reports . professor auwerx then showed that the genes also regulate longevity in worms . there the results were even more astonishing -- tinkering with the worms ' genes increasing lifespan by up to 80 per cent . the genes make a protein that , when pumped out in high quantities , cuts lifespan . with this in mind , professor auwerx turned to two widely used antibiotics that block the production of such proteins . in the study from the ecole polytechnique fédérale de lausanne , scientists tested the effect reservatrol had on the lifespan of worms . it was found to increase the lives of the worms tested by 60 % . the worms were also more active , had greater endurance and healthier muscles . given to worms , they increased lifespan by an average of 60 % . importantly , the worms were also more active , had greater endurance and healthier muscles . this allowed them to continue to wriggle fiercely when untreated worms had become weary . at 13-days-old , the onset of adulthood , they moved twice as much as others . and a week later , when the untreated worms were beginning to show their age , the difference was even more pronounced . a final set of experiments showed that resveratrol , the ` miracle ingredient ' in red wine uses the same mechanism to extend life . however , the effect was n't as dramatic . professor auwerx , of the ecole polytechnique fédérale de lausanne , said : ` this research gives us hope not only for increasing longevity , but also for lengthening the period of adult vitality , and doing this with simple drugs as antibiotics . ' while neither long-term antibiotic . use or heavy drinking advisable , the key will be to find a safe drug . that is just as effective . the professor said that it may be that such a pill would only need to be taken during a key period of life , such as puberty . should it ever hit the market , he believes ` everyone will be tempted to take it ' . reservatrol could help older people live more energetic lives , like the stars of itv show off their rockers -lrb- pictured -rrb- . this is based on the findings of a french study that treated worms with reservatrol . not only did the worms live longer when treated with reservatrol , they were also more energetic . scientists from the ecole polytechnique fédérale de lausanne believe that a similar technique could have the same effect on humans , giving elderly people more energy and zest for life . other potential ` fountains of youth ' being researched around the world include a drug that made old mice young again . and a modern , and it is believed , safer , version of thalidomide has shown promise in boosting the odds of a healthy old age . some experts say the science is moving so quickly that it will soon be possible to prevent many of ills of old age . if lives were healthier as well as longer , people could work for longer -- or simply make the most of their retirement . increasing the number of years of healthy life would also greatly ease health service costs and reduce the burden on families of caring for sick relatives .", "summary": " french scientists discovered that reservatrol , an ingredient found in red wine , can increase lifespan by 60 % .   the experiments were carried out on worms but researchers think reservatrol could have a similar effect on humans .
