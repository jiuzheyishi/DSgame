{"text": "the founder of russian communism vladamir lenin died after being poisoned by his political successor joseph stalin , according to a sensational new theory . russian historian lev lurie , believes that while lenin was already in poor health having suffered several strokes , stalin may have finished him off after a bitter feud . lenin , who had initially supported stalin 's rise to power , later began aligning himself with leon trotsky . theory : russian historian lev lurie believes lenin , left , could have been poisoned by his political rival and successor joseph stalin , right . in notes dictated before his death , lenin criticises stalin 's rude manners and ambitious nature . he even suggested that stalin should be removed from his position of general secretary of the communist party . poisoning would later become stalin 's preferred method for dealing with his enemies , lurie points out . he added : ` the funny thing is that the brain of lenin still is preserved in moscow , so we can investigate . ' popular theory maintains that lenin died from the sexually-transmitted disease syphilis . stalin was reportedly furious after lenin aligned himself with trotsky -lrb- pictured -rrb- . his embalmed body still lies . on public display in a red square mausoleum almost 20 years after the . collapse of the communist state he helped bring to life . mr lurie and ucla neurologist dr. harry vinters reviewed lenin 's records for an annual conference at the . university of maryland school of medicine . on famous people 's deaths . dr vinters put forward a separate theory , maintaining that stress or a family medical history could have accounted for lenin 's death . prior to his death , the 53-year-old soviet leader 's health had been growing worse . over time . in 1921 , he forgot the words of a major speech and he had to . learn to speak again and write with his left hand after one stroke . a . subsequent major stroke later left him paralyzed on one side and unable to speak . an autopsy found blood vessels in his brain were extremely hardened , results that have been difficult to understand , said dr. philip mackowiak , who organizes the yearly event . ` number one , he 's so young and number two , he has none of the important risk factors , ' mackowiak said . lenin did n't smoke - he never let smokers near him . he also did n't have diabetes , was n't overweight and the autopsy did n't find any evidence of high blood pressure , mackowiak said . there was ` considerable suspicion ' among russians at the time of lenin 's death that syphilis was to blame , mackowiak said . however , family history appears to have worked more against lenin , vinters said . lenin 's embalmed body still lies on public display in a red square mausoleum almost 20 years after the collapse of the communist state he helped bring to life . lenin was treated for syphilis using the primitive medications available at the time , and while the sexually transmitted disease can cause strokes , there is no evidence from his symptoms or the autopsy that was the case with lenin , vinters said . the soviet leader 's father also died at 54 and both may have been predisposed to hardening of the arteries . stress also is a risk factor for strokes , and there 's no question the communist revolutionary was under plenty of that , the neurologist said . ` people were always trying to assassinate him , for example . ' dr vinters said . dr vinters , who reviewed autopsy records and the leader 's clinical history , said toxicology tests that might have revealed poisoning were not conducted during the autopsy . reports from the time also show lenin was active and talking a few hours before his death . ` and then he experienced a series of really , really bad convulsions which is quite unusual for someone who has a stroke , ' vinters said . the conference is held yearly at the . school , where researchers in the past have re-examined the diagnoses of . figures including king tut , christopher columbus , simon bolivar and . abraham lincoln .", "summary": " popular theory maintains lenin died from the sexually-transmitted disease syphilis .   historian believes stalin was furious after lenin sided with rival trotsky .
