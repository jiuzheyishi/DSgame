{"text": "support : david cameron signalled his backing for gm food after previously being sceptical about its use . david cameron has given the clearest signal yet that the government wants to see controversial genetically-modified crops grown across the country . the prime minister told a conference of entrepreneurs that britain needs to take a ` really good look again ' at its policy on gm food if it is to prove it is a ` pro-science ' country . the intervention from mr cameron that he wants to see a gm free-for-all across the uk will alarm those who deride genetic modification as ` frankenscience ' . it emerged earlier this week that ministers are to push the european union to relax restrictions on the cultivation of gm crops for human consumption . but it is the first time that the prime minister has spoken up in favour of the idea . in opposition he was seen as being sceptical of gm crops . advocates argue that gm techniques increase crop yields , avoid the need for pesticides , and could be essential in assuring britain 's future food security . however , any relaxation of current restrictions will be in the teeth of much opposition . a survey by yougov out today found only 21 per cent of the population supported the technology , while 35 per cent opposed it . mr cameron made the comments as he addressed an audience of scientists and business leaders in london at an innovation summit linked to the uk 's leadership of the g8 group of the world 's richest nations . he said : ` we need to make sure we are a very pro-science country . i think there are one or two subjects there we need to take on . i think it 's time we had a really good look again at gm food and all of that . ` i think we need to be open to be open to arguments from science . ' the government is reported to be ready to call for eu restrictions on cultivation of the crops for human consumption to be relaxed . the coalition has allowed small-scale cultivation trials for gm food but widespread use is effectively banned . some gm products are contained in imported foods , but most supermarkets have banned the ingredients from their own-brand products because of public unease about the material . the prime minister was addressing an audience of scientists and business leaders in london at an innovation summit linked to the uk 's leadership of the g8 group of the world 's richest nations . genetically improved ? minsters believe gm crops could ` make agriculture more efficient ' and help eradicate diseases such as dieback in the uk . earlier this week , science minister david willetts supported calls for controls on gm crops to be weakened to make it easier for britain 's farmers to grow them . ` we believe that gm crops can help make agriculture more efficient and also just as importantly more sustainable , by , for example , reducing the use of pesticides and the use of fossil fuels , ' he said . a european commission analysis of 130 research projects carried out by 500 groups over 25 years concluded in 2010 that there is ` no scientific evidence associating genetically-modified organisms with higher risks for the environment or food and feed safety than conventional plants or organisms ' . but opponents of gm crops argue that it is far too early to conclude that the technique is safe -- including many farmers , with a quarter of those surveyed saying they would not cultivate them under any circumstances . they are concerned that gm crops could foster stronger pests , diseases and weeds that evolve to adapt to engineered plants . trials : attempts to grow genetically-modified crops have frequently been disrupted by protesters . mr cameron also used the innovation event to launch a prize fund , with # 1million of taxpayers ' money , to encourage revolutionary new ideas aimed at solving the world 's biggest problem . he said the modern version of the 1714 longitude prize would be a ` britain 's got talent ' for innovators . ` there are so many problems in our world that need that amazing solution , whether it is a cure for dementia , solving the problem of diabetes , having a flight from britain to new york that 's carbon free , ' he said . ` let 's challenge the public and challenge the scientists for which is the great problem we want to crack . ` i 'm thinking of something - britain 's got talent , you know , you switch on the tv and you watch the dog jumping over the pole , or whatever it is . let 's actually get the nation engaged on what the biggest problems are in science and in our lives that we need to crack , with a multi-million pound prize to then help us do that . '", "summary": " prime minister signals u-turn on gm food to help feed the world .   government is calling for eu controls on new gm crops to be relaxed .   but majority of consumers want more information on impact of gm crops .   much of the meat , milk and eggs in stores come from animals fed a gm diet .
