{"text": "with his penchant for ` hunny ' and a philosophical outlook , winnie-the-pooh was the charming bear whose tales captivated children from the day they were first published nearly 90 years ago . but while the the bear of little brain is still popular with his young audience , a publisher has decided that perhaps his gentle stories are not fast-moving enough for today 's youngsters . today , egmont press releases a new app for ipad and iphone - featuring a shorter , and speeded-up version of pooh 's adventures in the hundred acre wood . the story of winnie-the-pooh has been abridged for a new app because today 's children have shorter attention spans . the classic pooh app , which is read by actor rufus jones and is free to download , abridges aa milne 's story because the publisher says children will lose interest if the story does not zip along . kristian knak , who developed the story for egmont , said today 's young readers would move on if they were not grabbed in the first 60 seconds . ` today 's children 's attention spans are slightly different to how they were in 1926 , ' he said . ` we have a minute to get them on board . if not , they will move on to the next app , ' he told the times . egmont 's tim jones said the stories had to be made more appealing to a modern audience to keep them relevant to today 's children . ` as a children 's publisher , we want to be where children are experiencing entertainment and that is in the digital format , ' he metro . the classic pooh app will feature animated versions of the original drawings by the late ernest shepard . ` we 've been working with illustrations that are 85 years old which have a place in british culture , illustrations that are greatly loved . we had to look at it very sensitively and that 's what we 've tried to do . ' a second story app is available to buy for # 1.99 , and further stories will be available later this year . this morning , popular children 's author giles paley-phillips , 35 , said it was ` tragic ' that such a gentle story had to be speeded up for modern children . the award-winning author of the fearsome beastie said : ` i 've got two boys of my own , aged six and four , and we enjoy the bedtime ritual where we sit down and have time to read picture books and look at the illustrations . ` it is especially sad given that the pooh stories are so soft and gentle , and have such lovely pictures . ' i am very against e-books , because i think everything in the modern world moves at such a frantic pace . reading a book at their own pace offers children a chance to slow down and use their imagination , and really enjoy the story . ' the new classic pooh app , available from today , features animations of the original winnie-the-pooh drawings . new drawings show the bear and his friend piglet enjoying the sights of london , including the shard , pictured . the new drawings , by illustrator mark burgess , depict pooh visiting london and playing pooh sticks on the millennium bridge . the pooh stories for the app are not new , but the publisher has released publicity images drawn by mark burgess in the style of original illustrator e. h. shepard of pooh bear and his friend piglet in modern settings . there is one of pooh taking a photograph of london skyscraper the shard with his mobile phone , another showing the pair on the millennium ` wobbly ' bridge , and another showing them getting off a tube train . winnie-the-pooh , who was named after milne 's son christopher robin 's stuffed teddy bear , lost his hyphens when disney adapted his stories for the screen in the 1960s . the anthropomorphic bear and his friends have enchanted youngsters for decades , generating millions in the process . in 1930 , american stephen slesinger bought the us and canadian rights for pooh from milne for $ 1,000 and 66 per cent of slesinger 's income , and by the following year it was a $ 50m-a-year business . the stories about pooh bear have been translated into many languages including russian and even latin , and have inspired films , television series , and a lucrative range of pooh-related merchandise .", "summary": " new classic pooh app for ipad offers faster-paced stories to grab children .   publisher egmont says young readers must be hooked within a minute .
