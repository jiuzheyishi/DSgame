{"text": "jamal lewis , dorsey levens and two other former nfl players have filed a lawsuit accusing the national football league of misleading them and failing to protect them against on-the-field brain injuries they say caused health problems years after they retired . lewis and levens , as well as fulton kuykendall and ryan stewart , filed the lawsuit wednesday in u.s. district court in atlanta , according to four separate player statements .  despite overwhelming medical evidence ... the nfl not only failed to take effective action in an attempt to protect players from suffering , but failed to inform players of the true risks associated with concussions ,  the statements said . the men accused the nfl of using a  hand-picked committee of physicians  to misrepresent evidence of the effects of head trauma , particularly concussions , which were later more publicly linked to heightened risks of long-term brain injury .  we do believe the nfl knew and had that available information with them for many years now ,  said attorney mike mcglamry .  only recently had they come and acknowledged that concussions and multiple concussions do have this effect .  the four men said that since their playing days they 've suffered from a range of symptoms , including headaches , sleeplessness and dementia . still , mcglamry acknowledged the difficulty of targeting the nfl , particularly when most players voluntarily engaged in similar conduct during their time at the collegiate and high school levels . it 's also unclear whether players ' claims can be considered outside their current collective bargaining agreements , and whether the allegations are subject to a statute of limitations , most notable for players like kuykendall , 53 , who played for the atlanta falcons during the 1970s . the league responded thursday to the lawsuit , saying it  has long made player safety a priority and continues to do so .   any allegation that the nfl intentionally sought to mislead players has no merit ,  the statement added .  it stands in contrast to the league 's actions to better protect players and advance the science and medical understanding of the management and treatment of concussions .  lewis , 32 , played for the baltimore ravens and the cleveland browns , ending his career in 2009 . levens , 41 , played for the philadelphia eagles , new york giants and the green bay packers . stewart , 38 , who played as a safety for the detroit lions , said that since his retirement , he 's experienced frequent headaches , difficulty sleeping and tingling sensations in his arms and hands . knowing the risks associated with head trauma  probably would have made me at least play a little bit different ,  stewart told cnn .  i would have used my head a whole lot less , or not at all , when it came to trying to make plays . but i was coached to do that . i did what i was coached to do , not knowing the ramifications that i 'd be dealing with today .  part of the problem , said former atlanta falcons linebacker coy wire , is a sports culture that encourages behavior largely out of step with the now recognized risks associated with head trauma . head trauma injuries are exacerbated when coaches , even at the high school level say ,  ` oh , you just got your bell rung . get back out there and play , '  said wire . this can contribute , he added , to the danger of long-term brain damage . later on thursday , the nfl players association announced in a statement that it 's  not a party to this lawsuit and has no comment at this time .  in recent years , the nfl has attempted to strengthen rules that govern player conduct on the field , adding sideline medical staff -- unaffiliated with the teams -- in an effort to more independently evaluate injured players . in 2005 , the league banned the practice of tackling a player by using his shoulder pads , a move commonly referred to as a  horse-collar  tackle , after concluding it commonly resulted in injury . it also recently strengthened a 1979 rule that prohibits players from using their helmets to butt , or  spear  players during a tackle -- a rule that critics had often complained lacked official enforcement . players like steelers ' linebacker james harrison have since faced hefty and repeated fines for helmet-first tackles . still , others have called for added protections following a series of high-profile incidents involving former players ' health . in may , scientists announced that an autopsy of the brain of former chicago bears safety david duerson , 50 , who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound , showed evidence of  moderately advanced  chronic traumatic encephalopathy , or cte , a dementia-like brain disease afflicting athletes exposed to repeated brain trauma . cte has been found in the brains of 14 of 15 former nfl players studied at boston university 's center for the study of traumatic encephalopathy . their cases share a common thread -- repeated concussions , sub-concussive blows to the head , or both . john grimsley , who died in 2008 at the age of 45 , also from a gunshot wound , was the first deceased athlete studied for the disease at the boston university center , according to its website .  examination of mr. grimsley 's brain confirmed extensive cte ,  the website said . mike webster , an offensive lineman with the pittsburgh steelers who died at the age of 50 , was also diagnosed posthumously with cte . scientists at boston university say they have found evidence of cte in the brain of an athlete as young as 18 years old .", "summary": " four former nfl players are suing the league .   the men accuse the nfl of using a  hand-picked committee of physicians    they say the league misrepresented evidence
