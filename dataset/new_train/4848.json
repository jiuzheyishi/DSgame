{"text": "you 've probably heard of glorious goodwood -- well , this is more like glorious driftwood . galloping along beaches or drinking quietly from a pool , these majestic horses are n't what they first seem . that 's because , not that long ago , they were just piles of what seemed like scrap wood -- until , that is , artist james doran-webb began working his magic . born in birmingham , the 46-year-old has lived in the philippines since traveling there for what was supposed to have been an extended holiday in 1989 .  i was entranced by the countryside , the beaches , the wildlife and the people , with their flair for color and artistry ,  he explained . he 's long been using driftwood collected from the seas , beaches and rivers near his cebu city home to create his breathtaking wildlife art , and doran-webb 's work is a continuation of a childhood fascination with crafting wooden models and miniature sculptures . much time in his formative years was spent in the workshops of his parent 's antiques restoration firm , giving him a thorough informal education in the arts of craftsmanship . that accumulated knowledge of flair and polish is on display in his three thoroughbreds , all equine power and elegance and his biggest public art project to date . inspired by the fact that this is the chinese year of the horse , they were commissioned for new year celebrations at the gardens by the bay nature park in singapore , where they were even  ridden  by model jousters for a while . the logistics of creating each horse were daunting . a metal frame provides the equivalent of the animal 's skeleton , with hundreds of pieces of driftwood going into each sculpture . the larger pieces are then bolted together and the bolts welded to the frame , with each smaller piece then painstakingly screwed into place .  this wood has been dead for more than 50 years ,  doran-webb told cnn .  it has weathered over those decades , and that 's what makes it look so fantastic .  i was always an outdoor type of person , and would come across these wonderful pieces of wood while out kayaking -- i have been collecting driftwood since i was 18 , and have enough stockpiled to be able to find , in the end , all the right pieces .  i 'll go on a hunt for a piece for a nostril or eyebrow , but i 'll come across a potential hoof instead . it 's like a jigsaw puzzle : you keep on looking until you 've found the right piece .  also , people know the sort of wood i use now and they 'll bring it to me ,  added doran-webb , who pays them , putting money into villages where incomes can often be precarious at best .  but sometimes i 'll think i 've finished a piece and then find myself starting again with a certain amount of the wood because it does n't look right . i focus hard on the details of faces and muscles .  his first use of driftwood , though , had nothing to do with animals or sculpture -- he had initially crafted and sold furniture from it until the possibilities of creating large-scale art suddenly struck him . and what ambitious scale it is : each horse sculpture can weigh anything up to a ton -lrb- 1,000 kilograms -rrb- , is 16-17 hands -lrb- around 5ft 11ins -rrb- tall and can easily take the weight of a  jockey  or two . each takes three to four months to create , with doran-webb and his team of six craftsmen working together on the process , with each sculpture springing to life from a series of initial sketches and scale models .  i 'll have an idea -- an image of a horse race or a polo match -- and sketch it until i get something that has motion and movement ,  he said .  the metal skeleton is crucial . if you stripped away the wood , what you would see would look sort of like the skeleton of the actual animal . it provides all the strength , but cladding it takes a long time .  it may take a long time , but doran-webb says he 's never fully satisfied with the results , and only the world of deadlines prevents him from perpetual tinkering .  if it was n't for them , i 'd never leave the studio ,  he admitted .  if something is even an inch out , you have to redo it . there 's never been one i 've been happy with first time .
