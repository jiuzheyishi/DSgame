{"text": "there was a time when the prospect of germans crossing the english channel at speed might have been a source of some alarm . but today rail passengers on both sides of the water will be celebrating germany 's deutsche bahn receiving permission to run its 200mph trains at ` blitz ' or lightning speed through the channel tunnel . it will get travellers from berlin to london in four and a half hours -- and vice versa . a german ice high speed train coming out of the channel tunnel on its test run in 2010 . experts predict the extra trains and competition from the nation most renowned for making its railways run on time will result in cheaper fares and a better deal for passengers . it will add four million passengers to the 10 million who already use the rail-link ` chunnel ' . the decision follows three years of negotiation and a trial run of a 200mph german bullet train in october 2010 . it will lead to direct services between germany and holland and london with connections across the country . the aim is to run regular services between london 's st pancras station and frankfurt in germany , as well as amsterdam in holland . experts say the competition could also mean lower fares with a one way trip to germany costing as little as # 39 to # 49 . the decision was welcomed by transport secretary patrick mcloughlin who is in favour of the move . the intercity express train , one of germany 's most modern superfast trains , which will be continuing to expand across the continent . announcing the new deal , eurotunnel said : ` after three years of detailed study , the intergovernmental commission has granted deutsche bahn an operating certificate to run passenger services through the channel tunnel . ' it said : ' we believe that this long awaited decision will considerably enhance exchanges between the united kingdom and northern europe -lrb- germany , holland -rrb- and will over time add between 3 and 4 million new passengers per year to the 10 million already using the existing high speed passenger services . ' a eurotunnel spokesman said : ` this new chapter requires no additional investment as adjustments to the timetable and modifications to the paths through the tunnel will suffice to accommodate the new traffic . ' he said : ` this increase in the choice of services offered by railway operators is a measure of the improvement in the transport sector as it brings major benefits to passengers . jacques gounon , chairman and chief . executive officer of groupe eurotunnel sa said : ` twenty years after the . start of commercial services , the authorities have finally opened the . channel tunnel to all . ` this . is wonderful news for the millions of passengers in northern europe who . can now use this most environmentally friendly means of transport to . travel to london ' . the germans first made their pitch for a cross-channel train in october 2010 when they sent a trial 200-mph german bullet-train on a slow-speed dry run trial for a new direct cross-channel link . the german ` inter city express ' train . bearing the initial letters ` ice ' adorned as a red , white and blue union . flag , aims to replace passenger jets as the main transport to germany 's . financial capital and the rhineland . the plan is for three services a day in . each direction - each carrying 888 passengers in 16 coaches - on a new . generation german cross-channel bullet train that will put the people of . cologne closer in travelling time to the british capital than they are . to their own capital , berlin . two high-speed trains - one german , left , one french - in paris . the tgv high speed train and ice inter city express was a significant collaboration between rival rail giants , france 's sncf and deutsche bahn . in brussels , the trains will split , with eight carriages carrying 444 passengers heading to rotterdam and then amsterdam . the other eight carriages will head to cologne and then frankfurt . deutsche bahn officials said the journey time from cologne to london would be under four hours - less than the time it takes to get to berlin , around four and a half hours : ` passenger can choose which capital they prefer - yours or ours , ' said one db official . it also mean business travellers and tourists can relax for longer in their seats or work via wi-fi rather than enduring the hassle of airline check-in , security and trips to and from the airport . it is the latest step in the plan to create high speed rail links across britain and europe - from edinburgh to madrid and manchester to marseilles . but while trains will hit 200mph on the continent , tunnels on the uk side of the channel mean high speed trains are restricted in many places to 140mph . the german challenger was the first all-new train to use the tunnel since it opened . german railway giant deutsche bahn has already been busy buying up a number of uk train operators and has now set its sight on taking on the airlines and arch rival eurostar to win passenger services between the uk and the continent . it aims to slash the train travelling time from central london to frankfurt , nicknamed ` bankfurt ' in germany because it is the nation 's major financial centre , from around six hours to less than five hours . this competes with the door-to-door four and a half hours needed to fly there , once travel to the airport , check-in time and the 1 hour 30 minute flight time are put together . launching the plan at st pancras in october 2010 , deutsche bahn boss dr ruediger grube said it marked ' a new era ' of train travel adding : ` europe is becoming a small place . ` every day there are around 50 flights between the greater london area and the region of frankfurt and the rhineland . ' the city night line is a joint venture combining deutsche bahn and eurostar trains to paris for a service to the tirol as part of deutsche bahn 's expansion across the continent . until now that was out of reach of the railways , he said : ` but times change . thanks to new railway lines , new high speed trains , and new transport policies , we will be able to share in that market . ' mr grube said : ` three pairs of trains will connect frankfurt and london via cologne , brussels , and lille , with one train running in each direction in the morning , at lunchtime , and in the evening . ` this will also be the first time that amsterdam and rotterdam have a direct connection with london . ' the high speed german-built inter city express -lrb- ice -rrb- trains have to pass stringent safety tests to pass through the channel tunnel - including evacuations . their arrival nevertheless highlights how far international relations have moved . some 73 years ago , at the height of the battle of britain , the narrow strip of water comprising the channel was all that separated britain from german invasion . today the nation which was defeated is now running much of britain 's railways . last year state-owned deutsche bahn said it would delay the launch of direct train services between london and frankfurt to at least 2016 , compared with initial plans to start the route in 2013 . cross-channel train services are currently operated by eurostar , which is majority-owned by french state-owned sncf . eurotunnel gets a fee for each train passing through the tunnel linking dover to calais . the announcement comes as ministers are embroiled in a ` jobs for british workers ' row after confirming that germany 's siemens had won a controversial # 1.6 bn contract to build trains for the thameslink line . the decision is a huge blow to derby-based bombardier , one of three major employers in the city and the last british-based train-maker . canadian-owned bombardier had warned ministers it needed the thameslink contract to safeguard the future of the factory -- which survived a zeppelin airship raid in 1916 . it announced 1,400 job cuts at derby plant when it was first announced that it had lost the deal . tuc general secretary frances o'grady said : ` this will be a death blow to derby 's economy ' .", "summary": " berlin to london rail service will take only four and a half hours .   a one way trip to germany could cost as little as # 39 to # 49 .   german railway giant deutsche bahn has set its sights on rival eurostar .   trains will be connecting london 's st pancras with germany and holland .
