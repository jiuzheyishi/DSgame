{"text": "a high school football player who clashed heads with an opponent during a game thought little of the knock . but after hitting his shoulder during practice days later , he was left in a coma with a huge brain swelling and internal bleeding . six years later , aged 23 , he struggles to remember things from just hours earlier and can not walk unaided . cody lehe , from indiana , is one of dozens of promising young footballers to have fallen victim to the terrifying ` second impact syndrome ' . scroll down for video . horrific : cody lehe , 17 , was left in a coma after a double head trauma caused his brain to swell and fill with blood -lrb- file picture -rrb- . sis is very rare and always happens to high school or college-age players , according to dr michael turner , whose case study on cody was published yesterday in the journal of neurosurgery . ` it 's probably something to do with the . immature brain , because our brain really keeps growing until you 're 18 , . 19 years old , ' said dr turner . for years , doctors believed teenagers who . suffered from sis had blood clots from their first concussions , which went unnoticed until the second impact triggered brain swelling and further . bleeding . but cody had had a ct scan after the head clash , . the first to exist for an sis patient between hits , which showed nothing . dangerous : second impact syndrome is thought to cause blood vessels to swell and push against the brain , causing the loss of ability to walk , talk and recall simple things . no one had been especially worried about cody , because he had not passed or thrown up as a victim of concussion normally would . after taking . the second hit , however , the 17-year-old walked off the field and toppled . forward into another player , dizzy , his legs numb . then he collapsed , his body shaking with seizures . dr turner now believes that cody 's brain sent a message . to the rest of his body for more blood , which filled the veins and . arteries in his head and caused his brain to swell against the skull , causing further injury and damage . the ambulance technicians told his mother becky that they did n't think he would make it to the hospital , she told abc news . cody had to spend 55 days in the intensive . care unit - the same number as the one on his football jersey - and a further 43 in its rehab unit . he had suffered temporary cardiac arrest , hypertension , . pneumonia , renal failure and sepsis . he could not walk or talk . sis occurs when a person - most often a teenager - sustains a second head injury before recovery from an earlier head injury is complete . the second hit causes the brain to swell catastrophically , but it is the first injury that makes the player a walking time bomb . if , within several weeks , the victim suffers a second head injury , brain swelling , internal bleeding and death can occur within minutes . experts believe that after the second hit , the brain loses its ability to auto-regulate . blood vessel walls become less stiff and expand like a garden hose that becomes fatter as it ages . if enough blood vessels swell , it makes the brain bigger , squashing tissue up against the skull . there is serious concern about this problem in sport because so many players suffer head injuries . nobody knows the true number because they are often dismissed as ` dings ' and ` bell-ringers ' . cody has regained the . ability to speak , but still lacks short-term memory . he can walk on a . treadmill for six minutes at a time with someone at his . side , but he ca n't balance on his own and depends on a wheelchair to get . around . ` for someone who was n't supposed . to make it through , he 's beaten all the odds , ' said mrs lehe , adding that . she now sees a different side to her son that had previously been . reserved only for his school friends . ` he was a class clown . he was . hilarious , but we did n't see that much at home . ' dr turner said cody 's case showed that athletes need . to get off the playing field if they 've had head injuries . the centers for disease control and prevention has released guidelines . suggesting that players with signs of concussion should be removed from . play and not return until they have permission from their doctor and . show no symptoms with exertion . in august 2011 , 22-year-old starting fullback derek . sheely died a week after collapsing at football practice at frostburg . state university . his uncontrollable . brain swelling led doctors and his father to believe it was sis . an estimated 1.7 million people receive a traumatic brain injury , including concussions , each year , according to the cdc . cody 's mother mrs lehe added : ' i think the biggest thing is we have got to get the kids to understand to listen to their bodies . ` we have this gladiator mentality . out there , ' she said . ` be tough . hang in there . take one for the . team ... we 've got to change .
