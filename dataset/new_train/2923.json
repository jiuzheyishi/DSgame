 the surprising history behind the hijab . some women say the hijab makes them feel like they 're locked in a cage . but others say it leads to personal freedom . sarah hekmati first wore the hijab at age 15 growing up in detroit , michigan . she is the daughter of iranian parents who left iran in 1979 during the islamic revolution . hekmati says the hijab liberated her from some teenage angst : does my hair look good ? am i cute enough ? should i lose weight ?  it gave me a sense of identity ,  she says .  i really liked the purpose behind the hijab -- a woman covering herself so that a man should know her for her mind , not her body .  that purpose can be traced back to the quran , islam 's holy text , which encourages women to dress modestly , says faegheh shirazi , author of  the veil unveiled .  some muslims take the quran 's advice as a command for women to wear the hijab , while others disagree , she says .  the quran is very ambiguous about whether you have to wear the veil or not ,  shirazi says . the hijab , however , actually predates islam , shirazi explains . the first known reference to veiling -lrb- shirazi uses the term hijab and veil interchangeably -rrb- was made in an assyrian legal text in the 13th century b.c. , shirazi says . in the assyrian , and later , the roman and byzantine empires , the veil was a symbol of prestige and status , she says . by the 12th century , the veil had been imposed on women in the muslim world to exclude them from public life , shirazi says .  a sign of distinction had been transformed into a sign of exclusion ,  she writes in her book . people are still debating the meaning of the hijab today . in 2007 , british muslim groups protested when schools were given the right to ban students from wearing full-face veils . in 2008 , turkey 's top court upheld a ban on wearing muslim headscarves at the country 's universities . that same year , a muslim woman was briefly jailed at a suburban atlanta , georgia , courthouse after refusing to remove her hijab in court . some moms against hijab wearing . the debate over the hijab can literally hit home for some young muslim women . those that wear the hijab in the united states can befuddle their mothers , who often immigrated to the west so they could be free from wearing the hijab and other rules imposed on women . that 's what happened to hekmati , the muslim-american from detroit . her mother , behnaz , was puzzled by her daughter 's decision to wear the hijab . behnaz hekmati grew up in iran , where she did not wear the hijab . young women who attended college in iran like she did generally did n't wear the hijab , she says . behnaz hekmati warned her daughter that wearing the hijab would arouse the suspicion of americans .  i said sarah , when you cover your head here the people think you are political -- they see you differently ,  behnaz hekmati says . most of the trouble , though , came from iranian-americans , who came to the united states to escape the islamic fundamentalists who seized power in 1979 , she says .  the iranians here bother her more than americans ,  behnaz hekmati says .  they say , ` we got rid of you guys . we came here because we did n't want to see you guys anymore . '  hekmati was more concerned as a teenager about more personal issues , like her relations with boys . the hijab made it more difficult , she says . few asked her on dates . guys always seemed to put her in the  friend category .  she wondered if she was attractive .  i wondered at times : am i always going to be a guy 's friend and nothing more .  strangers in public saw her as something else -- a subjugated woman . they looked at her with pity , she says . some were just baffled .  one guy asked me if i was allergic to the sun ,  hekmati says . abdelaziz , the new jersey high school senior , also had her tense public encounters : angry looks , people feeling sorry for her or assuming her father ordered her to wear the hijab .  it 's not oppression ; it 's not that i 'm accepting degradation -- it 's about self-respect ,  she says . but it 's more about faith as well . she says the hijab affirms  islam in the most respectful and purified way .   when you actually wear it , it opens your eyes ,  she says .  it makes you want to explore your religious faith .  at times , abdelaziz says she wonders what it would be like to attend her prom , get a tan at the beach and have a boyfriend . but she says her decision to honor her faith is already paying off .  it really feels good ,  she says .  it felt like i was missing something and now i 'm complete . i finally understand my purpose .
