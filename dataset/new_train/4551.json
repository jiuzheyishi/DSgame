{"text": "an election-year showdown over a democratic priority -- raising the federal minimum wage to $ 10.10 an hour -- saw senate republicans block the measure on wednesday , unleashing a torrent of criticism from president barack obama and his party . the measure failed to get the 60 votes needed to open debate in the 100-seat senate , with only one republican joining majority democrats in an unsuccessful effort to overcome the gop filibuster . while another vote on the proposal is possible , obama and democrats quickly sought to exploit the measure 's initial stumble into political capital for november 's congressional elections .  if your member of congress does n't support raising the minimum wage , you have to let them know they are out of step and if they keep putting politics ahead of working americans , you will put them out of office ,  the president told a white house event that focused on the matter . minimum wage state by state . republicans argue raising the minimum wage to $ 10.10 per hour would damage the nation 's fragile economic recovery . several gop lawmakers took note of fresh data released wednesday indicating the economy grew at a sluggish 0.1 % in the first quarter of 2014 .  they seem to think they can coast on talking points and stale ideas Ã¢ $  and that the american people have n't been paying attention to their recent dismal record at actually helping the people they claim to care about ,  said senate republican leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky . however , senate democrats argued the gop position hurt american workers struggling to make ends meet .  their vote today defines their priorities ,  sen. patty murray of washington said of republicans .  it is the equivalent of looking american women in the eye and telling them they do n't deserve a living wage . it is telling our middle-class families they do n't deserve a fair shot .  minimum wage : congress stalls , states act . even if the senate moved ahead with the legislation , there was little chance the house , which is led by republicans , would take it up . obama and democrats noted that polls show a strong majority of americans support raising the minimum wage , which currently stands at $ 7.25 . at the same time , polls indicate democrats have little chance of winning back control of the house in november and could lose their majority in the senate . after wednesday 's vote , democratic senators sought to use the defeat as a rallying cry for november .  low-income people tend not to vote , but on this , this would be one that they come out on because it 's a pocketbook issue for them ,  said liberal sen. tom harkin of iowa . democrat chuck schumer of new york noted that traditionally conservative states like arkansas and alaska have put a minimum-wage increase on their ballots  to help bring out the vote .  2014 : what 's at stake . republican senators this week telegraphed their opposition to the minimum wage proposal , with some saying the democratic plan was too expensive and would lead to significant job losses if businesses were forced to adopt it .  it 's too high , too fast ,  said sen. rob portman of ohio , who favors a smaller increase like the one adopted in his state . sen. susan collins , a maine republican , also said she supports a reasonable increase and complained that democrats sought to force the higher figure through without compromise or debate .  i think it speaks to what 's wrong with washington today -- that we 're placed in a situation where it was ` take it or leave it ' rather than trying to come together and offer amendments and offer a level that might be acceptable ,  collins said after the vote . harkin , however , said the $ 10.10 figure sought by democrats was needed to lift people out of poverty .  we will not compromise on $ 10.10 . that just gets us above the poverty level ,  he said .  anyone who wants to go below that is saying that a hard-working american who works full-time all year long still will live in poverty . it 's time to get beyond that .  2014 : the battle for the senate . in february , obama signed an executive order raising the minimum wage to $ 10.10 per hour for federal contractors beginning in 2015 . the measure voted on wednesday sought to make that figure the federal minimum wage . the lone republican to vote with democrats was sen. bob corker of tennessee , who said he wants changes in the measure even though he supported bringing it up for debate . meanwhile , democratic sen. mark pryor , who is facing a challenging re-election in conservative arkansas , supports a smaller increase that is under consideration in his state . pryor missed wednesday 's vote because he was back in arkansas dealing with this week 's storm damage . key races to watch . republicans argued the liberal agenda pushed by senate majority leader harry reid of nevada could hurt centrist democrats this fall .  for the democrats here in the senate , particularly the vulnerable ones who are in tough competitive races , they 've got to be particularly sensitive to the agenda the democrats are driving ,  sen. john thune of south dakota , a gop leader , said this week .  i think there are a lot of democrats , on minimum wage even , that are concerned about its impact on the economy .  recent national polls indicated that a strong majority of americans support raising the minimum wage to $ 10.10 per hour . the most recent survey , conducted early last month by bloomberg , put that support at 69 % . an abc news/washington post poll released tuesday indicated that by a 49 % -33 % margin , americans say that the democratic party is closer to their views on the issue than the gop . and by a two-to-one margin , voters nationwide questioned earlier this month in a quinnipiac university poll said they would be more likely than less likely to vote for a candidate who supports raising the minimum wage . meanwhile , national polls suggested republicans have an enthusiasm edge over democrats six months before the november vote . according to an nbc news/wall street journal poll released wednesday , 45 % of registered voters say they want the november elections to result in a republican-controlled congress , with an equal amount saying they 'd like to see democrats in control on capitol hill . but among voters with the highest interest in the midterms , the gop holds a 15-percentage point lead -lrb- 53 % -38 % -rrb- over the democrats on the question of which party should control congress . a cbs news poll conducted late last month showed that 75 % of registered republican voters questioned said they were very or somewhat excited about voting in november , compared to 58 % of democrats . also , 81 % of registered republicans said they 'll definitely vote in november , compared to 68 % of registered democrats . the surveys seem to back up the conventional wisdom that the gop has an advantage over the democrats in midterm contests . white voters and older voters , key to the republican base , tend to cast ballots in bigger percentages in midterms than younger voters and minorities , who are an important part of the democrats ' base . democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the senate , including two independents who caucus with the party , but are defending 21 of the 36 seats contested in november . half of those democratic-held seats are in traditionally conservative states or those considered purple -- leaning neither right or left . in the house , democrats need to pick up 17 gop-held seats to win back control of the republican-led chamber , a feat political handicappers say is unlikely considering the shrinking number of competitive congressional districts . leading dem gov : 2014 is not a ` change ' election . new low for obama in key midterm indicator . biden goes on offense over gop economic agenda . special coverage : the 2014 midterms .", "summary": " president obama blasts republicans over
