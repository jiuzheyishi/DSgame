{"text": "a report from a french physician in 1740 contains what is thought to be the oldest medical record of a near-death experience has been discovered . the discovery was made by anthropologist dr phillipe charlier , who bought the book for about $ 1 -lrb- 60p -rrb- in an antique shop . in the book a patient is being described as falling unconscious and then seeing a pure bright light that they interpreted as being heaven . a french medical record from 1740 -lrb- shown -rrb- was found to include the oldest known reference to a near-death experience -lrb- nde -rrb- in a patient . the book was written by military physician pierre-jean du monchaux . he describes how his patient had vivid sensations associated with ndes . the greyson criteria measures how strong of a near-death experience a person has had . dr charlier applied it to the patient in the book -lrb- each part scored out of two -rrb- . a score of seven or higher is said to be an nde . altered sense of time 1/2 . accelerated thought processes 0/2 . life review 0/2 . sense of sudden understanding 0/2 . affective feeling of peace 2/2 . feeling of joy 2/2 . feeling of cosmic unity 0/2 . seeing/feeling surrounded by light 2/2 . purportedly paranormal vivid senses 0/2 . purported extrasensory perception 1/2 . purported precognitive vision 0/2 . sense of being out of physical body 0/2 . apparent transcendental sense of an ` other world ' environment 2/2 . sense of a mystical entity 2/2 . sense of deceased/religious spirits 0/2 . sense of a border / ' point of no return ' 0/2 . total score 12/32 . titled ` anecdotes de m√©decine ' , the report was written by french military physician pierre-jean du monchaux , reports livescience . at the time monchaux attempted to explain the phenomenon by saying that an increase in blood flow to the brain could be the cause behind the visions . however , modern physicians now think that the odd sensations are actually caused by a lack of blood flow to the brain . ` near-death experience -lrb- nde -rrb- has been scientifically described as  a profound psychological event with transcendental and mystical elements  after a life-threatening crisis , ' dr charlier writes in his paper . he describes these elements as awareness of being dead , positive emotions , out of body experience , the feeling of moving through a tunnel , communication with light , observation of colours of a celestial landscape , meeting with deceased people and a life review . pierre-jean du monchaux was born in 1733 but died in 1766 at the age of just 33 in the island san domingo from a fever . his patient for this report was a parisian apothecary who had a malign fever . after his last blood test he fell unconscious for a long time , to such an extent that his assistant became worried . ` he reported that after having lost all external sensations , he saw such a pure and extreme light that he thought he was in heaven -lrb- literally : in the kingdom of the blessed -rrb- , ' writes dr charlier . ` he remembered this sensation very well , and affirmed that never of all his life had he had a nicer moment . ` other individuals of various ages and sexes reported a very similar sensation in the same circumstances . ' monchaux then compared this case with others caused by drowning , hypothermia and hanging , and deduced that all involved the loss of blood . he then writes that the abundant flow of blood back into the brain creates ` these vivid and strong sensations ' . during ndes people describe having vivid sensations that seem to suggest they are moving towards a light -lrb- stock image shown -rrb- accompanied by a pleasant sensation . monchaux thought it was caused by an increase in blood flow to the brain but modern scientist now think it is actually caused by a lack of oxygen . today opinion is divided on the true cause of ndes . during such an event people describe having vivid sensations , sometimes out-of-body , that seem to suggest they are moving towards a light accompanied by a pleasant sensation . some experts think it is caused by a lack of blood to the brain , which sets it into ` panic mode ' and it produces vivid visions as it fights to survive . a study of heart attack patients by southampton university , however , contradicted the notion that lack of oxygen is responsible for ndes . the research team studied 63 survivors of a cardiac arrest who were resuscitated at southampton general hospital after they had been clinically dead with no pulse , no respiration and fixed dilated pupils . and those who reported to have a true nde during the ordeal were actually found to have had higher oxygen levels than those who had n't .", "summary": " a french medical record from paris in 1740 was found to include the oldest known reference to a near-death experience -lrb- nde -rrb- in a patient .   the book was written by military physician pierre-jean du monchaux .   he describes how his patient had vivid sensations associated with ndes .   monchaux thought it was caused by an increase in blood flow to the brain .   but modern scientist now think it is actually caused by a lack of oxygen .
