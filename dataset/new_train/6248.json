{"text": "you might think that a firm handshake , sparkling cv and a can-do attitude are the key ingredients to getting the job of your dreams . but a new study has found having a deep voice could be a barrier for women . recruiters view women with husky voices as less educated and competent , which means they are less likely to be hired . while females applying for jobs could be highly accomplished , recruiters view those with husky voices as less educated and competent , among other undesirable traits , according to a new study . researchers at the university of miami looked at women with ` croaky ' voices and how they were perceived , for their study which was published in the journal plos one . previous research has suggested that a low vocal range , known as ` vocal fry ' indicates education and power , but the new research found that recruiters view the women as less attractive , competent , educated and trustworthy . ` our results show that the vocal fry fad is a hindrance to young women who are trying to find work , ' said casey klofstad from the university . it was reported that in 2011 young women were speaking in a croaky , rough and guttural way to emulate the speech patterns of certain celebrities like britney spears . ` lack of experience due to their younger age , a historically poor economic environment and sex discrimination are all barriers to labour market success for this demographic . ` given this context , our findings suggest that young women would be best advised to avoid using vocal fry when trying to secure employment . ' scarlett johansson -lrb- pictured -rrb- may never be out of work , but scinetists found that people with husky voices like her were only hired 30 per cent of the time compared to normal sounding voices . the researchers recorded seven women between the ages of 19 and 27 and seven men aged 20 to 30 talking in their normal voice and then talking with a deliberately croaky voice . they were asked to say the phrase : ` thank you for considering me for this opportunity ' . then 800 people were asked to pose as recruiters and listen to each recording . they had to choose whether the ` normal ' voice was from a more educated , competent , trustworthy or attractive person . they were also asked which people they would hire based on their voices . it was revealed that people with croaky voices were only hired 20 per cent of the time compared to the normal sounding voices . the recruiters also assumed that people speaking in croaky voices were less likely to be educated , competent , trustworthy or attractive . researchers discovered that women were more likely to be perceived negatively if they had croaky voices than men . ` humans prefer vocal characteristics that are typical of population norms , ' said professor klofstad . ` while strange sounding voices might be more memorable because they are novel , humans find  average  sounding voices to be more attractive . ` it is possible that speakers of vocal fry are generally perceived less favourably because vocal fry is accompanied by a dramatic reduction in voice pitch relative to normal speech . ` previous studies show that when women try to lower the pitch of their voice they are perceived as less attractive , ' he added . ` you could view the results we found as an extension of this to an economic context , whereby deliberate lowering of voice pitch in a sex-atypical manner by women through vocal fry results in negative perceptions by potential employers . '", "summary": " researchers at the university of miami found that recruiters view women with husky voices as less educated and competent .   in their experiment , people with croaky voices were only hired 20 per cent of the time , compared to the normal sounding voices .   they discovered that women were more likely to be perceived negatively because of a croaky voice , than men .
