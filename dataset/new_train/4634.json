{"text": "eric shinseki resigned friday as the head of the department of veterans affairs , leaving behind the daunting task of repairing a broken health care system that has left thousands of veterans at risk as they wait for medical care . shinseki 's resignation concluded a firestorm of criticism and growing calls for him to step down following revelations of sometimes deadly delays for veterans waiting for care at va hospitals , allegations exposed by cnn in a series of exclusive reports . details of the delays were first exposed by cnn last november in an investigation into two va hospitals in the southeast . since then , cnn 's reporting has expanded to include numerous other va hospitals , culminating with details about secret waiting lists at the phoenix va that may have played a role in the deaths of 40 veterans . president barack obama went before reporters at the white house minutes after meeting with shinseki , saying the retired army general told him  the va needs new leadership  to address widespread issues that were chronicled in new reports this week . obama said shinseki  does not want to be a distraction .   that was ric 's judgment on behalf of his fellow veterans , and i agree . we do n't have time for distractions . we need to fix the problem ,  obama said . calls for shinseki 's resignation snowballed in recent days from across the political spectrum -- republicans and democrats , as well as veterans ' advocacy groups -- because of the misconduct . in a farewell message to va employees , shinseki did n't address the scandal specifically but did say he resigned with veterans ' interests in mind .  my personal and professional commitment and my loyalty to veterans , their families and our survivors was the driving force behind that decision ,  he said .  that loyalty has never wavered , and it will never wane .  shinseki says ` situation can be fixed , ' but not by him . earlier friday , shinseki announced steps to address the va shortcomings , including removing senior leaders in the phoenix va medical system , eliminating performance awards for va leaders in 2014 and wait times as a metric for evaluations and accelerating care to veterans . he also apologized to veterans and congress , but declared :  this situation can be fixed .  but shinseki wo n't be part of the solution . he went to the white house to present obama with findings from his internal audit of what was happening in the va system , including that many audited facilities had  questionable scheduling practices  that signaled a  systemic lack of integrity .  read the va audit report . the president acknowledged that scheduling issues did n't rise to the attention of shinseki , whom he praised as a man who  has served his country with honor for nearly 50 years .  at the same time , obama said that he and shinseki agreed that a shift in leadership was necessary . for now , sloan gibson -- a shinseki deputy -- will head the va until a new secretary is named and confirmed .  part of that is going to be technology . part of that is management ,  the president said .  but as ric shinseki himself indicated , there is a need for a change in culture within the vha , and perhaps the vha as a whole -- or the va as a whole that makes sure that bad news gets surfaced quickly so that things can be fixed .  read obama 's statement . breaking open the scandal . secret va waits lists alleged in phoenix . problems in the va system date back decades , but cnn 's reporting of long waits at va hospitals brought the issue into national focus at the end of 2013 . an april report by cnn in which sources said 40 veterans died at a phoenix va facility that used secret waiting lists to cover up the problem prompted angry calls for action . the va has acknowledged 23 deaths nationwide due to delayed care . cnn also obtained an e-mail written by an employee at a wyoming va clinic that said staff was instructed to  game the system  to make the clinic appear more efficient . a preliminary inspector general 's report made public wednesday described a  systemic  practice of manipulating appointments and wait lists at the veterans affairs medical center in phoenix . the va 's troubled history . according to the report , at least 1,700 military veterans waiting to see a doctor were never scheduled for an appointment or were placed on a waiting list at the phoenix va , raising the question of just how many more may have been  forgotten or lost  in the system . in a recent usa today opinion piece , shinseki ordered va officials to contact each of these veterans  in order to bring the care they need and deserve .  the latest report by the va inspector general 's office and shinseki 's auditors indicated a link between employee bonuses and covering up patient wait times . there also have been calls for a criminal investigation into fraudulent record-keeping to cover up delays at va hospitals . obama said friday that would be up to the justice department , which has been collecting information but has not launched any investigation . shortly before he resigned , shinseki told a veterans group that he was shocked by the inspector general 's report , especially the prevalence of wait lists for veterans needing medical care .  that breach of integrity is irresponsible , it is indefensible and unacceptable to me ,  he told the national coalition for homeless veterans just before heading over to his final meeting with obama .  i said when this situation began weeks to months ago and i thought the problem was limited and isolated because i believed that . i no longer believe that . it is systemic ,  he said . at the same time , the va chief of more than five years said that others had misled him .  i was too trusting of some , and i accepted as accurate reports that i now know to have been misleading with regard to patient wait times ,  he said .  i ca n't explain the lack of integrity among some of the leaders of our health care facilities . this is something i rarely encountered during 38 years in uniform and so i will not defend it because it 's indefensible , but i can take responsibility for it and i do .  shinseki could n't weather firestorm . whistleblower : va was ` way too focused on ... good numbers ' as the accusations mounted -- including the latest one in which reps. mike doyle and tim murphy of pennsylvania claimed 700 veterans had been placed on a primary care waiting list for doctor appointments at the pittsburgh va center , with some waiting since 2012 -- so too did the pressure on shinseki . senators calling for shinseki resignation . politicians largely applauded shinseki 's resignation on friday , even as they said that the va needed to do more than put new people in his place to resolve its shortcomings .  the denial of care to our veterans is a national disgrace , and it 's fitting that the person who oversees the department of veterans affairs has accepted responsibility for this growing scandal and resigned ,  senate republican leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky said in a statement . meanwhile , a va whistleblower who told cnn about the problems at the phoenix facility said friday he was saddened by shinseki 's resignation under such circumstances .  the va administrators got way too focused on having good numbers and they forgot the most important mandate , the reason we all work at the va -- to take care of veterans , to save their lives and give them good medical care ,  dr. sam foote said .  the next secretary 's biggest challenge will be to get that refocused and make sure the number one job is taking care of veterans - not worrying about their bureaucratic careers ,  foote added . va pledges faster appointments .", "summary": " obama
