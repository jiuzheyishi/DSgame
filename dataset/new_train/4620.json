escalation  at the noble sanctuary , jordan 's state news agency , petra , reported . jordanian prime minister abdullah ensour also instructed jordan 's foreign affairs minister to submit a complaint to the united nations security council about israeli  attacks  on the noble sanctuary , according to petra . the jewish protesters were attending a support rally for rabbi yehuda glick , a right-wing activist who was shot and gravely wounded by a palestinian last week . the shooting helped to ratchet up tensions in jerusalem and prompted israeli authorities to close the temple mount for one day -- a move that outraged palestinians . israeli police officer killed , 13 hurt in driver 's rampage . samri said the youths had gathered in the mosque overnight , amassing rocks , fireworks and molotov cocktails with which to attack police .  inside the mosque they formed obstacles to hide behind ,  she said .  there were violent clashes with the police .  police went several meters into the mosque in order to clear obstacles preventing them from closing the door , samri said , adding that jews and tourists were now allowed back to the site . but unrest flared again later near another gate , when police threw stun grenades and fired rubber bullets at muslim worshippers who were chanting and praying because they were n't allowed back into the site . paramedics from the red crescent at the scene told cnn that 15 people were injured , one of them with a serious injury to the eye . samri said police officers were injured . also in eastern jerusalem on wednesday , the driver of a commercial van ran over pedestrians at a rail station , killing an israeli border police officer and injuring 13 other people , police said . police shot and killed the attacker . no motive for the

prepare for war .  recent tension at the holy site . the temple mount , or haram al-sharif , is the holiest site in judaism and one of the three holiest sites in islam . some of the recent tension over the temple mount centers on glick , who has long argued that jews must have a place of worship on the temple mount . jews now have the right to visit the site but can not pray there . the drive by glick and others to enable jews to pray there is a sensitive issue for muslims , who suspect a plan to expel them from the site . glick was shot on october 29 as he left a jerusalem conference called  the jewish people return to the temple mount .  glick 's assailant , mutaz hijazi , was shot dead by an israeli counter-terror unit hours later . hundreds of palestinians attended hijazi 's funeral . israeli authorities reacted to glick 's shooting by closing al-aqsa mosque on october 30 , then restricting its access by allowing entry only by men over 50 years of age and women , and putting thousands more police on the streets . the palestinian authority described the closure -- the first in 14 years -- as a  declaration of war .  there were also harsh words from jordan , which remains the custodian of the muslim holy sites in jerusalem according to its peace treaty with israel . on wednesday , a spokesman for the military wing of hamas said that al-aqsa mosque  is the detonator needed to ignite a volcano in the face of the cowardly and treacherous occupier .   we salute the heroes of the mujahideen of hamas ,  abu abiada said in a message posted on the military wing 's website . place for muslim prophet , hebrew patriarch . with its golden dome overlooking jerusalem , the temple mount/haram al-sharif site is said to have hosted sacred events in both the jewish and muslim religions . jewish tradition holds that the temple mount contains mount moriah , where abraham , the hebrew patriarch , is said to have nearly sacrificed his son -- under god 's orders -- before an angel intervened . later , israeli king solomon constructed the first jewish temple on the mount , including the holy of holies , a room that kept the ark of the covenant , which was said to contain the tablets on which god wrote the ten commandments . muslims believe that the prophet mohammed was carried on a flying steed from mecca to the jerusalem site during his miraculous night journey , according to muqtedar khan , an expert on islam and politics at the university of delaware . according to islamic tradition , the night journey took mohammed to the same jerusalem rock on which abraham nearly sacrificed his son , where the muslim founder led abraham , moses and jesus in prayers as the last of god 's prophets . that rock is now said to sit in the dome of the rock , whose golden roof gleams above the old city skyline . since its construction in the seventh century , the haram al-sharif , now controlled by an islamic trust , has been an almost constant source of tension between muslims and jews .", "summary": " jordan recalls ambassador to israel to protest  increasing israeli escalation    paramedics say 15 people were injured ; police say officers were hurt
