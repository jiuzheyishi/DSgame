{"text": "a few months into the iraq war , david petraeus , then a three-star general and commander of the storied 101st airborne division , told cnn about what it would take to win .  frankly ,  he said ,  the way ahead will require a lot of determination and just plain old ingenuity and stick-to-itiveness .  it was january 2004 and the united states had lost 60 men and women . no one could have predicted accurately the course of the war then , but petraeus stuck to his playbook , eventually becoming the top u.s. commander in iraq , leading u.s. counterinsurgency operations and , in 2007 , a strategy to overcome a bloody insurgency that was fronted by a surge in troops . applauded for turning around what seemed a losing battle in iraq -- he was dubbed king david for his successes -- petraeus later went to afghanistan , commanding u.s. and nato forces there . he is arguably the most influential general of his generation . in fact , esquire magazine called him one of the most influential people of the 21st century . but after a career that began after graduation in 1974 from west point and as a second lieutenant in the infantry , petraeus is hanging up the uniform for a civilian suit , leaving the pentagon for halls of another hallowed washintgon institution : the cia . petraeus relinquishes his afghanistan post on monday . in an official ceremony , he will hand over command to marine lt. gen. john r. allen . petraeus plans to retire from the army at the end of august and assume the cia director 's job september 6 . some were stunned that a decorated military career was ending prematurely . petraeus is only 58 .  i wanted this job ,  petraeus said at his senate confirmation hearing .  i am taking off the uniform i have worn for 37 years to do this the right way .  with that , the u.s. army is losing the architect of modern-day counterinsurgency operations . petraeus wrote his doctoral dissertation on the lessons america learned in vietnam . later , he devised the army/marine field manual , challenging the military to think differently in how it relates to the civilian population in dealing with an insurgency . this week , ahead of his departure , petraeus assessed the results of his strategy in afghanistan .  what we have done is implement the so-called nato comprehensive approach , a civil-military campaign ... that does indeed embody many of the principles of the counterinsurgency field manual that we developed back in 2006 , and which we employed in iraq in the surge of 2007-2008 ,  he said in an interview with nato-tv .  i think generally , it has borne fruit .  he said it has been a difficult journey , rife with setbacks , but coalition forces have halted the momentum of the taliban in much of the country and reversed the insurgent hold in restive helmand province . petraeus 's experience in working with the cia on counterinsurgency efforts in the field was cited as a reason for his nomination as the spy agency 's director . petraeus told nato-tv that he never thought his military career would end in afghanistan . the top commander 's job came unexpectedly after a rolling stone magazine article prompted the resignation of gen. stanley mcchrystal . obama asked petraeus to leave the top post at u.s. central command . he took command in afghanistan on july 4 , 2010 .  we 've jokingly said that i went to the white house for the monthly national security council meeting on afghanistan and pakistan with president obama , and came out with a new job ,  petraeus said .  and that 's not far from the truth .
