{"text": "we 're used to seeing burnley in claret and blue , but the visitors wore a silver strip last night that made it look as though they had been wrapped in tin foil . the club 's third kit was first seen at sunderland late last month and was preferred to their all-black away kit again . at first glance , it looked like sean dyche had fielded a team of 11 tin men from the wizard of oz , but burnley 's performance soon showed they were not lacking any heart as they gave the home side more than a few scares at old trafford . burnley ditched their black kit in favour of a shiny silver strip at manchester united as george boyd reflects on a missed chance for the clarets at old trafford . ryan giggs -lrb- left -rrb- goes to challenge southampton 's matt le tissier during a premier league game in april 1996 , a match where manchester united manager sir alex ferguson binned the the grey kit at half-time . do n't expect louis van gaal 's team to respond by releasing their own tin coloured kit any time soon though . manchester united are unlikely to ever play in the colour again after sir alex ferguson binned it at half-time during a defeat at southampton in 1996 . united 's technical area has been vacant for much of the season with louis van gaal happy to observe proceedings from the dugout and make notes on his clipboard , unlike his predecessor sir alex ferguson who used it to great effect as a means of berating match officials and scaring the wits out of his players . united boss louis van gaal watched the match from the dugout while making notes on his clipboard . giggs -lrb- left -rrb- patrolled manchester united 's technical area alongside burnley counterpart sean dyche . van gaal 's assistant ryan giggs assumed a significantly higher profile last night , however , as he spent large parts of the game stood alongside dyche on the touchline . there was little sympathy for former blackburn player phil jones from the burnley fans as he limped off in the fifth minute . ` you 'll always be a b ***** d' was the charming refrain from the away end of old trafford in reference to their east lancashire rivalry . phil jones -lrb- right -rrb- was jeered off by burnley fans after picking up an injury , with his replacement chris smalling scoring just 22 seconds after replacing him to silence the boo boys among the away supporters . the chant was drowned out when jones 's replacement chris smalling scored with his first touch from a corner having been on the pitch for just 22 seconds , and he went on to head united in front again at the end of the first half . sean dyche included three former united players in his team -- david jones , michael keane and tom heaton -- but a serious knee injury suffered by dean marney last weekend meant that the burnley boss was unable to name the same starting line-up for the 11th league game in a row . michael keane -lrb- left -rrb- was one of three former manchester united players that started for burnley as he attempts to close down james wilson . daley blind was the second united player to be substituted before half-time after suffering a cut over his left eye in a collision with team-mate jonny evans . the dutchman came back on after having stitches but could n't continue . dlaey blind was forced off in the first half for manchester united having taken to the turf injured . blind walks off after picking up an injury as united were forced to make two first half changes . talk of manchester united turning into a long-ball team had dominated the build-up to this game thanks to some mischievous comments from sam allardyce and the reaction of louis van gaal who turned up at his pre-match press conference armed with statistical evidence to the contrary . marouane fellaini was not called upon at old trafford following his central showing at west ham on sunday . the target man at the centre of it all , 6ft 4in marouane fellaini , does n't seem to mind either way . ` i 'm a midfielder and i like to play a bit more defensive , but it 's up to the manager , ' said fellani . ` wherever he tells me to play , that 's where i play . if you put me up front you know why you 're doing it . '", "summary": " burnley played in new third kit which caught the eye at manchester united .   ryan giggs patrolled technical area instead of manager louis van gaal .   phil jones given little sympathy by clarets fans after limping off early on .   injury prevented sean dyche from naming unchanged line-up for 11th time .   daley blind forced off in one of two first-half substitutions for man utd .   marouane fellaini admits he does n't mind playing defensive .
