{"text": "in a dusty , run-down neighborhood on the outskirts of lucknow , the capital of one of india 's poorest and most conservative states , uttar pradesh , a vigilante group is making a name for itself . but these are no ordinary vigilantes . they 're girls -- mainly teenagers -- who patrol their local streets protecting women and girls from sexual harassment . in their matching black and red black salwar kameez -- the traditional garb worn by women across south asia -- they target offending males who have over-stepped the mark . the punishment ? humiliation , sometimes worse . their motivation is painfully clear . every single girl in the so-called  red brigade  has been a victim of sexual assault -- some have even been raped by their own family members , they say . in most cases , the crimes have gone unpunished and the victim left to suffer the trauma in silent shame . these girls have been forced to act , they say , because no one else will . opinion : rewiring of society 's attitude needed . cultural stigma . while sex crimes are not exclusive to india , the number of reported rapes there has increased dramatically , from 2,487 in 1971 to 24,206 in 2011 , according to official figures . but campaigners say this is the tip of the iceberg . most women in india -- a country where a cultural stigma keeps many victims from reporting the crime -- have stories of sexual harassment and abuse on public transportation or on the streets , according to the indian council on global relations . the issue appeared to reach a tipping point in india in december last year , when a 23-year-old woman was raped and fatally beaten by a group of men while traveling home on a public bus in delhi . the attack provoked outrage across the world and sparked nationwide demonstrations in india , as protesters called for tougher laws on sex crimes and a change in attitudes towards women . with global attention trained on india following the appalling case in the capital , the authorities acknowledged that action was needed . home minister sushilkumar shinde said india plans to recruit more female police officers -- currently only 7 % of the indian police force is female , according to government figures . the first fast-track court hearings have also been introduced to try to expedite cases in a justice system bogged down by red tape . it means sessions of the trial , once it begins , should take place nearly every working day until a verdict is reached . still , new cases continue to shock the nation , such as the 7-year-old girl who was raped in a train bathroom last weekend after she was lured away from her parents . opinion : death penalty not the solution . fightback on . the fight against sexual discrimination on the streets of lucknow preceded the international attention on sex crimes in india . the self-defense group was started several years ago by teacher usha vishwakarma , who discovered that an 11-year-old girl she taught in the modest school block opposite her family home had been raped by her uncle . not long after this revelation , vishwakarma found herself facing the unwanted attention of a colleague , who then tried to attack her . she managed to fight him off , but when she tried to report the incident , the local police were unimpressed . no one seemed to care .  this really upset me . it really affected me -- i would see any man in the street and would get upset and angry ,  vishwakarma , 26 , told cnn . she said people in her community thought she had gone mad . but still nothing happened to her attacker . eventually she learned that all of her students had experienced some form of abuse -- from lewd comments and cat-calls , to molestation and rape . many of the girls said they were afraid to go out alone for fear of being groped or worse . it was then that vishwakarma decided the girls had to protect themselves amid the deafening silence from within their own community . the  red brigade  was born -- the red in their uniform is to symbolize danger and struggle , while the black represents protest . in groups of four or five , the girls approach males deemed to be harassing a girl and order them to stop . if the perpetrator refuses to heed their warning , they punish him by mocking him publicly -- a significant slight in such a male-dominated society . vishwakarma admitted they have been forced to resort to violence on more than one occasion -- though she emphasized this does n't go beyond slapping .  the whole idea is to humiliate them ,  she said .  we are well within our rights -- this is self-defense . the police are not supportive so we have to defend ourselves .  martial means . and defend themselves they can , if their regular martial arts classes are anything to go he drills them in several techniques , from punching and kicking , to breaking the hold of an attacker approaching from behind . a faded picture of martial arts legend bruce lee gazes down approvingly , as each of the girls attacks the instructor 's padding with intense focus and conviction . they have plenty to be angry about . gyan , their instructor , explained that he 's teaching the girls for free .  i 'm doing it for my own daughter ,  he said .  these girls are brave and what they are doing is humbling .  the session ended with the girls lining up and bowing respectfully at their instructor . they have clearly learned how to channel their anger -- an asset on the unforgiving streets outside . but it 's not just kung fu training the girls receive -- the group provides a lot of support on gender issues , sexuality and health . it even helps younger children to attend school . protest . hours later , the girls were joined by several other supporters for a protest on the side of a busy highway in the center of lucknow . led by vishwakarma , the girls held placards in english and hindi demanding safety for women and chanted for stricter punishment for sex offenders . the scale of their task is perfectly illustrated by this small band of determined girls fighting against the tidal wave of lucknow 's late afternoon traffic . some commuters clinging from buses look quizzically at the small protest , while others ignore the scene completely . asked whether they are dealing with a deep-rooted cultural problem , vishwakarma 's 16-year-old sister , lakshmi , shook her head emphatically .  this is not a cultural problem -- it 's a social problem because men have a higher social status than girls .  the roadside protest may only have attracted a small number of people , but for vishwakarma , the red brigade is making a difference .  those who were voiceless before -- the girls -- now have a voice . now they speak for themselves and are emboldened ,  she said . with two daughters campaigning against a hugely divisive issue in india , vishwakarma 's mother admitted she had reservations about what they were getting into .  i was scared initially -- i asked ` why is she was doing this ? ' there was also a lot of pressure from within the neighborhood that she should not be doing what she was . because she would hold meetings late at night , people would say ` your daughter is not coming back home until late at night , which is not good . '  then someone said to me ` let her to what she wants to do . ' i now feel what they are doing is good and helping to bring a lot of change -- many boys who used to harass girls no longer do so because they are scared .  asked where she gets her courage from , vishwakarma replied simply :  when you suffer , you get that courage . when you are victimized , you get that courage . ", "summary": " the red brigade is a group of young girls fighting against sexual abuse .   many sex crimes against women go unreported in india due to cultural stigma .   rape of a young girl on a public bus in delhi in december provoked outrage .   many feel women 's issues , including sexual abuse , are not taken seriously .
