' obara is now serving life imprisonment . for what happened to lucie , as well as the rape and murder of australian . nightclub hostess carita ridgway , who died in tokyo in 1992 , and a . string of rapes on other women . mr blackman added he felt ` let down ' by the japanese court system , where verdicts are determined by three judges rather than a jury . he . said : ` it is simply not geared up to deal with a case and trial of the . nature of lucie 's . they depend so heavily on confessionals over there . ' i . ca n't imagine if it had been in a british court and such evidence had . been presented to a jury of 12 people they would have originally . directed there was no case to answer . ` the japanese police were very slow and needed a push to get going but it is the court system that let us down really . ' lucie 's father tim blackman -lrb- left -rrb- and sister sophie listened as the coroner recorded an open verdict today . japanese police believe obara , who filmed sex attacks on his drugged victims , could be responsible for up to 900 rapes . lucie 's sister sophie , who was 19 when she died , said today 's verdict made no difference as ` lucie 's still gone . ' she said : ` today is just a formality for us , the last thing . it 's over in a way , but it will never be closure for us . we still have to live with what happened . ' i think lucie 's death just reinforces how tragic it is that a 21-year-old girl can go on holiday with her best friend and end up murdered and here we are 13 years later in a dingy coroners court . ` the value of life is so important but it 's family and friends that are left behind who end up living with the sadness of it all .  if it was n't for lucie , a man who had 900 videos of him raping women and killed an australian girl could still be out there . ` lucie 's death brought those cases into the public domain and put this serial rapist in prison for the rest of his life . ' recalling the last time she saw her older sister , sophie , now 33 , said : ` it was the night before she flew to japan . i remember that night i slept with her in her bed . joji obara -lrb- left -rrb- is serving life imprisonment for the abduction of lucie -lrb- right -rrb- and dismembering and disposing of her body . he has also been convicted of the murder of australian carita ridgeway . ` it was such a long time ago . but life goes on , we have to move forward and just cope with things as best we can . ' she said the hardest times were family occasions , christmas and lucie 's birthday . on september 1 this year she would have turned 35 . her dad tim added : ` the thing i find hardest is the life we would have had with lucie . ` many of her friends are now married and have children . having her future taken away from us and not being able to share it with her is what is most difficult to deal with . ' earlier the inquest heard several post mortems were performed in japan and the uk which revealed traces of sedatives and the ` date-rape ' drug rohypnol were found in her body . an unidentified black substance was also found in her mouth . coroner dr roy palmer said : ` it 's been an awful long time i know . i think it is the longest case that i can think of without being concluded . even now we do n't have all the answers we 'd like . ' sophie blackman , pictured with her sister , said the family will never have ` closure ' over her death . croydon coroners ' court coroner dr roy palmer recorded an open verdict and admitted the family were not given ` answers that would in any way satisfy you ' he told lucie 's family : ` i 'm so very , very sorry you lost lucie in such sad circumstances and that no one 's been able to give the answers that would in any way satisfy you . ' the inquest heard former british airways air hostess lucie had only been in japan with her friend louise phillips , also 21 , two months before she went missing on july 1 , 2000 . that night she had been working at the casablanca hostess club and is believed to have gone back to obara 's apartment . when she failed to return the next day her friend reported her missing . lucie 's parents made several visits to japan and spent thousands of pounds trying to find her . but her remains were found on a beach 60miles from tokyo , near obara 's apartment , in february 2001 . she was identified by dna but the coroner said without a cause of death he must record an open verdict . lucie 's family have since set up the lucie blackman trust to help other families cope with the deaths of their relatives abroad and provide assistance to them .", "summary": " inquest into lucie blackman 's death in japan recorded open verdict .   her body was found buried in a seaside cave after she disappeared in 2000 .   her father tim said family had been ` let down ' by japanese court system .   businessman joji obara , 61 , serving life imprisonment for string of rapes .   also found guilty of murder of australian tourist and abducting lucie and dismembering and disposing of her body .   lucie 's family say they were robbed of a life with the former air hostess .
