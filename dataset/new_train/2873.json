{"text": "tony dorsett recalls a 1984 game against the philadelphia eagles when he was streaking up the field and an opposing player slammed into him . one helmet plowed into another . dorsett 's head snapped back , his helmet was knocked askew .  he blew me up ,  dorsett told cnn 's wolf blitzer .  i do n't remember the second half of that game , but i do remember that hit .  dorsett compared the hit to a freight train hitting a volkswagen . these days dorsett is worried about the cumulative effects of hits like the one ray ellis laid on him that day . in the past two years , dorsett 's memory has given him increasing trouble . on monday , doctors at ucla told dorsett , 59 , he has chronic traumatic encephalopathy , or cte , the hall of famer said . cte is a progressive degenerative brain disease found in some athletes with a history of repetitive brain trauma . the only way to definitely diagnose cte is after death , by analyzing brain tissue and finding microscopic clumps of an abnormal protein called tau , which has been found in the brains of dozens of former nfl players . opinion : why i 'm saying goodbye to football . however , a pilot study at ucla may have found tau in the brains of living retired players . some scientists say finding the disease in the brains of living players is the  holy grail  of cte research , providing a means to diagnose and treat it , and the ucla study may be an important first step . using a scan called a positron emission tomography , or pet , typically used to measure nascent alzheimer 's disease , researchers inject the players with a radioactive marker that travels through the body , crosses the blood-brain barrier and latches on to tau . then , the players ' brains are scanned .  we found -lrb- the tau -rrb- in their brains . it lit up ,  dr. gary small , professor of psychiatry at the semel institute for neuroscience and human behavior at ucla and lead author of the study , said in february . dr. joseph maroon , a neurosurgeon who works with the pittsburgh steelers , cautioned thursday that the cte diagnoses of dorsett -lrb- and two other living former players -rrb- need further study .  this is very , very preliminary ,  he told sportsradio 93-7 the fan in pittsburgh .  there are many , many causes of dementia or progressive memory loss , particularly when you get over 60 or 70 years of age . ... it 's something to obviously be concerned about , and the question is what can be done about it ?  dorsett said the diagnosis explains a lot about his forgetting where he is driving and his mood swings .  memory loss , more so than anything it 's been my big deal ,  he said .  sometimes you can have sensitivity to light and things like that . but my thing was not remembering . i 've been taking my daughters to practice for years and all of a sudden i forget how to get there .  his daughters are afraid , he said . they wonder which father they will get . will he be the happy dad or the one in a bad mood . for others known to have had cte , symptoms include depression , aggression and disorientation . in 2002 , mike webster , a hall of fame center for the pittsburgh steelers , was the first former nfl player to be diagnosed with cte . after his retirement , webster suffered from amnesia , dementia , depression and bone and muscle pain . what you need to know about concussions in the nfl . unlike webster , who spent his career smashing into opposition linemen many times a game and in practice , dorsett was a superfast running back who made his enemies miss by darting past them or with a quick spin to avoid contact . he won the heisman trophy as college football 's best player in 1976 and became an instant nfl star on the league 's most popular team , the dallas cowboys . he played 11 seasons and gained 12,739 yards , eighth best of all time . his 99-yard run in 1982 is an nfl record . he was inducted into the pro football hall of fame in 1994 . now he looks in a mirror and wonders .  and i say who are you ? what are you becoming ?  he said .  it 's very frustrating to be a person that 's been so outgoing , then all of a sudden , i 'm like a couch potato .  other athletes have demonstrated erratic behavior , such as pittsburgh steelers offensive lineman justin strzelczyk , 36 , who died in a 2004 high-speed chase . cincinnati bengals wide receiver chris henry died at age 26 after falling from the bed of a moving pickup during a fight with his fiancÃ © e. opinion : nfl takes good first step to protect players . some who showed signs of the disease have taken their own lives , including former philadelphia eagles defensive back andre waters , who shot himself in 2006 ; terry long , a former pittsburgh steelers offensive lineman who killed himself by drinking antifreeze ; and junior seau , the former linebacker who killed himself last year at the age of 43 . dorsett said that wo n't happen to him .  i 'm going to beat this . trust me ,  he said . dorsett pins much of the blame for his health issues on team owners . he said a $ 765 million settlement of a concussion lawsuit with the nfl was not enough .  i ca n't put a price on my health . the owners knew -lrb- about the dangers of concussions -rrb- for years and they looked the other way , and they kept putting us players in harm 's way .  the deal calls for the nfl to pay for medical exams , concussion-related compensation , medical research for retired nfl players and their families , and litigation expenses , according to a court document filed in u.s. district court in philadelphia . the agreement still needs to be approved by the judge assigned to the case , which involved more than 4,500 plaintiffs . nfl concussion settlement raises questions .", "summary": " tony dorsett was a finesse running back who for 11 years often made opponents miss .   at 59 he has been told he has a brain disease usually diagnosed in dead players .   one neurosurgeon said there are different causes for memory loss , so more study is needed .   dorsett says he is becoming a less outgoing person who has trouble remembering directions .
