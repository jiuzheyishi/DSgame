{"text": "a distance that is about a third of the radius of mercury 's orbit around the sun . the fact that m-dwarf systems vastly outnumber other kinds of systems carries a profound implication , according to professor johnson , which is that our solar system is something of a cosmic ` weirdo ' . but although the planets in m-dwarf systems orbit close to their stars , it does not necessarily mean that they 're fiery , hellish worlds unsuitable for life , the astronomers say . indeed , because m dwarfs are small and cool , their temperate zone -- also known as the ` habitable zone , ' the region where liquid water might exist -- is also further inward . even though only the outermost of kepler-32 's five planets lies in its temperate zone , many other m dwarf systems have more planets that sit right in their temperate zones . the implications of a galaxy chock full of planets are far-reaching , the researchers say . ` it 's really fundamental from an origins standpoint , ' said mr swift , who noted that because m dwarfs shine mainly in infrared light , the stars are invisible to the naked eye . ` kepler has enabled us to look up at the sky and know that there are more planets out there than stars we can see .
