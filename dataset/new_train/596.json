' the majority also noted that congress in 1984 changed the definition of a minor in child pornography to anyone under 18 because it found ` the previous ceiling of 16 had hampered enforcement of child pornography laws since , with the 16-year-old ceiling , there was sometimes confusion about whether a subject was a minor since children enter puberty at different ages . ' ruling : the jury ruled that since the 17-year-old was still a minor at the time , the photos were pornographic -lrb- stock photo -rrb- . the two dissenting justices said that because the photos do n't show an illegal act , they should n't be illegal . ` there was nothing unlawful about the production of the photographs taken by defendant in this case because the sexual conduct between defendant and -lrb- the girl -rrb- was entirely legal , ' wrote justice anne burke , who was joined by justice charles freeman . ` the photographs are therefore not child pornography as defined by the u.s. supreme court for purposes of the first amendment .
