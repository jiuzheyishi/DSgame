' i knew richard thompson was in form and for me to make him dip i knew that we must have gone fast . ` before the start i knew there was good conditions , much more cooler than it was for my heats , and i thought :  anything is possible here . just try and win the race .  and the time came . ' i came second to richard thompson and he 's a world class athlete . ' i did have a feeling this was coming . my group has been training well and we are all on form . i knew what type of shape i was in when i ran 10.17 in loughborough three weeks ago . ` i 'm still in shock , it has n't sunk in . soon i think it will sink in . ` i 've been getting lots of messages from family and friends and seen it all on twitter , it makes me happy . ' i just want to take one step at a time . there is still more work to do . ' pedigree : olympic triple jump champion greg rutherford also trains at lee valley with ujah .", "summary": " ujah ran 9.96 secs to finish second behind trinidadian richard thompson .   the 20-year-old took 21 hundreths of a second off his lifetime best .   the european junior champion is only the fifth british athlete under 10secs .   will face james dasaolu , adam gemili , dwain chambers and richard kilty at the british championships in birmingham this month .   he is unlikely to make england 's commonwealth games squad , however .
