{"text": "pressure is growing on george osborne , chancellor of the exchequer , to deliver a tax break for married couples . at least three cabinet ministers are backing demands for david cameron to deliver a tax break for married couples within months . allies of iain duncan smith , owen paterson and chris grayling indicated yesterday that they want the long-promised measure -- worth # 150 a year -- to be introduced in the budget in spring 2013 . they spoke out as 15 mps , including several ex-ministers , yesterday called in an open letter to mr cameron for the change to be introduced to parliament as part of next year 's finance bill . the intervention piles pressure on chancellor george osborne to placate social conservatives who are already enraged that he and mr cameron have made public statements in support of gay marriage , rather than recognising traditional marriage in the tax system . mr cameron has promised to introduce a transferable tax allowance for married couples in this parliament and treasury officials said yesterday that is still the government 's intention . but tory right-wingers are concerned that the measure , which is opposed by the liberal democrats , will be left until the final budget before the 2015 election . work and pensions secretary mr duncan smith has privately indicated that this is unacceptable to him because it would mean taxpayers would not see the benefit before the election -- due around may -- allowing an incoming labour government to easily reverse it . he also believes the measure would be dismissed as ` tokenism ' if it was left until the dying days of the coalition to be implemented . a friend of mr paterson , the environment secretary , said : ` he agrees with iain on this . ' and a source close to mr grayling , the justice secretary , said : ` chris believes it 's an important commitment for us to deliver . ' the mps backing the letter include former children 's minister tim loughton , former defence minister sir gerald howarth and nick de bois , secretary of the 1922 committee of back-bench mps . the letter comes at a time of deep divisions in the tory party over social policy . mr osborne provoked a backlash earlier this week when he claimed the conservatives have to back gay marriage if they want to win the election . he urged the party to emulate barack obama 's socially liberal policies to win over young voters and women , who were credited with ensuring he retained the white house . allies of iain duncan smith , owen paterson and chris grayling indicated yesterday that they want the long-promised measure worth # 150 a year . conservative secretary of state for justice chris grayling -lrb- centre -rrb- , the former minister of state for work and pensions , has , according to allies , indicated he wants the long-promised marriage tax break . and yesterday the boss of one of britain 's biggest polling companies accused downing street of misrepresenting its results of a survey on gay marriage . mr cameron said in a letter to former welsh secretary cheryl gillan , who opposes gay marriage , that a comres poll found 10 per cent of current conservative voters said the policy would make them less likely to vote conservative compared with 7 per cent saying it would make them more likely . but comres boss andrew hawkins said yesterday mr cameron had got his figures wrong . he added that the policy ` loses the party more votes than it gains ' , with ` former conservative voters less likely to return to the fold ' . other comres polls showed it had a ` general detrimental impact on the party 's fortunes ' , he added . proposals for gay marriage and the marriage tax break are expected to be introduced some time after the next queen 's speech and before the general election . a senior treasure source said : ` we are committed to recognise marriage in the tax system . '", "summary": " a group of 15 senior conservative mps call on the pm to live up to his pre-election pledge .   a stay-at-home spouse would be able to transfer their tax-free allowance to their partner .   the coalition agreement committed to bringing the policy forward - with lib dems allowed to abstain .
