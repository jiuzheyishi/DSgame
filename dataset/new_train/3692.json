{"text": "angry shoppers have demanded people boycott a fashion brand , claiming its logo bears a striking resemblance to the nazi eagle insignia which became the national symbol of adolf hitler 's third reich . a-list celebrities including singers rhianna and jessie j and model cara delevingne , have been spotted wearing the uk-based boy london brand in the past . the brand 's logo depicts a spread-winged eagle perched on a podium on top of the letter ` o ' in the world ` boy ' , which is written underneath . outraged customers have called for the company to take action after drawing comparisons with the infamous nazi parteiadler symbol . the fashion brand boy london is coming under increased pressure to redesign its logo after angry shoppers drew comparisons between it and a symbol used by adolf hitler 's nazi party . the parteiadler emblem was made germany 's national symbol under hitler 's nazi party in 1935 . the image was used as the emblem for hitler 's party . the eagle is facing the same way as in the boy london logo , but carrying a swastika in its claws , instead of the ` o ' . department store , fenwick , have now withdrawn the brand from its position at the entrance to their store in brent cross shopping centre in north-west london . a spokeswoman for the store said : ` our boy london line is no longer on the shop floor as we investigate the matter directly with the brand . ' but unisex t-shirts featuring the eagle emblem were still on sale for # 35 at selfridges in the bull ring in birmingham today . disgusted shoppers yesterday called for the brand to removed from all shops . one customer , polish-born jakub mozdzanowski , 34 , said : ' i saw the logo on a t-shirt a few weeks ago and it was n't a good feeling . then i saw it on someone else a week later and i even went over to speak to them . dictator adolf hitler is seen pictured in front of his nazi party 's emblem the parteiadler -lrb- left -rrb- . and -lrb- right -rrb- the symbol is seen on the label of a 1943 bottle of unopened red fuhrerwein wine . ' i showed them the nazi symbol on the internet and they were shocked . ' i do n't get offended easily but it was like a slap in the face . i showed it to my girlfriend and she said she did n't like looking at it . ` it 's quite embroidered on polish people 's minds , it gives you the creeps . ` i 'm polish so it 's quite close to home . i 've heard stories from my grandparents about the war and about when we were invaded . ` the logo should be taken off . i would think if the logo went then the company would go with it . ` it is wrong that people wear it , i would call on people not to wear that logo . ' despite the controversy , boy london has refused to accept any comparison between its trademark logo and the fascist third reich 's parteiadler symbol . a spokesman said : ` the brand is in no way connected to nazism or the idea of anyone being discriminated against for their creed , colour or religious beliefs . ' a white boy london t-shirt -lrb- pictured -rrb- cost # 35 from selfridges in the bull ring , birmingham . he explained that the logo ` was inspired by the eagle of the roman empire as a sign of decadence and strength . its aim is to empower people rather than oppress ' . boy london was founded by israel-based businessman john krivine in the 1970s and his original boutique in chelsea , london , sold outrageous items - including t-shirts with dried animal blood and jewellery made from hypodermic syringes , which were modelled by the original punks . mr krivine , who sold the punk-inspired company in 1984 , said : ' i do n't know what kind of eagle it was - roman legion , american indian , continental congress , third reich - it looked cool . ' nazi imagery had been a feature of the late 70s punk 's rebellion and mr krivine 's competitor , jewish punk entrepreneur malcolm mclaren , sold swastika t-shirts to trade on the symbol 's shock value . in 2007 , high-street chain zara was forced to withdraw stocks of handbags because they were emblazoned with swastikas . zara said the bag came from an external supplier and the symbol had not been visible when it was selected . the nazi party emblem was inspired by an historic symbol used in germany , the reichsadler . the reichsadler was derived from the roman eagle standard used by the holy roman emperors . at the time the eagle was the insignia of the imperial power as distinguished from the imperial states . the eagle began to appear in the 9th century on the banner of charlemagne and his successors . since then the majestic bird has been used to symbolise the habsburg monarchy as well as the austrian empire . the nazi party emblem from the admiral graf spee is raised from the seabed . the logo became the national symbol in hitler 's germany in 1935 . during the 1848 revolutions in germany , attempts were made to re-implement the reichsadler as a symbole of unity . in 1871 a single-headed eagle became the insignia of otto von bismarck 's lesser german solution , which sought to unify the northern german states , leaving out austria . in contrast the greater german solution favoured unifying all german-speaking peoples under ones state and was promoted by the austrian empire . after the first world war the weimar republic under president friedrich ebert assumed a plain version of the reichsadler , which stayed in use until 1935 . it was then that adolf hitler introduced his own stylised eagle combining the bird with the nazi swastika to create a new national emblem . hitler introduced both his own version of the reichsadler , in which the eagle is looking towards its right shoulder , and another version the nazi party 's parteiadler -lrb- the party 's eagle -rrb- , where the eagle looks to its left . at the conclusion of the second world war and with the defeat of the nazis , the federal republic of germany re-introduced the eagle used by the weimar republic under the direction of president theodor heuss in 1950 .", "summary": " boy london brand has been criticised for its eagle design logo .   emblem bears striking resemblance to the insignia used by hitler 's nazis .   shoppers have called for the logo to be withdrawn , branding it ` offensive ' "}
