{"text": "a little girl with down 's syndrome has learnt to walk , talk and even dance - all through copying her big sister . two-year-old ellie harrington , from ely , cambridgeshire , has started walking early in order to keep up with four-year-old sister evie . their parents , lisa moden , 42 and mark harrington , 43 , say it 's the desire to be like her sister that has helped ellie to develop so quickly . ellie harrington , 2 , has learnt to walk , talk and even dance through copying her four-year-old sister evie . the pair play together 24/7 and love dressing up as princesses , their mother said . ` evie 's relationship with ellie is very special , very close ' it is known that children with down 's syndrome are visual learners , so being able to copy evie has helped ellie 's development . ms moden said : ' i believe the main reason ellie began walking early was because she desperately wanted to keep up with evie . ` ellie 's muscle tone was very good , so she had a good head start with being able to follow her sister . ` children with down 's syndrome are visual learners , so its great for ellie to have a 24/7 playmate . ` the girls are inseparable , if evie put on a princess dress on from her fancy dress box then ellie will copy . ` they just love playing with each other , they are a little double act . ` evie told me that when she grows up she wants to live with ellie forever . it melted my heart . ' children with down 's syndrome usually learn and progress more slowly than most other children , although the level of learning disability will be different for each child . it is known that children with down 's syndrome are visual learners , and so copying a sibling can help their development . ms moden says she could n't be happier with the progress ellie is making at such a young age . she said : ` evie is constantly talking to her little sister so it 's no surprise that at just two-years-old she 's already pronouncing certain words . their mother , lisa moden , said : ' i believe the main reason ellie began walking early was because she desperately wanted to keep up with evie . their mother added : ` evie adores her little sister and it 's a relief to see them both learning new things together ' down 's syndrome is a genetic condition that causes some level of learning disability and a characteristic range of physical features . most babies with down 's syndrome are diagnosed shortly after birth and are likely to have reduced muscle tone , eyes that slant upwards , a low birth weight , a small nose and mouth and short fingers . they also have some degree of learning disability but this varies widely between children . some children with down 's syndrome also have associated health problems such as heart disorders , digestive problems , hearing and visual impairments , thyroid dysfunction and blood disorders . it is one of the most common genetic causes of learning disability and around 750 babies are born with the condition each year in the uk . it is caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21 in the baby 's cells . currently , no one knows what causes the presence of the extra chromosome but down 's syndrome is more common in children born to older mothers . for example , if a woman has a baby when she is 25 there is a one in 1,250 chance of her baby having down 's syndrome , but if a 45-year-old woman has a baby , there is a one in 30 chance of it having down 's syndrome . source : nhs choices . ` children with down 's syndrome generally experience some intellectual and physical delays but so far ellie has been developing really well . ` evie adores her little sister and it 's such a relief to see them both learning new things together . ` if evie starts dancing then her little sister will join in too , it 's so funny to watch them together . ` they do get themselves into mischief though , i often find them both on the table or windowsills . ' she was first told that ellie could have down 's syndrome when she was pregnant , after a blood test came back abnormal . she said : ' i was devastated with there being a one in five chance of her having the condition , but 80 per cent chance everything would be ok , so we just hoped for the best . ' i gave birth to ellie at home and i knew as soon as i looked at her that she had it . ' i was horrified , i did n't know what to do , i could n't see past her down 's syndrome . ` it makes me feel awful thinking back to all of those raw emotions but i was completely shocked . ' two weeks after being born , ellie was officially diagnosed . but instead of dwelling on the condition , ms moden 's family rallied round to support her through it . lisa said : ` it did n't take long for me to see past the diagnosis , ellie 's did n't seem to have poor muscle tone , she was lucky with very good health and went from strength to strength . ` evie loved her little sister from the moment she saw her , she was no different in her eyes . ` it 's refreshing to see and it 's nice to think she 'll always have a friend looking out for her when she starts school . ' as they girls have grown older , they spend more and more time together . ms moden said : ` the girls love playing together 24/7 . their parents say ellie learned to walk early because she wanted to keep up with her big sister . ` if they are n't climbing up our furniture they are playing hide and seek . ` both of them love dressing up as princesses too , they have a lovely fancy dress box which they 're always playing in . ` we 've only told evie that her sister is ` special ' the same as any sibling , but that she need may need extra help learning things but with the pace ellie picks things up she 's barely behind . ' ellie now goes to nursery two days a week where she enjoys playing with new friends . ms moden said : ' i was so terrified when i realised ellie has down 's syndrome but she is amazing . ' i would n't change her for the world , i 'm so proud of both my girls . ' the family have been supported by small steps - a support group for children with down 's syndrome . alison watson , founder of the group , said : ` when my freya , now six , was born with down 's syndrome , i set up small steps as i felt it was important to have a support network for parents such as myself . ` lisa bought ellie and evie to small steps to learn sign language , play , explore and have fun among people who understand and can support any worries or concerns having a child with down 's syndrome can bring . ` evie 's relationship with ellie is very special , very close . ` ellie learns so much from evie and children with down syndrome are generally very visual learners . ` we want people to know that having ds is certainly not the end of the world . ` it 's all about taking small steps , and enjoying every one of them .
