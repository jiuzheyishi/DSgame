{"text": "the senate blocked a measure tuesday that would have authorized construction of the keystone xl pipeline as democrats chose their pro-environment base over an old friend -- embattled louisiana sen. mary landrieu . the vote could just be a speedbump for the keystone project , with republicans ready to try again -- with much better odds of success -- once they take control of the senate in january .  this will be an early item on the agenda in the next congress ,  incoming senate majority leader mitch mcconnell , r-kentucky , said after tuesday night 's vote . but it 's a sharp blow to landrieu , who had based much of her campaign for re-election in a december runoff on the argument that she could deliver results . for days she had insisted that she had the 60 supporters necessary to cross a key procedural threshold , only to fall one vote shy on tuesday night .  this is for americans , for american jobs , to build an american middle class , and it will create 40,000 immediate jobs ,  landrieu said on the senate floor ahead of the vote .  if the people of this congress have n't noticed , there 's a long unemployment line in some parts of this country .  the vote served as a preview of the confrontations that lie ahead in washington . president barack obama is on track to overhaul immigration rules on his own by the end of the year -- a move that is pushing some conservatives to consider shutting down the government in retaliation . and as soon as the new republican congress is sworn in next year , keystone will be back on the agenda , along with efforts to curtail obamacare , raising the prospect of obama issuing a series of vetoes . but for all the battles that lie ahead , tuesday 's vote was really about local politics . louisiana 's senate race is headed for a dec. 6 runoff election , and landrieu -- currently the senate energy and natural resources chairwoman -- saw the pipeline as a final chance to demonstrate her clout to voters in an energy-rich state . republicans responded by guaranteeing her opponent , rep. bill cassidy , a seat on the energy committee . the house gop also had him sponsor their own keystone authorization bill , which was approved friday on a 252-161 vote . cassidy rubbed salt in landrieu 's wound tuesday , with his spokesman saying the vote was  perfect snapshot of her time as chair of the energy committee -- a failure .  right now , the decision on whether to approve the canada-to-texas pipeline is in the hands of the state department . obama has said repeatedly in recent days that he wants congress to stay out of it and leave it to state to finish its review of -- among other factors -- whether the pipeline would contribute to carbon pollution the could cause climate change .  there is a process underway and the president is confident that that process will carefully evaluate the consequences of this specific proposal and that that 's the proper way for a decision like this to be made ,  white house press secretary josh earnest said tuesday . six years into that review , though , lawmakers have grown impatient .  this process has not worked . this process has not brought this project some sort of finality -- yes or no ?  north dakota sen. heidi heitkamp , one of the pipeline 's most outspoken democratic supporters , said on the senate floor tuesday . liberal senate democrats like california 's barbara boxer railed against the pipeline tuesday , arguing that the environmental harm it could cause far outweighs the potential economic gains . boxer pointed to potential health risks of laying the pipeline , including heart disease , increased hospitalization , and a higher prevalence of chemicals that  penetrate deeply into the lungs .   the facts are the facts are the facts ,  she said .  if you 're not a scientist then be humble and listen to the peer-reviewed scientists . they do n't have a special interest . they have an interest in giving us information we should base our decisions upon .  boxer also referred to the project as the  keystone extra lethal pipeline .  the keystone debate on tuesday pitted traditional democratic allies against each other . many of the democratic no votes were longtime friends and supporters of landrieu who had contributed tens of thousands to her campaign . democratic sens. dianne feinstein of california , chris coons of delaware and amy klobuchar of minnesota all contributed $ 7,000 or more to her campaign , and all opposed passage of the bill . in the lead-up to tuesday night 's vote , the big question was whether landrieu could find the 60 supporters necessary to clear a key procedural threshold . in addition to the chamber 's 45 republicans , all of whom were expected to support the bill , landrieu was joined by 10 more democratic co-sponsors : alaska sen. mark begich , arkansas sen. mark pryor , indiana sen. joe donnelly , missouri sen. claire mccaskill , montana sen. jon tester , montana sen. john walsh , north carolina sen. kay hagan , north dakota sen. heidi heitkamp , virginia sen. mark warner and west virginia sen. joe manchin . three more democrats had pledged last week to support the measure : colorado sen. michael bennet , delaware sen. tom carper and pennsylvania sen. bob casey . that left her one vote short -- and her options looked limited . west virginia democratic sen. jay rockefeller said monday night that he was a no vote . maine sen. angus king , an independent who caucuses with the democrats , said tuesday that he would n't support it .  congress is not -- nor should it be -- in the business of legislating the approval or disapproval of a construction project ,  king said in a statement . after the vote , five anti-keystone protestors in the senate gallery interrupted with chants and cheers . they were removed by police -- and the senate moved on without a speech that had been expected from landrieu .", "summary": " senate blocks keystone bill .   vote previews battle that lies ahead between congress , obama .   landrieu : ` this is for americans , for american jobs ' "}
