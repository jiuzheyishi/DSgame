{"text": "monkeys and apes use loud calls and gestures to make their feelings known but until now , the exact meaning for individual movements has remained a mystery . now , researchers believe they have translated the key gestures used in the chimp community and deciphered their intentions , for the first time . from 4,351 gestures , experts were able to identify 66 that are used for 19 specific message meanings -- including showing a foot to tell a child they can climb on their back , to nibbling a leaf to signal intent to mate . scroll down for ` dictionary ' and video . researchers from scotland have translated the key gestures used by chimps . from 4,351 gestures , experts were able to identify 66 that were used for 19 specific message meanings , including hugging the air to ask for an embrace -lrb- stock image pictured -rrb- , and slapping objects together to ask another chimp to follow them . the researchers were able to narrow down these 66 gestures to 36 that are used intentionally to achieve 15 purposes , other than in play . the translations were made by dr catherine hobaiter and her colleagues at st andrews university in scotland . observations were made on chimpanzees within the sonso community in the budongo region of the rainforest , in uganda . during three field periods between october 2007 and august 2009 , dr hobaiter used focal behaviour sampling and filmed all recorded cases of gestural communication using a sony handycam . other gestures include stomping their feet to ask another chimp to stop what they are doing , and slapping objects together to ask another to follow them . of the 19 meanings , 17 encouraged interactions to start , such as ` groom me ' , or to develop , such as ` move closer , ' and ` change play ' . recordings taken from 2007 to 2009 in uganda found that nibbling on a leaf -lrb- stock image pictured -rrb- signals intent that a chimp is ready to mate . some of the gestures were found to have more than one meaning , and only 10 of the 66 gestures were used for only a single meaning , and of these , seven were recorded on three or fewer occasions . ` we can finally say for the first time that another animal communication has meaning ; not just information and not just complicated communication , but meaningful communication , ' dr hobaiter told bbc news . ` -lsb- recent -rsb- findings about great ape . gestures spurred interest in a potential common ancestral origin with . components of human language . ` of . particular interest , given the relevance to language origins , is the . question of what chimpanzees intend their gestures to mean ; . surprisingly , the matter of what the intentional signals are used to . achieve has been largely neglected . ` here we present the first systematic study of meaning in chimpanzee gestural communication . ' the research is published in the journal current biology . in . a separate study , primatologists emilie genty and klaus zuberbühler . from switzerland 's university of neuchâtel wanted to translate a . specific gesture used by bonobos . they discovered that the gesture , which . involves stretching an arm towards another bonobo , sweeping it inwards , . then finishing with a wrist-twirl that turns a downward-facing palm . upwards , is used to initiate sex . the researchers were able to narrow down these 66 gestures to 36 that are used intentionally to achieve 15 purposes , other than in play . for example , when a mother shows their chimp the bottom of their foot -lrb- stock image pictured -rrb- , it tells the child they are allowed to climb on their parent 's back . in a separate study , primatologists from switzerland 's university of neuchâtel wanted to translate a specific gesture used by bonobos . stretching an arm towards another bonobo , sweeping it inwards , then finishing with a wrist-twirl that turns a downward-facing palm upwards -lrb- pictured -rrb- is used to initiate sex . over 222 hours of observation time , the researchers collected a total of 471 video clips from two social groups of bonobos at a sanctuary near kinshasa , democratic republic of congo . they spotted 1,080 sexual solicitations , initiated by 18 males and 17 females . as well as identifying what the gesture means , they also discovered the technique needed to increase the chances of success . when the gestures resulted in sex , the initiator approached from a distance of around 3ft -lrb- 1 metre -rrb- with their back in a concave position . success also depended on how many other bonobos were present , and if any others were seen as competition . over 222 hours of observation time , the researchers collected a total of 471 video clips from two social groups of bonobos in kinshasa , democratic republic of congo . they spotted 1,080 sexual solicitations , initiated by 18 males and 17 females . this flow chart shows the success to failure rate . ` human children use gestures to communicate before they produce their first words , and their earliest gestures are deictic and typically emerge around 10 months of age , ' explained the researchers . ` iconic gestures therefore seem to be cognitively more demanding than deictic gestures or other conventionalized signals . ` in great apes , there is good evidence that language-trained individuals are capable of acquiring and understanding both deictic and iconic signals , but this is far less clear in their natural communication . ` although we can not claim with confidence that the beckoning gesture is produced with an understanding of its iconic nature , our findings are relevant in that they provide evidence that great apes can naturally use spatial reference as part of a communicative intention , with recipients responding to such signals appropriately . ` the ability to produce gestures that depict some spatial features of a desired action was therefore probably already present in the common ancestor of humans and apes . '", "summary": " researchers from scotland studied chimps in budongo forest in uganda .   they examined 4,531 gestures within 3,419 examples of communication .   this was used to identify 66 gestures for 19 specific message meanings .   mothers presenting their foot shows a child they can climb on their back .   while nibbling on a leaf signals intent that a chimp is available to mate .   in a second study , researchers from switzerland studied bonobo gestures .   they identified the human-like sweeping gesture used to initiate sex .   this .   includes stretching an arm towards a mate , sweeping it inwards , .   then finishing with a wrist-twirl that turns a downward-facing palm .   upwards .
