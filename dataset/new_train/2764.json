{"text": "apple has bought a 3-d-sensor company that helped build microsoft 's motion-control system kinect , stirring curiosity about what the tech giant might be up to behind closed doors in cupertino . primesense is an israel-based company that specializes in sensors that let users interact with mobile devices like tablets and smartphones by waving their hands . the company 's technology was used to help create kinect , rolled out for the xbox 360 in 2010 as a way for gamers to put down the controller and use their bodies and voices to play games . it 's been incorporated further into the new xbox one console , letting users control movies and other media with their voices . apple had reportedly been in talks with primesense since july . the deal was sealed for a reported $ 360 million . a statement released by apple in response to queries resulted in the same  non-confirmation confirmation  it has released after past acquisitions .  apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time , and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans ,  the statement says . primesense has confirmed the purchase but offered no further details . the purchase , of course , immediately spurred speculation about what apple might have in mind .  apple could be thinking a number of things , from gaming on ipads to a way to interact with apple tv or the rumored tv set ,  said carolina milanesi , a tech analyst with gartner research . she said she doubts apple is working on a dedicated gaming device . instead , she speculated , the company could be looking at a way to connect multiple devices and operate them at the same time .  gesture certainly has a place in complementing touch and voice as a way to interact with different devices ,  she said .  gesture could be particularly useful in interacting with different screens in the home .  the less exciting possibility is that we 'll never see a product or feature as a direct result of the buyout .  apple has done a series of acquisitions that we have not seen through as far as a practical implementation of the technology ,  milanesi said . but as the news spread monday , it was the possibility of the long-rumored apple tv set that many were thinking about . apple-centric blog 9to5 mac reported in september that apple was testing motion-sensor technology for television products . to some , the primesense purchase signals that apple is working on something truly different . the television has supposedly been in the works for years , and the company is widely expected to be rolling out a smartwatch in the not-too-distant future . but incremental upgrades to its popular iphone and ipad lines in recent years have led some observers to say the company has lost its knack for groundbreaking innovation . that 's a concept milanesi rejects .  to think that apple is not innovating just because we do not see a new category of product hitting the market is quite shortsighted ,  she said .", "summary": " apple buys 3-d motion-sensor company primesense .   purchase reportedly was for $ 360 million .   analyst says technology could be for an apple tv set or for gaming .   apple wo n't say what its plans for primesense are .
