{"text": "imagine this : in your hot little hands you hold a blueprint for a luxury hotel in one of the most idyllic -- and tiny -- locations in the world . there 's just one problem -- there 's no space to build the thing . the answer ? create a five-star yacht hotel . that 's exactly the thinking behind gibraltar 's new $ 200 million sunborn yacht hotel ; a permanently moored vessel which could spell the future of architecture in land scarce cities around the world .  in gibraltar there 's a huge demand for hotels , but how do you do it in such a small jurisdiction ?  sunborn gibraltar ceo , brian stevendale , told cnn .  unlike traditional building -- which involves trucks , cranes and a huge amount of disruption -- we have a ready built product that can be delivered to these prime areas .  ship-shape . the mammoth 142-meter superyacht will rest its anchor in gibraltar 's ocean village marina , located off the southern tip of spain , with plans to open its doors to the public by the end of this year . boasting 189 rooms , spa and gym , cocktail lounges , conference rooms , and even a ballroom , the luxury liner will be one of the grandest structures in the mediterranean . at seven storeys tall , the vessel will dwarf nearby yachts in the marina , with rooms expected to cost between $ 300 and $ 3,000 per night . plug in , tune out . the whopping boat , originally built in malaysia , will be attached to the dock via six superstrong hydraulic arms , each weighing eight tons . guests will enter through an enclosed glass bridge and stevendale says once on board  they will feel no different to being in a five-star hotel on land .   it 's intriguing that something so large can literally just be plugged in to a port ,  he added .  we will have enormous power cables safely secured underground .  small territory , big ambition . measuring just 6.8 square kilometres , the british territory of gibraltar is a small state packing a big punch . much like monaco or singapore , gibraltar is a sunny tourist destination with a thriving economy -- yet lacks the space for urban development . that 's where the sunborn yacht hotel comes in , with stevendale saying it could pave the way for similar vessels across the world -- and even be used at temporary events such as the world cup or olympics . coming to a city near you ? gibraltar follows the company 's first yacht hotel -- the  sunborn princess  -- which was moored at naantali spa resort in finland in 2002 . there are now plans to anchor similar floating hotels in london and barcelona . but with each contract usually spanning 10 years , stevendale says its unlikely the vessels will be doing much cruising once they 're in place . and if sunborn is on the right track , the most successful boats could be those which never even set sail .", "summary": " with land at a premium , property developers increasingly turn to floating hotels .   introducing gibraltar 's new $ 200 million sunborn yacht hotel .   five-star hotel a whopping seven storeys tall , boasting 189 rooms , luxury facilities .   follows similar yacht hotel in finland , with plans for vessels in london and barcelona .
