{"text": "while president-elect barack obama will certainly be making history when he takes the oath of office on january 20 , he 'll also be repeating it -- by placing his hand on the same bible that abraham lincoln used during the inauguration of 1861 . the 1861 lincoln inaugural bible against the backdrop of the main reading room of the library of congress . the constitution does not require presidents to be sworn in on a bible , though almost every chief executive since george washington has chosen to do so . presidents have differed greatly , however , on the question of which passage the bible should be opened to during the swearing-in ceremony . it brings up the question of what -- if any -- biblical passage obama will emphasize . if what is past is prologue , as shakespeare famously wrote -lrb- a quote now engraved in front of the national archives -rrb- , he might opt for the popular presidential theme of repentance . according to gleaves whitney , a presidential historian at michigan 's grand valley state university , ii chronicles 7:14 was used for three swearing-in ceremonies :  if my people , who are called by my name , will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways , then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land .  in this season of economic distress , however , the president-elect may prefer to follow the lead of franklin roosevelt . when fdr first took the oath of office in 1933 , the country was reeling under the crushing weight of the great depression .  only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment ,  roosevelt said in his inaugural address . urging his fellow americans to lend a helping hand , roosevelt had the bible opened to i corinthians 13 :  and now abideth faith , hope , charity , these three ; but the greatest of these is charity .  obama campaigned as someone who would strive to bridge the nation 's bitter partisan divide .  we have never been a collection of red states and blue states ,  obama said in his election night victory speech .  we are , and always will be , the united states of america .  if obama wants to stress that theme again on january 20 , he may prefer to follow bill clinton 's lead from the 1997 inaugural and open the bible to isaiah 58:12 :  thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations , and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach .  questions of war and peace are always in the back of any president 's mind . obama campaigned in part on a promise to end america 's war in iraq . shortly after winning the white house on a similar pledge to end another divisive conflict -- this one in vietnam -- richard nixon took the oath with a family bible opened to isaiah 2:4 :  and he shall judge among the nations , and shall rebuke many people : and they shall beat their swords into plowshares , and their spears into pruninghooks : nation shall not lift up sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more .  with the polls showing an overwhelming majority of americans convinced the country is on the wrong track , obama might hint at a back-to-basics message by doing what woodrow wilson did in 1913 . during his first inaugural , wilson opened the bible to psalm 119 , which concludes  i have gone astray like a lost sheep ; seek thy servant ; for i do not forget thy commandments .  speaking of a return to basics , what about america 's first president ? what did george washington do ? almost 220 years ago , in 1789 , washington opened the king james version of a masonic bible to genesis 49:13 --  zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea ; and he shall be for a haven of ships ; and his border shall be unto zidon .  was america 's first president trying to send a deep , profound message ? not exactly . it turns out that , for the nation 's first inaugural , the bible was hastily opened to a completely random page . the same thing was done 72 years later when lincoln was sworn in . cnn 's brendan polmer contributed to this report .", "summary": " barack obama will be sworn in using same bible as abraham lincoln .   lincoln 's bible was turned to a random page at his 1861 inauguration .   many presidents choose to open bible to a specific verse .
