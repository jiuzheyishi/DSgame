{"text": "they are an icon of the american west and a symbol of the country 's frontier history , but now hundreds of mustang horses face slaughter due to overpopulation . under existing laws the government pays ranchers to take in thousands of these ` wild ' horses a year in order to keep population numbers down . mustangs are not an indigenous species to america and are known to have an adverse affect on natural ecosystems . the current system of managing these threats has been in place since 1971 but now rising feed costs has resulted in a growing number of american ranchers refusing to take on mustangs . mustangs are regarded as a symbol of the frontier history of the american west . the government uses helicopters to trap mustangs and thin populations . campaigners say that helicopter herding is cruel and does not distinguish the fit horses from the old and young populations . pregnant mares and young foals are sometimes stampeded across miles and miles of rugged terrain , according to activists . officials have warned that the government 's own holding pastures and short-term corrals are themselves reaching over capacity . the result could mean that thousands of this treasured breed will be slaughtered in order to contain overpopulation . across ten western states in the us an estimated 37,000 wild horses and feral donkeys roam the ranges . officials say this is 11,000 more than the manageable population , and it is expected that figures will double every four years . there are around 50,000 wild horses and donkeys currently held in temporary pastures , three times the amount held a decade ago . despite the crisis in overpopulation , and the known effects of wild hoses on natural habitats of other native animals , activists continue to battle with the government over its management of mustangs in particular . to thin the populations of wild herds helicopters are used to chase mustangs into traps . some campaigners think this is cruel and damaging to a species they think america should be protecting . suzanne roy of the american wild horse preservation campaign said that pregnant mares and foals are stampeded by helicopters over miles of rugged terrain . ` helicopter 's are n't discerning , ' she said . ` they stampede the very old and the very young with the fit . ' authorities have been accused of managing mustangs into extinction . however , only 99 out of the 11,000 gathered from the plains last year died . that 's less than 1 % . officials are now beginning to recognise that slaughter might be the only solution to contain the population . government legislation has been criticised for favouring ranchers who prefer land to be freed of wild horses to make way for cattle . officials estimate that just under 50,000 wild horses are held in temporary pasture . there remains a controversy over whether the mustang can be considered an indigenous animal in north america . ms roy denies this and she questions the wisdom surrounding the belief that america 's land can not support mustang populations . she claims that the legislation is weighted heavily in favour of the ranchers who need the land freed up for cattle . the problem could be better addressed through contraceptive measures using fertility drugs . tom gorey , of the bureau of land management , denied that this would provide an adequate alternative . he said : ` logistically , -lsb- contraception -rsb- is very hard . it has not been demonstrated to be a magical solution . ' the us congress has recognised the mustang as ' a living symbol of the historic and pioneer spirit of the west . ' the first mustangs descended from iberian horses brought to mexico and florida from spain during the settlement of north america . most of these horses were of andalusian , arabian and barb ancestry and were domesticated animals tamed for human use . this has led to a dispute over whterh it is entirely accurate to call the mustang ` wild ' since it is the descendent of a domestic breed which is not native to the natural habitat . native americans quickly adopted the horse as a primary means of transportation . they were also used in battles , trade , and hunts , particularly bison hunts . some environmentalist claim that the mustang should be classed as indigenous because there is evidence that horses roamed north america in per-historic times . more than half of all mustangs in north america are found in nevada , with other significant populations in montana , wyoming and oregon . the government says that the total manageable population in the wild should be 26,000 a figure that is significantly lower than the reality . ` we are reaching a critical mass , ' tom gorey added . ` and we do n't see any instant solution .
