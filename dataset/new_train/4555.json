{"text": "around this time of year , you 're more likely to find college students in the library cramming for final exams than out partying . in an environment where the workload is endless and there 's always more to be done , a quick fix to help buckle down and power through becomes very tempting . prescription adhd medications like adderall , ritalin , and vyvanse are becoming increasingly popular for overworked and overscheduled college students -- who have n't been diagnosed with adhd .  our biggest concern ... is the increase we have observed in this behavior over the past decade ,  says sean mccabe , research associate professor at the university of michigan substance abuse research center . full-time college students were twice as likely to have used adderall non-medically as their counterparts who were not full-time students , according to a national survey on drug use and health report released in 2009 . the numbers vary significantly by school , with the greatest proportion of users at private and  elite  universities . some researchers estimate about 30 % of students use stimulants non-medically . more students think marijuana is ok .  when we look at upperclassmen , the number really begins to jump ,  says alan desantis , professor of communications at the university of kentucky who has conducted research on stimulant use in college .  the more time you stay on campus , the more likely you are to use .  of course , by and large the most common use is to concentrate while studying , with more than 90 % of users doing it for this purpose . adhd stimulants  strengthen the brain 's brakes , its inhibitory capacities , so it can control its power more effectively ,  said dr. edward hallowell , a psychiatrist and adhd expert .  they do this by increasing the amount of certain neurotransmitters , like dopamine , epinephrine , and norepinephrine .  students say they take these stimulants for the  right reasons ,  to be more productive in classes and to stay afloat in the sea of intense competition . in a 2008 study of 1,800 college students , 81 % of students interviewed -lrb- desantis 2008 -rrb- thought illicit use of adhd medication was  not dangerous at all  or  slightly dangerous .  while the picture of a methamphetamine user has hollowed cheeks , rotting teeth , and skin sores , an amphetamine-dextroamphetamine -lrb- adderall -rrb- user looks just like anybody else .  it helps me stay focused and be more efficient , which is very helpful with the chaos of college ,  says one university student who takes adderall anywhere from once a month to a few times a week , depending on her schedule and workload . students did not want to be identified because of their illegal use of the prescription drugs . yet these drugs are schedule ii substances , sitting pretty on the drug enforcement administration 's list right next to cocaine , meth and morphine .  college students tend to underestimate the potential harms associated with the nonmedical use of prescription stimulants ,  mccabe says . students may not know the stimulant 's documented contraindications -lrb- situations in which a drug might be harmful -rrb- or recommended precautions or how it may interact with other drugs , mccabe says . hallowell is also concerned that students taking controlled substances without prescriptions and physician supervision , noting that they may not know the dosage . watch : adhd meds do n't work long-term . short-term adverse consequences include sleep difficulties , restlessness , headaches , irritability and depressed feelings . other side effects include loss of appetite , nervousness , and changes in sex drive . the long term risk of psychological and physical dependence is of concern for routine users that may find they do not feel they can function optimally without it . schedule ii substances are classified by the dea as having a high potential for abuse . while students ' knowledge of the health dangers are limited , even less consideration is given to the illegality of use . obtaining stimulants from friends with prescriptions , as the vast majority of college students do , seems less dangerous and illegal than buying drugs off the street .  the fact that it 's illegal really does n't cross my mind ,  one student says .  it 's not something that i get nervous about because it 's so widespread and simple .  the biggest barrier to changing attitudes is the effectiveness of stimulants on campuses where the ends justify the means , researchers believe . after those late library nights , many students praise the little pill that got them through their hefty textbooks and into the morning . after taking adderall , says one university student ,  i just feel very alive and awake and ready for challenges that come my way .   i 'm on page 15 -lrb- of my paper -rrb- in just a few hours ... and i 'm very confident in it .
