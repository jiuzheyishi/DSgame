{"text": "oslo , norway the man behind a pair of bloody terror attacks in norway is set to appear in court monday , his first such appearance since authorities say he killed at least 93 people by setting off an explosion and gunning down people at a youth camp . police have not identified the suspect , but local television and newspaper reports say the man in custody is anders behring breivik . attorney geir lippestad , who claimed to represent the 32-year-old breivik , told norwegian tv2 late saturday that his client  is ready to explain himself  in court . the suspect feels the terrorist attacks were  horrible ,  but  in his head -lrb- they -rrb- were necessary ,  lippestad said . the 32-year-old norwegian has said that he acted alone and has not pleaded guilty , acting national police chief sveinung sponheim said sunday . but authorities have not ruled out that others may have been involved or helped him along the way . the investigation continues as the scandinavian nation continues to wrestle with the attacks ' aftermath , with an ashen-faced and openly weeping king harald v leading the nation in mourning sunday . memorial shrines with flowers and candles dotted oslo 's streets , and norwegians gathered at a cathedral in the capital to mourn the victims of the attacks .  soon , names and photographs will be released . the enormity of the evilness will surface in all its horror , and that will be a new test for us all ,  prime minister jens stoltenberg said at a church service sunday billed as a  mass for grief and hope .   in the middle of all the tragedy , i am proud to live in a country that has managed to stand tall .  sponheim said there has been  no progress  in ascertaining what the suspect 's motive might have been . but he said that investigators were studying a 1,500-page manifesto that authorities believe was published online the day of the attack . the document , apparently compiled over a period of nine years , rants against muslims and their growing presence in europe and calls for a european civil war to overthrow governments , end multiculturalism and execute  cultural marxists .  the author of the document identifies himself as breivik and indicates he is from norway . cnn could not independently verify that breivik wrote the document , and norwegian authorities would not confirm that the man in their custody wrote the manifesto , saying it was part of their investigation . authorities allege that he killed seven by setting off a car bomb outside government buildings in oslo on friday , then went 20 miles and killed at least 86 more by ambushing an island political youth retreat . the suspect was carrying a considerable amount of ammunition when he surrendered to authorities , sponheim told reporters . investigators will conduct autopsies over the next few days , sponheim said , and the identities of the victims will be released once all the next-of-kin have been notified . the death toll -- which inched up to 93 on sunday , after a person succumbed to injuries from the mass shooting -- and may increase , police say . at least four people have not been accounted for around utoya island , with investigators searching the waters nearby for victims who may have drowned trying to escape the shooter . authorities are also still trying to determine how many people died in the oslo bombing , where the explosion badly damaged several government buildings as well as the majority labour party office . they are also hunting for new evidence . on sunday , for instance , police raided a property the suspect owned in the eastern oslo area slettelokka looking for explosives .  we were there with dogs but found nothing of any value as evidence ,  sponheim said . police said sunday that the area around the blast site would remain cordoned off , but members of the public in the area were not at risk . in addition to the dead , at least 96 people were wounded in the attacks -- 30 in the blast and 66 in the mass shooting . doctors at oslo university hospital sunday were treating 31 patients injured in the terror attacks , 18 of whom were critically or seriously injured , oslo university hospital spokesman jo heldaas told cnn . pope benedict xvi on sunday offered his  fervent prayers for the victims and families , invoking god 's peace upon the dead and divine consolation upon those who suffer .   at this time of national grief he prays that all norwegians will be spiritually united in a determined resolve to reject the ways of hatred and conflict and to work together fearlessly in a shaping a future of mutual respect , solidarity and freedom from for coming generations ,  according to a statement released by cardinal tarcisio bertone on behalf of the pope . u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton expressed u.s. solidarity with norway .  the united states strongly condemns any kind of terrorism no matter where it comes from or who perpetuates it , and this tragedy strikes right at the heart of the soul of a peaceful people ,  she said in a statement . cnn 's michael holmes , erin mclaughlin , chelsea j. carter , jim boulden , laura smith-spark , joe sterling , moni basu , chelsea bailey , claudia rebaza and cynthia wamwayi contributed to this report .", "summary": " the suspect is set to appear in a norwegian court on monday .   investigators are
