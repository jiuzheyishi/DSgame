' alan mayor , left , and richard boyd , pictured in the wheelchair leaving burnley magistrates court , admitted theft by finding and were fined # 35 each . mayor then butted in sarcastically saying to his partner : ` another one of your plans ? thanks !

' the court heard the pair stole the wreaths from burnley crematorium , pictured , after arriving late at the florist where they had ordered flowers for mayor 's father 's funeral . andrew robinson , prosecuting told the court the wreaths had been left outside the crematorium after funeral services held that day . the wreaths were all returned to the place where they had been left . mr robinson added the value of the flowers was not known , but added : ` i know funeral wreaths can be very expensive . ' defending lawyer graeme parkinson said the flowers were not placed on a grave and would have ` withered away ' . he said they had all been recovered and put back , adding : ` as a consequence of that , has anybody actually been upset and distressed by the offence ? probably not . there was potential for causing some distress .

' mayor 's father had died , there was a funeral the day after in lancaster and the two of them had ordered flowers which they were due to pick up that evening . they had got stuck in traffic and missed the closing time at the florist . mr parkinson said they came up with the ` brainless ' idea to take the wreaths . they accepted it was stupid . the solicitor continued : ` mr mayor obviously was n't thinking straight because of the death of his father and mr boyd went along with it , but between the two of them , they should have thought better . ` alan mayor , per se , is not dishonest . maybe he was n't thinking straight , maybe he went along with a harebrained plan . ' mr parkinson said boyd was in very poor health and had signed himself out of hospital against medical advice to attend court . the solicitor continued : ` they do both apologise . they do both appreciate the seriousness of this offence and they wish to apologise profusely for their actions on that day .
