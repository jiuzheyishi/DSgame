{"text": "madrid , spain spain has won a major victory in its long court battle with a florida-based deep-sea salvage company over rights to an estimated $ 500 million in silver and gold coins , officials said wednesday . the treasure was recovered in 2007 from a 19th century sunken ship off the spanish coast . the 11th u.s. circuit court of appeals in atlanta on tuesday turned aside another motion from the u.s.-based company , odyssey marine exploration , and spanish officials said they now expect the coins -- nearly 600,000 of them -- to arrive in spain soon .  with the ruling by the appeals court , the process begins to recover all of the coins taken illegally  from the sunken ship , spain 's culture ministry said in a statement . odyssey , which can still appeal to the u.s. supreme court , said in a statement ,  currently , no final order has been issued in the case and it would be premature to comment at this time .  the battle royal began after odyssey announced in 2007 it had found the sunken treasure . it quickly laid claim to the coins , put them in crates and said it flew them to a discreet , well-guarded location in the united states . spain soon filed suit in a federal court in tampa , florida , also claiming the treasure . spain says its navy warship nuestra senora de las mercedes was carrying the coins . the mercedes , a 34-gun frigate , left peru in 1804 and crossed the atlantic to within a day 's sail from spain when british ships attacked the spanish fleet . in the ensuing battle of cape st. mary , south of portugal , the mercedes exploded after being hit in its power magazine , according to the spanish government 's filing to the florida court . the federal court in tampa in 2009 ruled in favor of spain 's claim to the treasure , but odyssey took the case to the federal appeals court in atlanta , which ruled last september to uphold the lower court 's ruling . at the end of that 53-page ruling , the three-judge appeals panel wrote ,  for the foregoing reasons , the district court did not err when it ordered odyssey to release the recovered  items to the custody of spain , according to a copy of the order viewed by cnn . since then , odyssey has filed various motions at the appeals court to overturn or delay the ruling , said james goold , a washington , d.c. , lawyer who is representing spain in the case . but on tuesday , the appeals court denied an odyssey motion , the court 's chief deputy clerk , amy nerenberg , told cnn by phone from atlanta . goold , who spoke to cnn by phone from washington , said it appears that odyssey 's only possible appeal now would be to the u.s. supreme court . that court agrees to hear only a tiny portion of the cases presented to it . the appeals court is expected to send the case in the coming days back to the federal court in tampa , which would establish and supervise the procedures for sending the coins to spain , goold said . spain believes that the main part of the nearly 600,000 coins are currently in florida , goold said . spain 's culture minister , jose ignaico wert , told cnn in madrid on wednesday that the case was never really about the money .  we 're not going to use this money for purposes other than artistic exhibition , but this is something that enriches our material , artistic capital and it has to be appreciated as such ,  wert said in an interview . he said the coins would be exhibited in spanish museums . peru has also followed this case . the silver and gold came from latin america when peru was a spanish colony .  formally , they have n't claimed anything , but we are completely open to consider the possibility of distributing some part of the treasure also among the latin american museums ,  wert said . the treasure includes a vast trove of coins , included fabled  pieces of eight ,  some minted in 1803 in lima , peru , spanish officials said at a 2008 news conference . the treasure already has crossed the atlantic ocean twice -- by ship in 1804 and then by plane in the other direction just a few years ago . spanish officials hope it might finally arrive now for the first time on the spanish mainland .", "summary": " the treasure is 600,000 silver and gold coins .   the coins went down with a spanish warship sunk in battle with british ships in 1804 .   a florida-based deep-sea salvage company recovered the coins in 2007 .   spain filed suit in u.s. federal court to claim the treasure .
