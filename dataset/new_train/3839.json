{"text": "education minister christopher pyne has denied he 's trying to save abc jobs in his home state of south australia , from his own government and at the expense of the broadcaster 's other departments . just as his communications minister malcolm turnbull was confirming that the abc will lose more than $ 250 million in federal funding -lrb- with up to 500 jobs expected to be shed before christmas -rrb- and sbs $ 25 million , mr pyne took the unusual step of launching his own on-line petition on wednesday calling on the abc board not to cut production in south australia . his office has denied it 's a case of double standards , my pyne attempting to turn the blame onto the abc board , accusing them of ` political vandalism ' if they choose to reduce production costs . the social media backlash against christopher pyne 's crusade was immediate . a spokesman for my pyne told daily mail australia that ` he 's not saying that , he 's not saying that there should be cuts pushed on elsewhere , it 's because of the report -lrb- peter lewis report -rrb- the -lrb- communication -rrb- minister received , which says there should be no cuts to programming ' . in an interview with abc radio 891 , mr pyne said : ` obviously the abc needs to make its contribution to reducing the debt and the deficit that labor has left us . and malcolm turnbull 's done the job for them ' . ` he got peter lewis to do a report , the lewis report , into how to reduce spending at the abc , which showed that the spending could be reduced without any impact on production , without any impact on programming , ' mr pyne said . christopher pyne hopes his campaign to save abc jobs in south australia will be heard . reaction to mr pyne 's petition to save jobs in south australia has sparked much reaction . ` so if abc management in ultimo decide to cut jobs and production in adelaide , it is a deliberate act of political vandalism , because they know , they have the report in front of them , in black and white , showing how to reduce costs without affecting production and programming and that 's what all out listeners need to know . ` there is no need for there to be a production change here in adelaide unless in ultimo in sydney , they refuse to actually implement the report malcolm turnbull had done for them . ' mr pyne 's petition via change.org states : ` we , the undersigned , are concerned that abc in south australia is the last tv production unit outside of sydney and melbourne . ` the board must reassure south australians that the local tv production house of the abc will remain in south australia . as noted in the abc 's 2013 annual report , abc south australia produces top rating , award-winning shows such as dream build which is listed in the 12 most popular australian made shows . ` further , abc south australia produces television that is often with a regional focus , including but not limited to the cook and the chef , poh 's kitchen , dream build , the karta orang-utan documentary at adelaide zoo , the beatles 50th anniversary tour documentary , a forthcoming country-based heritage restoration series and more . ` these television series are targeted at individual groups within the community and are crucial to a diverse market . by moving abc tv elsewhere , it will incur unnecessary costs and remove the efficient and innovative production unit from south australia . ` we , the undersigned , note that productions such as the daters has been produced here in south australia with a limited budget , while using innovative technology which has made it successful enough to be screened on abc2 and abc 's iview . ` we , the undersigned , strongly support the abc staying as a production unit in south australia and for the abc to adhere to its charter and continue to tell great stories  that contribute to a sense of national identity ... and reflect the cultural diversity of the australian community  . please ensure that the abc does not close its production house in adelaide . ' communications minister has revealed the cuts to the public broadcasters abc and sbs saying ` if the abc or sbs want to make decisions to change or cease programming ; that is their choice . the savings are not of a level that require any changes to programming ' mr pyne turned the heat up on the abc board today saying ` if abc management in ultimo decide to cut jobs and production in adelaide , it is a deliberate act of political vandalism , because they know , they have the report in front of them , in black and white , showing how to reduce costs ' mr turnbull has released details , claiming that changes to programming are not required and the savings can be found through ` operational efficiencies ' . his statement read : ` an efficiency study was launched in january to identify how the abc and sbs could find efficiencies in their back office operations , finance , property , it , administration , corporate and marketing , without impacting on programming ' . ` in total , including the 1 per cent down-payment announced in the may budget , the overall savings to the broadcasters is $ 308 million over five years or 4.4 per cent of taxpayers ' investment , ' mr turnbull stated . ` for the abc this means it will receive $ 5.2 billion over five years rather than $ 5.5 billion , a saving of $ 254 million or 4.6 per cent . ` the government is confident that these savings can be achieved without affecting the diverse range and quality of programmes provided by the abc or sbs . suggestions that popular programs or services are at risk because of budget savings are not credible . ` if the abc or sbs want to make decisions to change or cease programming ; that is their choice . the savings are not of a level that require any changes to programming . ` programming changes are decisions for the management and boards of the organisations , not the government . ' as for his colleague calling on jobs to be specifically saved in south australia , mr turnbull said ` christopher is representing his electorate , everybody is entitled to their opinion ' .", "summary": " communications minister malcolm turnbull has confirmed the abc will lose $ 254 million over the next five years -rrb- .   education minister launches petition to stop programming cutbacks and says the abc board would be guilty of ` political vandalism ' if there are .   christopher pyne has called for abc jobs to be protected in his home state of south australia .   government insists the abc board should not have to cut programming and production and can find savings across other business parts .   sbs will suffer cuts of $ 25 million over five years .
