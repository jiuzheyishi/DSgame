' other rumours to have generated from white 's note include that the iphone 6 - expected in 2014 - will have a much larger screen than the current 4inch iphone 5 model . apple could launch a 4.7 inch model - which would put it in close competition with samsung 's 4.8 inch galaxy siii - as well as a 5.7 inch ` phablet-style ' device . these rumours are said to have come from sources within the phone maker 's supply chain in asia . according to reuters , these suppliers have been approached with plans for the larger screens , but noted it is still unclear whether apple will actually launch its flagship product in the larger sizes . ` they constantly change product specifications almost to the final moment , so you 're not really sure whether this is the final prototype , ' said one person said to have ` direct knowledge of the matter . ' speaking at last month 's allthingsd industry conference on why apple has n't launched different sized iphones , ceo tim cook , pictured , said : ` we have n't so far . that does n't shut off the future . ' cook noted a larger screen comes with trade-offs on features such as battery life , resolution and brightness . apple 's possible shift to offer what is often referred to as ` phablets ' - chunkier smartphones not quite big enough to qualify as tablets - comes as the long-time consumer and investor faces pressure to deliver more than one new handset model a year . critics say its pace of innovation has slowed since the death of legendary co-founder steve jobs - a reference phil schiller , apple 's senior vice president of worldwide marketing , made during the keynote speech at apple 's developer conference in san francisco this week when he said : ` ca n't innovate any more , my ass . ' the iphone 5 , launched last september , was the first model to veer away from the apple phone 's 3.5-inch screen , which jobs famously deemed ` the perfect size for consumers ' and had been used in every iphone since the iconic device was unveiled in 2007 . the current iphone 5 has one of the smaller screens among the best-selling smartphones in the mobile market . samsung 's galaxy s4 and galaxy note 2 have 5-inch and 5.5-inch screens , respectively . apple launched its 4inch iphone 5 handset at an annual event in san francisco , in september last year . it is made of aluminium and glass , which makes it feel sturdy , but this pushes up production costs . the cheaper iphone mini is expected to have the plastic casing as seen on samsung galaxy models . for this year , apple is expected to launch two new models , widely referred to as the iphone 5s , with new fingerprint technology , and the cheaper version in plastic casing . apple plans to dress up the cheaper phone in a range of five or six colours to differentiate it from the more expensive model that has traditionally come only in black and white . analysts say the company needs a cheaper gadget to push on in growth markets in china and india , and to counter samsung 's edge in having phones priced up and down the spectrum . china , the world 's biggest smartphone market , is set to grow 48 percent this year , outpacing the global increase of 31 percent , according to industry forecasts . while apple only offers a single phone model across all markets , it has successfully marketed the ipod music player and its ipad in different sizes and at varying prices . if the new iphone mini launches as expected , it will more than likely run apple 's latest mobile software - ios 7 . this software was unveiled this week at apple 's developer conference and will be available as a free upgrade in the autumn . asked at last month 's allthingsd industry conference why apple has n't launched different sized iphones , ceo tim cook said : ` we have n't so far . that does n't shut off the future . ' he explained that the range of ipods serve different audiences and needs . ` on the phone , that 's the question . are we now at a point to serve enough people that we need to do that ? ' cook noted a larger screen comes with trade-offs on features such as battery life , resolution and brightness . test production for both the standard and cheaper iphone models aims to start next month , with mass production ramping up in august to meet a september launch target , two people said . ` trial production was originally planned to start in june , but the mixing of colours is taking longer than expected as apple has very high and idealistic standards , ' said one source in asia , adding 20 million plastic iphones are expected to ship in the october-december quarter . japan 's sharp corp and japan display and south korea 's lg display will supply the panels for the aluminium iphone 5s and the plastic iphone , while hon hai precision industry is said to be assembling the higher-end phone and pegatron will put together the cheaper model . the new ios 7 software will be available as a free upgrade in the autumn is the first software to be designed by london-born sir jonathan ive following an alleged power struggle with previous design chief scott fortsall . ive took over in october last year .", "summary": " industry analyst claims apple is working on a cheaper version of its iphone handset that will be available in five colours .   the new handsets could be made of plastic to keep costs down rather than the glass and aluminium of the current model .   other rumours suggest the company is working on a 5.7 inch phone - dubbed a ` phablet ' "}
