{"text": "nearly a year after the presidential election , the excitement of barack obama 's campaign has faded into the reality of an obama white house . as observers try to determine what time it is in american politics , they arrive at opposite conclusions . to some , said tulane university political scientist thomas langston , obama is like jimmy carter , and the nation will soon hammer the nails into the coffin of a dying democratic coalition just as voters , tired of the carter  malaise  era , handed the white house to republicans in 1980 . to others , obama has come to usher in a new understanding of the relationship between the government and the people . to them , langston said , it 's the dawning of a new age , as depicted in a famous 1984 ronald reagan campaign ad that declared ,  it 's morning again in america .  both obama and carter were elected into office at a time when voters were hungry for change . carter represented the antithesis of president nixon and a break from the disillusionment and mistrust of government caused by the watergate scandal . carter , like obama , learned the ropes in a state senate . critics accused carter of being inexperienced , having served one term as the governor of georgia . but the democratic candidate presented himself as a politician outside of politics and a reformer uninterested in partisan games .  with carter himself , there was a sense of a kind of national renewal in some ways that people have said has been true after the very difficult years of the bush presidency ,  said russell riley , chair of the miller center 's presidential oral history program at the university of virginia . shortly after taking office , carter 's approval rating peaked at 75 percent but dropped to the low 40s in a little more than a year . he entered office weighed down by a sagging economy , and eventually , the energy crisis , the soviet union 's invasion of afghanistan and the iranian hostage crisis took a toll on his administration .  he ended his presidency , of course , holed up in the white house as a virtual captive himself of the iranian hostage takers ,  langston said . the parallels to carter come primarily from obama 's republican critics . florida gov. charlie crist speculated last month that a carter-esque loss  may happen again ,  and former house speaker newt gingrich has predicted that a republican resurgence -- like the one he led in the mid '90s -- could be just around the corner .  carter is held up as the model of the ineffectual president -- a saint of a man but an ineffectual president . and so when people compare obama to carter , that is an attack ,  said david gergen , a senior political analyst for cnn who also worked in the nixon , ford , reagan and clinton administrations . the comparison to carter , gergen said , is more of a danger sign for obama than it is a reality because it shows how the storyline has changed . when obama first came into office , observers likened him to some of the most successful presidents in u.s. history , such as franklin roosevelt , gergen said . now , obama 's also being compared to a president who did n't live up to expectations . the carter comparison shows how much polarization has occurred in the country since the election , gergen said . under carter , there was also a sense of polarization -- but it was in the president 's party . the liberal wing of the democrats felt abandoned to the point that sen. edward kennedy , one of the top liberals in congress , challenged carter in his 1980 re-election bid . kennedy came up short , but his bid severely weakened carter and contributed to his eventual defeat in the 1980 election to reagan , riley said . while the similarities are not lost on riley , what 's more telling is the  most important mistake that -lsb- obama -rsb- did n't make .  when carter took office , there were democrats with executive branch experience available , but he did n't want to use them .  carter was criticized for bringing in the ` georgia mafia , '  riley said , referring to carter 's decision to give key positions to people from his home state . obama , however , stacked his bench with pros from the clinton administration . he brought in some advisers from chicago , illinois , some from washington and others such as chief of staff rahm emanuel with deep ties to both places . that move was critical , riley said ,  because if you 've got seasoned people in these positions , they 're much more likely to make adjustments and to know capitol hill in a way that will allow them to weather the kinds of problems that were common to both carter and obama .  john geer , a vanderbilt university political scientist , said the comparisons to carter are weak .  jimmy carter is a very rare exception in american history . most first-term presidents get a second term ,  he said , adding that it 's especially rare since carter 's term came on the heels of previous republican rule . president george h.w. bush also served one term , but it came after eight years of republican control of the white house . the more analogous comparison so far , geer said , is to reagan , who also entered the white house with a full plate of foreign policy problems -- mostly surrounding the cold war -- and a major economic crisis at hand . reagan was a gifted politician , geer said . he was known as an inspiring communicator , and his appeal crossed party lines . like obama , polls showed that reagan was more popular than his policies . more than 20 years after he left the white house , republicans still look to him as the last great face of the party .  reagan continues to be the touchstone , the smiling buddha figure . everybody rubs his belly for good luck ,  langston said .  like the smiling buddha , he is whatever you want him to be .  in his book  the audacity of hope ,  obama wrote that although he and reagan had differing political viewpoints , he understands the republican president 's appeal .  reagan spoke to america 's longing for order , our need to believe that we are not simply subject to blind , impersonal forces but that we can shape our individual and collective destinies , so long as we rediscover the traditional values of hard work , patriotism , personal responsibility , optimism , and faith ,  he wrote . gergen , who was director of communications for reagan , said the comparisons to reagan are strained because of their opposite governing styles . where as obama tries to draw consensus , reagan drew lines , he said .  reagan was a conviction politician , and barack obama is a consensus-seeking politician ,  gergen said .  barack obama was a magical figure in his campaign , ran an extremely good campaign , but also based it more on the sense of hope and change as ideas , the particular policy solutions , Ã  la reagan .  martin anderson , an economic policy adviser to reagan , said obama and reagan faced similar problems in their first year but approached them with different solutions . faced with an economic crisis , reagan 's strategy was to reduce taxes , let the american people figure out what to do and then find out what went wrong , anderson said . after reagan cut taxes in his first year , there were no immediate changes .  it looked terrible , and it did n't look very good during the second year . and then it began to catch and it worked ... and it was really terrific on the third and the fourth and the fifth and so on ,  anderson said . as for obama 's approach to country 's economic woes -- it 's too early to tell what will happen , he said . in his first few months in office , reagan also went through a game-changing experience that had ramifications for both him and the country : he got shot .  he came very close to dying . it was right down next to his heart . just stunned everything , stunned everybody ,  anderson recalled . but within weeks , reagan was back at work -- with a positive attitude and good sense of humor .  and the democrats -- after he came to life again -- they took a deep sigh and said , ` ok , you can do whatever you want , '  anderson said . as tragic as the 1981 assassination attempt was , reagan 's quick recovery -- and the sympathy from democrats -- provided momentum for the president 's agenda .  the first year is a very tough year for any president ,  anderson said , noting that each year thereafter is  dramatically different .  asked what he thinks about comparisons to carter and reagan , anderson replied ,  you know who he looks like ? obama .  looking to administrations past , obama can learn a valuable lesson , gergen said .  do n't spend time wallowing in arguments about who you might be -- spend time worrying about who you are and worrying about governing .  the similarities between obama and his predecessors , while interesting to discuss , are not foreboding , riley said .  there is no exact historical parallel to what we are looking at right now . there are bits and pieces here and there ,  he said . it 's impossible , however to take those similarities and  piece out from them a guaranteed scenario that he is going to end up in the same place .  that idea , he said , is perhaps best summed up in a quote attributed to mark twain :  history does n't repeat itself , it rhymes . ", "summary": " presidents obama , carter both elected at a time when voters wanted change .   analyst : carter comparison shows how expectations have changed since obama 's win .   obama , reagan faced similar problems but approached them differently , reagan aide says .   obama should worry about who he is , not who he might be , analyst david gergen says .
