{"text": "a pensioner was appalled when council workmen who fitted a new back door to his home left a foot-wide gap between the brickwork and the door . sydney twigg , 80 , was left fearing for his safety by the blunder because a thief could easily have squeezed through the gaping hole in his house in meltham , kirklees , west yorkshire . mr twigg confronted the workers when he saw the gap but was told it was someone else 's responsibility to fill it in . blunder : this foot-wide gap was left by workmen who fitted a new back door to the home of 80-year-old sydney twigg , who feared for his safety because a burglar could easily have squeezed through it . he said : ' i asked them when they had done it and they said it was n't their job and someone would be out to fix it . ` that was nearly two weeks ago . i have been on edge and nervous particularly about sleeping at night knowing that its not locked . ' it took 10 days for kirklees neighbourhood housing -lrb- knh -rrb- to fix the problem , and that was only after concerned neighbours put pressure on the housing authority on his behalf . time gap : the mistake was finally remedied after 10 days but only when friends and neighbours put pressure on kirkless neighbourhood housing . a tape measure shows the extent of the gap . the housing authority has admitted it made a mistake and apologised to mr twigg . beth sparrow , 31 , said : ` we have all had routine repairs but when i saw the gap on sydney 's back door i just could n't believe it had been left like that . ` anyone could get through it . to leave a vulnerable pensioner with an insecure back door is disgusting . ' i have since spoken to four different people at knh to notify them that this is not his out-house door but his back door and it needs urgently repairing . ' a spokesman for kirklees building services , which carried out the work on behalf of knh , admitted it had made a mistake . ` we 're very sorry for the confusion about the repair to mr twigg 's door and kirklees building services are looking into what happened so this kind of mistake does n't happen again . ` some loose bricks had to be removed from above the door when the new one was fitted on may 30 . ' a repair was ordered to fix the brickwork , but unfortunately this was listed as a routine job , not as an urgent one . ` this should not have happened and we apologise to mr twigg for this mistake . ` building services went to see mr twigg to explain what has happened and have carried out the repairs .
