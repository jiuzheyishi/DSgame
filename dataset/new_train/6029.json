' the company has also committed to paying for lucy 's vet bills . luther said staff at the greensburg petco told her the person who injured her dog was a trainee pet groomer . ' i was told yesterday it was somebody who was learning how to do this , which i think should 've been mentioned to me before i left the dog in their care . had i known that , maybe i would 've taken her away if i knew it was n't a trained professional , ' she told wtae .", "summary": " carissa luther dropped her dog lucy off at a pittsburgh petco to be groomed .   she received a call hours later from a vet saying her dog had to undergo anesthesia for two wounds .   lucy received 20 stitches on her abdomen and leg .   petco has assumed responsibility .   luther says someone told her the groomer who injured her pet was a trainee .
