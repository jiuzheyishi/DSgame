' william hague , the foreign secretary , congratulated morsi , saying : ` this is an historic moment for egypt . it will be important for the new government to stand for national unity and reconciliation , to build bridges across egyptian society and to uphold human rights , including the rights of women and religious minorities , and the rule of law . ' the rise of an islamist as leader of the arab world 's most populous state will present a new challenge for the west which for years counted mubarak as a staunch ally . historically the west has viewed the brotherhood with suspicion . under mubarak , many of the group 's members were arrested and persecuted . baited breath of thousands : cairo extends into the distance behind tahrir square , packed with morsy supporters as they await confirmation that their man has won . it 's official : farouq sultan , head of egypt 's elections presidential committee , announces the results during a televised press conference today . welcoming change : one of the morsy faithful rises above the crowd in tahrir square , which was at the heart of the arab nation 's uprising last year . the election outcome has alarmed many secular liberals and egypt 's coptic christian minority who fear an islamic takeover . but there was some relief last night at the result . if shafiq had been awarded victory , there were fears of growing civil unrest . a foreign office source said : ` the muslim brotherhood are a different beast from al qaeda , they are not part of any international terror conspiracy . we are breathing a sigh of relief . it is the least bad result . ' morsi has also pledged to stick by the camp david peace agreement with israel , but has warned it could be reviewed if israel does not respect the terms of the deal . in an effort to reassure egyptians that the rights of minorities will not be threatened under his rule , morsi announced an alliance with leading liberal and revolutionary groups . triumphant : women loyal to the muslim brotherhood roar in approval following the announcement . close race : morsy -lrb- right -rrb- edged out main rival ahmed shafik -lrb- left -rrb- , a former general . fresh start : the square erupts in a riot of red , white and black as word of the official results filters through . he has also said he will resign as leader of the freedom and justice party , the muslim brotherhood 's political arm , in a gesture signalling he would be a president for all egyptians . morsi was initially dismissed as uncharismatic and an unlikely winner . his success is a measure of the power of the brotherhood movement which is popular among the poor for its record of charity work . the win is seen as a victory for the revolution and marks the first time egypt has elected a civilian president in 7,000 years . ` the revolution passed an important test , ' said yasser ali , a spokesman for morsi 's campaign . ` but the road is still long . ' the long awaited results came after a tense week of uncertainty overshadowed by a military power grab that has sought to limit the powers of the incoming head of state . let down : supporters from the pro-shafik camp hear the results as one buries his head in his hands . overwhelmed : three pro-morsy voters embrace after hearing of their party 's long-awaiting win at the polls . bitter defeat : meanwhile , a supporter of ahmed shafiq presses a photograph of the losing candidate to her mouth . sickened : a woman in cairo clutches her stomach in anguish after learning of shafik 's loss . under a constitutional declaration announced by the army the powers of the new leader have been significantly curtailed . the president will not be commander in chief and the army will retain legislative authority until a new parliament is elected . morsi will now have to battle the military for real power , raising fears of further political tension in egypt -- and the region -- over the coming months . the army is expected to hand over power to the president in a ceremony later this week . by michael burleigh . this is a victory which will send . shock waves throughout the middle east , emboldening islamic radicals . from bahrain to syria to persist in their efforts to topple their . regimes , and confirming the israeli view that the arab spring has become . an arab winter . mohammed . morsi , egypt 's new president , is the arab world 's first elected . islamist head of state . he now rules a nation of 81million people . while . there is rejoicing among hardline hamas supporters in gaza tonight , . egyptian liberals and secularists will be bitterly disappointed , . especially since it was they , rather than the muslim brotherhood , who . toppled hosni mubarak . the wealthy cosmopolitan middle-classes will be shuddering inside their villas in cairo 's rich heliopolis suburb . a supporter of the muslim brotherhood 's mohamed morsy celebrates at tahrir square in cairo yesterday . the tears of supporters of ahmed shafik : this is a victory which will send shock waves throughout the middle east . although optimists hope that . egypt will evolve along the lines of turkey , which has a moderate . islamic government , the reality is that it is likely to see protracted . strife between a still-powerful military -- which has until now held all . the power -- and a strong islamist movement that will make it more like . strife-torn pakistan . the army have a lot to lose , while the brotherhood has everything to gain . morsi 's background is typical of the . middle class , academic professionals who dominate the brotherhood 's . leadership . he has a doctorate in engineering from the university of . southern california , and worked at egypt 's zagazig university . but he is . leader in name only , which is why he is known as the ` spare tyre ' . he . only ran for president after the ruling supreme council of the army . disqualified 62-year-old businessman khariat al shater , the real . strategic mind within the brotherhood . al . shater has been in prison four times . he and morsi represent the . conservative strain of the brotherhood , and rule out women and . christians ever standing as president . they want egypt to be run along . the lines of saudi arabia , where women are covered from head to toe and . banned from driving , alcohol is forbidden and sharia law is commonplace . the wives of these two men wear the niqab , which covers the face and is . unusual in egypt -- except in areas where the brotherhood 's huge . charitable involvement acts like a chill draught in a room . the . military , which thanks to its vast grants from the us still retains . considerable power in egypt , has made a deal with the brotherhood . drastically reducing the new president 's untested powers . in . a sense both sides have been engaged in a game of chicken . the . brotherhood has been using its supporters to flood tahrir square and . threatening to unleash its trades unions to paralyse an egyptian economy . already limping along because of the collapse of mass tourism . the generals -- who could always fill the streets with troops -- have issued a decree which restricts what president morsi can do . morsi . has no power over budgets , internal affairs or the army , in a country . where the defence budget is 40 per cent of revenue . he may chair a new . national defence council , but 11 of its 16 members will be serving . generals . but . while the army holds many cards , the military 's commercial and . industrial interests make it highly vulnerable to charges of . institutional corruption of the sort that saw the ousting of mubarak , . himself a former air force general . fragile peace : in an echo of last year 's turmoil , military police are deployed outside the electoral commission 's offices in cairo following the announcement , and it is the military who still hold much of the power . since mubarak went , relations . with israel have become far chillier . morsi is a fervent supporter of . israel 's enemy hamas , the egyptians have cut off deliveries of natural . gas to israel , and they 've opened the sinai border to waves of african . migrants who are causing serious law and order problems for the citizens . of tel aviv . the . world can only watch and wait to see if israel reacts -- and how this . uneasy partnership between the generals and the brotherhood plays out . many will be fearful , however , if in time the islamists gain the upper . hand . michael burleigh is author of
