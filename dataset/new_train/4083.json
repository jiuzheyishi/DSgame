{"text": "ours is a culture that loves to celebrate youth , but there are those 30 and older who will tell you that leaving one 's 20s behind is like a revelation . growing out of that decade often means growing out of bad decision-making , frustrated searching and feeling generally as though life 's a pinball machine -- and you 're the ball . as you age , hopefully you realize that what you 've lost in youthfulness you 've gained in wisdom . in the best scenarios , you know how to bounce back from bumps and are better at avoiding valleys . you appreciate your mistakes , but you 'll be damned if you 'll repeat them . as much as we 'd hoped she would , amy winehouse never got that far . when she died at 27 last july , few truly knew the intimate details of her personal life . the public could really know only what we 'd read about , seen and heard -- that she was a troubled young woman struggling with drug and alcohol abuse and that whatever was plaguing her threatened to overshadow a superb talent . ahead of her standout performance via satellite at the 2008 grammy awards , the singer was enmeshed in negative press and a few in the media openly questioned how long she 'd survive . she went on to win five awards that night , including best new artist . she owned that evening and touched hearts with her look of utter amazement and how she fled into the arms of one of her back-up singers when she bested artists such as beyonce and rihanna for record of the year . the tragedy of winehouse 's passing was n't just that the predictions came true , or that we 'd lost an undeniably great talent , but also that she lost a fight so early in life . this was an artist who was blessed with the presence of someone who 'd seen it all and a voice from another lifetime , a woman who could write about and then sing to life some of love 's darkest sides . she sang us through our own rough spots and regrets , but could n't seem , in the public 's eye , anyway , to do the same for herself . mitch winehouse on losing amy : ` you take every day as it comes '  i do n't write songs because i want my voice to be heard or i want to be famous or any of that stuff ,  winehouse told cnn in a 2007 interview .  i write songs about things i have problems with and i have to get past them and i have to make something good out of something bad .  we ca n't pretend to know her struggle with alcohol or substance abuse , but we 've all felt some variant of the longing , loneliness , hurt and infatuation she put into her music . winehouse presented those emotions in a visceral way with which we could connect . she could take a personal experience and strike a note of universal truth . take , for example ,  rehab ,  her grammy-winning but controversial track from her autobiographical second album  back to black .  it 's about the time her management tried to get her sober and she refused . but it was the smirking wisecracks and stubborn defiance that had us singing along . on her jazzy 2003 debut  frank ,  it was the beautifully sung , detailed story of wounded pride on  you sent me flying ,  and the tsk ` ing , sneering disappointment in a lover on  stronger than me .  winehouse scores posthumous no. 1 .  you know i 'm no good  provided a sultry soundtrack for the flawed and self-critical while  tears dry on their own  is an anthem of resolve . the album 's title track , winehouse explained in that 2007 interview , the aftermath of a broken love . her massive appeal was backed by strong production on both albums , thanks to collaborations with producers salaam remi and mark ronson , and of course that voice -- rich , evocative and captivating . those elements helped her songs ' content to shine ; everything 's discussed with brash honesty and often a sense of humor .  there 's no point in saying anything but the truth ,  winehouse told the guardian in 2004 .  because , at the end of the day , i do n't have to answer to you , or my ex , or ... i should n't say god ... or a man in a suit from the record company . i have to answer to myself .  that frankness and headstrong independence is what we loved about her and could relate to . although some talked callously about her struggles , there was still an underlying hope that she 'd push past her problems . so when she could n't , her july 23 death felt to many like a sucker punch . at the time of her death , it appeared that winehouse was focused on recovery . an inquest last fall ruled that she 'd died of alcohol poisoning and a family spokesman said at the time that  amy was battling hard to conquer her problems with alcohol , and it is a source of great pain that she could not win in time .  who knows what the next few years of her life could have brought . that question will always linger and is the difficulty of watching someone pass on so young -- those of us left living know just how much more life can bring . perhaps she would have found , as slate wrote in 2008 , that  there are other , better things to romanticize than hard times and hard booze .  instead , we 're left to hope that when she died , she still felt the same way as she did when she spoke to harper 's bazaar in 2010 . holding on to nary an unfulfilled goal , she said ,  if i died tomorrow , i would be a happy girl .  winehouse producer : i still hear her voice .", "summary": " amy winehouse died a year ago today at 27 .   fans and fellow stars were rooting for her to continue to find success .   the tragedy of her death was to watch a woman lose a battle so early in life .
