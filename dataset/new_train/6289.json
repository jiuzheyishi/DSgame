{"text": "there were three main bands at oxford in 1974 . there was bluebird , who were studious types , and two vaguely political units known as flying wedge and frothy green stools . attend any left-leaning party or banner-filled occupation of a university building and it would be announced that the wedge or the stools were about to entertain . all of them had a few numbers they 'd written themselves , so i had a crack at this caper and discovered it was harder than i 'd imagined . in a fortnight my song catalogue had only three entries -- a weak , twinkly thing called the invisible girl , a challenging rant called sombrero fallout and a fey and ineffectual dirge called i 'm flying -lrb- and you are the sky -rrb- . rockin ' politico : tony blair -lrb- left -rrb- and his friend alan collenette outside the vineyard in richmond in 1972 . mr blair is showiong his bohemian side by eschewing shoes . for one sparkling moment i thought they were classics and saw myself performing them in a halo of soft lighting , but when i tried one out on the chilswell road commune they suggested i stick to the bass . but the best possible thing happened : an old school friend called adam dropped by to say he 'd formed a band that wanted to play covers and they had n't got a bass guitarist . he had a beard and a mop of blond , shaggy hair and something shy and shrugging about him . ` what are you called ? ' i wondered . ` ugly rumours , ' he shrugged . ` why ? ' ` because . . . ' and he gave me a quizzical look as if my knowledge of rock 's outer reaches fell shamefully short of the mark ` . . . because if you hold the cover of the grateful dead 's from the mars hotel album upside-down in a mirror , the shapes in the stars spell the words  ugly rumors  . so we 're ugly rumors , ' he shrugged , ` but in english . ' loose band rehearsals took place in somebody 's flat . adam played rhythm guitar and brought some harp lager . jim played the drums and had a fur coat and a chipped front tooth and never surfaced till ` cool o'clock ' . al was the frontman , a proper lead guitarist with a knotted scarf , studded biker jacket and a flailing curtain of hennaed hair . he lived in alma place , off cowley road , which he referred to as astral space . they never lose it : tony blair plays the guitar with pupil andrew cragg -lrb- right -rrb- , 15 , on saxophone on a visit to hartlepool . we all had cuban-heeled cowboy boots and spent a rackety afternoon trying to master long train running by californian weed-enthusiasts the doobie brothers and live with me by the rolling stones . within a month we 'd cobbled together a set and played a couple of parties but nobody fancied singing . we took it in turns but this demanding activity interfered with the main point of being in any group which was posing expansively , waving at girls and wedging lighted ciggies under the top of your guitar strings like keith richards . ugly rumours needed someone out front . my friend anji had an old mate at st john 's college called tony blair , who 'd managed a band and appeared in revue shows , so we asked him to audition . ` audition ' was pitching it a bit high and the moment he arrived , wearing the same boots as we had , he 'd effectively got the job . he had a folk-rock look -- long hair with a fringe -- and was keen , organised , quite posh , very funny and started a lot of sentences with the word ` guys ' . we 'd sent him the set-list so he 'd been up half the night with his ear pressed to a speaker transcribing the words and breezed in waving sheaves of handwritten lyrics . ` guys , ' he said , ` great selection ! where 's the name from , ugly rumours ? ' docked four points : imagine not knowing that . there was some tutting and adam had to fill him in . ` any chance of doing i do n't want to talk about it by crazy horse ? ' tony wondered . this was impressive : only the most insanely confident singer of a college rock band would dare suggest a ballad , let alone an obscure one . the audition got under way , two acoustic guitars , an unamplified bass , an upturned wastepaper basket and tony emoting into a microphone that was n't plugged in . he sang in high , fruity tones with the odd jagger move thrown in . we signed him up and charged off to the bear pub in alfred street to drink to our glorious future . the five-piece ugly rumours began appearing on the party circuit , al perfecting his gale-force solos and tony adopting a courageous hoop-necked top that revealed several square inches of bare torso . the only tensions were the do-you-tuck-your-flares-into-your-cowboy-boots debates seconds before showtime , and the irritating sight of pretty girls gathered round the central mike-stand . ` guys , guys . ' tony called us together after one show . ` we 're ok and everything but we could be so much better if we rehearsed ! ' his level of enthusiasm was high even by my standards , and this was exceptionally keen . we played at a ball organised for the satirical strumpet student magazine . nobody threw anything , radical folk in suede shoes and military jackets clapped quite loudly and this whole ball business clearly got to tony . ` listen , guys , you know these college balls that are 20 guineas a pop and have funfairs and slightly second-rate groups like caravan , right ? why do n't we do an alternative one ? pints of beer , quid to get in , ugly rumours top of the bill ? ' the corpus christi alternative college ball was held on a cloudless june evening . anji -lrb- hunter who went on to become blair 's office ` gatekeeper ' in downing street -rrb- wore a billowy blue frock and a felt hat . blair 's gatekeeper : anji hunter . she had an old mate at st john ¿ s college called tony blair , who ¿ d managed a band and appeared in revue shows , so he was asked him to audition . the ticket included three bands , tins of lager , wine from bottles with plastic stoppers and saucers of twiglets and smarties . in an attempt to be ` far out ' we 'd booked a string quartet to open the show -- long-haired girls in flowing dresses -- then a trad jazz band of old duffers in their 40s wearing straw hats and striped blazers . the idea was you could watch this cheesy , toe-tapping fare from the terrace while gearing up for the white heat of ugly rumours . the crowd thought differently . two minutes ' exposure to these brass-edged stompers and they were hurling themselves about in riotous abandon , blokes in indian shirts jiving uncontrollably and girls cantering down the little paths among the flower-beds . they were going to be a hard act to follow . musical mates : tony blair and boomtown rats lead singer bob geldof . my heart was pounding as we stood and watched . i looked at the five of us , a great heap of split-ends and fag ash in our skinny t-shirts and giant trousers . apart from jim , we all had bare feet . we padded out nervously into the setting sun , squashing burning marlboros into our guitar necks and placing bottles of warm blue nun on the top of our amps . the cowbell started up for honky tonk women . we cranked up the riff and gave tony the nod and he burst from behind a hedge doing his now fairly polished jagger impression -- low-slung flares , bare midriff , one hand on a hip , the other wagging a cautionary finger , elbows flapping like a chicken . a couple of camp handclaps above his head and he pulled the microphone from its stand . ` well awwwrright corpus christi alternative college ball , how are ya ? ' they were fine , thanks , but a bit danced-out by the jazz band . ` are you ready for some rock 'n' roll ? ' possibly , but they had to get their breath back first . and that beer was n't going to drink itself . we gave it our best shot but the moment had passed . no matter how much al threw his hair about , or tony said ` awwwrright ! ' , or jim whacked his cowbell while looking cool and distant , or adam grinned bashfully and stamped on his effects pedals , we could n't fill the lawn like the boater-sporting jazzers . tony knew it , too , and made an announcement i do n't remember discussing in the pre-gig huddle . ` guys , we 're going to try something different , ok ? ' the crowd lowered their lager cans . ` we 're going to bring on the string quartet for a jam . . . ' scattered applause . ` . . . and let 's have a big hand for our brilliant jazz band , too . come on back up , guys ! ' mass jubilant shrieks of delight . what the hell was this ? in the interests of creating an ` alternative happening ' , we were now lumbered with six pensionable goons in cricket blazers who were far better musicians than we were . it 's after events like that , in the long sleepless hours of dawn , that even the most deluded would-be rock god in a college covers act tends to take a long , hard look at himself and ask some tough but quite reasonable questions . such as this : if i was the least talented member of the fourth - best covers group at a university , how was i ever going to make it as a musician ? whatever uncertain paths lay ahead of the five of us , they would n't involve being in rock bands .", "summary": " the real truth behind ugly rumours , blair 's university band .   invited to audition by anji hunter , who later worked for him at no 10 .   wanted to sing a ballad and an obscure one at that .   extracted from rock stars stole my life ! a big bad love affair with music by mark ellen , to be published by hodder & stoughton on may 8 at # 18.99 . © mark ellen 2014 . to order a copy for # 16.99 -lrb- p&p incl -rrb- call 0844 472 4157 . rockstarsstolemylife.com .
