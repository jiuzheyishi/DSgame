{"text": "-lsb- caption -rsb- . facebook is heading for a catastrophic decline and could lose 80 % of its users by 2015 , researchers warned today . the team from princeton claim the social networking site spread ` like an infectious diseases . ' the predict its ` decline phase ' has already begun - and will be swift . by treating facebook 's rapid adoption like the spread of an infectious disease , researchers at princeton have devised a model that predicts facebook will lose 80 per cent of its users in the next three years . focus groups carried out as part of a recent pew research found why teens are leaving facebook . female -lrb- age 19 -rrb- : ` yeah , that 's why we go on twitter and instagram -lsb- instead of facebook -rsb- . my mom does n't have that . ' female -lrb- age 15 -rrb- : ` if you are on facebook , you see a lot of drama . ' female -lrb- age 14 -rrb- : ` ok , here 's something i want to say . i think facebook can be fun , but also it 's drama central . on facebook , people imply things and say things , even just by a like , that they would n't say in real life . ' male -lrb- age 18 -rrb- : ` it 's because -lsb- facebook -rsb- it 's where people post unnecessary pictures and they say unnecessary things , like saying he has a girlfriend , and a girl will go on and tag him in the picture like , me and him in the sun having fun . why would you do that ? ' the researchers first analysed the rise and fall of myspace to prove their theory could accurately predict the fall of a social network . they then analysed google searches from facebook , and say the results were very similar . ` extrapolating the best Ô¨Åt model into the future suggests that facebook will undergo a rapid decline in the coming years , losing 80 % of its peak user base between 2015 and 2017 , ' they said . ` the site has ` already reached the peak of its popularity and has entered a decline phase . ' to explain why social networks are like infectious diseases , the study pointed to similar research done with ideas . ` ideas , like diseases , have been shown to spread infectiously between people before eventually dying out , and have been successfully described with epidemiological model , ' they say . ` idea manifesters ultimately lose interest with the idea and no longer manifest the idea , which can be thought of as the gain of  immunity  to the idea . ' researchers from princeton used epidemiological models usually used to study disease - and say the ` decline phase ' has already begun . search queries for facebook and myspace : researcher say the decline of facebook has already begun - and will happen incredibly quickly , mirroring the death of myspace . however , the researcher admit their study has not yet been peer-reviewed . facebook , which currently boasts 874 million users worldwide , would certainly object to being compared to a viral epidemic . but the company itself admitted in october to losing teen users . over 11m teenagers and college students have left facebook since 2011 , an analyst claimed earlier this week . digital consultancy istrategy labs released a study it says uses data from facebook 's own social advertising platform to come up with the shocking figures . experts believe that young people are increasingly abandoning the site to turn to apps such as whatsup , snapchat and others . the researchers analysed the rise and fall of myspace to test their theory , looking at the number of search terms over time for the side to develop their model . according to istrategy , facebook has 4,292,080 fewer high-school aged users and 6,948,848 college-aged users than it did in 2011 . late last year facebook shares went on a 24 hour rollercoaster after the company 's chief financial officer admitted that teenagers are losing interest in the site . shares in the social network soared around 15 per cent to $ 57.98 -lrb- # 36.16 -rrb- following the site 's latest quarterly earnings announcement , before suddenly failing to $ 47.40 . the dip was attributed to comments made by facebook 's chief financial officer david ebersman about a decline in teenagers using the social network site . ` we did see a decrease in daily users , especially younger teens , ' said ebersman on a conference call with analysts , although added : ` our best analysis of youth engagement in the u.s reveals that usage of facebook among u.s teens overall was stable . ' facebook did not release official figures about the current number or users who are teenagers or how substantial this drop was . another recent study found teenagers are turning away from facebook because of oversharing friends and concerns over their parents knowing what they are up to . it found they are turning to twitter and services like snapchat in increasing numbers - where they are sharing more personal information about themselves than ever before . researchers found a big increase in the number of ` selfies ' being posted , along with information about their school , city and even their mobile phone number . teens told researchers there were too many adults on facebook and too much sharing of teenage angst and inane details like what a friend ate for dinner . ` the key is that there are fewer adults , fewer parents and just simply less complexity and less drama , ' said amanda lenhart of the pew research center , one of the study 's authors . ` they still have their facebook profiles , but they spend less time on them and move to places like twitter , instagram and tumblr .
