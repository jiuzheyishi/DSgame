{"text": "a former miami beach police officer was convicted monday of reckless driving but acquitted of driving under the influence for a 2011 crash in which he struck and seriously injured two people strolling on the beach while joy-riding with a woman on a police all-terrain vehicle . the six-person jury reached the verdict in the trial of derick kuilan after deliberating just over two hours . kuilan , 33 , was convicted of reckless driving with serious bodily injury , a felony punishable by up to five years in prison , as well as misdemeanor reckless driving . party boy : kuilan was photographed with this bachelorette party before he struck two people while driving his atv . embarrassed ? kuilan kept his head down in court on wednesday . trial evidence showed that kuilan , while on duty and in uniform , had a blood-alcohol level above florida 's 0.08 legal limit to drive when he took a woman at a south beach nightclub bachelorette party out on the high-speed beach atv ride . but the defense also showed there was a second blood test that put kulian 's alcohol level below the limit , some five hours after the crash . ` he was not guilty of dui , and that 's what we 've said all along , ' said kuilan 's attorney , evan hoffman . miami-dade circuit judge marisa tinkler mendez will sentence kuilan at a later date . kuilan , who had been free on bail , was taken into custody following the verdict . assistant state attorney david gilbert told jurors during closing arguments that the two alcohol blood test results -- both of which would surely have been higher if kuilan 's blood had been drawn earlier -- coupled with the officer 's decision to take the atv out on a pitch black beach was clear evidence of recklessness , not just poor judgment as kuilan 's attorney contended . victim : kitzie nicanor , pictured , suffered a brain injury from the crash and her spleen had to be removed . vehicle : kuilan was driving this atv on the night of the crash that struck two people on the beach . ` without his headlights on , he might as well have had a blindfold on , ' gilbert said . ` can you get more reckless than that ? he was both impaired and reckless on the night of the incident . ' victims kitzie nicanor and luis almonte both testified , saying they had gone to ocean 's edge to watch the sunrise when the atv slammed into them without warning . almonte suffered a shattered leg and nicanor had numerous injuries , including a brain injury she said has left her unable to work . her spleen was removed , leaving a large scar . some of the women at the bachelorette party testified they initially thought kuilan and his then-partner may have been part of the club 's entertainment , perhaps even male strippers . they got the officers to pose for a party cellphone photo that was published around the world after kuilan was charged by prosecutors . hoffman noted that kuilan is also being sued in civil court by the victims , who seek money damages for negligence . hoffman said that was the proper way to resolve the case , rather than felony criminal convictions . no one testified that kuilan was seen drinking alcohol , hoffman said , and no hard evidence that he was speeding on the atv or driving it erratically . ` this case is riddled with reasonable doubt , ladies and gentlemen , ' hoffman told the jury . ` this is a reckless driving case where there was no reckless driving .
