{"text": "giving up chips might not be so good for you after all , new research suggests . a study claims that adults should make sure they get a daily dose of the vegetable oil that chips are often cooked in . the research revealed that basic cooking oil , popularly used for frying fish , cooking chips and roasting potatoes in millions of homes , is healthier than previously thought . basic cooking oil , popularly used for frying fish , cooking chips and roasting potatoes , is healthier than previously thought as it contains omega-6 fatty acid , linoleic acid . it showed that everyone should be getting up to four tablespoons a day in order to protect their heart , u.s. researchers said , after conducting 15 clinical trials on 500 adults . vegetable oil is , typically , made from plants like sunflower , corn or soy and used in both commercial , mass produced cooking and in the home . it is most commonly an alternative to animal-based fats and both cheaper and more practical for day to day cooking than expensive and trendy virgin olive oils , for instance . the new research by food scientists from the university of missouri suggests a daily dose , similar to the current average , is actually good for the heart not bad for it . vegetable oil , they say , contains an omega-6 fatty acid called linoleic acid -lrb- la -rrb- which reduces blood cholesterol levels and lowers the risk of heart disease . the results of their clinical trials on humans found no evidence that la ` promotes inflammation ' , contradicting a previous study that was conducted on animals , they said . the full paper , to be published in the journal of the academy of nutrition and dietetics is just the latest in the see-sawing of medical opinion about vegetable oil . such oils used to be welcomed as an alternative to the kind of lard and animal fats which had previously been used to fry and roast food . linoleic acid reduces cholesterol levels meaning that it decreases a person 's risk of developing heart disease . the boom in junk food from the 1970s saw many health experts claim people were consuming too much oil in their diets as they tucked in to burgers , fries and pizzas . it has also helped fuel the rise in sales of alternative but expensive trendy oils from virgin olive to walnut . lead researcher , nutritionist professor kevin fritsche , said humans respond differently to vegetable oil , adding : ` in the field of nutrition and health , animals are n't people . ` we 're not saying that you should just go out and consume vegetable oil freely . ` however , our evidence does suggest that you can achieve a heart-healthy diet by using soybean , canola , corn and sunflower oils instead of animal-based fats when cooking . ' the clinical tests looked at the bodily reactions to adults consuming a variety of different fats , including vegetable oils . it found the type of inflammation that leads to heart disease was most likely to be a result of too much animal fat rather than vegetable oil , said the researchers . professor fritsche said : ` some previous studies have shown that inflammation , which is an immune response in the body , can occur when certain fats are consumed . ` we 've come to realise that this inflammation , which can occur anywhere in the body , can cause or promote chronic diseases . ` we know that animal fats can encourage inflammation , but in this study , we 've been able to rule out vegetable oil as a cause . ' he added : ` consumers are regularly bombarded with warnings about what foods they should avoid . ` while limiting the overall fat intake is also part of the current nutrition recommendations , we hope people will feel comfortable cooking with vegetable oils . '", "summary": " people should consume up to four tablespoons of vegetable oil a day .   it contains omega-6 fatty acid linoleic acid -lrb- la -rrb- which reduces cholesterol .   it had been thought la promoted inflammation , but study disproved this .   the inflammation which causes heart disease is more likely to be caused by over-consumption of animal fats .
