fantastic article , and i am heartened to see it published on cnn ,  allison mckenzie said in an e-mail .  so many families and people are suffering under the incredible burden of dealing with mental illness , and it 's particularly difficult when it involves children .  many called the issue of mental illness the most important story of our time , yet one that is routinely ignored . they pointed out that children can now stay on their parents ' health care plans until the age of 26 , yet a mentally ill son or daughter can make all their own health care decisions when they turn 18 -- regardless of parental input . that 's resulted in our jails and prisons being filled with people with mental disorders , readers pointed out , and all too often our cemeteries , too .  the problem no one seems to address is when these kids turn 18 , we as parents no longer have control ,  e-mailed mia st. john , a world champion boxer who cares for her mentally ill son .  the parents will tell the

but was a master at hiding his struggle . since losing my son , i have tried to learn everything i can about depression and other mood disorders . i was shocked to find out how many people battle mood disorders and how difficult it is to get treatment .  sefcik emphasized another key point : mental illness affects rich and poor alike . the sefciks had money and resources , yet it was n't enough . the most poignant outpouring came from those who could relate to daniel . they shared very private struggles . most asked not to be identified , but said they wanted daniel to know there was hope .  i have a history of mental illness too , but am successfully functioning with medicine and years of support ,  one reader wrote in an e-mail .  i celebrate all the parents and professionals who quietly , bravely fight for the sick ones . they suffer when they help , but we all suffer if we do n't help .  stephanie and daniel are my heroes . i pray that we will be stronger and more compassionate after reading their story .  one of the most touching messages came from a mother who said her 9-year-old son was hospitalized last year for 16 days for delusions , depression , anxiety and suicidal thoughts .  i have learned a lot since then about his illness , and even more the startling lack of available mental health resources and treatment options , even in a large city ,  the mom wrote . the mother asked not to be identified , but she said stephanie and daniel 's story inspired her to put into words what she has been through . she wrote this poem , titled cherry 784 , that she said could be shared with others : . cherry 784 . we hid the knives . but you really only wanted . to fall from your window . nine years is enough . i 've had a good life . you told me during a visit . the one where you still were n't sure . if i was really your mom . we played basketball in the dayroom . and snuggled on worn bean bag chairs . with our shoes off and our hopes high . that the next day you 'd come home . i took weary walks between visiting hours . through corridors , concrete walkways . and parking decks in the august swell . texting 1a , 4c , 3d to myself . digital bread crumbs . for the evening return . the contraband i carry . fits in an empty locker . lift the phone . speak the code . cherry 784 . hold for the buzz . open one door . wait for it to close . so the other will open . you , always on the other side , anxiously waiting . reminding me i was 2 minutes late . -lrb- as if i did n't know -rrb- . and squeezing the remaining breath from my lungs . with your little boy hugs . i brought you fresh fruit in labeled cups . cantaloupe , grapes , oranges , and pineapple chunks . the scent embedded in my flesh from cutting . something sweet for you , my love . my bamy
