{"text": "the attention of people around the world was centred on lewis hamilton winning the spanish grand prix , but formula one 's intrigue involved a british boffin with an h4 pencil . as so often , the real stories occur off the track . so it is in the case of adrian newey , red bull 's peerless designer , whose services are being sought by ferrari . newey is thought to earn # 7million a year at red bull , meaning that to sign him ferrari 's president luca di montezemolo would need to be the man that broke the bank at maranello . that is something he would be willing to do . in demand : ferrari are courting red bull 's technical chief adrian newey in a bid to revive their fortunes . the italian team are in an awful mess - one of their cars was lapped in barcelona on sunday - and the flamboyant di montezemolo is personally involved in sorting out the mess . he has already parted company with stefano domenicali as team principal and replaced him with marco mattiacci , an executive from america who has extremely limited sporting experience . there will be further changes throughout the team - ` we need defenders and midfielders , not just strikers , ' as one respected ferrari executive confessed - but the significance of signing newey can hardly be overstated . he is , after all , the man behind 10 drivers ' and 10 constructors ' titles with williams , mclaren and red bull . out of sorts : ferrari 's kimi raikkonen was lapped during sunday 's spanish grand prix . but would newey go ? he was equivocal about the possibility when asked by sky . ' i do n't know , ' he said . ' i need to think about it . we 're in the middle of the season and i 'm just getting on with it . ' asked again , he replied : ` at some point i am going to have to think about the future , but at the moment my focus is getting in front of the silver car -lrb- the mercedes -rrb- . ' christian horner , his boss at red bull , was firmer but not conclusive when he responded by saying : ` it is an annual thing that there is speculation about adrian 's future but he has made his feelings clear to me about the team . in the pits : ferrari chief luca di montezemolo salutes the fernando alonso faithful in spain . ` he has paternal feelings towards the team and he is much more involved than he has been . the speculation is purely that . you can understand why ferrari would be looking . adrian has always enjoyed a challenge . ' newey , who still designs by hand on a sketch board , enjoys his life at red bull : the atmosphere is relaxed -lrb- but highly competitive -rrb- , with a college-like air in his design department . it was that freedom , plus plenty of money , that convinced him to leave mclaren and its straitjacket approach to join the milton keynes factory and build four world championship-winning cars . those working practices were sold to him by horner over dinner at the bluebird restaurant on chelsea 's king 's road . red bull are struggling this year but that is down to their under-powered renault engines rather than newey 's chassis . there is no sign of any strain in relations between newey and his team . it is more a matter of whether he is tempted to take on a new , perhaps final , challenge in formula one at the age of 55 . ferrari is alluring to anyone with racing in their soul .", "summary": " adrian newey 's services are sought by ferrari chief luca di montezemolo .   newey was behind a combined 20 titles at williams , mclaren and red bull .   ferrari have parted company with team principal stefano domenicali .   a move to ferrari could signal newey 's final challenge in formula one .
