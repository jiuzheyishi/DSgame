' general sir david richards , chief of the defence staff , pays a token rent on princess diana 's former apartment in kensington palace and can live there with his wife caroline for the duration of his time in office . the property reportedly costs the taxpayer # 256,000 a year to run . the first sea lord , admiral sir george zambellas -- the most senior officer in the royal navy -- has a luxury apartment in admiralty arch , just off trafalgar square . remarkably , none of these service chiefs is reported to pay more than # 750 a month to rent these properties , and there are many other such officers in luxury properties . they may also claim for domestic assistance and some enjoy the services of personal chefs and drivers . in an exclusive interview with the mail on sunday , mr davies described visiting an eight-bedroom house at the royal naval base in devonport , plymouth , which was maintained for entertaining guests by the rear admiral commanding ` fost ' -- the flag officer sea training establishment . the first sea lord , admiral sir george zambellas - the most senior officer in the royal navy - has a luxury apartment in admiralty arch , just off trafalgar square . he said it was fitted out with antiques and grand paintings like a country hotel , all at public expense . ` the rear admiral admitted he and his wife had n't liked living there so they had moved to a much smaller place nearby , but their huge house was maintained for guests of fost , ' he said . ` what we have is a relic of the 1920s class system in the armed forces that is perpetuated through a package of privileges and remuneration to senior officers which they could n't maintain in civilian life and is denied even to senior officials in the diplomatic service . ' mr davies also said many of these officers were doing little more than ` manning desks ' in whitehall and that one in three could be removed from the command chain without remotely damaging britain 's chances of winning future wars . he said : ` all three services are top-heavy with senior officers , even in comparison to the us military , which is hardly an example of efficiency . many are replicating each other 's jobs . ` we would be better off amalgamating the three services at the level of high-ranking commanders to end this duplication . this would mean the armed forces would n't need to retain and promote so many officers in order to compete for the top jobs . ' the mod 's ex-chief economic adviser , neil davies , said : ` senior officers say . they require official residences in easy reach of downing street so they . can be summoned to advise the pm at any time . in that case they could . be found a council flat in vauxhall ' . above , kensington palace . mr davies said politicians and civilian officials were reluctant to challenge the generals and admirals over their packages because they would have to put their own pay deals and perks under similar scrutiny . ` at the end of the last labour government a report was commissioned into these privileges . it was intended to highlight the cost of official residences and vehicles and the lifestyles but it was never published and effectively buried , ' he said . on procurement , mr davies suggested the mod was restricted by its relationship with the british defence industry , with companies such as bae systems enjoying a ` feather-bedded monopoly ' . ` bae won a contract to build the astute attack-class submarines after offering a price that it simply could not afford . so it went cap in hand to the mod claiming that it would have to default on the order unless the mod coughed up more money . bae are untouchable . ' an mod spokesman said : ` senior ranks do not just fulfil command positions in the three services , they also hold senior management roles . . . as well as positions in uk embassies , nato and other coalition headquarters around the world .

' the mod has been at the centre of some of the most public , and acrimonious , exchanges about the spending review , with the head of the army , general sir peter wall , warning that cuts could endanger soldiers ' lives . sir peter argued it would be dangerous to lose more troops when the army is already being reduced from 102,000 to 82,000 personnel . ` imposing more on us now before the last round of efficiencies have materialised properly in a balanced way would be very disruptive , ' he said . an earlier version of this article said general sir peter wall had an apartment at kensington palace . in fact his army accommodation in london is at a different location . nor does he have a country residence as was stated . we apologise for these inaccuracies .", "summary": " neil davies , ex-chief economic adviser , says up to # 1bn can be saved .   head of army , general sir peter wall is paid # 180,000 and has flat in central london as official residence .   general sir david richards , chief of .   the defence staff , also pays token rent on apartment at kensington palace - at yearly cost of around # 256,000 to taxpayer .
