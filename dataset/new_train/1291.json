{"text": "kevin pietersen 's autobiography was launched on monday and the former england cricketer has certainly divided opinion with his revelations . here , sportsmail experts nasser hussain , sir clive woodward and martin keown deliver their own verdicts on kp . kevin pietersen launched his autobiography on monday morning and here 's sportsmail 's experts ' verdicts . nasser hussain . what we are hearing from kevin pietersen all comes from england losing 5-0 in australia . you never learn about divisions in the camp when a team is winning . the concept of team spirit makes me laugh . michael holding will tell you that some of the great west indies players did not get on and shane warne will say the same about his great australian side but what they all had was respect for one another when they stepped onto the field . somewhere along the line that respect between pietersen and other england players and coaches has been lost . it makes fascinating reading , kevin is entitled to his views and makes some valid points . but the methods employed by andy flower that he condemns took england to the top of the world rankings and three ashes triumphs . sportsmail 's nasser hussain -lrb- left -rrb- speaks with pietersen -lrb- right -rrb- in 2012 at the oval in london . pietersen , with surrey at the time , gestures as he speaks to former england captain and sportsmail 's hussain . click here for sportsmail 's exclusive ! there is a fine line between bullying and banter . i have always found the way england 's bowlers respond to misfields as unedifying but i 'm sure they will tell you that they set high standards and challenge each other in this way . and if what we hear about pietersen 's attitude towards james taylor at headingley in 2012 , which kevin touches on in the book , is true then maybe that borders on the kind of ` bullying ' he now condemns so strongly . perhaps the lesson that needs to be learned from this affair is that peter moores and alastair cook need to keep an eye on the culture within the dressing room so that , if they gain success with a new england team , it does not all collapse around them because of a spectacular clash of egos . pietersen , whose autobiography was launched on monday , holds his head as he speaks to hussain in 2012 . sir clive woodward . i like kevin pietersen , he 's the kind of athlete i 'd want in my team . but i ca n't get on board with books of this nature . as a fan i 'm saddened , and as a coach i just ca n't believe it 's all got so out of hand . it just enforces my belief that unless you get it right off the field you have no chance on the field . elite sport is a tough place and conflicts are natural behind the scenes . our england team was at its best when a bit of sulphur was in the air , it 's important to speak out . pietersen stands and chats with coach andy flower -lrb- right -rrb- during a nets session at trent bridge in 2013 . that said , the personal resentment and vilifying pietersen 's book exposes is not a problem any team i 've been a part of has had to deal with . our team had a set of teamship rules -- behaviours we agreed upon together . these would cover all manner of issues -- many similar to those pietersen highlights . we even agreed never to write anything in a book anyone in the dressing room would take offence to . for all the achievements that england team made they have clearly fallen short in this area , and there 'll be more to come . ` how do you want to be remembered ? ' is one of my favourite lines . i ca n't help but wonder how some of these guys would answer this question now . pietersen has exposed various incidents in his autobiography and sportsmail 's experts deliver their verdicts . martin keown . you can not allow a culture to develop in a dressing room where you have cliques and people getting special treatment . so if england did put their bowlers on a pedestal , that is a huge failing of the management . the idea that fielders had to apologise to bowlers if they dropped a catch is really unhealthy . walking on eggshells and living in fear of people within your own team is mad . people know when they make mistakes , they do n't have to be told to apologise . a big man will do that anyway . being scared just means you make more mistakes . people need support -- not to be screamed at . pietersen has involved stories about his time with england and sportsmail 's experts have their say on it too . pietersen seems to have spent a lot of time questioning and criticising the england management but doing that in front of everybody undermined them . the one time i captained england , manager howard wilkinson told me if there were problems , i should raise them with him , not in front of the group . pietersen should have probably done the same . the problem with speaking out is that people get fed up and you end up looking the fool . if he had n't been so outspoken , he would still be playing for england . he has had a magnificent career . now he should move on or the bitterness will eat away at him forever . video pietersen blasts former england ` regime '", "summary": " kevin pietersen launched his controversial autobiography on monday .   sportsmail 's paul newman revealed pietersen tried to oust andrew strauss as england odi captain by attempting to woo coach andy flower .   nasser hussain , sir clive woodward and martin keown - sportsmail 's top experts - deliver their verdicts following pietersen 's claims and accusations .
