{"text": "a test used for heart disease is ` flawed ' and may be leading to thousands of patients being given the wrong treatment , an expert has warned . professor nick curzen said that x-rays for angina - a painful tightening of the chest - give inaccurate results in a quarter of all patients . the tests , called angiograms , involve patients being given a local anaesthetic while a long tube is inserted into their groin or arm up to the coronary artery in the heart . flawed : according to professor curzen , angiograms are inaccurate in 26 per cent of cases . a dye is then passed through the tube while a series of x-rays are taken which show up any blockages in the arteries . professor curzen , a consultant cardiologist at southampton general hospital , said the x-rays do not give a precise reading on whether blood flow is restricted . he said angiograms should be used alongside another procedure which involves inserting a tiny wire into arteries which measure the blood pressure . professor curzen carried out a trial on 200 patients which showed that angiograms led to the wrong treatment in 26 per cent of cases . during the trial patients were given angiograms and doctors then decided on their treatment . they then underwent the second procedure , a fractional flow reserve test , and doctors were asked if they would change the treatment . in 26 per cent of cases they did . faulty : the test is supposed to pick up arterial blockages such as the one above but does n't always get it right . professor curzen said : ` the results indicate management of patients with stable angina by angiogram alone is probably flawed and treatment would be much more tailored to the individual through routine use of a ffr pressure test at the diagnostic stage . ' he now wants to conduct a much larger trial in the hope it will lead to a ` major change ' in the way tests are done . about one in seven men and one in 12 women over 65 suffer from angina although it is also common in patients in their fifties . it occurs when the arteries supplying blood to the heart become narrowed resulting in a heavy , tight pain that can spread to the arms and neck . angina is a form of heart disease and patients may go on to suffer heart attacks and strokes if it is not properly treated . patients are given a spray or pills to take once an attack starts and other drugs to help prevent them .", "summary": " angiograms are inaccurate 26 % of the time says professor nick curzen .   professor curzen , a cardiologist , said another procedure is needed .   the results were revealed following a trial involving 200 heart patients .   flawed angiograms result in inappropriate treatment being prescribed .
