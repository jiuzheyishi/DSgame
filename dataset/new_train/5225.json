{"text": "filthy houses and flabby thighs are the things we 'd most like to banish in 2013 , according to new research . but although cleaning up and exercising more have been named britain 's top new year 's resolutions , most of us will give up both of them by february , as the average person sticks to their new life goals for a measly five weeks . other top aspirations for this year include spending less money -lrb- 26 per cent of respondents -rrb- , dieting -lrb- 21 per cent -rrb- and finding a new job -lrb- 16 per cent -rrb- . scroll down for video . some 29 per cent of british people plan to keep their houses spotless in 2013 , the same amount who have made exercising more their new year 's resolution . research by vileda revealed that . 29 per cent of brits plan to keep their house looking spotless next year - the same number that plan on exercising more . the top dreams for our personal lives include financial stability -lrb- 46 per cent -rrb- , losing weight -lrb- 37 per cent -rrb- and going on an exotic holiday -lrb- 22 per cent -rrb- . men appear to be more career focused than women , with 16 per cent dreaming of landing a new job and 14 per cent wishing for a pay rise . but despite 60 per cent of us making at least three resolutions each year , 49 per cent of brits fail to stick to them for more than a month . can you stick to your new year 's resolutions beyond february , or will you - like most of us - have fallen off the wagon by then ? the older we get , the better we are at seeing our dreams through to fruition with 36 per cent of 45-54 years olds keep at least 2 dreams for at least 6 months . londoners are most likely to make a list of their dreams , with 46 per cent of the capitals inhabitants setting themselves goals for 2013 , the welsh are least likely to make any with just 31 per cent pinpointing their aims for the coming year . brits also have big dreams for their homes in 2013 , with 45 per cent of the country claiming that they have plans to make improvements in at least one room of their home . the most popular rooms that will be getting a makeover next year are bathrooms -lrb- 38 per cent -rrb- , living rooms -lrb- 33 per cent -rrb- and kitchens -lrb- 32 per cent -rrb- . around 16 per cent of people say their top goal for 2013 is to find a new job , and 14 per cent of men would like a pay rise before the year is out . however financial concerns may scarper our plans for home improvement , with over half of respondents saying money would prevent them from following through with a re-vamp . when it comes to cleaning , the average brit thinks they will probably only last six weeks at their new resolution . some 6 per cent even said they 'll probably give up their ambition in less than seven days , while an ambitious 12 per cent aim for more than four months . although 46 per cent of people are dreaming of financial stability in 2013 , researchers say the best way of sticking to your resolutions is to be realistic with your targets and not plan a ` complete overhaul ' immediately . lindsey taylor of vileda said : . ` exercising , dieting and giving up things such as smoking or drinking . are all traditional resolutions for the new year . ` however , cleaning up the home is now . top of our agenda as well as cleaning up our lifestyles . many of us . want a completely fresh and clutter-free start to the year and as they . say , a tidy house equals a tidy mind . ' advising people on how to stick to their resolutions , she added : ` we all know it can be difficult to keep new year 's resolutions especially if we set ourselves challenging targets such as losing a lot of weight in the first month , or keeping a completely spotless home.be realistic with your targets and do n't plan a complete overhaul immediately . ` if so , you 're a better person than most . over two thirds of dieters will ditch their weight loss regime by the 15th of this month , according to a new poll . and weak-willed seven per cent of slimmers will give up by the end of day one . the optimum time for ditching the diet is around 11am on january 15th . with dieters claiming after two weeks and one day without any treats , . they often succumb during the morning coffee break . most people who decide to lose weight this year will have thrown in the towel by mid-january . out of those who manage to hang on past then , a further 15 per cent said they keep up the healthy . eating until the end of january , and 23 per cent claim they manage to stick . to their new regime indefinitely . how long will your diet last this year ? but in the naughty corner , 21 per cent last just one week , and 34 per cent until only january 15 . the survey of 750 adults by money saving website netvouchercodes.co.uk found that almost a third of slimming hopefuls -lrb- 29 per cent -rrb- chose to join a slimming club , claiming this was the only way they were able to stay on track and keep the pounds off . twenty seven per cent followed an online diet and weight loss plan , with the majority -lrb- 43 per cent -rrb- choosing to watch what they eat , cutting out sweet and savoury treats and alcohol . just one per cent opted to pay for a diet plan which includes ready prepared meals . one respondent said : ` losing weight is one of my resolutions every year . normally i watch what i eat but it never works . ' i get too tempted by the biscuits in the cupboard or even worse , end up finishing off my kids ' meals before i have my own . ` this year i 'm definitely trying a slimming club . fingers crossed that 'll do the trick and losing weight will never again be on my list of resolutions . ' steve barnes from netvouchercodes.co.uk , said : ` people do take weight loss seriously , especially after the excesses of christmas and the new year , but it seems most of us falter just after we hit the two week mark . ' f you 're the only one in your family trying to lose weight or the only person within your group of friends , then it can be really tough . ` it 's too easy to say you 'll just have one glass of wine or one chocolate - it never works . once you 've been tempted , then that 's it . ' i think it 's much harder if you decide to go it alone without any support . ` if you join a club or follow an online plan then you have other people to rally round when the going gets tough and you 're tempted to pack it in .", "summary": " sixty percent of brits make three resolutions in january ...   ... but half give them up after five weeks .   a cleaner house , more exercise and less spending are top goals for 2013 .   londoners most likely to make resolutions , welsh people the least .
