{"text": "president barack obama has struggled with sagging approval ratings over the last year , but the commander-in-chief 's numbers may have dropped further among active-duty troops . just 15 % of active-duty servicemembers gave obama a thumbs up in the annual military times survey and more than half -- 55 % -- say they disapprove of obama 's job as commander-in-chief . the president has struggled to gain the approval of troops throughout his time in office , but these numbers reflect a new low for obama , who finished his first year in office with a 35 % approval figure and only 4 in 10 disapproving , according to the military times survey . the military times survey is not scientific and relies on a voluntary response from the publication 's readers . president obama 's approval rating in the general population is much higher , though still well below 50 percent . in the most recent cnn / orc poll , he got the approval of 44 % of americans . the military times survey also finds a lower approval rating than other polls of americans connected with the military . a washington post / kaiser family foundation poll of veterans of iraq and afghanistan found approval of the president was lower than the general population , but much higher than 15 percent . 32 % of veteran respondents in that april survey said they approved of the job president obama was doing . for these reasons , the military times survey may be more useful to show to show trends . it has been asking the same questions of its readers for ten years . troop morale has slumped during the obama administration , falling to 56 % this year from 91 % who were satisfied with their quality of life in 2009 . more than half of american troops believe they are underpaid today . but the publication 's readers are more supportive of the social changes the president has enacted in the military . support among active-duty troops for allowing gay men and women to serve openly in the military has grown to 60 % three years after  do n't ask , do n't tell  was reversed . about 41 % of servicemembers said some combat roles should be off-limits for women . obama 's unpopularity among military times readers comes with sinking support for and trust in both major political parties . nearly half of the active duty servicemembers surveyed said they believe both the republican and democratic parties have become less supportive of military issues . only about 1 in 10 said the two parties  have the armed forces ' best interests at heart ,  according to the military times . the survey revealed another interesting trend in troops ' political identities , revealing that fewer identify as republicans and more are calling themselves libertarians or independents today . but that has n't stopped them from missing their previous commander-in-chief , president george w. bush . about two-thirds of iraq and afghanistan veterans said bush was a good commander in chief compared to 42 % for obama , according to a washington post-kaiser family foundation poll in april .", "summary": " only 15 % of active-duty troops approve of obama 's job as commander-in-chief , according to a military times survey .   that 's an all-time low for obama , who ended 2009 with a 35 % approval rating .   an all-time high of 60 % of servicemembers support gays serving openly in the military three years after dadt reversed .   only 1 in 10 believe democrats and republicans have their best interests at heart .
