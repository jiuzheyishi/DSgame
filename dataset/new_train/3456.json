{"text": "bernard hopkins was born nine years before the rumble in the jungle , the 40th anniversary of which muhammad ali and george foreman celebrated last week . hopkins took time out from a fledgling career of mugging grown-ups and being stabbed three times himself in the crime-ridden streets of philadelphia to watch film of the legalised fist fight beamed into us cinemas from distant zaire . just eight troubled years after ali famously knocked out the hitherto indestructible foreman , hopkins was sentenced to 18 years in jail for nine felony convictions . bernard hopkins , boxing 's oldest ever world champion , is two months shy of his 50th birthday . hopkins comfortably outpointed beibut shumenov to retain his ibf and wba world titles in april . hopkins ' victory over shumenov was his 55th in a career that has seen him fight 65 times . upon being paroled six years later , at the age of 23 , he replied to a taunt from the prison warden who predicted he would see him again soon by saying : ` i ai n't ever coming back here . ' hopkins had identified boxing as the means for reforming his life . now it appears he has discovered the secret of eternal youth . in atlantic city on saturday night hopkins will contest the 66th fight of his seemingly ever-lasting career . already , at 49 , he is boxing 's oldest world champion of all time . if he wins in the boardwalk hall this coming weekend he will be a reigning world champion when he turns 50 on january 15 . but not for him a soft-touch opponent to help him make more history . at this age when many sportsmen are reaching for the carpet slippers and regaling their grandchildren with tales of glories past , hopkins is taking on one of the most devastating punchers in the hardest of all games . not for nothing is sergey kovalev nicknamed krusher . nathan cleverly , who lost his world title when he was flattened by the russian knockout machine in cardiff 15 months ago , testifies : ` this man has serious power . he hits harder than anyone i 've fought . i fear he will stop hopkins and end his career . ' hopkins has re-styled himself as the alien as a testament to his ability to box into his 50th year . kovalev has only one minor blip on his record -- a technical draw . of his 25 victories , all but two have been inflicted inside the distance and only two others went beyond the fourth round . yet hopkins has hand-picked this menace for this iconic moment , in which he intends adding kovalev 's wbo light-heavyweight title to the wba and ibf belts which he already wears around his fat-free waist and six-pack stomach . alright , we have heard plenty down these remarkable years about the clean-living , strict dieting , hard-training regime to which hopkins adheres , not only when preparing for fights but every day of his life . ok , he rarely if ever weighs more than a pound or two above the 12-and-a-half stone light-heavyweight limit and forswears hard liquor , cigarettes and late nights . but kovalev ? hopkins will soon be half a century old , for heaven 's sake . the krusher is 21 years his junior . and yet , and yet ... when this match was made the first instinct of most of us , like cleverly , was to start praying hopkins would not be badly hurt . and yet ... this is not only the oldest but the wiliest of world champions . kovalev trains during a media workout as he prepares to face hopkins on saturday . kovalev has proved himself to be one of the hardest hitters in boxing . and while he talks about his spartan lifestyle keeping him young , he has to have an intellectual reason for choosing kovalev . the alternative was an equally big-money battle with another mighty puncher , one of whose victims is coming up to a battle of britain rematch with cleverly in liverpool on november 22 . adonis stevenson made almost as short work of tony bellew as kovalev did of cleverly and hopkins was close to agreeing a unification fight with canada 's wbc champion . so why , all of a sudden , kovalev ? hopkins , talkative man though he is , keeps his counsel . adonis also spells danger but hopkins prefers the krusher . could it be he has worked out that kovalev is the inferior technical boxer of the two and less likely , also , to have the patience to unravel the defensive labyrinth and complex traps which hopkins will bring to the argument ? it is reasonable to suspect as much . oscar de la hoya , the president of golden boy promotions in which hopkins is a stakeholder , suggests that his business partner is ` more powerful , just as fast and even more clever ' than back when he dubbed himself the executioner . hopkins has changed his nickname to the alien and kovalev says : ` i 'm going to hit him so hard i will send him back to mars . ' sergey kovalev dethroned nathan cleverly as world champion last year in a destructive fight . cleverly was in a bad way when he was stopped in the fourth round by the hard-hitting russian . six years ago , shortly before he retired , our own legend joe calzaghe outpointed the older and seemingly ageing hopkins . he marvels that the man is still boxing and says : ` kovalev will have to catch bernard if he is to make his power count . although i have to say it will be hard for a 49-year-old to keep away from trouble for the full 12 rounds . ' do n't bet against hopkins doing it . do n't count out another miracle of the aged , another blow on behalf of the grey community . do n't write off the prospect of one more mesmerising , time-defying victory by decision for the grand old man of the ring . fifty is a dangerous age . but for whom ? hopkins v kovalev will be televised live on boxnation late saturday night . we are asked to believe that the proprietors of strip clubs in las vegas have requested that the local cops help them ban floyd mayweather . this is the unlikeliest story of the week . the allegation is that some pole dancers were upset at being molested by the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world . now while mayweather is no angel , this one smacks of the ridiculous . check out the video of him on one of those nights out with the lads . he is there to be observed throwing hundred dollar bills at those naked bodies like so much confetti . so affronted are the girls by all that harassment that they can be seen ... smiling broadly . the first meeting of ricky hatton and kostya tszyu since their world title epic nine years ago has provided on object lesson in manners to today 's aspiring champions . the hitman is in sydney promoting one of his stable of fighters , sergey rabchenko , in next week 's light-middleweight title eliminator against former three-time world champion anthony mundine . hatton and tszyu , the formidable russo-aussie he forced to relinquish his world light-welterweight title by retiring at the end of the 11th round in the manchester arena , embraced each other warmly . both recalled the punishing ferocity of their clash , hatton saying : ` this second meeting is a lot less painful than when we hit each other with so many heavy shots . ' ricky hatton and kostya tszyu met up in sydney , nine years after their ferocious fight in manchester . hatton throws big right at tszyu during their world title fight at the men arena in manchester . tszyu gave as good as he got for most of the fight but failed to come out for the 12th and final round . hatton celebrates winning the ibf world title with his promoter frank warren . tszyu , who retired at the end of the greatest victory in hatton 's career and is now a moscow businessman , said : ` thank you , ricky , for making me realise i had to find something in my life other than boxing . ' hatton added : ` it was a wonderful fight but the way we conducted ourselves was just as important . ' gentlemen of the ring circa 2014 , please take note . another rival for the attention of the combat sport audience arrives on channel 5 on sunday week , november 16 . as the ultimate fighting championship continues to expand outside the us , so bellator promotions invade the uk market with a show which features a battle between mixed martial art legends tito ortiz and stephan bonnar . channel 5 is the only terrestrial tv outlet for boxing in this country . so the old game will be listening carefully when bellator chief executive scott coker says ` we will become a fixture for mma fans in the uk . ' but so will dana white of the ufc , currently the octagon 's main counter-attraction to the prize-ring .", "summary": " bernard hopkins is already the oldest world champion in history .   victory over sergey kovalev will see him reign at the age of 50 .   but the russian has devastating power , as nathan cleverly can attest .   ricky hatton and kostya tszyu met for the first time in nine years .
