' the . miz is a region of broken ice floes , hundreds of kilometres wide , that . forms at the boundary of the open ocean and the pack ice . predicting the scale of ice breakup requires an understanding of how far waves move into it . ` we . found that the retreat and expansion of the sea ice edge correlated . with significant wave height increases and decreases respectively , ' she . said . the aurora australis navigates sea ice in the southern ocean . dr kohout said that since the days of antarctic explorer ernest shackleton , it has been known that waves play a role in breaking-up sea ice , but this role has not been well understood . ` a two metre increase in significant wave height over a decade led to a two degree latitudinal retreat in ice extent . ' dr . kohout found that the largest increases in wave height occurred in the . amundsen-bellingshausen sea , where regional sea ice retreat is well . documented . similarly , the largest wave height decreases were in the western ross sea , where sea ice has expanded . dr . kohout said that since the days of antarctic explorer ernest . shackleton , it has been known that waves play a role in breaking-up sea . ice , but this role has not been well understood . ` our . results suggest that sea ice is vulnerable to changes in storminess . the southward shift in storm tracks over recent decades has resulted in . fewer cyclones at mid latitudes and more cyclones at higher latitudes , ' dr kohout said . ` in . the future , wave heights are predicted to increase everywhere at the . sea-ice edge in the arctic and antarctica . so it is conceivable that . this will accelerate sea-ice retreat . ' the . antarctic ice sheet is more unstable than first thought with a new . study suggesting melting began 5,000 years earlier than previously . believed . the . study reveals that shrinking of the vast ice sheet accelerated during . eight distinct periods between 20,000 and 9,000 years ago causing a . rapid sea level rise . during . one period 14,600 years ago , melting glaciers released so many icebergs . into the ocean that sea level rose 6.5 ft -lrb- 2 metres -rrb- in just 100 years . the . results provide the first clear evidence for dramatic melting in . antarctic 's and reflect predictions for the region 's future . it . also follows recent news that destabilisation of part of the west . antarctic ice sheet has already begun and could be ` unstoppable . ' the study was conducted by an international team including researchers from germany , canada , hawaii , lapland and australia . periods of rapid increase in iceberg-rafted debris suggest that more icebergs were being released by the antarctic ice sheet . the . researchers discovered increased amounts of debris during eight . separate episodes beginning as early as 20,000 years ago , and continuing . until 9,000 years ago . up until now , melting of antarctic ice sheet was n't thought to have started until 14,000 years ago .", "summary": " this is particularly true of waves higher than 9.8 ft -lrb- 3 metres -rrb- , study found .   in large waves , movement in sea ice went on for up to 217 miles -lrb- 350km -rrb- .   storms in southern ocean could accelerate sea ice retreat in the future .
