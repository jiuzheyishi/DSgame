{"text": "no-one can fault u.s. secretary of state john kerry for lack of effort . he has just wrapped up his 10th visit to the middle east in pursuit of a peace agreement between israel and the palestinian authority -- the most elusive prize in international diplomacy . kerry has a vision , according to u.s. diplomats -- to climb the mountain with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and palestinian president mahmoud abbas , and to peer down from the summit on the valley of peace to see what a two-state solution would look like . it is a poetic metaphor , but more than half-way into the nine-month timetable for reaching a framework agreement , kerry 's partners are still bickering in the foothills . the more pessimistic observers -- with history on their side -- say both the israelis and palestinians are positioning themselves to be able to blame the other for failure . kerry 's aim is to gather together all the issues --  borders , security , refugees , jerusalem , mutual recognition , and the end of conflict and of all claims  -- in this framework agreement , which would in his words  lay out the end-game ,  the parameters for a final peace settlement . the u. . s and its partners would then help the two parties hammer out the details . kerry himself has acknowledged how difficult the climb would be -- choosing another metaphor while shuttling through the region last week .  in the end all of these core issues fit together like a mosaic , like a puzzle and you ca n't separate out one piece or another ,  he said .  the last pieces may decide to fall into place , or may fall on the floor , and leave the puzzle unfinished .  kerry dropped hints about progress last week , saying after meeting abbas that talks had  fleshed out and even resolved  certain kinds of issues . u.s. envoy martin indyk will stay in the region to follow up on last week 's talks and the secretary himself will likely return within weeks . but at the same time , both parties are busy blaming the other for obstructing the process . netanyahu , with kerry at his side , accused the palestinian authority of continuing  unabated incitement against the state of israel  over the past six months .  a few days ago in ramallah , president abbas embraced terrorists as heroes ,  he said , referring to the welcome given to palestinian prisoners released by israel . borders and jewish settlements are likely to be the most difficult piece of kerry 's puzzle . the israeli government is expected to announce plans in the next few days for building 1,400 new homes in the west bank , a move guaranteed to infuriate the palestinians . a senior u.s. state department official said last week that  the settlement activity that has been going on has created a lot of questions on the palestinian side and in the international community about the intentions of the government of israel .  nearly half-a-million jews now live in settlements in occupied territory , and israeli sources maintain that the largest -- such as those in hebron and beit el -- would not be surrendered on any settlement . president obama laid out washington 's principles two years ago , saying that  the palestinian people must have the right to govern themselves , and reach their potential , in a sovereign and contiguous state .  that state should be based on the 1967 land boundaries -- before israel seized east jerusalem and the west bank -- plus swaps to take account of developments since . netanyahu shot back that a return to such borders would imperil israel 's security .  remember that before 1967 , israel was all of nine miles wide , half the width of the washington beltway ,  he said while meeting obama . many israeli officials insist that today -- in the face of growing instability in the region and a resurgence of militant islamist groups -- the jewish state must maintain a military presence in the jordan valley as the only way to defend the country 's eastern border , providing some strategic depth . and that presence , they maintain , could only be sustained by a secure road cutting through the heart of the west bank . some within israel 's coalition government even want to annex jewish settlements in the fertile jordan valley , potentially the bread-basket of a new palestinian state , and home to nearly 30 % of palestinians living in the west bank . the proposal is unlikely to go anywhere , but demonstrates the internal difficulties that face netanyahu in any push toward a final settlement . whatever is going on behind closed doors , israel and the palestinians seem in public no closer to compromise on other core issues . both continue to claim jerusalem as their capital . the palestinians reject outright netanyahu 's demand that they recognize israel as a jewish state , fearing that to do so would disenfranchise 1.5 million israeli arabs . israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman says he has an answer for that -- move the border so that the main concentrations of israeli arabs will live within a palestinian state . in kerry 's favor is a recognition among many israelis that the current environment may offer the best opportunity to strike a deal , with much of the arab world in disarray and long-term population trends threatening to leave the jews a minority in their own homeland . lieberman himself said on friday that kerry 's framework was the best israel could expect and  any other proposal from the international community wo n't be as good .  former prime minister ehud olmert chimed in , saying  there 's nothing that will change our lives so substantially , nothing that could negatively impact our lives , more than the existence or absence of a peace agreement between us and palestinians as soon as possible .  and in an editorial , the israeli daily haaretz said netanyahu -- and israel -- could not afford to be seen as the spoiler .  an israeli refusal would put israel on the south african track , banishing it to the punishment corner , a disgrace to the family of nations . an israeli refusal would endanger its intimate alliance with the united states , on which its national security and economic wellbeing are based . an israeli refusal would play into the iranians ' hands ,  haaretz wrote . kerry seemed to hint at this dilemma when he said :  the time is soon arriving where leaders are going to have to make difficult decisions .  through intensive diplomacy the u.s. secretary of state is trying to build momentum and to get both netanyahu and abbas to make a leap of faith despite the skepticism and outright opposition they both face at home . by phone , in person , through his support team , kerry is not giving either party a moment to drift backwards . the self-imposed timetable calls for a framework agreement to be reached by april . publicly , that remains the target . but one senior state department official says with masterly understatement :  from my 35-year experience on this particular conflict and the efforts to resolve it , it always takes longer than you think .
