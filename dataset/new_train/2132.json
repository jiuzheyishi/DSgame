{"text": "it may not be comparable to gilligan 's island , but the plight of the 74 members of the australasian antarctic expedition , aboard a research ship stuck in ice for more than a week at the bottom of the world , appeared anything but grim as 2014 approached .  we 're the a , a , e who have traveled far , having fun doing science in antarctica !  a dozen or so of them sang on a video posted on youtube .  lots of snow and lots of ice , lots of penguins , which are very , very nice !  the rhyme scheme then fell apart , but the festive mood did not :  really good food and company , but a bloody great shame we are still stuck here ! ice cold , cha cha cha ! ice cold , cha cha cha !  it was not all fun and games aboard the russian-flagged mv akademik shokalskiy . after bad weather led the crew of the australian icebreaker aurora australis to suspend efforts to reach the expedition monday , less than 10 nautical miles short of its goal , more than two dozen of those aboard the research vessel ventured onto the surrounding ice , locked arms and proceeded to stomp on the snow to mark a spot where a helicopter from the chinese icebreaker xue long , or snow dragon , can land . the helicopter , which can carry 12 people at a time , is expected to take the ship 's 52 passengers -- including the research team and journalists -- to the xue long . the australian icebreaker that tried unsuccessfully to reach the research vessel will send a barge to pick them up from the xue long . the 22 crew members of the akademik shokalskiy will stay aboard , the australian maritime safety authority said . but the timing of the rescue remained uncertain as weather tuesday remained bad . the failed attempt by the australian icebreaker followed one by the xue long , which made it to within 6 nautical miles of the trapped vessel when its path was blocked by ice . it returned to open water and remained in the area to provide support , said andrea hayward-maher , a spokeswoman for the maritime authority . the akademik shokalskiy has not moved since christmas . chris turney , an australian professor of climate change at the university of new south wales , told cnn that there are regular briefings on the status of rescue attempts , and in the meantime , people are doing what they can to keep busy . that includes yoga and spanish classes . the expedition to gauge the effects of climate change on the region began on november 27 . the second and current leg of the trip started on december 8 and was scheduled to conclude with a return to new zealand on january 4 . the vessel got stuck in the ice 15 days after setting out on the second leg . turney said the ship was surrounded by ice up to nearly 10 feet -lrb- 3 meters -rrb- thick . it was about 100 nautical miles east of the french base dumont d'urville , which is about 1,500 nautical miles south of hobart , tasmania . on christmas morning , the ship sent a satellite distress signal . but by new year 's eve , those aboard were showing few signs of distress .  up in the air , the chinese came , flew around once and left again !  they sang .  the french dropped by , but could n't get near . bloody great shame we 're still stuck here !  cnn 's josh levs and jamie crawford contributed to this report .", "summary": " some stranded on the akademik shokalskiy since christmas have sent an upbeat message .   youtube video :  lots of snow and lots of ice , lots of penguins , which are very , very nice !     the french dropped by , but could n't get near . bloody great shame we 're still stuck here !    a helicopter is expected to pick up 52 passengers , and the 22 crew members will stay aboard .
