{"text": "nakoula basseley nakoula , the man allegedly behind the inflammatory film  innocence of muslims ,  was ordered held without bail thursday after being arrested in california and accused of violating his probation .  he engaged in a likely pattern of deception both to his probation officers and the court ,  judge suzanne segal said in issuing her ruling . the preliminary bail hearing began with segal asking the defendant -- dressed in gray slacks and a white and yellow striped t-shirt , with handcuffs and chain around his waist -- what his true name was .  mark basseley yousseff ,  he replied . the judge then asked again , what is your name ?  mark basseley ,  he said this time , again without spelling the name out . he has used at least 17 false names , according to court documents , but is mostly referred to as nakoula . an attorney for the man then argued for $ 10,000 bail . attorney steve seiden said his client had always maintained contact , in person and by telephone , with probation officers who have been monitoring him since his 2010 bank fraud conviction . but the main reason nakoula should n't be jailed , his lawyer argued , was for safety reasons , saying the anti-islam film would make him a target of fellow inmates .  it is a danger for him to remain in custody at the metropolitan detention center in los angeles because there are a large number of muslims in there ,  seiden said .  we are extremely concerned about his safety .  making no mention of aliases , the lawyer added that nakoula had made no attempt to flee southern california and never would . assistant u.s. attorney robert dugdale told the judge that the man -- whom he referred to as nakoula or bassil -- had engaged in a  pattern of deception  and  a person who can not be trusted .  dugdale pointed to a probation report citing eight allegations in which nakoula had allegedly violated his probation . one of those was a requirement not to use aliases without permission from his probation officer , something the prosecutor said nakoula did on at least three instances : during his fraud case , when he tried to get a passport in 2011 and during the making of the film . dugdale said nakoula had deceived the cast of the film as well as his probation officers . the prosecutor also noted that nakoula was able to afford to make payments during the making of the film , saying it further raised concerns about the possibility of him fleeing the area while the legal case against him proceeds .  he poses a flight risk and poses a danger to others ,  dugdale said , alluding to the probation report 's recommendation that nakoula be sentenced to 24 months in prison . the prosecutor added that he had received assurances from the metropolitan detention center that nakoula would be placed in protective custody if he was ordered jailed , meaning he would not have contact with other inmates . the judge , who ordered a future identity hearing to determine the defendant 's actual name , cited the many instances in which he misrepresented his name . she also noted his  unstable  residence and work history , referring to the film project , as also among the reasons for denying him bail . when asked if he understood the nature of the hearing , nakoula answered ,  yes .  the judge then waived his right to a preliminary hearing and left open a future date for a revocation hearing . immediately following thursday 's hearing , nakoula was escorted away by the u.s. marshals service in a three-car caravan and driven two blocks to the metropolitan detention center . ` innocence of muslims ' actress sues filmmaker , youtube . earlier this month , nakoula met with a probation officer in the wake of a federal review of his five-year supervised probation in the 2010 case . nakoula was cooperative at that voluntary interview , authorities said . he was bundled up in a coat , hat and white scarf when he was escorted from his house for that interview . he was n't under arrest at that time . having served one year in federal prison at lompoc , california , officials could n't determine this month whether nakoula paid any of the court-ordered restitution of $ 794,700 , according to probation department officials and court records . while on probation , nakoula was prohibited from using aliases as well as accessing computers or any device that can access the internet without approval from his probation officer . iran blocks youtube , google over mohammed video . he came to the world 's attention after his movie , a trailer of which had been

territories , with some of them targeting u.s. diplomatic missions . on friday , a chechen court ruled the film to be extremist and banned it in the russian republic , according to information minister murat tagiyev . the film has potential to inflame sectarian hatred and may cause  destabilization of the political situation in the region , most of whose population is muslim ,  he said . as the protests raged , nakoula remained out of public view and ensconced with his family in their home in cerritos , california , southeast of downtown los angeles . actor : anti-islam filmmaker ` was

the film in its initial stages told cnn that a different name was filed on the paperwork for the screen actors guild : abenob nakoula bassely . a public records search showed an abanob b. nakoula
