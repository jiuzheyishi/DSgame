{"text": "the united states has n't abandoned robert levinson , the retired fbi agent described by his wife as the  longest-held american hostage ,  secretary of state john kerry said sunday .  there has n't been progress in the sense that we do n't have him back . but to suggest that we 've abandoned him or anybody ... is simply incorrect and not helpful ,  kerry told abc 's  this week .   the fact is that i have personally raised the issue , not only at the highest level that i have been involved with , but also through other intermediaries .  levinson disappeared in iran in march 2007 during a business trip , purportedly undertaken as a private investigator looking into cigarette smuggling . however , the associated press and the washington post reported thursday that contrary to what the state department and levinson 's family have said for years , levinson actually was working for the cia in iran . and a source involved in the matter told cnn there 's proof that levinson worked for the cia undercover , and under contract , while also working as a private investigator . white house : levinson not a government employee when he made iran trip . that allegation does n't sit well with sen. john mccain , r-arizona , who is on the senate committee on foreign relations .  what disturbs me is apparently they did not tell the truth to the congress . the cia did not tell the truth to the american congress about mr. levinson ,  mccain said sunday on cnn 's  state of the union .   if that 's true , then you put this on top of things that our intelligence committees did n't know about other activities , which have been revealed by -lrb- nsa leaker edward -rrb- snowden -- maybe it means that we should be examining the oversight role of congress over our different intelligence agencies .  iran 's government repeatedly has said it is not holding levinson and does not know his whereabouts . during a september interview with cnn 's christiane amanpour , iranian president hassan rouhani was asked what he could tell levinson 's family .  we do n't know where he is , who he is ,  rouhani said .  he is an american who has disappeared . we have no news of him .  mccain : cia did not tell congress the truth about levinson . kerry said the united states is still looking for proof that levinson is alive . a  number of different channels  are  being worked aggressively ,  he said . iran 's previous president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , said he was willing to help find levinson , and the family received what then-secretary of state hillary clinton described in 2010 as  proof of life .  in 2011 , the state department said new evidence suggested that levinson , who has diabetes and high blood pressure , was alive and being held somewhere in southwest asia . this year , a source with knowledge of the investigation told cnn ,  we have every reason to believe that he 's alive and that the iranians control his fate .  asked whether he believes the iranian government is responsible for levinson 's disappearance , kerry said he thinks the government  has the ability to help us here , and we hope they will .  mccain said he was  confident we are doing everything that we can  to get levinson released from iran , . he added that any negotiations in levinson 's case should also include attempts to free other americans who are believed to be in iranian custody . report : iran arrests alleged mi6 spy working for britain in iran .", "summary": " secretary of state john kerry says he 's raised issue of levinson  at the highest level    levinson disappeared almost 7 years ago on an alleged business trip .   multiple reports this past week suggest levinson may have been working for the cia .   mccain : if the government lied about levinson , it may be time to reassess oversight .
