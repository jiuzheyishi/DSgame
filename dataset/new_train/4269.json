'  protester jose acosta asked sunday .  are we going to get pulled over just because of a broken taillight or because of the color of our skin ? ... if so , is everybody going to be pulled over ?  kearny police chief joe martinez called critics ' concerns unfounded , saying the arizona law enforcement community includes a large number of hispanics .  we 've never had a policy of racial profiling ,  martinez said saturday night at a town hall meeting in casa grande .  in fact , quite the contrary , it 's been outlawed .  phoenix mayor phil gordon appeared at the rally in support of the protest , calling the law unconstitutional and  just plain wrong .   america is a country that is compassionate and that welcomes everyone ,  he said .  this is not what this country and this state was founded upon .  gordon vowed to take the fight through the state 's judicial system .  we 'll go to the state courts and we 'll go to the federal courts and we 'll go all the way to the supreme court ,  he told the cheering crowd .  i promise you .  gordon told cnn on saturday that he will bring up an item calling for legal action against the law at tuesday 's city council session . others were also vowing this weekend to legally challenge the law . the rev. al sharpton , along with leaders from the national action network and the hispanic federation , announced sunday that he will legally challenge the law . the law  is an affront to the civil rights of all americans and an attempt to legalize racial profiling ,  sharpton said in a statement after the bill 's signing friday .  as one who helped to make racial profiling a national issue and who has in the last year visited arizona several times to rally against these draconian immigration policies , i am calling for a coalition of civil rights organizations to work with those in arizona to resist and overturn this state law .  the national coalition of latino clergy and christian leaders , a group that represents 30,000 latino churches worldwide , also said saturday it plans to file a lawsuit against the bill .  in addition to this law being illegal , if this law goes into effect , we expect it to have a dramatic affect on the state with u.s. citizens , legal residents and others moving out of the state out of fear of being singled out ,  william sanchez , an immigration attorney representing the coalition , said in a statement . cnn 's casey wian contributed to this report .", "summary": " hundreds gather to denounce bill signed friday by gov. jan brewer .   new law requires police to determine whether a person is in u.s. legally .   it also requires immigrants to carry alien registration documents at all times .   kearny police chief joe martinez called critics ' concerns unfounded .
