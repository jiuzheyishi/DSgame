{"text": "in the days since michael brown was shot and killed , protests have filled the streets in ferguson . but beyond the signs , marchers and tear gas , there 's the pain and grief of a family . it 's a pain sybrina fulton knows all too well .  i wish i had a word of automatic comfort , but i do n't ,  she writes in an open letter to brown 's parents . fulton has been there . she , too , lost a son in a shooting death that also triggered protests and outrage . her son was trayvon martin .  i hate that you and your family must join this exclusive yet growing group of parents and relatives who have lost loved ones to senseless gun violence ,  she writes in the letter published in time magazine .  but michael is much more than a police/gun violence case ; michael is your son .  two and a half years ago on february 27 , 2012 , fulton 's son was shot and killed in florida by george zimmerman , a volunteer neighborhood watch captain . the case quickly drew national attention as weeks went by without formal charges . president barack obama publicly addressed the case , as he has in the brown shooting . and as is the case with the brown shooting , protests in support of trayvon and his family spread nationwide . zimmerman was charged on april 11 , 2012 . then in july of 2013 , he was found not guilty of second degree murder . in the brown shooting , a grand jury may begin to hear testimony as early as wednesday and decide on whether to return an indictment against the police officer who killed him , darren wilson . claims of character assassination . meanwhile , key questions in the case remain unanswered and a debate over what we do know plays out in public . police have released video of brown taking part in an alleged convenience store robbery , and a purported friend of the wilson called into a local radio station claiming that brown attacked the officer and disobeyed an order to freeze . it 's an account that a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation later told cnn matches what wilson himself has told investigators . however , both the video and the account of events contrast sharply with what witnesses and family members have said about the incident and brown 's character . perhaps in reference to this public debate , fulton writes the browns will  hear character assassinations about michael which i am certain you already have .  she adds ,  this will incense and insult you . all of this will happen before and continue long after you have had the chance to lay your son to rest .   honor your son and his life , not the circumstances of his alleged transgression ,  fulton writes .  i have always said that trayvon was not perfect . but no one will ever convince me that my son deserved to be stalked and murdered . no one can convince you that michael deserved to be executed .  fulton pledges that  neither of their lives shall be in vain  and ends her letter with a fiery call to action .  if they refuse to hear us , we will make them feel us .   some will mistake that last statement as being negatively provocative . but feeling us means feeling our pain ; imagining our plight as parents of slain children . we will no longer be ignored .  magazine : the aftermath in ferguson . complete coverage of what 's happening in ferguson .", "summary": "  i wish i had a word of automatic comfort , but i do n't ,  she writes .   fulton writes the browns will  hear character assassinations about michael    she ends the letter with a fiery call to action .
