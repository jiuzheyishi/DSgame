' liverpool council leader joe anderson said : ` anyone who knows liverpool will not recognise the city from the way in which this report is being interpreted . ` the comparisons are fanciful and it is absurd to say any part of the city is a no-go area . ' ahead of the publication of the incb 's annual report on drugs around the world , professor ghodse said urgent action was needed because parts of the uk were experiencing ` social disintegration ' . the iranian-born doctor claimed that birmingham , liverpool and manchester were experiencing ` a vicious cycle of social exclusion and drugs problems and fractured communities ' . ` in many societies around the world , whether developed or developing , there are communities within the societies which develop which become no-go areas , ' he went on . ` drug traffickers , organised crime , drug users , they take over . they will get the sort of governance of those areas . ` examples are in brazil , mexico , in the united states , in the uk , birmingham , liverpool , manchester , and therefore it is no good to have only law enforcement , which always shows it does not succeed . ` it is crucial that the needs of communities experiencing social disintegration are urgently tackled before the tipping point is reached , beyond which effective action becomes impossible . ` the consequences of failure are too high for society and should be avoided at all cost . ' one example of the scourge of drugs in liverpool was a family of drug dealers and their . associates , last november were jailed for a total of 82 years for peddling heroin and crack cocaine on the streets of . liverpool . lisa whitney and carol whitney , part of the ` drug family ' , were jailed for four and eight years respectively . as the net closed on the drug dealers , . officers found an sa80 assault rifle which had been stolen from army . barracks on salisbury plain in 2005 , around 1,200 rounds of . ammunition as well as a large quantity of class a substances . thirteen people involved in running a 24-hour drugs cash and carry service were jailed after months of surveillance . undercover officers from merseyside . police posed as addicts to make ` test purchases ' to gain the necessary . evidence as undercover officers filmed the footage . his comments were undermined by statistics showing the wildly differing crime rates between cities in england and south america . for example , the metropolitan area of rio de janeiro , which contains vast sprawling slums , saw 4,631 murders in 2009 , including scores at the hands of drug dealers . in contrast , there were 35 murders in manchester in 2009-10 -- a record low -- and 27 in the west midlands . the greater manchester police force . boasts a 96.8 per cent detection rate for murders . officials in rio . estimate there have been 60,000 unsolved murders in the past decade , . including 24,000 where the body was unidentified . senior police officers also dismissed . the claims . tim hollis , the chief constable of humberside and the . association of chief police officers ' drugs spokesman said : ` i simply do . not recognise the reference to  no-go  areas in the uk . it appears to . be set in the broader context of social cohesion . ' assistant chief constable steve . heywood of greater manchester police said : ` i am sure that the majority . of people in manchester will wholeheartedly reject any suggestion that . parts of the city are  no-go  areas . ` we . accept that drugs are a major driving force behind many other crimes . such as burglary , robbery and vehicle crime , and that is why we are . determined to root out all those involved ' . merseyside police said it ` absolutely disagreed ' there are any ` no-go areas ' in liverpool or elsewhere in the force area . illegal internet pharmacies are targeting . young people online through sites such as facebook and youtube , a . united nations drugs chief warned today . professor hamid ghodse , president of the un 's international narcotics . control board -lrb- incb -rrb- , said illegal internet pharmacies were becoming . ` very sophisticated ' in approaching young people on social media sites , . leaving them ` very vulnerable ' online . he warned young people to be aware of whom they were talking to and interacting with on the internet . ` disturbingly , illegal internet pharmacies have started to use social . media to publicise their websites , which can put large audiences at risk . of dangerous products , ' prof ghodse said . the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- has found more than half of medicines from internet pharmacies are counterfeit , he added . ` this has become really rather sinister now , ' he said , ` it is much more widespread than you can believe it is . ` international illicit pharmacies are using social media and they are . not just coming overtly as they used to do , advertising their selling of . illicit drugs to you , they do it under a variety -lrb- of different ways -rrb- . ` they use youtube , they use facebook , they attract you to their website . ... then when you go there you will see they are also selling illicit . drugs . ` particularly young people , they become very vulnerable in using internet pharmacies . ' prof ghodse went on : ' a few years ago it was direct , it was the internet selling all sorts of controlled drugs . ` but now actually they are using the social media , engaging people in a . variety of ways which in the first instance you do not see they are . marketing the drug . ` but then , in a very sophisticated way , they are getting the right . question on to youtube , on to facebook , and even chatting in the . chatrooms , they get engaged , and then bombard them with drugs . ' the incb annual report added that the illegal firms took steps to ensure . they looked legitimate , ` providing quotes and images of purported . medical doctors ' . but it added that the firms had turned to ` message board and social . network advertising ' after several internet search engines banned the . use of registered trademarks for prescription drugs in their sponsored . links . more than half -lrb- 58 per cent -rrb- of the 12,000 seizures of controlled substances . sent via the mail in 2010 were from india , with others from the us , . china and poland , and ` some of course in the uk ' , prof ghodse added .", "summary": " un narcotics chief : manchester , birmingham and liverpool are comparable to brazil and mexico for their ` no-go ' areas .   badly managed large scale immigration fuels the problem .   ` drug traffickers , organised crime , drug users - they take over '   celebrity use of drugs is helping to ` normalise use ' in society .   acpo says it does ` not recognise the reference to  no go  areas in the uk ' "}
