{"text": "last week 's presidential election should be a wake-up call to the republican party -- we can not afford to ignore a rising generation of 21st-century americans . going into the 2012 election , i worried that without effectively connecting with the youth vote , the gop risked losing the millennial generation for the rest of their lives . on november 6 , we may have sealed our fate . that 's because partisan self-identification forms in new generations like cement -- setting softly and hardening over time . after three presidential elections cycles of voting for the democratic candidate , there 's a danger that millennials will vote blue from here on out . they broke for john kerry in 2004 by 9 percentage points , for president barack obama in 2008 by 34 percentage points , and again in 2012 , by a lesser 23 percentage points . republicans can take cold comfort in the fact that the surge in millennial support for obama that democrats had hoped for in 2012 did n't turn up . the center for information & research on civic learning and engagement estimates that about as many millennials voted in this election as the last one -- even though a whole new cohort of 18-plus voters became eligible . opinion : my generation showed up . as gop pollster and millennial maven kristen soltis points out ,  young people are open to hearing a new message and new solutions . and they are frustrated . they did n't turn out in higher numbers for barack obama this election than they did four years ago . but they have not warmed to the republican party . we have not made the connection for why conservative principles are better for their future .  but there 's a silver lining , according to soltis : mitt romney improved with millennials more than any other age group over john mccain 's performance -- no other age group had such a dramatic swing . the problem , she acknowledges , is that it 's still not enough . obama beat the gop among youth by 4 more points than clinton and reagan won youth in their re-elections , each capturing the youth vote by 19 percentage points . for a generation whose enthusiasm has waned , winning the youth vote by 23 percentage points is still historic in modern american politics . david burstein , filmmaker and author of the forthcoming book on millennials ,  fast future : how the millennial generation is shaping our world ,  tells me that  with sustained increased youth participation in 2004 , 2008 and now 2012 , it 's impossible to say that young people do n't show up to vote . we 've proved our political muscle . politicians have been able to get away with paying little attention to issues facing young americans by invoking the argument that we do n't vote . now , they have no excuse not to address our concerns . ... millennials take participating in politics seriously and see it as a real responsibility .  where are all the millennial feminists ? that 's why i 'm stubbornly optimistic as i look to the future . my republican party has no choice but to reach out to millennials . and when republicans sift through the exit polls , we will have to confront our demographic deficit with latinos , single women , non-churchgoers and centrist voters . but here 's the hidden good news -- if republicans aggressively reach out to millennials , they will find that they can begin to address all their problems in one fell swoop . because the character of the millennial generation embodies the demographic challenges facing the gop . the millennials are the most diverse , least traditional , least partisan generation alive today . they are 40 % nonwhite , and hispanics are the largest minority population within the age cohort . by supporting the dream act , which allows a pathway to citizenship for millennials who are in the united states without authorization through no fault of their own , we reach out to both millennials and hispanics . only one quarter identify with organized religion , and they adhere least to traditional family structures . being the political party perceived as obsessed with limiting the rights of their gay friends is not a winning formula . millennials are concerned with national debt and the deficits . the message that previous administrations ' reckless spending -- republicans and democrats alike -- has amounted to  generational theft  that is compromising the millennial generation 's fiscal future can resonate . i had hoped that vice presidential nominee paul ryan would make it his mission to tour college campuses making an explicit generational appeal to millennials . this could be a winning issue for republicans to help bridge the divide , and while ryan did visit some universities , a consistent drumbeat by the romney-ryan ticket to compete for the youth vote did not occur . it was a lost opportunity . it 's not just about social issues . even if the gop were to embrace freedom to marry as being consistent with advancing individual freedom -lrb- something i 'd love to see -rrb- , we would not suddenly win over millennials . we need to make a compelling case for why conservatism can connect with this rising generation , explaining that our fiscal policies in particular will help build a more prosperous and less debt-ridden future for them and the country we all love . there 's still time . the 2020 election will be the first presidential race where all millennials will be of voting age -- with 90 million eligible voters -lrb- as opposed to this year 's 64 million -rrb- . we may have failed to connect with this first wave of millennials , but there 's no excuse to miss the chance to connect with this rising generation now . the gop can make itself competitive without compromising our core principles of individual freedom , fiscal responsibility , free markets and a strong national defense . we might have missed our chance in 2012 , but if we start now , the party , and the country will be better for it . a millennial says : stop trashing us !", "summary": " gop consultant margaret hoover says her party missed the boat in 2012 with millennials .   obama won the millennial vote by 34 percentage points in 2008 and 23 points in 2012 .   republican stances on marriage and immigration turn away millennials , hoover says .   gop should emphasize its strong points -- fiscal conservatism , national defense .
