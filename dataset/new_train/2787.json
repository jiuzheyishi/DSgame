{"text": "kevin chapman , the college graduate student who led the team that recently unearthed civil war artifacts at the site of a confederate prison in georgia , recalls two visitors who came one day to watch one of the digs . doug carter of fayetteville , georgia , and nina raeth of north augusta , south carolina , traveled in april to magnolia springs state park , unaware of each other and the bond they shared . carter brought a  fowling  shotgun that belonged to his great-grandfather , jesse taliaferro carter , who was a confederate prison guard at andersonville and camp lawton , site of chapman 's work . raeth , a great-granddaughter of a union prisoner who also was at andersonville and lawton , came out of curiosity .  it was kind of a magical day ,  said chapman , a student at georgia southern university in statesboro . since then , carter and raeth have become good friends , sharing research and family stories . jesse t. carter was only 17 when he went off to war . after serving as a guard he was wounded in battle in south carolina and ended the war at columbus , georgia . he died in 1924 . raeth 's ancestor , sebastian glamser , was a german immigrant who moved to little sandusky , ohio , a few years before the civil war . he served with the 37th ohio , company f.  doug has been such a source of information for me ,  said raeth , who grew up in michigan . her great-grandfather was captured in atlanta in july 1864 . after serving time in the prison camps , he was paroled in virginia . he died in 1911 . part of the family lore is how glamser tried to hang on while in prison . one of his few possessions was a lice comb .  he loaned it -lrb- to other prisoners -rrb- for a ration of food ,  raeth said . the descendants noted that both inmates and guards suffered late in the war .  they shared a deplorable condition ,  said carter .  they were both american soldiers .  chapman , 36 , said the chance meeting amplified what an archaeological excavation is really about -- understanding the lives and circumstances of the people who left personal belongings behind .  it 's huge ,  chapman said of the discovery of the stockade 's exact location and the first 200 artifacts .  this was a very scientific survey ,  said the summerville , georgia , native . chapman was the star of wednesday 's formal announcement of the major find . carter and raeth also were on hand .  he realized he was on to something that was the work of a lifetime ,  said mark musaus , deputy regional director of the u.s. fish and wildlife service , which recently hired chapman to work part time as an archaeological technician . chapman and fellow georgia southern students used strings , posts and grid patterns to work a tree-covered site on the grounds of bo ginn national fish hatchery next to magnolia springs state park near millen . in addition to the low-tech equipment , which included shovels , they also employed high-tech ground-penetrating radar and lidar , a device that studies soil beneath vegetation . chapman and sue m. moore , an anthropology professor at the university , said they did n't expect to find artifacts . their target was pinpointing the camp 's stockade . matt luke , another student on the team , said technology one day will allow visitors to use devices to get a virtual look at artifacts and models of structures . for example , a visitor to the dig site could use a smart phone that would bring in gps coordinates to show a model of the stockade wall . so far , chapman said , the students are unearthing many artifacts in clusters , indicating they may have been left in tents or shelters . the discovery at camp lawton is expected to boost tourism in economically struggling jenkins county as well as awareness of the anthropology program at georgia southern university , about a half hour south in statesboro .  it gives us visibility if nothing else ,  said moore .  i 'm just ecstatic my students were involved .  aptly , chapman 's background has elements of the military and of corrections . he served in the u.s. armed forces in bosnia , learning the importance of the small things , like the bent picture frame he found at the lawton site .  it reminds me of the things you left behind ,  he said . he also works part time as a bail bondsman at akins & sasseen bonding co. in statesboro and has worked at the bulloch county jail .  prisoners have not changed much over time ,  chapman said .  they 've always improvised .
