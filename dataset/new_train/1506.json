{"text": "you might need to dig out those sunglasses earlier than expected this year . scientists believe there is a 75 per cent chance that 2014 will be the hottest on record . that 's because the menacing el niño weather pattern seems to be ready to blow huge amounts of heat into the atmosphere . the image shows what happens when a el nino strikes surface waters in the equatorial pacific ocean . warm water anomalies -lrb- red -rrb- develop in the central pacific ocean . winds that normally blow in a westerly direction weaken allowing the easterly winds to push the warm water up against the south american coast . an el niño occurs when equatorial pacific waters are unusually warm . it can change ocean and wind currents across the globe , wreaking havoc on the climate . scientists in germany now believe they can forecast disruptive el niño events a year in advance , according to a study in pnas . they hope the forecast could allow countries to develop better strategies that can counter the devastating effects of an el niño event . scientists commonly forecast el niño , which means ` little boy ' in spanish , about six months in advance , but long-term predictions have so far been tricky . scientists in germany recently said they can forecast disruptive el niño events a year in advance . they hope the forecast will help countries develop better strategies to counter the effects such as wild fires , pictured in the philippines . meteorologists said the prospect of a 2014 el niño will be firmed up ` in the next month or two ' during an el niño event the trade winds weaken . warm , nutrient-poor water is not pushed westward and comes to occupy the entire tropical pacific ocean . the cold water is not forced to the surface and the coastal waters of peru and ecuador are unusually warm . this warmer water has a devastating impact on their fishing crops which rely on cool waters to thrive . the region also experiences an extremely higher than average amounts of rainfall . the name el nino is believed to have been coined in the 19th century after peruvian fisherman observed it around christmas . the word is spanish for ` boy ' in reference to the infant jesus christ . up until now , scientists have forecast the event by analysing water temperatures in the eastern pacific , along the equator . but because water temperature is strongly influenced by the winds blowing across the equator , predictions have been limited to six months or less . instead of analysing the water temperature in a specific area of the pacific ocean , armin bunde of justus liebig university in giessen , germany , and his colleagues looked at the atmospheric temperatures in all areas of the pacific . they then looks at how the temperatures in the el niño basin are linked to the temperatures in the rest of the pacific area . the researchers claim their method correctly predicted the absence of el niño events over the past two years , and forecast about a 75 per cent chance of an el niño in late 2014 . climatologist tim barnett at the scripps institution of oceanography in la jolla , told livescience that the methods the researchers employed were outdated . ` the techniques the researchers used made me feel like i was back in the 1980s and 1990s , ' mr barnett said in an interview . the warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the eastern pacific ocean are seen in this map of ocean temperatures taken by satellite in 2006 . redder spots are where temperatures are warmer than normal . a separate study has found that extreme weather events fuelled by el niños are expected to double . climate scientists warned that countries could be struck by devastating droughts , fires and foods every ten years . extreme el niño events develop differently from standard el ninos , which first appear in the western pacific . the extreme events occur when sea surface temperatures exceeding 28 °c develop in the equatorial pacific ocean . others argue that this approach does not look at the physics of the seas or atmosphere , but only looked for statistical patterns in temperature -- which they claim can always be found if you look hard enough . ` the risk of an el nino event in the second half of 2014 has increased , but it 's certainly not guaranteed at this point in time , ' said andrew watkins , supervisor , climate prediction at australia 's bureau of meteorology . mr watkins said early indications suggested that the weather pattern could arrive as early as june , though the prospect would not become clear until the second quarter . last month , a separate study found that extreme weather events fuelled by unusually strong el niños are expected to double . climate scientists warned that countries could be struck by devastating droughts , wild fires and dramatic foods approximately every ten years . an international team of scientists from the arc centre of excellence for climate system science -lrb- coecss -rrb- , the u.s. national oceanic and atmospheric administration and csiro , has spotted a link between global warming and extreme el niño events . ` we currently experience an unusually strong el niño event every 20 years . our research shows this will double to one event every 10 years , ' said agus santoso of coecss , who co-authored the study .", "summary": " event occurs when equatorial
