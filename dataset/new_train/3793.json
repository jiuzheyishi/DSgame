{"text": "smog swallows up the london skyline . the european court of justice has said the government must urgently do something to halt britain 's terrible air pollution . ministers must urgently tackle britain 's abysmal air pollution , the european court of justice ruled yesterday . the uk has repeatedly failed to meet clean air targets , leaving most of our cities clogged with pollution that is estimated to kill 29,000 people a year . the european court yesterday found that the uk was in breach of eu law and should have created plans to tackle air pollution in 16 cities by january 2015 at the latest . under existing plans , the worst areas - including london , birmingham and leeds - would not meet the pollution limits until 2030 , campaigners say . britain breached eu targets in 2010 for levels of nitrogen dioxide , a gas particle from car engines and factories which causes breathing and heart problems . it is still nowhere near adequate levels , and has repeatedly asked to be granted extensions to the eu deadline . the european court , which is based in luxembourg , ruled that the uk 's supreme court now has jurisdiction over the matter and must order the government to take action to meet the legal limits in a much shorter time frame . the government is also facing a separate # 300million fine for failing to meet the eu 's air quality directive on pollution . some 16 areas including greater london , greater manchester , glasgow , sheffield and the west midlands are currently in breach of the targets . the problem was dramatically illustrated in april when a thick smog enveloped the country , forcing people to stop exercising and schools to keep their children inside . environmental lawyers clientearth , who brought the case against defra , the government 's environment department , said the ruling is likely to mean rolling out london 's planned ` ultralow emissions zone ' to cities across the country . the plan , drawn up by boris johnson , will mean charging diesel car owners # 10 to enter the city centre and scrapping old taxis . clientearth lawyer alan andrews said : ` thousands of people die because of air pollution every year . this ruling will save lives by forcing the government to finally take this issue seriously . ' london 's st paul 's cathedral is barely visible due to the heavy pollution blanketing the capital . shadow environment secretary maria eagle said : ` this european court of justice judgement is a damning indictment of the tory-led government 's total failure to tackle the uk 's air pollution . ` air pollution is a serious public health issue facing our towns and cities , tens of thousands of lives are lost each year and yet david cameron 's government has done nothing to solve the problem . ` the european court of justice has now demanded that the uk take urgent action to address dangerous levels of air pollution . ' manchester city -lrb- pictured -rrb- is among the worst centres for smog and pollution in britain . maura gillespie , of the british heart foundation , said : ` this judgement means the uk government is finally being held to account for their breach of air pollution limits . ` breathing certain pollutants is proven to exacerbate existing heart conditions and put vulnerable people at greater risk of a heart attack . ` the public expect the air we breathe to be safe . officials must act now to improve the quality of the air we breathe . ' and friends of the earth campaigner jenny bates said : ` uk air quality is a national disgrace - tough measures are long overdue . ' the ruling came as the european environment agency published its latest annual air quality report , which showed that almost a fifth of people living in british cities are exposed to nitrogen dioxide levels up to 50 per cent above eu limits . a picture taken in 2007 shows factories in stirlingshire , scotland , belching out smoke . mp joan walley , chair of the parliamentary environmental audit committee , added : ` ministers have complacently carried on with business as usual and put off serious efforts to deal with the problem for another decade . ` it is not acceptable for ministers who live in leafy suburbs to tell people living next to busy roads in towns and cities that they have to wait until 2030 to breath clean air . ' a defra spokesman said : ` air quality has improved significantly in recent years and average roadside concentrations of no2 levels have fallen 15 per cent since 2010 . ` we have built on this by committing # 2 billion since 2011 to increase the uptake of ultra-low emission vehicles , green transport initiatives and supporting local authorities to take action . '", "summary": " government ordered to urgently tackle britain 's pollution problem .   the european court yesterday ruled the uk was in breach of eu law .   it said britain should have plans to tackle air pollution in place by 2015 .
