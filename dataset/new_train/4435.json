{"text": "a five-year-old ban on the use of trans fats in new york city restaurants has sharply reduced the consumption of these unhealthy fats among fast-food customers , a study by city health officials has found . in 2007 , the new york city board of health , spurred on by the administration of mayor michael bloomberg , adopted a regulation that forced restaurants to all but eliminate the use of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils and spreads , the main sources of trans fats in the u.s. diet . the ban appears to have had the intended effect . a new analysis of thousands of lunch receipts , collected at fast-food chains before and after the ban went into effect , estimates that the average trans fat content of customers ' meals has dropped by 2.5 grams , from about 3 grams to 0.5 grams . additionally , the proportion of meals containing less than 0.5 grams -- an amount generally considered negligible -- increased from 32 % to 59 % between 2007 and 2009 .  for consumers , the transition was seamless . most new yorkers did n't even notice ,  says christine curtis , a coauthor of the study and the director of the city 's nutrition strategy program .  and now we know that it has really made a difference .  health.com : the 22 worst foods for trans fat . the study is the first to examine the real-world impact of trans fat restrictions in restaurants , curtis and her colleagues say . and it suggests that health regulations at the local level can have a measurable effect on public consumption -- an important finding at a time when another pending citywide ban , this one on large sodas and sugary drinks , is generating headlines and controversy . the study included fast-food chains such as mcdonald 's , burger king , subway , kfc and pizza hut . although the analysis was limited to new york city , many of those chains have chosen to eliminate trans fats nationwide as a result of the ban , curtis says .  it 's a big health benefit for new yorkers , but really we 're looking at a much broader impact , as well ,  she says . restaurants and food manufacturers use partially hydrogenated oils and fats in baking , frying and food processing . -lrb- small amounts of trans fats also occur naturally in meat and dairy products . -rrb- trans fats have been shown to raise  bad  ldl cholesterol while lowering  good  hdl cholesterol , and even moderate consumption has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease . health.com : high cholesterol ? know the good and bad fats . as of 2006 , the food and drug administration -lrb- fda -rrb- has required food manufacturers to include trans fats on the nutritional label of packaged foods . but because americans eat more than one-third of their meals outside the home , this regulation addressed only part of the problem . the new york city ban , which was phased in between 2007 and 2008 , was the first of its kind to target trans fats in restaurants , bakeries and other food-service establishments . the ban prohibits restaurants from serving foods or using ingredients that contain 0.5 grams or more of trans fats per serving . -lrb- the 0.5-gram cutoff is a nod to the fda , which allows foods containing less than that amount to claim  zero  trans fats on their labels . -rrb- . the restaurant industry initially opposed the ban , arguing that eliminating trans fats would be expensive and would alter the taste and texture of foods . despite these early concerns , most restaurants were able to meet the new requirements by reformulating their recipes , reducing portion sizes and introducing new and healthier menu options , curtis and her colleagues say . health.com : easy food swaps that cut cholesterol , not taste . in the new study , published this week in the annals of internal medicine and funded by the city of new york and the robert wood johnson foundation , researchers at the city 's department of health estimated trans fat intake by comparing nearly 15,000 lunch receipts from 168 fast-food locations with the nutritional info for the corresponding menu items . at the time the ban went into effect , some health advocates , including the american heart association , expressed concern that reducing trans fats would lead to an increase in the use of saturated fat , which also contributes to heart disease . but that does n't seem to have happened . the average saturated fat content of lunchtime meals showed only a slight increase , 0.55 grams , between 2007 and 2009 . the study provides a partial picture of the ban 's effect , however . the researchers looked only at large fast-food chains , which are generally required to publish the nutritional content of their products , so they ca n't say how the ban has affected trans fat content at non-chain restaurants and other establishments . health.com : 10 states that consume too much fast food . the new study comes just weeks after mayor bloomberg announced plans to restrict the sale of sugary drinks larger than 16 ounces in new york city . while the two bans address different health issues -- fat versus sugar -- the soda restriction could have a similar impact , says alice lichtenstein , a professor of nutrition science and policy at tufts university , in boston . the trans fat ban worked because it gave consumers a healthier default option and did n't require them to make a conscious change in their eating habits , lichtenstein says . a ban on large sodas would accomplish much the same thing by eliminating an unhealthy menu item , although it will still address just one aspect of a much larger issue .  the biggest health threat we face is our total caloric intake within the context of our physical activity levels and sedentary lives ,  says lichtenstein , who wrote an editorial accompanying the study .  these changes are just small drops in that bucket , but we have to keep an open mind and try multiple approaches if we want to find more strategies that really work .
