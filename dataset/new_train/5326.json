{"text": "a 15-year-old is suing the icelandic state for the legal right to be called ` light breeze ' . she was baptised by the name - blaer in her own language - but the country does not allow babies to be called anything that is not on a government-approved list . a handful of other states , including germany and denmark , also have this rule . icelanders are generally comfortable with a firm state role , and abide by the personal names register , a list of 1,712 male names and 1,853 female names . identity crisis : blaer bjarkardottir , 15 , left , was given her name by her mother , bjork eidsdottir - but they were later told by the priest who baptised blaer that it had been a mistake . all fit icelandic grammar and pronunciation rules and officials claim they will protect children from embarrassment . parents can take from the list or apply to a committee with alternative ideas . blaer bjarkardottir 's mother , bjork eidsdottir , said she learned her daughter 's name was not on the register only after the priest who baptised the child later informed her he had mistakenly allowed it . ' i had no idea that the name was n't on the list , the famous list of names that you can choose from , ' said mrs eidsdottir , adding she knew a blaer whose name was accepted in 1973 . rock 'n' roll : the name elvis was recently permitted because it fits the guidelines - but choices such as cara , carolina and christa were rejected because the letter ` c ' is not in iceland 's 32-letter alphabet . this time , the panel turned it down on the grounds that the word blaer takes a masculine article , despite the fact that it was used for a female character in a novel by iceland 's revered nobel prize-winning author halldor laxness . given names are even more significant in tiny iceland than in many other countries - everyone is listed in the phone book by their first names , while surnames are based on a parent 's given name . even the president , olafur ragnar grimsson , is addressed simply as olafur . as a consequence of the ruling , blaer has no official name and is only identified as ` stulka ' - or ` girl ' - on all her official documents . this has led to years of frustration as she has had to explain the story at the bank , when renewing her passport and when dealing with the country 's bureaucracy . her mother is hoping that will change with her suit , the first time someone has challenged a names committee decision in court . although the law has become more relaxed in recent years - with the name elvis permitted as fitting the guidelines - choices such as cara , carolina , cesil , and christa have been rejected outright because the letter ` c ' is not part of iceland 's 32-letter alphabet . ` the law is pretty straightforward so in many cases it 's clearly going to be a yes or a no , ' said agusta thorbergsdottir , the head of the panel of three appointed by the government to a four-year term . other cases are more subjective . ` what one person finds beautiful , another person may find ugly , ' she acknowledged , pointing to ` satania ' as one unacceptable case because it was deemed too close to ` satan . ' the board also has veto power over people who want to change their names later in life - rejecting , for instance , middle names like zeppelin and x. 1 . elvis -lrb- sweden -rrb- . 2 . superman -lrb- sweden -rrb- . 3 . 4real -lrb- new zealand . 4 . carolina -lrb- iceland -rrb- . 5 . tom -lrb- portugal -rrb- . 6 . friday -lrb- italy -rrb- . 7 . bridge -lrb- norway -rrb- . 8 . @ -lrb- china -rrb- . 9 . anus -lrb- denmark -rrb- . 10 . devil -lrb- japan -rrb- . 1 . elvis -lrb- iceland -rrb- . 2 . superman -lrb- new zealand -rrb- . 3 . gandalf -lrb- uk -rrb- . 4 . king -lrb- us -rrb- . 5 . dear pineapple -lrb- dominican republic -rrb- . 6 . speedy -lrb- germany -rrb- . 7 . facebook -lrb- egypt -rrb- . 8 . like -lrb- israel -rrb- . 9 . bitter -lrb- argentina -rrb- . 10 . monkey -lrb- australia -rrb- . when the artist birgir orn thoroddsen applied to have his name legally changed to curver , which he had used in one form or another since age 15 , he said he knew full well the committee would reject his application . ' i was inspired by prince who changed his name to the artist formerly known as prince and puff daddy who changed his to p. diddy and then diddy with seemingly little thought or criticism , ' he said . ' i applied to the committee , but of course i got the  no  that i expected . ' on his 30th birthday , he bought a full-page advertisement that read , ` from february 1 , 2006 , i hereby change my name to curver thoroddsen . i ask the nation , my friends and colleagues to respect my decision . ' he added : ' i can understand a clause to protect children from being named something like  dog poo  , but it is strange that an adult can not change his name to what he truly wants . mrs eidsdottir said she is prepared to take the case all the way to the country 's supreme court if a court does n't overturn the commission decision on january 25 . ` so many strange names have been allowed , which makes this even more frustrating because blaer is a perfectly icelandic name , ' said mrs eidsdottir . ` it seems like a basic human right to be able to name your child what you want , especially if it does n't harm your child in any way . ` and my daughter loves her name .
