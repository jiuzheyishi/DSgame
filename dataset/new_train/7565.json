{"text": "steven phillips spent 24 years in a texas prison for a string of sexual assaults it was later determined he did n't commit . for his decades of unjust incarceration , the state of texas awarded him nearly $ 6million in compensation after his august , 2009 release , which is in accordance with a relatively new texas law that specifies the amount of compensation exonerated prisoners are to receive . then came the legal bills - his attorneys charged him more than $ 1million for work they claim to have done to lobby texas lawmakers to increase the amount of compensation for exonerees . then came his ex-wife . justice delayed : steven phillips spent 24 years in prison for crimes he did n't commit . he was awarded $ 6million for his time in prison - and now his ex-wife wants a piece of the action . phillips and his former bride , traci tucker , were expecting their first child in 1982 , when phillips was first charged in the case that ultimately would send him to prison for more than two decades . they divorced nearly 10 years later , in 1992 , after phillips says they ` grew apart . ' now the two are engaged in an ongoing legal battle over compensation she claims she is owed for wages lost by her former husband 's incarceration .  he was a victim of a wrongful justice system , and his family was also ,  tucker tells the texas tribune . last year , a dallas county judge awarded tucker more than $ 150,000 of phillips ' compensation , a ruling phillips has since appealed . the case is likely headed to the texas supreme court , where justices will determine what - if any - sort of compensation former spouses of exonerated prisoners should receive . in 2009 , the texas legislature passed the tim cole act , which raised the compensation for exonerated prisoners to $ 160,000 for each year a person was wrongfully imprisoned . for the 24 years phillips spent behind bars , he received a lump-sum payment of more than $ 2million . additionally , he will receive a monthly annuity of about $ 11,000 , as well as medical and education benefits from the state . compensation : traci tucker feels she is owed compensation for the 24 years her ex-husband spent in prison . but phillips contends that the compensation is not for lost wages . rather , he claims in his appeal , it 's a mandatory payment he is owed under the law for his time spent behind bars . texas state senator rodney ellis , one of the architects of the tim cole act , seems to agree . in an affidavit filed in the case , ellis writes that the legislature never intended to compensate exonerees for lost wages ; otherwise it would have been based on their income prior to their incarceration and be subject to taxes -lrb- as the law is written , compensation for exonerees is tax-free -rrb- . ellis notes that the legislature recognized that a man can not support his children while in prison , which is ` we drafted the compensation statute to include any child support payments and interest on child support arrearage that are owed by the exoneree . ' the affidavit was not allowed into evidence . after winning his freedom , phillips is back in court fighting for compensation . another of the law 's architects , state senator rafael anchia , says lawmakers had failed to consider former spouses of exonerees when drafting the law . ` this is an example of the law of unintended consequences , ' he says ` we did not think about entitlement in prison . ' regardless of the law , tucker says she had every intention of sticking it out with phillips while he was in prison .  to me , marriage was for life , and i was going to be with him forever , . and we were going to get through this -- or so i thought ,  she says . prior to the divorce , tucker claims she visited phillips frequently and provided him with money to buy things in the prison 's commissary . at his trial , tucker was phillips ' star witness . the string of sexual assaults for which phillips was wrongly convicted happened in 1982 . several women were attacked and forced to perform sex acts at gun point . at least two of the victims wrongly identified phillips . tucker provided phillips ' alibi , testifying that he could n't be the person committing the assaults because she was with him when some of the assaults took place . phillips was convicted anyway and sentenced to two 30-year prison sentences . he subsequently pleaded guilty to several other , similar crimes to avoid what would likely have been a life sentence had he been found guilty . in 2001 , phillips began learning about dna and - with the help of the innocence project - was able to have his dna tested against dna found at the scenes of crimes supposedly committed by him . the dna did n't match . however , it did match a convicted sex criminal sydney alvin goodyear . ` this is one of the worst cases of tunnel vision we 've ever seen . police . seized on steven phillips as a suspect and refused to see mounting . evidence that someone else actually committed these crimes , ' said . innocence project co-director barry scheck . ` sidney goodyear was a one-man crime spree who could have . been stopped much sooner if police had followed the evidence instead of . locking onto an innocent man . ' after the dallas crimes for which . phillips was wrongfully convicted , goodyear committed at least 16 other . sexual assaults and related offenses in multiple states . of the lawsuit and inflated bill from his attorneys , phillips - who says he has no ill-will against his ex - sums his situation up as follows : ` when the cheese is on the table , the rats come out . '", "summary": " steven phillips was wrongly convicted of a string of sexual assaults he did n't commit .   dna evidence cleared him of any wrongdoing in 2008 .   as compensation for his time in prison , the state of texas will pay him about $ 6million .
