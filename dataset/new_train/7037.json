' a met office spokesman said what we were experiencing was indeed a ` typical british summer ' . he said : ` the weather can be best summed up over the course of the day as quite unsettled , a few places experiencing dry , bright spells , and temperatures will be quite decent when the sun does come out - with highs of around 22 degrees . ` there is rain clearing out of scotland , heading into the south west moving along the south coast into the afternoon - turning into heavy rain throughout the evening . ` there will also be more rain overnight in places and it will windy as well along the western coast , with gusts of between 35-40mph . a sea of red as giant poppies shine in the sun at bamburgh in northumberland . the glorious conditions experienced last weekend , however , already seem like a distant memory . but met forecasters say there will still be some ` pockets of fine weather ' , it just depends ` where and when you ` catch them . ` there is a lot of weather going on and it is looking quite unsettled . jet streams are belts of . fast flowing , narrow air currents found in the atmosphere , formed near . air masses with significantly different temperatures . they are responsible for moving weather around the latitudes . the . polar jet stream , which is the most northerly jet stream , affects the . uk , and tends to be further south in the winter and further north in the . summer . recently , the jet stream has been further south - which is why the uk has experienced such wet summers . a . band of high pressure is blocking the path of the jet stream , meaning . that the present weather conditions will stay until this pressure moves . ` the jet stream is a narrow band of fast moving wind high up in the atmosphere , which effectively can steer in low pressure systems off the atlantic which then get caught up in this area . ` where that jet stream sits is important . if it is to the north , we get settled conditions . ` to the south we get unsettled conditions sent to us . ` at the moment it is sitting more or less over us or just to the south . ` we will see some bright spells in between , where it is sunny with some pretty decent temperatures , but the weather is moving through quite quickly . ` it really depends on ` where and when ' if you are hoping to see better weather . ` it is typical british weather - with areas of sunshine and showers .
