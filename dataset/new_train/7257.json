{"text": "unhappy : andrew mitchell with the bike at the centre of the plebgate affair . a diplomatic protection officer and a middle-aged woman were arrested yesterday over the alleged ` plebgate ' plot to discredit former tory minister andrew mitchell . in all , six people -- four police and two others -- have been detained by operation alice detectives investigating claims that a conspiracy cost the former chief whip his job . mr mitchell was forced to resign after allegations he was aggressive towards officers and called them ` plebs ' when they would not let him take his bicycle through the main downing street gate in september . but a channel 4 investigation cast . doubt on the police account . among other things it revealed that cctv . footage disproved the claim that a large group of tourists were outside . the gate during the row . scotland . yard said the 48-year-old policeman arrested yesterday is being . questioned on suspicion of misconduct in public office . the woman , aged . 49 , is suspected of assisting an offender . both were held following . ` fresh information ' given to operation alice officers on june 4 . david . davis mp , a friend of mr mitchell , wrote to the independent police . complaints commission on that day highlighting evidence which ` strongly . reinforces the case that a conspiracy took place ' . in his letter to the ipcc , mr davis . referred to documents lodged by the sun newspaper in defence of a libel . action taken against them by mr mitchell . in . them , the paper refers to a call it received the morning after the . incident from an anonymous woman who described herself as a tourist . she . was said to have overheard mitchell saying to police officers : ` you 're . f ****** morons -- you think you run the country , well you do n't . ' but mr davis pointed out to the ipcc that video evidence showed ` there were no civilian witnesses in earshot of any exchange ' . he added : ` the only possible explanation therefore is that this bogus witness was yet another police officer masquerading as a civilian , or a civilian put up to it by one of the police officers who was aware of the original incident . ' last night mr davis said : ` all i was doing was what you would expect any decent policeman to do . looking at the facts with a cool forensic eye . ' the arrested policeman had previously been issued with a regulation 15 notice , served following an alleged breach of professional standards . he has been on restricted duties but will now be suspended . mischief : crispin blunt mp suggested mischievously that broadcaster channel 4 should be put in charge of the investigation . in a further development , the mail on sunday has learned that detectives have followed the advice of another tory minister and turned to channel 4 for help . last week crispin blunt mp stood up in the commons and suggested mischievously that the broadcaster should be put in charge of the investigation . he said : ` the channel 4 dispatches programme took 10 days to establish that the video record was completely at odds with the police account of events . ` since the police have interviewed 800 officers , spent # 144,000 and taken eight months apparently to go nowhere , might it be an idea to invite channel 4 's dispatches to be put in charge of the investigation , as it appears more effective and would certainly be more independent ? ' two days after mr blunt 's comments detective superintendent steve williams wrote to channel 4 's political editor michael crick requesting emails and communications with keith wallis , 52 , the officer channel 4 first contacted six months ago . mr wallis , from ruislip , middlesex , was arrested in january on suspicion of misconduct in public office . revealed : dispatches and channel 4 news revealed cctv footage contradicted claims that onlookers had been shocked by the incident as it showed just one , uninterested , man walking past . under investigation : the cctv footage showed an exchange that raised questions about the description in police logs leaked to the media . the letter said the met had sent a report to the crown prosecution service but wished to identify all lines of enquiry . it also asked for communications with any of wallis 's associates . channel 4 is understood to be considering how to respond . the events date from september 19 , 2012 , when police on duty in downing street refused to open the gate for andrew mitchell to leave by bike . according to a police log leaked to the media later , mr mitchell is said to have told the police to ` learn your f ****** place ' ; that they did n't ` run this f ****** government ' , and that they were ` f ****** plebs ' . but in december dispatches and channel 4 news revealed cctv footage that contradicted the account in the leaked logs . reports said the log mentioned eyewitnesses who were ` visibly shocked ' . but the footage shows just one man wandering past , who did n't appear to show particular interest in the incident . the dispatches programme also revealed an email was sent from a man in ruislip to his mp john randall -- who coincidentally was and still is deputy chief whip -- with an account very similar to the police log published in the media . denial : while mr mitchell apologised for using profanity , he has always denied calling the officers ` plebs ' and ` morons ' , or telling them to ` know their place ' friends of mr mitchell said last night that scotland yard had many questions to answer about the case . ` if it has taken eight months to turn to such an obvious line of inquiry it must be clear to everyone that the met is dragging its heels , ' said one . while mr mitchell apologised for using profanity , he has always denied calling the officers ` plebs ' and ` morons ' , or telling them to ` know their place ' . operation alice was launched in december to investigate whether there was a conspiracy to frame mr mitchell . sir bernard hogan-howe , the metropolitan police commissioner , originally stood by his officers , saying they had ` accurately reported what happened ' . but he was later forced to promise that he would preside over a ` ruthless search for the truth ' about the ` plebgate ' confrontation that led to mr mitchell 's resignation .", "summary": " diplomatic protection officer , 48 , and woman , 49 , questioned over plot .   tory minister andrew mitchell was forced to resign after allegations .   channel 4 investigation cast doubt on police account .
