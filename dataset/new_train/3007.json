{"text": "are you about to turn 29 , 39 , 49 or 59 ? then you could be on the cusp of making big decisions , a study has found , with people more likely to make changes when they approach a milestone birthday . researchers analysed the responses of 42,000 adults from more than 100 countries who completed a survey about their values between 2010 and 2014 . they found that people with an age ending in nine were more likely to make changes ` that suggest a search for meaning ' such as taking up marathon running or joining an extramarital dating site . lead author adam alter , from new york university , said : ` people audit the meaningfulness of their lives as they approach a new decade . people tend to either conclude happily that their lives are meaningful or they decide their lives lack meaning . ' the team discovered that some people will engage in ` productive behaviours ' , such as taking up a new sport . but professor alter added : ` in contrast to this adaptive behaviour , some people might struggle to come to terms with the conclusion that their lives lack meaning . they might seek a socially damaging extramarital affair . ' researchers found that men who have an age ending in nine - 29 , 39 , 49 - were much more likely to register for an extramarital dating site than men of other ages . over a series of studies , the experts found that these so-called ` 9-enders ' were particularly prone to behaviour ` that suggests a search for , or crisis in meaning ' a poll of 2,000 women found those who cheat are often following in their own mother 's footsteps . according to the research by illicit encounters site , seven out of ten women who cheat on their husbands have mothers who were unfaithful too . many women feel their mother 's infidelity gives them ` permission ' to cheat - and they consequently take their marriage vows less seriously . men are also more likely to stray if their fathers were philanderers - but not to the same extent as women . for the first part of their study , the researchers analysed the responses of 42,000 adults who completed the world values survey - a large-scale questionnaire completed by people from more than 100 countries between 2010 and 2014 . they found that 9-enders reported thinking and questioning the meaning of life more than other respondents . subsequently , the researchers obtained data from an online dating site that targets people who are already in a relationship and found that there were far more 9-ender men - 18 per cent more - than would be expected by chance . further analysis found a similar , though less-pronounced , pattern of results for women . using government data , the researchers then examined the number of suicides per 100,000 individuals aged between 25 and 64 across the u.s. from 2000 to 2011 . the researchers also found that many people entering a new decade tend to engage in ` productive meaning-seeking behaviours ' , such as taking up a new sport . they randomly chose 500 first-time participants in one of five major marathons -lrb- stock image -rrb- . of that sample , 74 were 9-enders -- ` an overrepresentation of 48 per cent ' they found a small , but statistically significant , increase in the number of 9-enders committing suicide compared to other ages . the researchers also found , however , that many people entering a new decade tend to engage in ` productive meaning-seeking behaviours ' , such as taking up a new sport . they randomly chose 500 first-time participants in one of five major marathons in the us . of that sample , 74 were 9-enders -- ` an overrepresentation of 48 per cent ' . they also analysed another set of marathon runners ' race times and found that people ran an average 2.3 per cent faster in their 9-end year than the two years before or after . this suggested that they were more motivated and trained harder as they approached their milestone birthday , the researchers said . the research paper was published in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences .", "summary": " researchers studied answers of 42,000 adults from world values survey .   they also tracked how many people registered for extramarital dating sites .   men who have an age ending in nine - 29 , 39 , 49 - were much more likely to register for an extramarital dating site than men of other ages .   these so-called ' 9-enders ' were more likely to question the meaning of life .   study also spotted a trend for 9-enders to take up sports or run marathons .
