{"text": "washington whatever you think of his politics , house speaker john boehner has a great sense of humor . so perhaps he wo n't mind the question framed this way : what happened , in the course of just one week , to make speaker boehner the miss emily litella of immigration reform ? -lrb- if i have lost you already , take a moment and search the web to understand the reference -- you wo n't regret it . -rrb- .  never mind ,  was the trademark closing line of a character the late gilda radner made famous as a cast member on  saturday night live .  and  never mind ,  is what speaker boehner might just as well have said thursday when he all but declared the immigration reform legislative debate dead for 2014 .  listen , there 's widespread doubt about whether this administration can be trusted to enforce our laws ,  boehner told reporters , suggesting white house executive actions to change provisions of the health care law had many conservatives worried the administration would n't feel bound by any immigration legislation passed by congress . citing that trust deficit , the speaker added :  it 's going to be difficult to move any immigration legislation until that changes .  there is without a doubt deep mistrust of the obama white house in the republican congressional ranks . but is that mistrust any greater than just a week ago ? of course not , and it was just a week ago that the same speaker boehner said this of the same immigration debate : .  this problem has been around for at least the last 15 years , it 's been turned into a political football . i think it 's unfair , so i think it 's time to deal with it .  to be fair , the speaker a week ago was candid about the disagreements and skepticism within the republican ranks -- and among republican base voters critical to 2014 midterm success .  that 's why ,  he said a week ago ,  doing immigration reform in a common sense , step by step manner helps our members understand the bite size pieces and helps our constituents build more confidence that what we 're doing makes sense .  but to that point , again just a week ago , the word from house gop leadership aides was that boehner wanted to try to see if the house could act this year . and president obama tried to create some space for compromise , angering some liberals by telling cnn 's jake tapper he would not prejudge the final product -- opening the door to accepting a measure that provided legal status , but not a fast track , to citizenship for the estimated 11Ã‚ 1/2 million undocumented immigrants in the united states . now , it appears testing that spirit of compromise will have to wait until 2015 or beyond . what changed in a week ? nothing , say key boehner lieutenants . they insist people , primarily immigration activists and the media , read too much into what the speaker said a week ago .  nothing ` happened ' per se ,  a top boehner aide said in an e-mail exchange .  we just got started and getting started requires taking a sober view at the challenges that we face . all he did today was outline the challenges we need to overcome .  those challenges -- the trust deficit as outlined by the speaker -- are most unlikely to be overcome in a heated election year . veteran gop strategist alex castellanos , who for years has been urging the gop to act on immigration , said the politics behind boehner 's shift were easy to understand .  nothing the house would do would ever become law ,  castellanos said -- meaning that even if the house passed something , it was unlikely that differences with the senate could be worked out this year . so a house debate now , castellanos said ,  would divide republicans and become a political weapon democrats could use against republicans in 2014 .  there is no doubt a vocal slice of the house gop conference was against acting on immigration this year -- arguing their biggest priority is turning out conservative base voters , many of whom view even legal status as amnesty . and on the senate side , gop leader mitch mcconnell had already served notice he had little appetite for revisiting the issue in that chamber before the election . not only does mcconnell face a tea party primary challenge but , as we illustrated last sunday on  inside politics ,  most gop strategists see action on immigration this year -- whatever the long-term good it might do republicans -- as potentially harmful to gop prospects this year . the raw politics behind that view : in the 11 states where senate seats now held by democrats that are top gop 2014 targets , conservative turnout is critical and the latino population tiny to small . -lrb- west virginia is lowest with just a 1 % latino population ; north carolina is the highest at 9 % . -rrb- .  mcconnell saying it was n't going to get done -- burst the balloon ,  said gop strategist ana navarro , another voice who consistently stresses the urgency of acting on the immigration issue , yet sees the short-term political rationale of waiting . so does castellanos , again despite his longer-term worries about the gop and the latino vote .  right now , the spotlight is center stage on the democrats , the president and obamacare ,  said castellanos .  and the gop wants to do nothing to distract from that , certainly not start a food fight on immigration . ", "summary": " a week ago , house speaker boehner said he wanted to try to act on immigration .   on thursday , boehner said it would n't happen this year .   trust gap between republicans and white house wo n't close in election year .   immigration debate between house republicans would give democrats a weapon .
