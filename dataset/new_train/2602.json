{"text": "last year , at wellesley high school in massachusetts , david mccullough jr. , an english teacher at the school and the son of the pulitzer prize-winning historian david mccullough , gave the commencement address . he knocked it out of the park , and his words traveled far . what he had to say , america was desperate to hear . mccullough believes that much of today 's youth is  pampered , cosseted , doted upon , helmeted , bubble-wrapped  and shielded from reality . he told the graduates :  climb the mountain not to plant your flag , but to embrace the challenge , enjoy the air and behold the view . climb it so you can see the world , not so the world can see you .  i 've had the privilege of delivering a commencement address , at a university in central california , and i hope someday to deliver another . in fact , i already know what i want to say . so let me try it out on the class of 2013 . talk to college professors or human resource managers or employers . read the research done on the so-called millennial generation , and you 'll find lots of evidence that mccullough was on the right track . the young people of today have often spent their lives being coddled , catered to and spared the stress of living up to expectations . people usually tell them only what they want to hear . obama to new grads :  no time for excuses  not me . i 'd rather tell our future leaders what they need to hear . here are 10 provocative pieces of advice that this year 's class of college and university graduates would be wise to take to heart : . 1 -rrb- have your parents introduce themselves to you . interview them , and record it . ask them about their lives , and what stories or lessons they 'd like to share with their grandchildren . they gave you life , so the least you can do is try to understand theirs . when they 're gone , you 'll be glad you did . 2 -rrb- follow your passion but be open to the idea that your passion might change and evolve over the years as you do . do n't be afraid to change course and go in a different direction . you 're allowed to have second thoughts , about what you want to do and how you intend to spend your life . 3 -rrb- never forget that , despite what society has told you , you 're not special , as mccullough said in his graduation speech . the world does n't revolve around you . and you must n't feel entitled to anything . no one is better than you , but you 're not better than anyone else . treat everyone with respect , as long as they treat you the same way . 4 -rrb- break out of your comfort zone . do what you 're most afraid of . avoid what is easy and predictable . travel the country and the world . meet new people and strive to see the world from their vantage point . stay curious . ask questions . and never stop learning . 5 -rrb- do n't just accept failure , but welcome it . expect it . learn from it . treat it as a valuable learning experience . remember , if you always get everything you want , and accomplish everything you set out to do , then you 've failed anyway . because you 've set your goals too low . 6 -rrb- question authority and challenge your beliefs . jump into the public debate . become engaged . democracy is a participatory sport ; you take part , or you get taken apart . it does n't matter what you believe . what matters is that you thought your way there and can explain why you believe it . 7 -rrb- for those of you who choose , or are able , to get married -- and hopefully , one day , all of you will be -- who you decide to marry will go a long way toward determining your success . it 's more important than degrees from fancy schools . people can either lift you up , or bring you down . choose well . 8 -rrb- for those who you who choose , or are able , to have children , when you set to raise them , give them the one thing they want most : your time . teach them to be productive . but more importantly , teach them , by example , to be good people , who treat fellow human beings kindly and with respect . 9 -rrb- as you go through life , do n't be afraid to have high expectations of your children , of others , and of yourself . there are worse things than being disappointed because someone did n't perform as you hoped . like giving up on them and not expecting much from the beginning . 10 -rrb- finally , many years from now , when you go to your rest , your most important accomplishment in life wo n't be the money you earned or the success you enjoyed . the only thing that will endure , and let the world know you were here in the first place , is the impact you had on other people . make it a positive one . that 's it . take it , or leave it . everyone enjoys the comfort of a warm bath . but sometimes , what 's called for is a cold shower . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of ruben navarrette .", "summary": " ruben navarrette : last year a graduation speaker told students  you 're not special    he says the viral talk rightly targeted millennial generation as privileged , entitled .   navarrette gives 10 tips for a rewarding life and career .   he says young people should get to really know their parents , explore life outside comfort zone .
