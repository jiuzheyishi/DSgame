{"text": "if the federal government shuts down starting tuesday because of a bitter partisan battle over the new health care law , more people say congressional republicans rather than president barack obama would be responsible , according to a new national survey . a cnn/orc international poll released monday morning , hours before funding for the government is scheduled to run out , also indicates that most americans think republicans in congress are acting like spoiled children in this fiscal fight , with the public divided on whether the president is acting like a spoiled child or a responsible adult . and six in 10 questioned in the survey say they want congress to approve a budget agreement to avoid a government shutdown , and if it happens , most people say a shutdown would be a bad thing for the country . the poll 's release comes one day after the gop-dominated house of representatives approved a spending plan to fund the government that would delay the affordable care act , better known as obamacare , for a year , and repeal its tax on medical devices . 10 ways a shutdown would affect daily life . that measure now heads back to senate later monday , where the democratic majority has said any changes to the health care law would be a deal-killer . if no deal is reached on a temporary funding measure , a government shutdown would kick in at 12:01 a.m. et tuesday . according to the poll , which was conducted friday through sunday , 46 % say they would blame congressional republicans for a government shutdown , with 36 % saying the president would be more responsible and 13 % pointing fingers at both the gop in congress and obama .  the number who would hold congressional republicans responsible has gone down by 5 points since early september , and the number who would blame obama is up 3 points in that same time ,  said cnn polling director keating holland .  those changes came among most demographic groups .  the cnn poll is similar to a cbs news/new york times survey released late last week that indicated 44 % blaming congressional republicans and 35 % pointing fingers at the president . two other polls conducted in the past week and a half , from pew research center and united technologies/national journal , showed a much closer margin but their questions mentioned republicans in general rather than the gop in congress . while most democrats questioned in the cnn poll would predictably blame congressional republicans and most republicans questioned would point fingers at the president , independents were divided on which side they would blame . in a separate question , 49 % of all people in the poll say that obama is acting like a responsible adult in this budget battle , with 47 % describing him as a spoiled child . while that 's nothing to brag about , it 's better than congress . read the entire cnn/orc poll . according to the poll , 58 % say congressional democrats are acting like spoiled children , with that number rising to 69 % for the gop in congress . only one in four say congressional republicans are acting like responsible adults . some 68 % say a shutdown for a few days would be a bad thing for the country , with that number rising to nearly eight in 10 for a shutdown lasting a few weeks . six in 10 questioned in the cnn survey say that it is more important for congress to avoid a shutdown than to make major changes to the new health care law , with only a third saying it is more important for lawmakers to prevent major provisions in the new health care law from taking effect by cutting the funds needed to implement them . -lrb- note : when cnn began interviews for this poll on friday evening , the senate had just stripped out of its bill the house republican measure to defund the health care law . what the house passed this weekend does n't specifically call for a defunding of obamacare -- instead it delays its implementation for a year -- but the repeal on medical devices would cut key funding for the law . -rrb- . the drive to overthrow the health care law , which was passed in 2010 when democrats controlled both houses of congress , is being fueled by gop lawmakers voted into office the past two elections with the strong support of tea party activists and other grassroots conservatives .  a majority of republicans think that blocking obamacare is more important than approving a budget agreement ,  said holland .  so do tea party supporters , regardless of their partisan affiliation .   who 's driving this strategy : 40 to 50 of the most conservative members of the house , and four or five of the most conservative members of the senate ,  says cnn chief national correspondent john king .  fifty-six percent of tea party supporters say it 's a good thing to shut down the government . these are the folks those most conservative members of congress are listening to . those lawmakers think back home they 're on safe ground even though nationally shutting down the government is a non-starter .  the poll indicates that obamacare is not popular , with 57 % saying they oppose the law , up 3 points from may , and 38 % saying they support the measure , down five points from may . but only about four in 10 oppose it because it is too liberal , with about one in 10 saying they do n't like the law because it is not liberal enough . if you add the 38 % who favor the law to the 11 % to oppose the law because it 's not liberal enough , you get 49 % , compared with the 39 % who say they oppose the law because it 's too liberal . the poll was conducted for cnn by orc international september 27-29 , with 803 adults nationwide questioned by telephone . the survey 's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points . the questions . where do
