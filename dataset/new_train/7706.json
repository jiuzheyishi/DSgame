' labour media spokesman helen goodman said : ` i would describe this as a total damp squib . they seem to have agreed an expansion of the iwf and an extra # 1million . they have not even begun to get to grips with our call for action on web filters to protect children . i feel disappointed and frustrated . ' a statement released by the four largest isps -- bt , sky , talktalk and virgin media -- said the extra # 1million would be spread out over four years . ` this additional funding will supplement the existing zero-tolerance approach to child abuse material online , ' they said.scott rubin , director of public affairs at google , said : ` we have a zero tolerance attitude to child sexual abuse imagery online . ` the fight to remove these images from the internet is a global one , and we hope these measures will help in that important battle .
