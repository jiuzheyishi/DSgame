{"text": "on christmas eve in 1968 nasa provoked outrage among atheists when the apollo 8 astronauts read from the book of genesis as they orbited the moon . so if any people of a similar disposition are reading , look away now - a team based in israel are planning to send the torah to the moon . the sacred jewish scroll would be sent along with other iconic earth artefacts as part of the google lunar xprize , a competition amongst private companies to send vehicles to the moon , with the goal of maintaining earth 's culture in the event of an apocalypse . an israeli-based team is hoping to send a handwritten version of the torah -lrb- stock image shown -rrb- to the surface of the moon . their goal is to hitch a ride with a mission currently competing in the google lunar xprize , which should see private companies landing on the moon starting at the end of 2015 . the project is known as torah on the moon and is based in tel aviv . the . google lunar xprize , the largest international incentive based prize of . all time , is tasking private organisations with . safely landing on the surface of the moon . ` more . than half of the world 's population has never had the opportunity to . view a live transmission from the lunar surface , ' say the organisers . the . google lunar xprize aims to create a new ` apollo ' moment for this . generation and to spur continuous lunar exploration with $ 40 million in . incentive based prizes . in . order to win this money , a private company must land safely on the . surface of the moon , travel 500 meters above , below , or on the lunar . surface , and send back two ` mooncasts ' to earth . the team are hoping to send a handwritten jewish scroll , the sefer torah , to the lunar surface reports new scientist , and later the vedas -lrb- hindu scriptures -rrb- and the i-ching -lrb- an ancient chinese philosophical work -rrb- . they would each be transported in capsules that would enable them to survive on the moon for more than 10,000 years . ` this is an incredible , beautiful project , ' said group founder paul aouizerate . ` these three texts are among earth 's most ancient documents , created over 3,000 years ago . ` they are significant to billions of people . ' to fund the mission aouizerate and his team are hoping to raise up to # 12.1 m -lrb- $ 20.5 m -rrb- by having scribes write each of the 304,805 characters contained in the torah . these writers would be funded by believers . ultimately , the goal is to ensure a significant part of earth 's culture would remain on the moon far into the future . thus , if earth were to suffer an apocalypse-type event , be it a nuclear war or an asteroid impact , part of humanity 's legacy would live on . the endeavour has been considered before on varying scales , with other agencies and organisations saying humanity should create ` time capsules ' that will preserve earth 's cultures and societies . in fact nasa 's two voyager spacecraft , currently on their way into interstellar space , each contain something called the golden record . this vinyl is a collection of various snippets of earth life and culture , from the sounds of nature to images of humans . it is intended , if it is ever found , to be a lasting legacy of humanity 's place in the universe . the torah on the moon project had previously hoped to ride to the moon with a lander designed by tel aviv university laboratory called spaceil -lrb- artist 's illustration shown -rrb- , but the partnership has since been cancelled . this vehicle is designed to ` hop ' across the lunar surface using rockets . the prospect of creating a ` time capsule ' of earth life has been considered before , in order to preserve humanity 's legacy in the event of a global catastrophe . pictured is an ` earthrise ' as our planet came into view while apollo 11 orbited the moon . this particular project , meanwhile , would be hitching a ride on one of several google lunar xprize missions . as yet , though , the team have n't booked a place on any particular flight . it had initially been intended to join a lander that is being built by israeli-based spaceil , but that partnership failed to materialise . they are now sounding out the spain-based barcelona moon team to see if they would be willing to take the artefacts , but there has been no confirmation of an agreement yet . another obstacle is to actually create a capsule that can survive the extreme environment on the moon . in sunlight the lunar surface can reach a scorching 123 째c -lrb- 253 째f -rrb- , but at night it plunges to a frigid -173 째c -lrb- -279 째f -rrb- . an attempt by esa to make the capsule that would keep the torah safe on the moon failed to withstand this vast temperature swing . this would not be the first time religion and space have combined . as mentioned earlier , the apollo 8 astronauts infamously read from the book of genesis as they orbited the moon . buzz aldrin , meanwhile , took communion on the moon before stepping onto the surface in july 1969 . and the apollo 15 astronauts left a bible on their lunar rover when they left the moon in july 1971 . in 1971 the apollo 15 astronauts left a bible on their lunar rover -lrb- pictured in the red circle -rrb- when they left the surface of the moon . this is one of a handful of instances where religion and space have combined , including buzz aldrin taking communion on the moon in july 1969 .", "summary": " an israeli-based team is hoping to send the torah to the moon 's surface .   the project would hitch a ride on a google lunar xprize mission .   this is a competition for private companies to land a vehicle on the moon .   the torah would be put inside a capsule that could survive for 10,000 years .   and it would be joined by other important texts in the future to preserve snippets of earth 's culture and society in case humanity goes extinct .
