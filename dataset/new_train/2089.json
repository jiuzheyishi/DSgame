{"text": "beijing china is a country where the rule of law is selective and often unjust . one source of injustice is the 50-year-old system known as  laodong jiaoyang ,  or re-education through labor . under this system , tens of thousands of offenders are imprisoned in china without trial . a united nations human rights council report estimates that some 190,000 chinese were locked up in 320 re-education -- or  laojiao  -- centers in 2009 . that is in addition to an estimated 1.6 million chinese convicted in regular courts and held in the formal prison system . the  re-education through labor  system dates back to the 1950s when the newly established communist regime swept up  counter-revolutionaries  and  class enemies  to maintain order . today it empowers police to jail accused offenders -- from petty thieves and prostitutes to drug abusers -- for up to four years without a judicial hearing . though the practice is supposedly meant for only minor offenders , critics of the system say it is often used as a tool to persecute government critics , including intellectuals , human rights activists and followers of banned spiritual groups like the falun gong , and is a major source of human rights violations . professor yu jianrong , a scholar at the chinese academy of social sciences , a government think-tank , acknowledged that the system  has played a certain role in maintaining social order and in preventing and reducing crime .  however , he added ,  as a compulsory re-education administrative measure , it is against the concept of law , lacks legal basis and is contrary to the principles of fairness and justice . it will cause political consequences if this system is not abolished .  beijing officials say some rethinking is underway . in a press conference last week , jiang wei , a senior official of a government taskforce on judicial reform , said the government was preparing to revamp but not abolish the system . chinese society , jiang said , has  reached a consensus on the need to reform the re-education through labor system .  opinion on chinese social media confirms that . on the sina weibo micro-blogging site , an informal poll last week showed 97 % of the nearly 13,000 respondents voted that  the laojiao system must be rescinded .  only 3 % opined that it is  very good , very practical and must not be rescinded .  public criticism of the practice resurfaced last august after tang hui , a woman in hunan province , was sentenced to 18 months in a labor camp after she agitated for justice for her 11-year-old daughter who was allegedly abducted , raped and forced into prostitution by seven men . tang 's plight earned support among lawyers , intellectuals , bloggers and even the mainstream media . ten lawyers wrote an open letter to government agencies , arguing that the system was neither transparent nor well-supervised .  current regulations do not require the laojiao management committees to release a written verdict to explain how their decisions were made , so it 's difficult to know if a decision was fair ,  complained co-signatory li fangping , a beijing lawyer . within a week , tang hui was released . wang xixin , a peking university law professor , supports the reassessment of the laojiao system .  the way it 's implemented , looking at the deprivation and restriction of the citizens ' personal freedom and the lack of openness , fairness and impartiality and procedural safeguards , the system itself needs to be reformed .  chinese ex-convicts who have survived years in laojiao camps have bitter memories .  it was physically exhausting and psychologically tough because isolation and starvation are always part of daily life ,  recalled a government functionary who was jailed for four years . in the camp , he said he was assigned to work in a vehicle-repair workshop . does the system work in re-educating convicts ?  it 's hard to say ,  he said .  different people take different lessons from their experiences , but most people leave the camp still hating the system or the government .  reform is always a good idea , but you can not do it without changing the whole legal system .  reformers propose the abolition of the laojiao system , but hardly anyone expects that to happen soon . the chinese leadership remains divided about law reform and other aspects of political reform . faced with growing social unrest and political instability , china 's leaders have increasingly relied on criminal and administrative punishment to contain rising demands for social justice , clean government , political transparency and accountability , especially among those left behind and marginalized . some legal experts agree that the system will take some time to change .  the laojiao system should not be completely abolished ,  said jiang ming ` an , professor at peking university .  instead it should be adapted and reconstituted . we need to take into account the protection of social order and maintenance of social stability .  a microblogger named sanxiasheng agreed and tweeted :  if re-education through labor is abolished , you will see more gangsters around the neighborhoods .  ma huaide , a professor at china university of political science and law , likened the laojiao system to an ax .  the ax may serve as a weapon , but we need not destroy all the axes ,  ma said .  the key is to supervise the hand that holds it .  but yu jianrong , the researcher at the chinese academy of social sciences , unequivocally rejects the laojiao system .  it goes against the legal system , undermines the law and harms social justice ,  he posted on social media .  it serves as the local authorities ' tool of reprisal in the name of maintaining stability . it has to be abolished immediately .  china-watcher anthony saich said the planned reform of the system was  long overdue  but would proceed gradually .  as with most reforms in china , the policy thrust is to be cautious and experiment first both for people to get used to the change and then to assess whether it has been successful ,  saich , a professor of international affairs at harvard kennedy school , explained .  i would imagine it will lead over time to its abolition .
