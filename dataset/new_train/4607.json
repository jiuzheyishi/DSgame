{"text": "atlanta , georgia three decades after serial killings of african-americans in georgia shook much of the nation , most respondents to a nonscientific cnn poll say wayne williams committed what came to be called the atlanta child murders . although williams was convicted only of murdering two adults , police blamed him in the murders of two dozen african-american boys and young men that lasted from 1979 to 1981 . in williams ' first tv interview in at least a decade , he insisted to cnn 's soledad o'brien that he 's innocent . he 's serving two life sentences . a two-hour cnn documentary ,  the atlanta child murders ,  invited viewers to weigh the evidence and hear from witnesses in the case , and then go to cnn.com to cast votes on whether williams is  guilty ,   innocent  -- or the case is  not proven .  nearly two out of every three persons who voted in the nonscientific poll said they would convict williams . according to poll results , 68.6 percent of respondents said williams was guilty . only 4.3 percent said he was innocent . the remaining 27.1 percent chose a third option ,  not proven ,  which was added to the cnn poll to offer a middle ground . more than 55,000 persons took the opportunity to register their opinions about the case on cnn.com . by march and april of 1981 , bodies were turning up at the rate of one a week , stoking fears among atlanta residents and many people across the nation . in san mateo , california , news reports detailing the killings drove 8-year-old tyika mitchell , her mother and her grandmother to the tv each night . the memory still gives mitchell chills , she said .  i remember being scared to death , especially since he was only killing little black kids , and as such , i believed that it was only a matter of time before the killer got to me ,  said mitchell this week . the family had roots in atlanta , heightening their concern .  it felt like every day a new dead child had been discovered ,  she said .  i remember my mom and grandmother discussing how they recognized the area of atlanta the kids were being found in ,  she said . ireport : mitchell 's memories of scary times . growing up in atlanta , texas , lisa dickerson was a 17-year-old high school student at the time . the murders made her more frightened during a class outing .  it affected everything that we did ,  she said . but looking back on the case , dickerson feels police may have gotten the wrong man .  i never thought that -lsb- williams -rsb- killed the little boys , and i had a doubt about the two older men ,  she said .  i think he made himself look guilty , but i do n't think he did it .  ireport : atlanta , texas , remembers too . in atlanta , georgia , at the time , jackie proulx was a 4-year-old white girl , who also recalls being shaken by news of the killings .  my little friends and i talked about being scared , and would talk about how to defend ourselves against the bad guys ,  proulx said .  i also had several nightmares during that time about being chased and terrorized by a monster .  proulx said she just could n't believe there were people in the world that would hurt or kill children .  i had always assumed adults were to be trusted , so it made me feel vulnerable .  ireport : a frightening time in atlanta , georgia . years later , trust for adults , even strangers , became a theme in a college thesis that mitchell wrote for a criminal justice course . she wrote that children would  feel comfortable getting into a car with  williams because he was a black man from the community . mitchell , who said she holds degrees in criminal justice and social science , also explored a deeper syndrome in her thesis , self-hate , which she attributes to negative images and stereotypes of blacks advanced by mainstream media .  then you have wayne williams , who took it to the extreme and engaged in a sort-of genocidal killing spree of only downtrodden african-americans ,  she said . to this day , the serial killings affect proulx 's parenting of her four sons , ages 4 and 8 .  we have had many discussions about what to do in various situations , like getting lost , or being approached by someone they do n't know ,  said proulx .  i keep them close to me at all times . i do not let myself just assume they are safe , even in our neighborhood .  williams was convicted of killing two adults -- nathaniel cater , 28 , and jimmy ray payne , 21 -- whose bodies were found downstream from a river bridge where police spotted him . jack mallard , who prosecuted the case , believes williams was responsible for many more deaths during the period .  i would say about 25 of the 28 male victims on the list ,  he said . early in the case , williams failed an fbi polygraph test , which is not admissible in court . dna science was not widely used at the time of williams ' 1982 trial . but results from the 2007 testing of dna evidence in the case have implicated williams in the death of at least one 11-year-old victim , patrick baltazar , according to expert dna scientists . cnn 's jim polk and christina zdanowicz contributed to this report .", "summary": " nonscientific poll : 68.6 percent believe wayne williams is the atlanta child murderer .   many african-americans across the u.s. recall being frightened by the case .   years later , one woman says case leads her to closely watch her kids .
