{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- in just two years , bonita went from full-time work to a part of the new underclass of unemployed . the longer it 's been since she was forced to leave her job with the boston housing authority , the harder it gets to return to the ranks of the employed . even though the 46-year-old mother of five has an accounting certificate and a mind for numbers , prospective employers  do n't so much as look at me because of my age or because of my work gap ,  she says , referring to the period of time she 's been unemployed .  it 's always like , ` ok , thank you , we 'll call you within two weeks . ' then three weeks go '  two years after his release from prison , travis was still struggling to find full-time , stable employment . he put out applications , but his phone did n't ring . the odd jobs , like cleaning cooking equipment for restaurants , helped , but after months of relying on his family for support with little to contribute in return , he felt like a bum .  i wanted to be one of the people who get up and go to work every day without breaking the law and have a quality of life ,  he told monica potts in a story she wrote for the american prospect . yet with no other options in sight , he turned for a time to what he knew to be a reliable source of income -- selling drugs in his west baltimore neighborhood -- before finding help . the stories of bonita and travis stories are n't outliers -- more and more americans are finding themselves relegated to the margins of the economy , despite their best efforts to escape that fate . it breeds hardship and hopelessness , and it also violates a basic tenet of our social contract when temporary setbacks become permanent obstacles . the numbers reflect the extent of that permanence ; the longer you 've been out of work , the harder it is to find it again . that 's a troubling reality because for most americans , the path to success is n't straightforward ; it 's punctuated with obstacles and pitfalls . to the immigrant in search of a fresh start , the entrepreneur in pursuit of a new business venture , or the countless families striving for a better tomorrow , it 's the promise of a second chance that animates the american dream . many of the sooners , forty-niners and other pioneers who built our country were running from failures back east . on tuesday , president obama will give his state of the union address . one key issue he should address is the problem of long-term unemployment . while the unemployment rate has improved , there are many americans who have fallen off the radar . to restore an economy capable of reaching its potential and renew our claim to be a nation that encourages its citizens to pursue their aspirations , we have to stop defining people by their failures . we need to rebuild the  second-chance  economy . as bonita found out , in today 's economy being unemployed now often makes you unemployable . one-third of the 10.5 million people who are currently jobless qualify as  long-term unemployed ,  meaning they have been out of work for longer than six months . and in most parts of the country , discrimination against them is perfectly legal : just take a look at the map below . with three unemployed workers for every job opening , employers can be selective . in startling research , rand ghayad , a labor economist at northeastern university , found that prospective employers consistently threw out resumes of applicants with a recent stint of unemployment in favor of applicants with consistent work histories -- even applicants with less education or no relevant work experience . it should be unsurprising , then , that brookings estimates that in any given month , only 11 % of the long-term unemployed will have attained steady , full-time employment a year later . and being consigned to the  long-term unemployed  category is more likely to result from bad timing than lack of talent . the single-greatest factor determining whether someone will bear the mark of  long-term unemployed  is what the unemployment rate was when he lost his job . workers may invest years in their education and acquiring the skills that make them successful at their jobs -- only to be rejected because of factors beyond their control . not only can this create a scarring effect that can permanently diminish their earning potential , it also results in a tremendous loss of human capital at a time when the economy is still struggling to recover . while discrimination against the long-term unemployed is permissible under the law , for individuals with a criminal conviction , it 's often mandatory . a groundbreaking report by the national association of criminal defense lawyers recently documented over 45,000 legal barriers faced by those with a criminal record -- in employment , housing , student financial aid , access to a business license or a driver 's license , or even the right to vote . though targeted restrictions in the interest of public safety are needed , many others -- such as new york state 's prohibition against employment as a bingo caller -- are simply arbitrary and punitive . the impact of these barriers is massive and disproportionately affects communities of color -lrb- that 's partly because , as you can see below , communities of color have a much higher chance of going to prison than their white counterparts -rrb- . since 1980 , the number of incarcerated americans has more than tripled -- reaching the highest rate in the world -- and one out of every 34 americans is either behind bars , on probation , or on parole , many for non-violent drug offenses . the striking breakdown between the types of crimes is below . in all , according to the national employment law project , at least 65 million americans , totaling more than one in four adults , have a criminal record , that subjects them to these mandatory  collateral consequences  -lrb- such as being unable to get a driver 's license or to qualify for student financial assistance -rrb- on top of their formal sentence . these policies keep ex-offenders on the outside of their families and communities , as well as of the economy and democracy . and , in the era of big data , the past does n't stay there . instead , past missteps and misfortunes will linger in permanent and public view . with the click of a button , information from employment histories and civil and criminal records to credit reports and foreclosures can be summoned and used to deny access to employment , housing , or the public assistance needed just to put food on the table . this data -- often full of inaccuracies -- will leave scars on millions of people , in many cases inflicted by automated processes that another human being never touches . what can be done ? to start delivering on the promise of a second-chance economy , policy efforts must focus on four key principles : . -- employers must stop discriminating against applicants without a job . that means removing employment status as a requirement in job postings and making sure human resources representatives are n't discarding the resumes of unemployed applicants on sight . some states have passed laws prohibiting discrimination against the unemployed . and in december 2013 , a house bill was introduced that offered tax incentives to employers of the long-term unemployed . though the bill was ultimately unsuccessful , laws alone are n't the answer because they 're so difficult to enforce and monitor . beyond legislation , the government could fund programs that build partnerships between corporations , local community colleges or workforce development organizations to align training of the currently unemployed with the jobs most needed within the company . it could also prioritize the long term unemployed in its own hiring practices . -- entering the criminal justice system should n't be a one-way street out of the economy . through  ban the box  laws -lrb- in other words , prohibiting the use of boxes applicants must check to indicate they 're unemployed -rrb- , states and cities across the country are already limiting the impact of past incarceration on employment prospects . states could strengthen these efforts by both reducing first-time incarceration and taking a more holistic approach to reentry that connects ex-offenders with the basic tools they need to get jobs and manage money . for starters , states should provide each individual leaving a correctional facility with a state-issued id -- a prerequisite to employment , opening a bank account , and accessing a range of other services and opportunities . -- give people who have encountered adversity the financial tools they need to start over . everyone needs a safe , affordable place to store and transfer money . new york is working with major financial service providers to remove barriers to bank accounts imposed by chexsystems , a database that banks use to estimate risk posed by potential customers . the city 's department of consumer affairs estimates that this and similar databases have prevented more than 825,000 residents in new york city alone from opening an account , often as a result of isolated mistakes , like overdrafts , rather than the fraud it was intended to detect . -- big data should n't be a tool for economic exclusion . in an era of increasingly automated decision-making , we need to both ensure the privacy of those interacting with data systems , and strengthen the integrity of those systems . we can start by following this set of guidelines laid out by a high-profile coalition of civil rights groups . among them -- give individuals control over how a corporation can gather data from them ; allow people to ensure that the data used to make decisions about them is accurate . we 've all heard about the  right to be forgotten  ruling in europe . although it raises important concerns about the freedom of information , the response to that ruling shows that all of us -- and particularly those with blemishes on their record -- need a chance to make a fresh start . these are just a few examples of how we can begin to replace our policies and practices that double down on disadvantage with ones that restore second chances . a real second-chance economy will not only benefit those who are shut out of economic citizenship , but will also restore the dynamism and growth to our economy that will create jobs for everyone who wants to work .", "summary": " in president obama 's state of the union address , he should look at solutions for the jobless .   the longer people have been out of work , the harder it is to find a job .   we must have policy that stops discrimination against the long-term unemployed .
