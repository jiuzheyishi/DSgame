{"text": "the doctor-patient relationship is a complex one . it occurs at a stressful and busy time for both the patient and the doctor . because it involves at least two humans , there are usually at least three versions of the conversation : the doctor 's , the patient 's and the true version . a survey published this week in the journal health affairs reflects this complex relationship . lisa iezzoni and her colleagues surveyed 1,891 physicians nationwide about how honest they are with their patients regarding medical mistakes and a patient 's prognosis . the survey found that although two-thirds of doctors agree they should share serious medical errors with their patients , one-third did not completely agree . nearly two-fifths of the respondents said they did not disclose their financial relationships with drug and device companies . and more than 55 % of physicians said they often or sometimes described a patient 's prognosis in a more positive manner than the facts might support . these survey results are unsettling . we all want to think of medicine as an honorable profession and that the people in it work with integrity . while we should all be appalled that a doctor would deceive or lie to a patient , we should also look beyond the white coat for an explanation . while it is not a vindication , the fact is physicians are human . they have all the feelings and failings of humans . please keep in mind , medical errors can be due to negligence , but they are more often a failure to analyze data appropriately . many doctor errors are simply a matter of bad luck : the doctor was not good enough that day and would have done better the day before or the day after . some bad outcomes are not really the physician 's fault . some doctors do not admit error out of fear of litigation . but my experience is that the discomfort of addressing one 's own failings or weakness is more commonly the reason for not coming forward . it is a normal human tendency to not want to admit an error . confession is difficult , especially when you have to admit responsibility to the person you have hurt . in the case of a  bad luck  outcome , the physician may be unwilling to admit their lack of control . this is often due to a lack of communication during the consenting process -- when doctors explain the possible outcomes or side effects -- and can lead to patient anger when things go badly . ironically , when i have seen a doctor admit an error , the patient or patient 's family is usually forgiving and rarely sues . so why would a doctor not be honest about a patient 's disease or prognosis ? this is likely because doctors are not always the best communicators . medical explanations involve defining some complicated things . this is difficult and it is often easier to just not do it . sometimes there is a tendency to simplify to the point of not telling the truth . it is unfortunate that our medical system pays doctors handsomely to do medical procedures , but does not reimburse well for talking to , counseling and spending time with patients . in a normal office environment , a physician is often forced to see four or more patients per hour . questions go unanswered or half answered as the physician moves from room to room assessing the patient , reading a patient 's history and lab research , documenting and looking things up . it 's a rare private practice physician who can block extra time for a patient with special needs . this can be costly . telling a patient bad news is horribly difficult . it is always an emotional struggle for any caring human being . the emotional incentive is to hold back information or be less than honest . it is harder for me to tell a patient that they are dying -- and that all we can reasonably do is try to keep them comfortable -- than it is to tell a family member that a patient has died . as someone who studies how health care is provided and how health care is consumed , this survey 's findings do not surprise me and the solutions are not simple . we need to transform health care . this involves empowering the patient . patients need to take an interest in their own health . ask good questions and expect if not demand answers . some patients will need advocates or navigators to help them . the transformation also involves more members of the medical profession coming to realize the meaning of the term  profession .  a  profession  is a group of people who put their own interests secondary to the interests of the people they serve . a profession is also a group that educates and polices itself . my greatest concern is many doctors and patients fail to comprehend just how complicated medicine can be . even doctors fail to remember that medicine is a science and an art , often with unclear answers . there are things in medicine that are scientifically known , and things that are unknown . there are also things that are believed . the wise physician draws a distinction between the three . the unwise doctor often confuses what he believes with what he knows . these unwise doctors may not know they are not telling their patients the truth . the opinions expressed in this article do not necessarily represent those of cnn , the american cancer society , or emory university .", "summary": " survey published in health affairs shows one third of doctors do n't share medical errors .   results are unsettling , doctor says , but we should remember that physicians are human .   doctors often try to soften the blow of a prognosis by not giving all the negative details .
