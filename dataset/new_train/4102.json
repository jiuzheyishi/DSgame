{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- have you ever thrown away a banana peel or dumped expired milk into the garbage ? well , if you do it in seattle you are in for a fine . under a new policy , passed 9-0 by the seattle city council earlier this week , those who fail to compost  food waste and compostable paper  will be penalized . the new program will come into effect in january 2015 for commercial establishments and residences . it will be enforced by the seattle public utilities commission . seattle has had a similar rule for noncompostable recyclables for nine years . after receiving two warnings , residents and businesses will be fined $ 50 for dumpsters and a more modest $ 1 for waste at single-family homes . previously , the utilities commission left residents and businesses a note that asked them to compost . if they did not comply , the city refused to collect the garbage . 4 ways to combat food waste at home . so , why is seattle making residents compost ? the city was not going to meet its self-imposed goal of recycling 60 % of all waste .  compostables are about 30 % of what is still in the garbage and they are the largest target we have to help us reach our goals ,  said timothy croll , solid waste director of the utilities commission , which asked the city council for the change .  also , composting food waste reduces emissions of methane , which is a strong cause of climate change .  although the utilities commission contends inspecting garbage and issuing fines for noncompliance will have  minimal costs  and save money in the long run by reducing landfill usage , not everyone agrees .  this program is not free , it costs money and nobody is looking at the real cost of this -lsb- program -rsb- ,  said todd myers , environment director for the conservative washington policy center . opinion : composting in a city : are you kidding ? myers said the program costs could be put to better use .  there are a lot of ways to spend this money to actually do good for the planet . ... seattle is very good at doing things that feel good , but very bad at doing things that do good for the planet ,  said myers . but croll said the program is worth it .  nine years ago , we prohibited recyclable paper and containers from the garbage and this created a significant rise in our recycling rate ,  croll said . the program is modeled on a similar one instituted in san francisco in 2009 . last year , then-mayor michael bloomberg proposed requiring new york residents to compost . new york 's city council only extended the requirement to commercial establishments .", "summary": " seattle city council mandates food waste composting .   residents will be fined $ 1 for violations .   critics say program is a waste of money .   san francisco was the first city to mandate composting .
