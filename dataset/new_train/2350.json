{"text": "a rogue trader has cost ubs an estimated $ 2 billion , the swiss banking giant announced thursday , revealing what could be the third-largest loss of its kind in banking history . a $ 2 billion rogue trading loss would be all but unprecedented , market analyst ralph silva told cnn .  we have only had three or four other situations ... in the billions , and that is exactly what happened ,  he said . the bank is large enough to take a $ 2 billion hit , experts said . shares in ubs were down 11 % on the u.s. stock exchange at midday trading , though , even as european markets closed higher thursday . police arrested a man on suspicion of fraud in an early-morning operation in london 's banking district hours before the loss was announced , they said . ubs contacted the police at 1 a.m. about an allegation of fraud , and a 31-year-old man was arrested at work two and a half hours later , police commander ian dyson said . british media named the suspect as ubs trader kweku adoboli , 31 . cnn has not independently confirmed his identity , but was told when calling his desk at ubs that he was not available . the bank declined to comment on the arrest . news of the rogue trader comes amid pronounced economic anxiety in europe . markets there have been in turmoil in recent weeks as concern has mounted that greece might default on its huge debt , sending shock waves through the 17-nation eurozone and further afield . just this week , the credit rating agency moody 's downgraded two french banks . on thursday -- even as news was circulating of the incident at ubs -- came word that the federal reserve and four other powerful central banks announced they were throwing a lifeline to europe 's struggling banks . the european central bank , along with the fed , the bank of england , the bank of japan and the swiss national bank , said three u.s. dollar auctions would be held to help out european banks that need the currency to fund loans and repay debt . european banks have seen u.s. dollars flow out as u.s. financial institutions and money market accounts scale back exposure to european banks , amid fears over those institutions ' exposure to debt held by greece and other european nations . u.s. treasury secretary timothy geithner is to attend a meeting of europe 's economic and financial affairs council in wroclaw , poland , on friday , at which questions around greek debt and financial stability in the eurozone are bound to be discussed . finance ministers for the european union member states , central bank presidents and representatives of other major financial bodies will also be present . the conference comes ahead of g20 and imf meetings later this month . as to the episode at ubs , silva , the analyst , outlined three possible ways a loss that big could take place : intentional fraud ,  basic stupidity  in trading strategy , or what the banking industry calls  fat fingers ,  which means typing the wrong number by accident . perhaps the trader  put in an extra zero so instead of buying a million he or she bought ten million -- could be a problem ,  silva said . lex van dam , a former trader who is now a partner at hampstead capital in london , said chaos in the markets could have put more pressure on a trader desperate to hang onto his job .  trading has been incredibly difficult over the last year ,  said van dam .  with the volatility in banking stocks , commodities and currencies , things can go wrong really , really easily . if you 're worried about your job and you try to hide -lrb- a mistake or loss -rrb- , you can see how these situations arise .  a bank 's risk management division is supposed to examine a trader 's activities , he said .  he must have done something that he was n't supposed to do , obviously ,  van dam said . ubs said no client positions were affected by the loss , which is still being investigated . but the  unauthorized trading by a trader in its investment bank  could cause ubs to post a loss in the third quarter of this year , it said . the loss would potentially be among the largest costs ever to a bank in unauthorized trading . rogue trader jerome kerviel cost his french bank , societe generale , almost $ 6 billion , and was sentenced to three years in prison last year . yasuo hamanaka cost sumitomo corporation $ 2.6 billion in the global copper market , and was sent to prison for eight years over fraud and forgery in 1997 . nick leeson , the subject of the ewan mcgregor movie  rogue trader ,  lost about $ 1.3 billion for his bank , barings , in 1995 , forcing it to close . ubs is not likely to collapse , but the scandal could prompt the bank to split its investment bank into a separate company , van dam said . there is a  much higher chance that this bank will now be broken up  into a wealth managament firm and an investment bank to reduce clients ' exposure to investment banking losses , he said . he favors that alternative , he said .  the banks are too large ,  van dam said .  the products are so complicated , and the management does n't understand it .  ubs made a pre-tax profit of about $ 1.9 billion in the second quarter of this year , it announced in july , down from about $ 2.5 billion the quarter before that . cnn 's nina dos santos , irene chapple , ben rooney , alex mohacs , james partington , laura perez maestro , kendra petersen , nick thompson and christine theodorou contributed to this report .", "summary": " ubs itself reported the rogue trader to police , officers say .   british media name the arrested man as kweku adoboli .   the loss could be caused by anything from fraud to  stupidity ,  an expert says .   it would be among the largest losses in unauthorized trading .
