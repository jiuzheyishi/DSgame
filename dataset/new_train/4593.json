{"text": "after 25 years and nearly 30 trials , italy 's former prime minister silvio berlusconi has for the first time been handed a definitive sentence by the country 's highest court . berlusconi , who served three times as premier , was found guilty of tax fraud and given a four-year sentence , of which he will serve only one year due to an amnesty aimed at cutting down on prison overcrowding . read more : silvio 's fury at high court verdict . the high court also ordered a lower court to reconsider whether berlusconi should be banned from public office . prosecutors had been seeking a five-year ban , but the lower court will have to review this part of the sentence , and will probably issue a three-year ban . so what happens next ? once the sentence goes into effect in a few days , berlusconi will have 30 days to decide how he wants to serve the one-year sentence . jail is n't an option given that the former premier is aged 76 , so the choice is between house arrest , and more likely , community service . then there is the question of whether berlusconi , a member of italy 's senate , is eligible for public office , now that he 's been convicted of a crime . according to italy 's anti-corruption law , which was passed by mario monti 's government in late 2012 , berlusconi will be ineligible to hold public office after he serves this sentence , independent of the outcome of the review by the lower court . the italian senate will need to decide when berlusconi 's ineligibility begins . does it apply immediately , which would result in him stepping down as a senator ? or does it apply after the current parliamentary term ? either way , as things stand , berlusconi can not run for parliament for six years . once the public office ban is reviewed and completes its judicial journey , which will take months , it too would need a senate vote for immediate enforcement , which could ban berlusconi from holding public office for the duration of the sentence . so what political implications does all this have on enrico letta 's government and italy 's immediate political future ? the senate vote will be the first critical step and is bound to lead to a ferocious divide in letta 's delicate  grand coalition  government , which is comprised of center-left parties and berlusconi 's center-right pdl party . even if berlusconi was ineligible for office , there is technically nothing to stop him leading the center-right in an election campaign without running for office . the latest example of this in italy is beppe grillo , the comedian turned politician , who leads his five star movement despite being banned from public office due to a conviction over a road accident . if the center-right won an election , the political office ban could be changed with a simple majority in parliament -- and with ineligibility out of the way , berlusconi could at least technically become prime minister for a fourth time once the law is abolished . simply put , silvio berlusconi is down but definitely not out . a video statement he released thursday confirmed this and read like a call to battle and the beginning of yet another very long election campaign . we 're in uncharted territory , and what happens next politically is nearly impossible to predict . but the possible outcomes include the downfall of the government . what is certain is that in both the center-left and the center-right there will now be immense internal pressure . with some pushing for an early election as a  referendum on berlusconi  -- 43 % of voters in one swg poll released friday believe berlusconi is being persecuted by magistrates -- and others trying to maintain calm in order to keep the government alive in the name of national interest , it will be a question of who blinks first . the cult of silvio berlusconi : why italians keep voting for ` il cavaliere '", "summary": " italy 's former prime minister silvio berlusconi is given a four-year sentence for tax fraud .   however , he will serve only one year due to an amnesty cutting down on prison overcrowding .   berlusconi has 30 days to choose between house arrest or community service .   he will be ineligible to hold public office after he serves this sentence .
