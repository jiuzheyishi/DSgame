{"text": "three women share their stories of how a feeling or hunch changed the direction of their lives . her little boy found . nothing signaled distress about the laughing 5-year-old child that maryam dilakian saw -- except a strange , insistent feeling in her gut . -- as told to kate rockwood . i was in jamaica for a wedding , and i felt the pull to volunteer . the resort manager directed me to a few orphanages that might admit visitors , and one reluctantly said that i could come . the place had three sections , and i ended up spending my time with the infants and toddlers , because i 'd heard the bigger kids did n't need help . as i was leaving , i passed three of the older kids running around . one of them was laughing really loudly , and i smiled at him as i walked away . i 've never been able to adequately describe what happened next . outside , the taxi was waiting , at the top of a hill quite far from town , and when i went out , someone locked the gate behind me . i opened the door of the cab , put my bag on the seat , and all at once i knew i needed to help the little boy i 'd smiled at -- he was in trouble . it made no sense : he 'd been laughing when i saw him ; he did n't look like he needed me at all . but my heart started to race and i began to feel physically numb . the thought kept coming again and again -- i need to help him . oprah.com : what real love looks like . going back into the orphanage was n't easy . i had to argue with the driver to wait and then buzz until someone came to unlock the gate . they were n't happy to see me . the schoolers were outside , and the boy i 'd seen -- daniel -- was on the ground , looking absolutely pitiful . he was like a different child . i have never in my life fought back tears so hard as at that moment . i fell to my knees and embraced him and i knew instantly , without a doubt : this is my son . later i realized that he must have just been punished . on trips that followed , i saw daniel physically abused when he got in the way . he 's a boisterous kid . he runs a lot , he laughs a lot . i learned that children in jamaican orphanages normally stay six months , until the court decides they can return to their family or be adopted . but daniel 's file had been lost , so he never had a chance . he lived in that home for three and a half years , standing in a crib , looking at a wall . no music -- no nothing . he 'd never been out of the orphanage . he did n't even speak . when i went to the adoption agency , the man said ,  you can not adopt a child that does n't exist .  i showed him daniel 's photo , and said ,  here is this child .  it took me six trips to jamaica to set things right . two weeks after daniel came to live with me in new york city , he started speaking . i tell him this story every day . i do n't let myself imagine , what if i 'd gotten in the cab ? it felt inevitable -- he 'd always been my son . oprah.com : a working mom adopts 5 kids . her trouble went deeper than doctors knew . her doctor assured her she was in good health , but eerie dreams left trisha coburn with a sense of foreboding she could n't shake . -- as told to lisa kogan . i was 46 years old , i had three terrific kids , a happy marriage , and a painting studio where i spent hours every day . not only was nothing wrong in my life , plenty was incredibly right . but then i had the dream . i was standing at a barbed-wire fence across from five or six terribly frail people with huge dark eyes and ghostly pale skin . they were trying to tell me something in a language i did n't understand . it was intense and disturbing , and it left me rattled . a week later i had the dream again , only this time there were a dozen people trying to get me to grasp what they were saying . the following week the dream returned , but now there were 20 people , and they looked desperate . i woke up crying . i started feeling afraid to go to sleep . oprah.com : how to tune in to the voice within . even though my husband thought i was overreacting , i called my doctor to schedule a physical . i did n't know what else to do . the receptionist pointed out that i 'd just had a physical six months earlier ; the most i could talk her into was some new blood work . at the appointment , i told the doctor i felt that something was n't right . he smiled .  you eat well , you exercise , you 're healthy . quit worrying .  two days later , his nurse called to say my blood work was fine . i relaxed and figured i could put my fears behind me . a week later , the dream was back . there must have been 100 people -- wailing , screaming , pleading with me . i kept saying ,  i do n't know what you want from me ! please , please tell me what i 'm supposed to do .  a few days later , the fifth and final dream : back at the fence , only this time nobody is there . i fall to my knees , sobbing ,  come back . i need you to help me .  and suddenly i hear one voice . and that voice says two words -- in perfect english :  look deeper .  how to use your intuition . i called my doctor the minute his office opened .  what 's the deepest place in the human body ?  he said ,  i suppose it 's the colon .  and i said ,  then i want a colonoscopy .  he explained that i had no family history of colon cancer , no symptoms , that insurance would never cover it . i persisted . i told the gastroenterologist i wanted to be awake for the procedure . i watched the camera twisting and turning and following the curves through my colon , and then i heard the doctor draw a breath and say ,  oh my .  there , on the screen , was a black mass . and the doctor promptly put me to sleep . it was cancer -- aggressive and fast moving . she later told me that if i 'd waited even two months , my prognosis would have been ... grim . oprah.com : listen to your body 's early-warning system . calculating danger . the scariest thing about intuition ? realizing too late that you were right . by stephanie pearson . to do research for a magazine story , i once spent a few days at a lodge in a remote part of chile , on lago general carrera . after leaving the lodge , i was scheduled to take a puddle jumper to balmaceda , a town near the lake 's opposite shore . when high winds forced the pilot to cancel the flight , the lodge owner patched together a plan b : his wife would drop me off in the closest village , where an acquaintance would pick me up and shuttle me the final four-hour stretch to balmaceda . the route would pass through a few towns and two military checkpoints . the rest : empty wilderness . after the woman introduced me to the driver in chile chico and waved goodbye , three stocky , good-looking men appeared out of nowhere and jumped into the backseat of the toyota hilux . they were bomberos , or firemen , they told me , on their way to a conference in balmaceda .  interesting timing ,  i thought , since it was good friday in a catholic country where all business had ground to a halt for the next few days . we started driving and the buddies started joking , first about my wedding ring --  i did n't know she was married ,  one said -- then about my height -lrb- i 'm 5 ' 10  -rrb- , then about my hair -lrb- i 'm blonde -rrb- . my heart started to beat faster . to distract myself , i flipped open my lonely planet guide and landed by chance on the  women travelers  section . the first sentence i read :  if you hitchhike , exercise caution and especially avoid getting into a vehicle with more than one man .  oprah.com : o 's worst-case scenario handbook . a dozen ugly scenarios reeled through my brain . most of them ended with me in a ditch . my heart was racing and my chest felt tight . i opened my window ; i could n't get enough air . and that 's how it went for the next hour , the men joking while i tried to breathe and wondered if today was going to be my last day on earth . as we rolled into the first town , i said i had to go to the bathroom , but after i hopped out of the truck , i told the driver i 'd decided to stay in los antiguos for the night .  ¡ buen viaje !  i said , backing away as the bomberos hurled a tirade of unflattering spanish , cursing me , the ungrateful gringa . the truck idled there for a few minutes , as if the men were deliberating what to do , then squealed off . after spending the night with a local family , i made it to balmaceda the next day . maybe the delay was silly . maybe i 'd caved in to an irrational fear and offended four harmless men for nothing . i 'll never know . all i could do at the time was act on my internal sos signals . had i ignored them and wound up in trouble , my prescient notions would have proved true . but by then it would have been too late . subscribe to o , the oprah magazine for up to 75 % off the newsstand price . that 's like getting 18 issues free . subscribe now ! tm & © 2011 harpo productions , inc. . all rights reserved .", "summary": " during a trip to jamaica , maryam dilakian recognized her soon-to-be son after one smile .   trisha coburn 's dreams led her to push doctors to discover her colon cancer .   writer stephanie pearson got an urge to leave her companions to avoid potential danger .
