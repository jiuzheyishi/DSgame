{"text": "south africans turned out wednesday for their country 's first elections since the death of nelson mandela , a process that 's expected to dent but not end the hold of the party to which he 'd long been associated . the party mandela once led , the governing african national congress , held an advantage based on very early results around midnight on wednesday , according to the south african press association . once all of the votes are counted , the anc is expected to hold onto power . but it may have its grip weakened amid growing discontent , particularly among urban voters . the anc , which has governed for the past 20 years , still enjoys widespread support as the party that represents the defeat of the apartheid system and the beginning of democracy in south afprica . but with president jacob zuma dogged by scandals , economic difficulties and concerns over reports of rising corruption , the anc could see its share of the vote fall from the 65.9 % it won in the 2009 elections .  many are hoping that the anc will get a scare in these elections and begin to reflect on some of its failures ,  wrote south african political commentator justice malala in an opinion article for cnn . if the party 's share of the vote drops to 63 % or below , malala said , it will mean that  the party is experiencing its second significant decline in two successive elections .  elections called ' a resounding success ' at the forefront of the issues that have blighted zuma 's presidency is a scandal over his rural homestead in nkandla , in the province of kwazulu natal . the state watchdog has alleged that more than $ 20 million of public money was misused in improvements to the sprawling complex . zuma has denied any wrongdoing . but among zuma 's support base in areas like kwazulu natal , many people remain loyal .  frankly they do not see a problem with him having let his home in nkandla be refurbished at such a high price . in fact they see it as part of the perks of being a ruler ,  said achille mbembe , a professor at the wits institute for social and economic research in johannesburg . voting began wednesday at 7 a.m at more than 22,000 polling stations across the country and finished at 9 p.m. , the press association reported . the millions of voters were charged with electing 400 members of parliament , as well as representatives in new legislatures in south africa 's nine provinces , sapa said . while it did n't provide specifics , south africa 's government communication and information system reported  great turnout of voters , in particular first-time voters .  the same agency added late wednesday that security forces were on  high alert  throughout the day , arresting 97 people for election-related offenses . the gcis did n't report any violence , but noted the deaths of four people : two who died while waiting to vote , plus two party agents killed in a car accident .  government wishes to commend all south africans for the part they have played in making our elections a resounding success ,  the agency said .  ... the nation 's fifth democratic elections have undoubtedly added to our legacy of regular and peaceful elections .  sapa reported that the economic freedom fighters party had contested that account , claiming the process was flawed and that some people were allowed to vote more than once . past and future . the anc is facing its biggest challenges in cities , where analysts say discontent is on the rise , notably among young people , over a lack of quality education and jobs .  increasingly , south africa feels like a country caught between its past and its future ,  malala said . the situation is compounded by the fact that many disillusioned young people are n't registered to vote . opposition leaders like mmuse maimane of the democratic alliance are seeking to connect with younger voters .  it 's key that they establish their own future , their new freedom , their new south africa ,  he said ahead of the election . the economic freedom fighters , a young party formed a few months ago by expelled former anc youth leader julius malema , is also trying to loosen the governing party 's grip on power . the democratic alliance is quickly adapting itself from its reputation as a  white party ,  and the eff is fast becoming a player on the national stage , malala said , but  both parties are only likely to give the anc a real run for its money in the 2019 and 2024 elections .
