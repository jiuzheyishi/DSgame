{"text": "girls as young as 11 ` expect ' to have to perform sex acts on rows of boys for up to two hours at a time in parts of london , a watchdog said as they warned child abuse is rife across britain . deputy children 's commissioner sue berelowitz said there ` is n't a town , village or hamlet in which children are not being sexually exploited ' . in one vile abuse case she uncovered , boys aged 14 and 15 were . ` summoned ' via blackberry messenger to the gang rape of a ` very , very . young girl ' which lasted several days . horrendous : thousands of children the country are being sexually exploited , stunned mps were told today -lrb- picture posed by model -rrb- . she told mps today : ` boys were being called while some . were raping the girl to say  come , come , come , you can join in too  and . they were arriving and elbowing each other out of the way to rape her . ' ms berelowitz said the recent sex abuse case in rochdale - which involved mostly men of pakistani origin abusing white girls - was just part of a wider picture of exploitation involving victims and abusers of all races and cultures . giving evidence to the commons home affairs committee , she said : ` what i am uncovering is that sexual exploitation of children is happening all over the country . ` as one police officer who was the . lead in a very big investigation in a very lovely , leafy , rural part of . the country said to me :  there is n't a town , village or hamlet in which . children are not being sexually exploited  . ` the evidence that has come to the fore during the course of my inquiry is that that , unfortunately , appears to be the case . ` we should start from the assumption that children are being sexually exploited right the way across the country . ` in urban , rural and metropolitan . areas , i have hard evidence of children being sexually exploited . that . is part of what is going on in some parts of our country . it is very . sadistic , it is very violent it is very ugly . ' her report into the scale of child abuse is due out in september . giving examples from the capital , she . said : ` there are parts of london where certainly children expect to have . to perform oral sex on line-ups of boys , up to two hours at a time from . the age of 11 . and it was ` quite common ' for girls to . be lured via internet chat rooms to meet a friend , only to be met by a . group of boys and gang raped in a park . ` then another group of boys come , they take her to another part of the park and she is serially raped again , ' ms berelowitz told mps . ' i wish i could say to you that such things are uncommon but i 'm afraid they are quite common . ' in the rochdale case , nine muslim men , . mainly of pakistani origin , were found guilty of plying girls as young . as 13 with drink and drugs so they could use them for sex . horror : children are being targeted on facebook - and in one instance word of a gang rape was spread by blackberry messenger . but while it may be true that some pakistani men saw white girls as ` easy meat ' - as suggested by a number of high-profile politicians - that was only one pattern among many , she said . ' i regret to say that there are parts of every single community - white , pakistani , afghan , gypsy and romany travellers , you name it - who are seeing children as easy access in terms of sexual exploitation . and in terms of victims we are seeing the same sort of profile . ' ethnic minority victims were ` too often missed out ' . the deputy commissioner told the visibly-stunned mps that ` what is being done is so terrible that people need to lay aside their denial ' or risk victims being disbelieved . victims numbered in the thousands not the hundreds , she said . she said she was ` extremely concerned ' about the role being played by the internet in enabling and fuelling abuse , and ridiculed the idea that parents could prevent access . young people were acting out scenes they saw in online pornography and even organising abuse via social networking sites and messaging systems , she said . one police force showed her a list of more than 1,000 girls aged between 12 and 14 whom a man in his 40s masquerading as a boy had managed to make his ` friends ' on facebook . ` we have gathered quite a lot of evidence to show that there is no doubt that social networking sites can be a source of real problems for this , ' she said . she said easy access to extreme pornography was a particular concern . ` we 've had boys say to us - some of the boys i 've spoken to who 've been involved in sexual exploitation -  it was like being in a porn movie  . ` they have watched things and then they 've enacted them . ` parents may think they can control what 's going on because they can have a blockage on the computer but the reality is children can get anything they like on their mobile phones . ` and they are . it has definitely affected children 's thresholds of what they think is normal . ' in another case , older men were using young male gang members as a ` front line ' in a wider abuse network , and had even forced two of the boys to have sex and filmed it on a mobile phone to ensure their compliance . speaking about the race issue , she told the committee she had visited a ` racist ' estate in the north of england where there was routine sexual abuse of children within an all-white community . ' i have been to gang-associated areas in the north of england . ' i am thinking of one particular estate which is exclusively white , because it is such a racist estate , where there is a very strong and identified pattern of the white males on that estate sexually exploiting the white females on that estate . ` so it is really important to hold all of it in mind . '", "summary": " internet is fuelling abuse of thousands of youngsters , deputy children 's commissioner tells mps .   boys , aged 14 and 15 , summoned to gang rape which went on for days by blackberry messenger .   ` there is n't a town , village or hamlet in which children are not being sexually exploited , ' she says .   girls are being lured into parks by boys they meet online and gang-raped , she tells politicians .   abusers and victims are from all racial and ethnic backgrounds , she says .   blocking computers is not enough - because children are now targeted via their mobiles .
