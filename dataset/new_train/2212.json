{"text": "washington the  nuclear option  would be the changing of senate rules to enable judicial and executive nominees to be confirmed with just 51 votes instead of 60 . apparently you need 60 votes to do just about anything in the senate but change the rules . that only takes 51 votes . nuclear ? that sounds harsh for something as simple as a rule change . senators view themselves as being part of the  world 's greatest deliberative body .  it 's a debatable point , but in order to protect the minority party and make sure nobody does anything without a full debate , senate rules require that 60 of 100 senators agree to votes to move toward confirming a nominee or passing legislation . in the fancy language they speak on capitol hill , moving toward a vote is called  invoking cloture .  senate moving toward ` going nuclear ' actually confirming the nominee or passing the legislation takes only 50 votes , but because of the procedural rules , it pretty much takes 60 to invoke cloture and get anything done these days . by requiring only 51 votes , the entire character of the chamber would change . instead of being forced to get buy-in from the minority party -lrb- republicans right now -rrb- , the majority party -lrb- democrats right now -rrb- would be able to confirm anybody for whom they could get a simple majority . click here for a good academic paper from george kroger at the university of miami on  the rise of the 60-vote senate  the idea is that it would  blow up  the senate . we 're speaking figuratively , of course . the symbolism of  going nuclear  also portends a sort of mutually assured destruction in the future , to borrow another cold war term . democrats wo n't always control the senate . and when republicans are in charge , you can bet they 'll return the favor . man who coined the term ` nuclear option ' regrets ever pursuing it . wow . that does sound serious . is this constitutional ? sure is . the constitution does n't say anything about senate rules . it puts that power in the hands of senators and congressmen .  each house may determine the rules of its proceedings ,  according to article 1 , section 5 . senators are tasked with signing off on nominees in article ii , section 2 . but it does n't say how exactly , which has led to a centuries-long debate on the matter . here 's what the constitution says about the president 's power to appoint :  he shall have power ... with the advice and consent of the senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the supreme court , and all other officers of the united states , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law : but the congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the president alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments .  ok . fine . there 's nothing in the constitution . but senate rules are pretty clear on the 60-vote threshold . yes , they are . read the chapter on cloture . but they 've changed over time . until 1949 , for instance , according to the congressional research service , senators could n't even move to limit debate -lrb- invoke cloture -rrb- on nominations . according to the senate website , henry clay was the first senator to threaten going nuclear , back in 1841 , on legislation . up until 1975 , it actually took 67 votes to overcome a filibuster . the most famous examples came during the civil rights era when southerners from both parties blocked equal rights legislation . it took 60 days of filibustering to find the votes for the 1964 civil rights act . what role does filibustering play in all this ? everybody seems to have a different definition of what a filibuster is . in pop culture , filibustering brings to mind jimmy stewart in  mr. smith goes to washington ,  speaking for hours to block legislation with which he disagrees . anymore the filibuster is an implied thing . when everybody realizes that if there are n't 60 votes to limit debate , senators do n't generally spend much time debating at all . they just move on . even when a senator mounts a long , all-night speech , the outcome is usually pre-ordained . take sen. ted cruz , the texas republican who spoke all night just before the recent government shutdown . even before cruz started speaking , senators had reached agreement to vote on a government funding bill the next day . his speech was not a filibuster ; it was preaching to his political choir . why is all this coming to a head now ? this is where it gets even more complicated . republicans have been blocking nominees to the d.c. court of appeals not because they dislike all the nominees , but because they do n't want more democrats than republicans on that court . currently , there are equal numbers of democratic and republican appointed judges on the court , which is considered second only to the supreme court in importance . in fact , republicans want to shrink the number of judges on the court and expand the number of judges in other courts . but this is a fight that extends way beyond the current spat over the d.c circuit court . the number of filibusters has exploded in recent years , and so has the number of votes trying to end them . between 1949 and 2012 , cloture was invoked 122 times . the vast majority of those occurred in the past decade . democrats , who employed the tactic of filibustering to some effect during the george w. bush administration , now say they 're fed up with republicans employing it against president barack obama . read a really detailed look at the history of filibusters and cloture filings from the congressional research service . republicans block nominees to d.c. court .", "summary": " senate rules require 60 votes to move toward confirming a nominee or passing legislation .   up until 1975 , it took 67 votes to overcome a filibuster .   sen. ted cruz 's floor speech before the government shutdown was n't a filibuster .   current fight is over d.c. court , but impact extends well beyond that .
