' admission : the anchor said , ` the truth is , i am overweight . you can call me fat ' hi jennifer , . it 's unusual that i see your morning show , but i did so for a very short . time today . i was surprised indeed to witness that your physical condition has n't improved for many years . surely you . do n't consider yourself a suitable example for this community 's young . people , girls in particular . obesity is one of the worst choices a . person can make and one of the most dangerous habits to maintain . i . leave you this note hoping that you 'll reconsider your responsibility as . a local public personality to present and promote a healthy lifestyle . in a special four-minute broadcast that aired before the news ms livingston spoke directly to her critic . she said she tried to laugh off the comment as she was so used to criticism from being in the public eye , but was encouraged by hundreds of supporters to speak out . she acknowledged : ` the truth is , i am overweight . you can call me fat - and yes , even obese on a doctor 's chart . ` but to the person who wrote me that . letter , do you think i do n't know that ? that your cruel words are . pointing out something that i do n't see ? ` you do n't know me . you are not a . friend of mine . you are not a part of my family , and you have admitted . you do n't watch this show . ` you know nothing about me but what you see on . the outside , and i am much more than a number on a scale . ' and perhaps to address the writer 's comment that she was not a good role model for young people , she used the opportunity to focus on bullying , pointing out that october is anti-bullying month . ms livingston said : ` that man 's words mean . nothing to me , but really angers me about this is is there are children . who do n't know better - who get emails as critical as the one i . received , or in many cases even worse , each and every day . ` the internet has become a weapon and is passed down from people like that man to those who do n't know any better . ` if . you are at home and you are talking about the fat news lady , guess . what ? your children are probably going to go to school and call someone . fat . ' standing up : ms livingston refused to give in to those who criticised her over her appearance . viral : after mr thompson revealed the letter , messages of support for the couple started to flood in . she then thanked the hundreds of messages of support and courage she received from those in the community and further , saying it was ` overwhelming ' and ` inspiring ' . she finished the broadcast with a strong and powerful message : ` to all of the children out there who feel lost , who are struggling with your weight , with the color of your skin , your sexual preference , your disability , even the acne on your face , listen to me right now . ` do not let your self-worth be defined by bullies . learn from my experience - that the cruel words of one are nothing compared to the shouts of many .
