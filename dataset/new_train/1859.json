{"text": "after 15 months in orbit the u.s air force 's highly secret unmanned space plane successfully touched down yesterday , and it 's highly anticipated landing was caught on film . the military 's unmanned x-37b robotic space shuttle returned from orbit at 5:48 a.m. in california from a secretive test flight . and now officials from the vandenberg air force base have released a short video of the smooth landing . the first part of the 1.17 minute video , which captured the plane 's final descent , is shot in infrared light . scroll down for video . home : the military 's unmanned x-37b robotic space shuttle returned from orbit at 5:48 a.m. saturday in california from a secretive test flight , air force officials confirmed . back : an infrared view shows the x-37b unmanned spacecraft landing at california 's vandenberg air force base , 130 miles northwest of los angeles . the plane 's belly and nose glow bright orange showing the retained heat from piercing through the earth 's atmosphere . after . the plane touches down the film switches out of the infrared light , . showing the shuttle in good shape after its mysterious mission . the . miniature space plane touched down at california 's vandenberg air force . base , 130 miles northwest of los angeles . it was only the second u.s. vehicle to make an autonomous runway landing from space . the space plane , also known as orbital test vehicle-2 , or otv-2 , fired its engine to slip . out of orbit , then pierced through the atmosphere and glided down the . runway - just as an ordinary airplane would . ` with the retirement of the space . shuttle fleet , the x-37b otv program brings a singular capability to . space technology development , ' said lieutenant colonel tom mcintyre , . x-37b program manager . ` the return capability allows the air force to . test new technologies without the same risk commitment faced by other . programs . we 're proud of the entire team 's successful efforts to bring . this mission to an outstanding conclusion . ' the military 's first x-37b debuted . in 2010 and autonomously landed at vandenberg after 224 days in space . smooth landing : the unmanned air force space plane steered itself to a landing early saturday capping a 15-month clandestine mission . returned : the space plane , also known as orbital test vehicle-2 , or otv-2 , fired its engine to slip out of orbit , then pierced through the atmosphere and glided down the runway like an airplane would . enlarge . this computer image shows the space plane re-entering earth . although it resembles a small space shuttle it is not designed to carry humans . it 's wingspan is a mere 4.5 m with a length of 8.9 m . it is powered by batteries and solar cells . the former soviet union 's buran space shuttle , which made a single . spaceflight in 1988 , was the first ship to make an autonomous landing . from orbit . the military will not disclose . what otv-2 was doing during its 15 months in orbit , but a third mission . already is on the calendar for launch this fall . otv-2 blasted off . aboard an unmanned atlas 5 rocket from cape canaveral air force station . on march 5 , 2011 . at . launch , the space plane was accompanied by staff in biohazard suits , . leading to speculation that there were radioactive components on board . boeing phantom works built two of the robotic space planes , which resemble diminutive space shuttle orbiters , as test vehicles . the military , which took over the . program from nasa , says it is using them to learn how to quickly and . inexpensively refurbish reusable spaceships for flight . however , the ultimate purpose of the mission has largely remained a mystery . questions : the unmanned space plane is the second of its kind to be sent up by the u.s. air force - but its purpose has never fully been explained . finishing touches : scientists in protective suits inspect the solar-powered craft prior to its mission . the top-secret robot plane is expected to land saturday - weather and technical issues permitting . the x-37bs also . serve as orbital test beds for instruments that could be incorporated . into future satellites . it is not known if it carried anything in its cargo bay , which is about the size of a pickup truck bed . the vehicles look like miniature . versions of nasa 's now-retired space shuttle orbiters , with a similar . shape and a payload bay for cargo and experiments . they are 8.9 metres . long , compared to the shuttle 's 37-metre length , and have a . wingspan of 4.5 metres , compared to the shuttle 's wingspan of 23.7 meters . the solar-operated vehicles were designed to . stay in orbit for up to 270 days . otv-2 surpassed that milestone by 199 . days . keeping watch : an artist 's rendition of the x-37b shuttle orbiting the earth . the x-37b due to fly this fall is the vehicle that inaugurated the program in 2010 , ' however , many skeptics think that the vehicle 's mission is defence or spy-related . there . are rumours circulating that the craft was kept in space longer than . initially intended to spy on the new chinese space station , tiangong . however , analysts have pointed out . that surveillance would be tricky , since the spacecraft would rush . past each other at thousands of metres per second . and brian weeden , from the secure world . foundation , pointed out to the bbc : ` if the u.s. really wanted to . observe tiangong , it has enough assets to do that without using x-37b . ' lift off : the x-37b sits on top of an atlas v rocket as it 's launched at cape canaveral air force station in florida in 2010 . ready for launch : the x-37b rocket in florida before it blasted off into space . mystery : scientists work on a prototype for the rocket prior to its launch . last may , amateur astronomers were able to detect the orbital pattern of the first x-37b which . included flyovers of north korea , iraq , iran , pakistan and afghanistan , . heightening the suspicion that the vehicle was being used for . surveillance . other industry analysts have . speculated that the air force is just making use of the x-37b 's amazing . fuel efficiency and keeping it in space for as long as possible to show . off its credentials and protect it from budget cuts . after all , under budget cuts for 2013 to 2017 proposed by the obama administration , the office that developed . the x-37 will be shut down . according . to x-37b manufacturer boeing , the space plane operates in low-earth . orbit , between 110 and 500 miles above earth . by comparison , the . international space station orbits at about 220 miles . watch video here .", "summary": " the x-37b landed in california early saturday morning .   the space plane has been circling the earth at 17,000 mph and was originally due to land in december .   mission of highly classified robotic plane extended for unknown reasons .
