{"text": "an audio recording purportedly from the islamic state of iraq and syria promises more fighting in more iraqi cities , including baghdad .  continue your march as the battle is not yet raging ,  a voice said to be that of isis spokesman abu mohammed al-adnani says on the message posted early thursday -lrb- last wednesday night et -rrb- on the group 's media website .  it will rage in baghdad and karbala . so be ready for it .  cnn can not confirm the authenticity of the audio or time and date of its recording , which is nearly 17 minutes long .  do n't give up a hand 's width of ground you 've liberated ,  the voice says in apparent encouragement of isis fighters . the message , if authentic , is further proof that the militant group are not content with control of the places they have already taken over -- and are setting their sights higher . open to u.s. strikes . on wednesday , iraq 's government indicated a willingness for the united states military to conduct airstrikes against the radical islamist militants . several u.s. officials said washington views the situation as  extremely urgent  and is looking to see what more support the united states can provide to the iraqi government , in addition to weapons and vehicles it has already provided . part of this will be giving iraqi officals intelligence they can use to go going after isis . assistance could also involve training and  kinetic  activity , u.s. officials told cnn , but they would n't specify whether those options included airstrikes . baghdad 's openness to airstrikes was first reported by the wall street journal on wednesday night . one of the officials said there clearly was a breakdown in iraqi security , but washington believes it was a combination of factors , including the fact that iraqi forces were already stretched thin by limited success against isis in anbar province . government forces in the northern cities of mosul and tikrit ran when attacked this week , the officials said . one silver lining , the officials said , is that iraqi officials now seem to have a coordinated approach with the semiautonomous kurdish regional government . it appears iraqi forces will team up with kurdish fighters , known as the peshmerga , to fight militants with isis , an offshoot of al qaeda . peshmerga forces took up positions in southwest kirkuk after militants took over several villages and districts north and west of the city and the iraqi army withdrew , police officials there told cnn . the u.s. state department on wednesday updated its travel warning to iraq , saying terrorist activity and violence is at  levels unseen since 2007 .  it has warned against all but essential travel to the country . rapid takeovers . a day after taking over mosul , iraq 's second-largest city , isis militants gained nearly complete control of the northern city of tikrit , witnesses in the city and police officials in neighboring samarra told cnn . heavy fighting erupted inside tikrit -- the hometown of former iraqi leader saddam hussein -- as the military tried to regain control , the sources and a police official in baghdad said . according to the witnesses in tikrit and the samarra police officials , two police stations in tikrit were on fire and a military base was taken over by militants . the governor of salaheddin province , of which tikrit is the capital , was missing , according to the sources . suspected isis militants raided the turkish consulate in mosul on wednesday , capturing 48 people , including diplomats , and they also seized parts of baiji , the site of iraq 's largest oil refinery , police officials in tikrit told cnn . the devastating isis advance is proving an object lesson of much that is wrong in iraq and the region -- with a festering civil war over the border in syria adding fuel to the growing sectarian tensions at home . isis is exploiting this to expand its influence , from cities like falluja and parts of ramadi that it wrested from the government in anbar early this year , and from syrian towns like raqqa it controls over the border . that it is capable of fighting the forces of syrian president bashar al-assad on one hand , its fellow radicals on another and the iraqi government on top of that is an indication of the depth to which isis has established itself in the region . militants were responsible for the deaths of many u.s. troops in western iraq . with american help , iraqi tribal militias put isis on the defensive . but when u.s. troops left the country , the extremist militants found new leadership , grew stronger while in syria , and returned to iraq , making military gains often off the backs of foreign fighters drawn to syria 's conflict . half million civilians displaced . the clashes across iraq come on the heels of a sudden and danger-fraught exodus from the fighting in mosul , which fell to militants tuesday . more than 500,000 people have fled the fighting there , the international organization for migration said wednesday . the group said there were many civilian casualties . the city 's four main hospitals are inaccessible because of fighting , and some mosques have been converted for use as clinics , the iom said . those fleeing the fighting -- some on foot , some bringing only what they can carry in plastic bags -- were heading to the city 's east or seeking sanctuary elsewhere in nineveh province or in iraq 's kurdish region . the u.n. refugee agency said many people were traveling with no belongings and little or no money . that including one family of 12 people , including a 70-year-old grandmother , who had walked for two days from a farm near mosul to a checkpoint . they had no idea what they were going to do next , and they had spent all their cash , the united nations said . mosul , a predominantly sunni city with 1.6 million residents , collapsed swiftly . american-trained iraqi forces ran in the face of the onslaught , leaving behind uniforms , weapons and armored vehicles . a u.s. department of defense official said washington has provided $ 15 billion in training , weapons and equipment to the iraqi government . the heavily armed radicals overran police stations , freed more than 1,000 prisoners from the city jail and took over the city 's international airport . prime minister nuri al-maliki ordered that all military leaders who fled be court-martialed . the defense ministry said the air force killed a group of isis militants along a highway leading south toward samarra . the ministry also said it would push back the militants .  this is not the end , we are very confident that we will be able to correct the path and to overcome mistakes ,  the ministry said on its website . the interior ministry said that military commanders have started deploying fighters from local shiite militias on the western outskirts of al-nasiriya to protect that city . turkish consulate targeted . turkish special forces members , consulate workers and three children were among those detained and taken to the isis headquarters following a raid on the turkish consulate in mosul on wednesday morning , turkish officials told cnn .  the condition of the turkish citizens is fine , developments are being monitored ,  the officials said . foreign minister ahmet davutoglu said consulate staff had been urged to leave this week , but the decision to evacuate was left up to individuals .  we were told that it would be more risky for our 48 people to go outside than to stay inside ,  davutoglu said , speaking on turkish television .  if any harm is done to any of our citizens , it will not go unanswered . no one should test turkey .  oil town under attack . meanwhile , suspected isis militants seized parts of baiji , a small iraqi town in salaheddin province about 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of the capital , baghdad , police officials in tikrit told cnn . the baiji oil refinery is still under the control of iraqi security forces , officials said . the fact that isis forces are trying to take the town suggests a wider strategic aim besides oil . baiji sits on the main highway north from baghdad to mosul that passes through rural areas in which isis has much influence . for the government to reinforce its troops in mosul , it needs to drive them through baiji . if isis controls the town , the government 's task will be much harder . explosions struck three shiite areas in baghdad , killing 25 people and injuring 56 , police officials told cnn . the deadliest attack was in sadr city , where a car bomb exploded near a funeral tent , killing 15 people , police said . discontent feeds violence . in his weekly address to the nation wednesday , al-maliki described the assault on mosul as a  conspiracy  to destabilize the country and called on iraqis to  stand as one united front .  shiite cleric muqtada al-sadr said in a statement wednesday that he is ready to form a  peace brigade  to work in coordination with the iraqi government  to defend the holy places  of muslims and christians . but this brigade probably would be viewed by many as a resurgence of al-sadr 's mahdi army , the powerful shia militia that disbanded at the end of 2008 . its formation could risk worsening the country 's underlying problem -- festering sectarian division . the country 's minority sunni population , which prospered under hussein , feels shut out by al-maliki 's shia majority-dominated government . a u.s. counterterrorism official told cnn that isis had been active in nineveh province  for a long time and clearly sensed that mosul was vulnerable now after engaging in sporadic attacks earlier this year .  strategically , the group looks at syria and iraq as one interchangeable battlefield , and its ability to shift resources and personnel across the border has measurably strengthened its position in both theaters .  however , the official said isis still  has shown little ability to govern effectively , is generally unpopular and has no sway outside the sunni community in either iraq or syria .  a spokeswoman for the iranian foreign ministry said the fall of mosul and the situation in tikrit validates neighboring tehran 's concerns .  the islamic republic of iran had earlier warned that the danger of terrorism wo n't be limited to one region and will spread beyond countries . and unfortunately today we are witnessing this issue ,  marziyeh afkham told the semiofficial fars news agency . the siege of mosul : what 's happening ? why is it significant ? how isis and iraq upheaval threatens the wider world .", "summary": " u.s. updates travel warning , saying violence in iraq is at 2007 levels .   u.s. looking at options , which include sharing intelligence .   heavy fighting in tikrit as militants take over much of that city .   half a million people have fled mosul fighting , group says .
