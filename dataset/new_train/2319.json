{"text": "the last time earl woods jr. saw his half brother tiger was four years ago , when the family buried their father . earl woods jr. and his two siblings kevin woods and royce woods , also tiger 's half siblings , joined tiger on his private jet to take their father 's remains to kansas . the three are the offspring of tiger 's father earl woods sr. and his first wife barbara hart woods . the couple divorced in 1968 .  he was gracious enough to allow us to join him on the jet to take my dad to kansas ,  says earl woods jr. .  i remember we came off the jet , walked down the runway , hugged , -lrb- we said -rrb- ` hey , how you doin ' ? ' and he went that way with the entourage , and we went this way . and that was the last i ever saw him .  that was in may 2006 , at a time when tiger was cementing his legacy as one of golf 's greatest . after his father passed , woods memorably won the british open and dedicated the victory to his dad , who had been his first coach when he was just 3 years old . he won one more major championship that season and seven other pga tour events . tiger was one of the most popular figures in the world . but he had no contact with his half siblings -- earl jr. , kevin and royce . earl jr. says he has reached out through phone calls and letters , but got no response .  i have no grudge against him . i 'm disappointed . i 'm a little angry ,  he says .  but , if he chooses to contact and to be in contact , we would love that . you know , we have unconditional love for him , whether he contacts us or not .  earl jr. wants tiger to respond because kevin is sick . he has multiple sclerosis and his health has declined 40 percent in the past two years , earl jr. says .  kevin does n't want this to be a big to-do about his condition ,  earl jr. says .  but , you know , it makes me a little angry that ... there is this issue with trying to get the news to him . and it 's been so difficult . it 's like he does n't care . i kinda feel that he does .  cnn twice reached out to tiger woods ' management company for this documentary . woods did n't return messages seeking comment . when tiger , born in 1975 , was just starting out as a golfer , earl jr. , who was a tool and die maker , says he cut down some clubs and worked in the shop getting them ready for the pint-sized lad . even after he moved out of the family 's house into his own apartment , he would come down on weekends to visit . he says his little brother was a bit of a nerd , who when he was n't golfing was often on the computer .  he knew a lot about those computers at a young age .  tiger played other sports too -- soccer and cross-country -- but tiger excelled at golf from an early age , earl jr. says . he and his siblings never felt like tiger was getting special treatment -- their father was a born instructor , earl says , and spent a lot of time in the backyard playing baseball with he and kevin , too . earl woods sr. , a retired military officer , was a dominating presence . many people wonder if tiger changed greatly after his father died . earl jr. ca n't say for sure , but says their father instilled good values in his children and that tiger is a good man who  made critical mistakes  in his marriage . earl jr. says tiger is n't a womanizer -- he had been surrounded by groupies since his days as a teen national champion and young celebrity -- so he 's puzzled as to why tiger is reported to have had so many affairs recently . he thinks hanging around with other celebrities that were living a playboy lifestyle affected tiger . and he thinks it would be different if earl sr. were still around .  my dad let tiger be his own man when he was alive ,  earl jr. says .  but i think that tiger felt an obligation to make my father proud of him and not get caught up in -- the different things that some popular people get caught up in and that he had to live his life walking down a certain path .  but with him gone , i do n't know if there 's anybody in his group that holds him to task anymore .  his half-brother lost his way , he says .  what i saw was that -- he lost a part of himself ,  he says .  i think that our father was a part of tiger so much that , when he passed , tiger became lost . that he did n't know how to fill that void .  but the tiger talked about by media and critics is n't the real eldrick woods , he says . tiger is n't arrogant , just very confident of his abilities , earl jr says . and he feels that as a golfer he needs to conduct himself a certain way with people . some people misinterpret that as aloofness , his brother says . some may question why earl jr. is speaking now . he says it 's not because he wants money from his famous half-sibling . he says that after tiger 's auto accident and the subsequent scandal last november , his family wanted to give tiger some time . but now they want a few things . they want him to know about kevin . they want people to know the real tiger woods . but most of all , they just want to know how he 's doing .", "summary": " earl woods jr. tells cnn he has n't spoken to his half-brother in four years .   family has reached out to tiger but he has not responded , he says .   tiger learned his values from his father , who died in 2006 .   earl jr. believes tiger has no one to keep him on the right path .
