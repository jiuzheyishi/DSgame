{"text": "` great crime ' : tristram hunt says his party created a culture of low expectations for state school pupils . labour created a culture of low expectations for state school pupils , tristram hunt , the shadow education secretary , has admitted . he said it was a ` great crime ' that the last government had failed to pushed children more than simply aim for them to achieve a c grade at gcse level . he also admitted that exams had been dumbed down in recent years , saying ` yes , there are elements of grade inflation ' . labour now wants to introduce licences for teachers , stripping them of their right to be in the classroom if they fail assessments carried out every five years . in a startlingly frank admission , mr hunt said : ` the great crime was an awful lot of effort being put on kids getting a c at gcse , then not going further . there should be no limits - the system should be saying how far can this child go ? ' schools were too focused on the pass grade , ` c ' , because of its significance in league tables . he said that education should not just be about exam results . ` what do people who send their children to private school want ? it 's not just smaller class sizes . it 's the playing fields and the after-school stuff like music and drama because they help to build confidence and character . ' he told the times : ` we need to work out how we can generate all those elements for everyone within a broad education and value them alongside academic rigour . ' labour would not shut surviving grammar schools but mr hunt said their social mix should be questioned . ` if they are simply about merit why do we see the kind of demographics and class make-up within them ? ' instead of focusing on a handful of specialist schools , he called for the whole system to be more aspirational . a source close to mr gove said that mr hunt was ` right ' to acknowledge mistakes with league tables , adding : ` we 're getting rid of the five a * to c league-table measure that lay behind it . in future , league tables will be based on progress across eight subjects - so no more focus on the c/d borderline . ' labour has also revived its plans to licence teachers in the same way that doctors and lawyers are regulated . changes : the party have also outlined plans to licence teachers in the same was as medics and lawyers -lrb- library photo -rrb- . ` you need a critical mass of good teachers , ' mr hunt said . ` the quality of an education system can not be greater than the quality of its teachers . ' under his plans , teachers would have their lessons assessed by other teachers to demonstrate they were keeping pace . a new royal college of teaching would supervise the licencing regime . he said while bad teachers could currently be fired , there was a lot of ` recycling ' where they were simply hired by another school . ` there is usually a collection of teachers who are not at the cutting edge and this is a check upon that . if a teacher has left one school but then gets a renewed enthusiasm , great , but they would need to pass the re-licensing a s a sign of confidence . ' mr hunt , who has been tipped as a future leader , was privately educated at # 15,000-a-year university college school in north london and has a phd from cambridge . he has previously said he would not rule out sending his own children to private school , although his son currently attends a state school in london . mr hunt favours a return to the ` basics ' in education and wants more children to read the classics and study latin .", "summary": " tristam hunt , shadow education secretary , says labour failed pupils .   said children were not pushed to achieve beyond c grades at gcse .   admitted ` grade inflation ' had made exams easier in recent years .
