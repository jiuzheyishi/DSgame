{"text": "tlc 's reality show  19 kids and counting  has tons of fans , but more than 80,000 ca n't be counted in that number . that 's the amount who have signed a change.org petition to have the show canceled in light of what the petition calls the duggar family 's anti-lgbt stance . according to the petition , michelle duggar 's voice can be heard on a recorded call from this past summer urging the citizens of fayetteville , arkansas , to vote to repeal a law that forbids business owners and landlords from evicting and firing people based on gender identity .  the fayetteville city council is voting on an ordinance this tuesday night that would allow men -- yes i said men -- to use women 's and girls ' restrooms , locker rooms , showers , sleeping areas and other areas that are designated for females only ,  the petition reports duggar as saying on the robocall .  i do n't believe the citizens of fayetteville would want males with past child predator convictions that claim they are female to have a legal right to enter private areas that are reserved for women and girls .  the petition says duggar 's words  reek of ignorance and fear mongering .   just because someone is transgendered does n't mean they are a child predator or a rapist ,  the petition says .  the claim that this ordinance would provide predators with access to women 's restrooms in order to assault or leer at girls or women is nothing more than fear-mongering and spreading ignorance and hatred .  the duggars are known for being devout christians who do n't believe in practicing birth control and whose children follow courtship rules that include no kissing until their wedding day . the petition also says that the duggars ' oldest son , josh , has taken a job with the family research center , which the petition says  is such a hate-filled , anti-gay organization that the southern poverty law center in 2010 labeled it a ` hate group ' for its ` dissemination of false and demonizing propaganda about gays and lesbians . '  the movement comes on the heels of controversy about a recent posting on the duggars '  official  facebook page . after their newly married daughter jessa was criticized for sharing an instagram photo of herself kissing her husband ben seewald , michelle and jim bob duggar posted an image of themselves kissing and challenging others to do the same . john becker , who blogs about lgbt issues at the bilerico project , wrote that pictures of same-sex couples were deleted . a counter petition to support the duggars has been started and as of friday had more than 6,000 signatures .", "summary": " as of thursday the petition had more than 80,000 signatures .   the duggars are known as devout christians .   the petition also mentions their son 's new job .
