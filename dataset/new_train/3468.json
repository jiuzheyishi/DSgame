{"text": "when deborah lee james became top boss of the air force seven months ago she had no inkling a nuclear crisis was brewing . but once it erupted in the form of exam-cheating by dozens of missile launch officers , she quickly announced conclusions that no air force leader before her had dared state publicly . the nuclear missile corps ' problems run deep , she said , morale is ` spotty ' and forceful fixes are needed . james reached those conclusions in january after a short visit to the three air force bases that operate intercontinental ballistic missiles , or icbms . secretary of the air force deborah lee james speaks to the associated press during an interview at the pentagon on july 11 . she met not only with commanders but with the rank-and-file , including enlisted airmen who keep the missiles running properly and junior officers trained to launch them . ' i walked away believing there was something systemic , cultural if you will , that went beyond cheating and -lrb- that 's -rrb- why i felt like we needed to not just address cheating -- yes , we have to fix that -- but we need to go farther than that , ' she said in an associated press interview in her pentagon office overlooking the potomac river . to her it seemed natural to acknowledge this publicly , although others in the air force had chosen not to . ' i hope and believe i am a straight talker , ' she said . ' i think it 's better to just say it . do n't mince words . and so i thought it was important to just stand up publicly and say what seemed to be obvious to me . ' her candor and crisis management have won praise from republicans and democrats alike . ` she has forged relationships with troops and listened to their inputs , ' said rep. howard ` buck ' mckeon , the california republican who is chairman of the house armed services committee . ` she has identified shortfalls in icbm leadership and made corrections . that is a sharp difference from the way air force leadership has handled these issues in the past . ' james , 55 , is only the second woman to serve as air force secretary , the service 's top civilian official . she took office in december 2013 following months of associated press reports documenting problems inside the nuclear missile corps , starting with the sidelining in april 2013 of 19 launch officers at minot air force base in north dakota for what commanders called attitude and performance flaws . it was an unprecedented action and coincided with the ap 's publication of an internal email from an officer at minot complaining of ` rot ' inside the icbm force . deborah lee jameshas been praised for the way she handled the air force exam scandal . senior air force officers at the time generally dismissed the reports , saying any problems were localized and limited . ' i do n't particularly agree that we have any compelling problems ' in the icbm force , maj. gen. garrett harencak , the top nuclear weapons staff officer at air force headquarters , said in june 2013 . ` the morale of our crews out there -- i 've been out there -- is exceedingly , exceedingly , good . ' james took a look for herself in january 2014 and saw something different , worse than she had imagined . she traveled to each of the three icbm bases after disclosing at a pentagon news conference that 34 launch officers at malmstrom air force base in montana had been implicated in a cheating scandal and a small number of those were also suspects in an illegal drug use investigation . -lrb- the number implicated in the cheating later rose to nearly 100 . -rrb- . before james hit the road she quickly gathered enough information about the dimensions of the cheating to satisfy herself that it did not amount to ' a major problem that could be of catastrophic consequences ' . ` but still , why did this happen and what is going on ? ' she asked herself . what she found was a set of interconnected problems that went deeper than the cheating . she spotted morale issues , with airmen asking , in essence , why is it that the air force claims the nuclear mission is its no. 1 priority and yet missile facilities are in poor shape and spare parts are in short supply ? ` some of the things i saw had been of a longstanding nature , ' she said . ` so why had these things not gotten fixed before ? it 's a good question , and i ca n't really answer that . ' james , a native of rumson , new jersey , never served in the military but spent a decade -- from 1983 to 1993 -- as a professional staff member on the house armed services committee , which has oversight responsibility for the defense department . from 2002-13 she was a senior executive at science applications international corp. in mclean , virginia . john hamre , who was on the professional staff of the senate armed services committee while she was a counterpart on the house side , said he was not surprised that she quickly sized up the nuclear problem and attacked it head on . ` she is wise enough to know that you can not fudge your way through a political problem if you do n't solve it . it keeps coming back . the way she handled the icbm problem was typical debbie james , ' said hamre , who also worked closely with james from 1993-97 when he was the pentagon 's budget chief and she was assistant secretary of defense for reserve affairs . hamre , who later was deputy defense secretary , is now president and chief executive officer of the center for strategic and international studies , a washington think tank . james said she was surprised by the icbm crisis , but not unprepared . ` life comes at you fast and furious sometimes , ' she said with a grin .", "summary": " nine air force officers were fired in march following a widespread exam cheating scandal .   col. robert stanley was found directly responsible for the 100 soldiers implicated and resigned .   air force secretary deborah lee james has been praised for how she openly discussed the problems in the ranks .
