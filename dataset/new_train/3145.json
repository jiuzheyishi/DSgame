' however , ms bhuiyan had never granted permission for mr mohrer to follow her using the tool . two months earlier , ms bhuiyan had asked about competitor lyft , and mr mohrer had emailed her logs of some of her uber trips . while uber would not comment on the allegation , it is understood that the company is now investigating mr mohrer . shocking : emil michael -lrb- pictured -rrb- , uber 's senior vice president , reportedly proposed looking into journalists ' ` personal lives ' and ` families ' while in the presence of a buzzfeed editor at a private dinner in new york . ` our data privacy policy applies to all employees : access to and use of data is permitted only for legitimate business purposes , ' a spokesperson for uber told mailonline . ` data security specialists monitor and audit that access on an ongoing basis . violations of this policy do result in disciplinary action , including the possibility of termination and legal action . ' the news follows another incident this week in which a senior executive at uber made a grovelling apology after suggesting putting a team together to dig up dirt on journalists who criticise his company . emil michael , who made the remarks at a private dinner in manhattan , said he had dreamed up an eight-man team who would find out about writers ' personal lives and families so that uber could discredit them . target : he was speaking with specific reference to sarah lacy -lrb- left -rrb- , editor of pandodaily , who recently wrote about deleting her uber app after the firm teamed up with an apparent escort service in france . the scheme was targeted at a particular silicon valley female editor who has savaged the company for its alleged ` sexism and misogyny ' - but drew an outraged backlash when it became public . a chorus of disapproval aimed at michael prompted a humiliating public apology to sarah lacy , the editor of pandodaily , in which he disowned the idea entirely . mr michael posted an apology to lacy 's twitter account , saying : ' i would like to apologise to you directly . my comments were wrong and i deeply regret them . ` neither me -lsb- sic -rsb- nor my company would ever engage in such activities . again , i apologize . ' the remarks will do little to improve uber 's fragile relationship with the media following the portrayal of its management team as insensitive and aggressive toward customer complaints . venue : during the dinner party at manhattan 's waverly inn -lrb- pictured -rrb- , michael was reportedly asked about the firm 's depictions in the press . in response , the executive suggested that uber should consider spending ' a million dollars ' of its reported $ 15billion worth on hiring four researchers and four journalists , it is claimed . under-fire : ashton kutcher has entered the firestorm surrounding taxi-hiring app uber . ashton kutcher has entered the firestorm surrounding under-fire taxi-hiring app uber and defended controversial comments made by an executive who suggested spending $ 1 million to dig up dirt on journalists who criticize the company . kutcher , an investor in the app , took to twitter on wednesday to show his support for beleaguered vp emil michael and described sarah lacy , a female journalist who has been highly critical of the company , as ` shady ' . ` what is so wrong about digging up dirt on shady journalist ? ' tweeted the celebrity tech entrepreneur who has invested in tech firms including skype , foursquare , airbnb and spotify through his venture capital firm a-grade . so as long as journalist are interested and willing to print half truths as facts ... yes we should question the source ' he continued in a series of tweets before he sought to clarify that he was speaking for himself and not uber . ` this should be fun ... here comes the part where journalist explain why they should be exempt from ridicule and judgement and probing ... ' he continued . and , indeed , the apology did not stop lacy from writing a scathing opinion piece on pandodaily , in which she said the plan was ` like a five-year-old pretending to be frank underwood ' - a reference to kevin spacey 's scheming politician character in netflix series house of cards . according to ms lacy , michael also called her cell phone and ask to speak in private , but hung up after she refused to have an off-the-record conversation . mr michael 's plan came up when he was asked about the firm 's negative press coverage . in response , the executive suggested that uber should consider spending ' a million dollars ' of its reported $ 15 billion worth on hiring four researchers and four journalists , according to buzzfeed . the eight-strong hit team would investigate ` your personal lives , your families ' with a view to discrediting journalists behind unfavorable reports on the taxi service , he said . mr michael was especially focused on ms lacy , who also recently accused uber of ` sexism and misogyny ' on her silicon valley website , writing : ` the company simply does n't respect us or prioritize our safety . ' apology : michael , who used to work at klout and also sits on a board advising the department of defense , later took to twitter to apologize for his comments to lacy herself , saying : ' i would like to apologize to you directly ' contradicting his remarks : he added : ` neither me nor my company would ever engage in such activities ' he reportedly expressed anger over her claims that , responding that women are far more likely to suffer assault at the hands of normal taxi drivers than uber drivers . in a statement to buzzfeed on monday evening , he said he believed he was speaking off the record and that his remarks did not reflect his nor uber 's views . ` the remarks attributed to me at a private dinner - borne out of frustration during an informal debate over what i feel is sensationalistic media coverage of the company i am proud to work for - do not reflect my actual views and have no relation to the company 's views or approach , ' he said . ` they were wrong no matter the circumstance and i regret them . ' at no point during the dinner did michael suggest the firm has already hired opposition researchers . an uber spokesman confirmed that the company does not carry out such research and has never considered doing it because it would be a ` clear violation of our privacy and data access policies ' . the event at waverly inn on friday evening was attended by a number of high-profile figures , including actor ed norton and publisher arianna huffington . uber consultant : the dinner was hosted by ian osborne -lrb- pictured -rrb- , ex-adviser to british pm david cameron . the event on friday evening was attended by actor ed norton -lrb- left -rrb- and publisher arianna huffington -lrb- right -rrb- . response : on monday , ms lacy responded to buzzfeed 's article on her site -lrb- pictured -rrb- , saying : ` companies should n't be allowed to go to illegal lengths to defame and silence reporters ' it comes as a legal battle between nevada 's highly regulated taxi industry and uber stumbled into complications as two state judges laid claim to hearing the same case . in court on monday , clark county district judge douglas herndon blamed the overlap on the state attorney general , who represents the nevada taxicab authority and nevada transportation authority . ' i think you 're jumping around to different jurisdictions trying to get a ruling , ' he said . the state regulators want to put an end to uber , which launched its ride-sharing services in las vegas , reno and carson city on october 24 . hours after the service was launched , the state hastily sought orders to halt the company 's business in all three cities . the attorney general later filed a complaint and motions in washoe county . on monday , uber asked the state supreme court to put a halt to the case . the company expects a decision in several days .", "summary": " josh mohrer , the new york manager , allegedly tracked johana bhuiyan .   buzzfeed claims mr mohrer did this twice using a tool called ` god view '   it is available to all employees and allows them to see customer activity .   this week , another employee said he wanted to ` dig up dirt ' on journalists .   emil michael , senior vice president , made comments at new york dinner .   allegedly suggested that uber should hire $ 1million team of researchers .   michael was reportedly speaking with specific reference to sarah lacy .   ms lacy , editor of pandodaily , is outspoken critic of online taxi service .
