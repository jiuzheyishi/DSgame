{"text": "esa 's rosetta mission is currently making its way towards a comet in the solar system . and , in a series of stunning new images , it reveals how comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko has begun to develop into an exciting ball of dust and gas . over a period of six weeks the comet has begun to extend its dusty veil known as a ` coma ' into space . this sequence of images was taken between 27 march and 4 may , as the gap between spacecraft and comet closed from around 3.1 million miles -lrb- five million kilometres -rrb- to 1.2 million miles -lrb- two million kilometres -rrb- . the rosetta spacecraft is set to rendezvous with the comet later this month before entering orbit in august and becoming the first spacecraft ever to orbit a comet . rosetta , . named after a block of stone that helped archeologists decipher ancient . egyptian hieroglyphs , will seek to help scientists unlock the . composition of comets and thereby understand more about the origins and . evolution of our solar system . the . probe was launched in 2004 and has since travelled around the sun five . times , picking up energy from earth and mars to line it up with its . final destination : comet 67p/churyumov -- gerasimenko . for . the coldest , loneliest leg of the mission , as rosetta travelled out . towards the orbit of jupiter , the spacecraft was put into deep-space . hibernation . later . this year , rosetta will complete its cruise towards the comet , meeting . with it in august , before putting its philae lander onto the comet 's . surface in november . once there it will follow the comet on its journey around the sun , performing extensive studies of the coma and the surface . and in november it will perform another first when it releases the philae lander , which if successful will be the first vehicle ever to land on a comet . by the end of the sequence of images of the comet the coma extends about 800 miles -lrb- 1,300 kilometres -rrb- . but the core of the comet , known as the nucleus , is itself just 2.5 miles -lrb- four kilometres -rrb- across and can not yet be seen . the coma has developed as a result of the comet moving progressively closer to the sun along its 6.5 year orbit . even though it is still more than 370 million miles -lrb- 600 million kilometres -rrb- from the sun - more than four times the distance between earth and sun - its surface has already started to warm , causing its ices to turn to gas and escape from its rock-ice nucleus . as the gas escapes , it also carries a cloud of tiny dust particles out into space , which slowly expands to create the coma . the warming will continue as the comet moves closer to the sun and activity rises , and pressure from the solar wind will eventually cause some of the material to stream out into a long tail . rosetta and the comet will be closest to the sun in august 2015 , between the orbits of earth and mars . the rosetta spacecraft launched in 2004 on a mission to study comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko -lrb- artist 's illustration shown -rrb- . it will rendezvous with the comet later this month before entering orbit in august , becoming the first spacecraft to orbit a comet . in november of this year the philae lander will be sent to touch down on the surface of the comet -lrb- artist 's illustration shown -rrb- , which will be the first landing ever performed on a comet . here , harpoons will be fired into the surface to keep it anchored while it studies its surroundings . the onset of activity now offers scientists the opportunity to study dust production and structures within the coma before getting much closer . ` it 's beginning to look like a real comet , ' says holger sierks , principal investigator for osiris , the optical , spectroscopic and infrared remote imaging system , at the max planck institute for solar system research , germany . ` it 's hard to believe that only a few months from now , rosetta will be deep inside this cloud of dust and en route to the origin of the comet 's activity . ' in addition , tracking the periodic changes in brightness reveals the nucleus is rotating every 12.4 hours ' about 20 minutes shorter than previously thought . ` these early observations are helping us to develop models of the comet that will be essential to help us navigate around it once we get closer , ' says sylvain lodiot , esa rosetta spacecraft operations manager . on 25 feb 2007 the rosetta spacecraft returned this stunning image of mars as it flew past the red planet on its way to the comet . the picture was taken by an imaging instrument on the philae lander at a distance of 620 miles -lrb- 1,000 kilometres -rrb- . below the solar array an area close to the syrtis region is visible on the planet 's disk . osiris and the spacecraft 's dedicated navigation cameras have been regularly acquiring images to help determine rosetta 's exact trajectory relative to the comet . using this information , the spacecraft has already started a series of manoeuvres that will slowly bring it in line with the comet before making it enters orbit in the first week of august . detailed scientific observations will then help to find the best location on the comet for the philae lander 's descent to the surface in november . the images shown here were taken during a six-week period that saw the orbiter 's 11 science experiments and the lander and its 10 instruments switched back on and checked out after more than 2.5 years of hibernation . earlier this week , a formal review brought these commissioning activities to a close , giving the official ` go ' for routine science operations . ` we have a challenging three months ahead of us as we navigate closer to the comet , but after a 10 ` year journey it 's great to be able to say that our spacecraft is ready to conduct unique science at comet 67p/c-g , ' says fred jansen , esa 's rosetta mission manager .", "summary": " esa 's rosetta spacecraft is getting ready to rendezvous with a comet .   and ice from the target has started to create a ` coma ' as it nears the sun .   this is seen in a series of images taken by the spacecraft as it approaches .   later this month rosetta will perform its first rendezvous with the comet .   it will become the first spacecraft ever to orbit a comet in august .   in november the philae lander will be the first vehicle to land on a comet .
