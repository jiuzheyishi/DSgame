{"text": "dozens of whales are dead after they got stuck on a remote beach in new zealand , authorities said monday . the 39 long-finned pilot whales became stranded overnight on farewell spit , a narrow claw of land that juts out into the sea from the northern tip of new zealand 's south island . twelve of the whales had died by the time they were found monday morning . conservation officials said they decided to euthanize the remaining 27 because the chances of getting them safely back out to sea were too slim .  they have come very high onto the beach in a big tide ,  said john mason , the conservation services manager for the area where the whales were found .  the big tides are now reducing , coming in further out from shore , so it would be difficult to get the large animals into deep enough water to refloat them .  he said that he and his staff had  carefully weighed up the likelihood of being able to refloat  the whales , but that they  determined that due to various factors it was unlikely they could be rescued .   rather than prolong the suffering of the remaining 27 whales , we decided to humanely euthanize them ,  he said in a statement . surrounded by oceans rich in marine life , new zealand has one of the highest stranding rates for sea mammals in the world . an average of about 300 dolphins and whales get stuck on the country 's coasts each year , according to project jonah , a nonprofit group that aims to rescue and protect marine mammals . golden bay , the area where the group of pilot whales got stuck , is known as a stranding hotspot because of its protruding coastline , gently sloping beaches and system of currents . pilot whales , which live offshore , are among the most vulnerable species to mass strandings in such conditions , according to the encyclopedia of new zealand . but the number of whales that died on farewell spit this week pales in comparison with some of new zealand 's worst strandings . in 1998 , more than 300 pilot whales died after they got stuck in doughboy bay on stewart island , which sits off the south coast of the south island . new zealand 's worst ever stranding took place in 1918 , the encyclopedia of new zealand says , when around 1,000 pilot whales got marooned on long beach in the chatham islands , which are situated hundreds of kilometers off the country 's east coast . scientists ask public to help find missing whales stranded off florida coast . cnn 's khushbu shah contributed to this report .", "summary": " the group of whales got stranded overnight on new zealand 's south island .   twelve had died by the morning and officials decided to euthanize 27 others .    it was unlikely they could be rescued ,  a local conservation official says .   new zealand has one of the highest stranding rates for marine mammals .
