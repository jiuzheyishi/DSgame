{"text": "the sometimes violent protests in ferguson , missouri , and the law enforcement response has sparked a debate about what some call the  militarization of police ,  after armored vehicles , stun grenades and high-tech weaponry were brought in to calm the violence . some of the equipment may be military surplus that came from the federal government through a program from the defense department 's defense logistics agency , which provides military equipment to local police departments across the country . the dla 's law enforcement support program was created in 1999 .  this is a program legislated by congress which allows the secretary to transfer some excess military property to local law enforcements ,  said pentagon spokesman rear adm. john kirby on tuesday . kirby said since 2007 the ferguson police department has received two humvees , one generator , and one cargo trailer . over the same time period , the st. louis county police department received six pistols , 12 rifles , 15 weapon sites , an explosives disposal robot , three helicopters , seven humvees -lrb- two used by ferguson police -rrb- , and two night-vision devices .  it 's still up to local law enforcement to determine how and when and where and under what circumstances they use excess military equipment ,  said kirby , but defense secretary chuck hagel  has been mindful of the public debate and discussion about this issue and asked his staff this morning about some additional information about this program .  according to kirby , hagel has received an information paper with more details on the program , but has yet to order a formal review . hagel wants a better understanding of the law and regulations governing the transfer program and what parts of that program are the responsibility of the defense department . the program has been in place for several years with little controversy and attention , but has grabbed the national spotlight with the unrest in ferguson , where police have used what looks like tactical military gear and vehicles , although it 's not clear what equipment may have actually come from pentagon inventories . complete coverage on ferguson shooting and protests . pentagon officials say a key issue for the department is the fact that once the equipment is transferred , the military has no control over how a local agency uses it . many police departments also get funding for military-style equipment from homeland security and the justice department , which operate programs aimed at beefing up police capability in the event of a terrorist attack . president barack obama called for a review of the program on monday .  i think it 's probably useful for to us review how the funding has gone , how local law enforcement has used grant dollars to make sure that what they are purchasing is stuff that they actually need . because there is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement and we do n't want those lines blurred , that would be contrary to our traditions and i think that there will be some bipartisan interest in reexamining some of those programs .  sen. carl levin , d-michigan , chairman of the senate armed services committee , said his committee would  review this program to determine if equipment provided by the defense department is being used as intended .  magazine : the aftermath in ferguson . read more about the flash point in the heartland at cnn.com / us .", "summary": " ferguson and st. louis pd received military surplus .   defense secretary chuck hagel wants to know more about the program .   some are alarmed at what is seen as the  militarization of police  in ferguson .   many police departments get u.s. military surplus or funds to buy equipment .
