' and willis certainly made a statement with the opening event , which saw 28 dancers take over the london street to perform singin ' in the rain . paying tribute to the british capital , the performers arrived in one of the city 's iconic red buses - all sporting coats and boots from the latest hunter original collection . country in the city : the regent street store has been designed to resemble a barn and aims to pays homage to the british countryside within an urban setting . dramatic scenes : the opening event saw 28 dancers take over the iconic london shopping street with a production inspired by singin ' in the rain . just to ensure all eyes were definitely on the store , a free-runner scaled down the side before the production climaxed with a torrent of water spraying down onto regent street . inside , the store - which looks a little like a souped-up hay barn - the decor pays homage to the british countryside . seating areas resemble the traditional farmhouse boot room , with boots displayed against a backdrop of box hedging and green tiles . willis , like his wife a fan of all things high-tech , also oversaw the installation of a five-metre led screen that cuts through both floors and plays fashion shows and ad campaigns on a loop . how fitting : the event was inspired by gene kelly 's famous performance and hunter 's heritage of protecting from the weather and all terrains . making a scene : a freerunner scaled the side of the new store before the production climaxed with a torrent of water spraying down onto regent street . the grass is greener : seating areas resemble the traditional boot room and the collection is displayed against a backdrop of box hedging . ` the design of the store references some classic architectural features and materials that you might traditionally associate with the countryside or the outdoors , but they have been reinvented into an urban context , ' he explained . fresh from an evening spent having dinner with george clooney and his new wife , amal alamuddin , the 44-year-old told of his plans to ensure that city shoppers get a truly rural shopping experience . ` the result of this is that you really experience the merging of the countryside and the city under one roof ; ' he enthuses . ` it is these two worlds coming together that represent what the new hunter brand is all about .
