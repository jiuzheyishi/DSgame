{"text": "every year around 1,000 people in the uk die waiting for a heart transplant and scientists are searching for a lifesaving alternative . advances in transplant technology could one day enable surgeons to use animal organs in people , which could solve the problem of donor organ shortages around the world . now scientists have managed to transplant pig hearts into baboons , whose immune systems were supressed to stop them rejecting their new hearts . take heart : advances in transplant technology could one day enable surgeons to use animal hearts in people , which could solve the problem of donor organ shortages around the world . a heart transplant using a human heart is pictured . there were 145 heart transplants in the uk last year but a shortage of donor hearts . a transplant might be considered for someone who has severe heart failure , but it could be years before a suitable organ becomes available . currently , a heart transplant operation takes between four and six hours . the patient is connected to a heart-lung bypass machine that makes the blood circulate around their body . the surgeon will them transplant the new heart before making it beat . when the heart beings to take over pumping and the patient 's condition is stable , the bypass machine will be turned off . the surgeon will then close the cut-open breastbone with wire . the procedure is risky and the heart could fail to pump , or the body could reject the new organ . approximately one in 10 people dies due to complications in the year following surgery . nine out of 10 people say they support organ donation , but only three in 10 sign the register . just like the transplant of human hearts , there is a risk that the new heart will fail after surgery , but experts reported that the pig hearts survived in their recipients for more than 500 days . far more people are waiting for organ transplants than there are donor organs so if animal organs can be used , thousands of lives could be saved across the globe . dr muhammad mohiuddin , chief of transplantation at the national institutes of health 's national heart , lung and blood institute , in bethesda , maryland , told livescience that transplanting organs from animals could be used as a stopgap until human organs become available , or as a complete replacement . he told the american association for thoracic surgery in toronto that tissue rejection by the recipient 's immune system is the biggest hurdle to a heart transplant . in their . experiment , they used genetically engineered pig hearts -- which are . similar to a human 's - without the genes known to cause tissue rejection . in humans , and replaced them with human genes to encourage the body to . accept the heart . to . study the hearts , they implanted them into the abdomens of baboons - . without removing their original hearts - but connecting the pig 's hearts to . the baboons ' circulatory system . scientists have managed to transplant pig . hearts into baboons -lrb- stock image left -rrb- , whose immune systems were supressed to stop them . rejecting their new hearts . pig -lrb- stock image right -rrb- hearts were genetically engineered to minimise the chances of rejecting in the recipients ' bodies . the experiment proved that the scientists can control the rejection of organs using immunosuppressive drugs . the scientists will now use the genetically engineered organs to replace baboon 's hearts and if successful , it could still be years before animal transplants can be used in clinical trials on humans . dr mohiuddin believes that other tissues could also be transplanted from animals to humans , so that people could carry on with their lives with a pig 's liver , kidneys or lungs in the future .", "summary": " scientists in maryland transplanted pig .   hearts into baboons , whose immune systems were supressed to stop them .   rejecting their new hearts .   pig hearts were genetically engineered without the genes causing tissue rejection in humans and were replaced with human genes instead .   the hearts survived in their recipients for more than 500 days .   it could be years before clinical trials can be conducted on humans .   one expert thinks that animal liver , kidneys , lungs and hearts could be implanted into humans in the future .
