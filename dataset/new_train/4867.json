{"text": "-lrb- cnn -rrb- on the foggy , icy oregon interstate , kaleb whitby plowed into the back of a jackknifed semi truck , flipping his pickup . then the real horror came : the sight of another tractor-trailer zooming straight toward him .  when i saw those lights coming , i knew he was going to hit me ,  whitby said .  and then i closed my eyes and prayed that everything turned out ok . that was all i could do .  he gripped the steering wheel tightly as the second semi smashed through his pickup , crushing it like a soda can .  it was just metal crunching and glass . it was just all fast and loud .  whitby told cnn 's  new day  that he was a man of faith .  i do believe , and i 'm very firm in that , and i just held on to the wheel as tight as i could , tucked my head and just kept praying the whole time . after he hit , i just hoped that it would be over with soon ,  he said . the crash left only two things intact : the marred shell surrounding whitby 's seat , and whitby , who was pinned between the two trucks .  when the second truck hit my back end , it spun my bed underneath the first trailer that i hit and continued to swing my nose around , and i guess put my nose underneath the second trailer . and as that trailer came around , it just kind of pushed me down and further into that -- that small v where you can actually see both the trailers within arm 's reach on both sides . and so if they would 've pushed me even a foot , it would have crushed me ,  the 27-year-old father said . but he was alive . and alert . and nearly scratch-free . whitby was part of a 26-vehicle pileup saturday on interstate 84 outside baker city , oregon .  this is the biggest crash i have seen in a while ,  oregon state police sgt. kyle hove said .  it was extremely slick out there . one semi that spun around on the black ice started the chain reaction .  about a dozen people were injured , including two seriously . but there were no fatalities .  it 's surprising no one died in this ,  hove said . before trying to wiggle out , whitby decided to let the sound of traffic subside  to make sure things were ok .  then passers-by came to help .  one guy pulled my feet out just enough so i could slide out of the car .  whitby 's injuries ? a bruise on his left eyebrow and a few scratches on his right hand . he told  new day  he thanked god for his survival .  i do n't have the answers , and if i did , i probably would n't be doing what i 'm doing now . when things like that happen , and what i 've kinda come to realize , is that it is a miracle and that i need to take that into my life and remember it , and now i need to figure out who i need to be in this life and what i need to accomplish .  because how many people do n't get the chance -- a second chance -- at escaping a situation like that ?
