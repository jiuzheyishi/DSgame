{"text": "getting enough sleep will be one of the biggest challenges facing the first astronauts travelling the 47million miles to mars . poor sleep was a key problem encountered by six volunteers during a 17-month simulated round trip to the red planet . the men - three russians , an italian , a frenchman and a chinese man - spent 520 days and nights confined to a 550 cubic metre ` spacecraft ' and cut off from the outside world . scroll down for video . members of the mars500 project , pictured , were confined to a 550 cubic metre ` spacecraft ' and all but one suffered sleep pattern problems . the team underwent a simulated 520 day mission to mars - but were actually inside this hanger in moscow . scientists operating the mars500 project in russia monitored their medical and psychological condition as well as activity levels and sleep patterns . the men were kept isolated and did not have access to natural light or fresh air . for one month of the project , funded by russian and european space agencies , they were able to explore another enclosed area that represented the surface of mars . as the mission progressed , crew members became more sedentary and most experienced sleep disturbances , the data revealed . without normal sleep-wake activity cycles , their ` body clock ' , or circadian rhythm , patterns became disrupted . the mock spaceship made most of the volunteers lethargic and sleepy . four of the men had considerable trouble sleeping and some had depression issues . only . one man 's sleep was mostly unaffected during the ` trip ' , according to . the findings published in the journal proceedings of the national . academy of sciences . the team aboard the fake mars mission celebrating halloween . the team celebrating chinese new year onboard their simulated spacecraft . they emerged one by one after their 520 day ` mission ' and the first results show sleep deprivation was the biggest issue . the tired looking team moments after they were released from the simulator . previous simulated missions have even included simulated ` mars walks ' supposed to replicate excursions onto the surface of mars . one of the six volunteers - who were . paid about # 62,000 - slept nearly half an hour less each night than he . did when he started the mission , affecting how he went about his day . co-author professor david dinges , from . the university of pennsylvania 's perelman school of medicine , said : ' a . take-away message from this line of research is the life-sustaining . importance that healthy sleep duration and timing plays for everyone . ` as a global society , we need to . re-evaluate how we view sleep as it relates to our overall health and . ability to lead productive lives . nasa landed the curiosity rover on mars last year which has sent back information to give scientists a better picture of the planet . ` whether it is an astronaut being . challenged to reach another planet or a newborn baby just learning to . walk , the human body 's need for sleep is as essential as our need for . food and water and integral to our ability to thrive .
