{"text": "there were few wealthier men in the united states than henry graves jr. . born into an august banking family , he had spent his life accumulating a multi-million-dollar fortune by investing shrewdly in railways and banking . like many rich men , graves liked to collect objects as well as money . while most ordinary men collected stamps or coins , he acquired holiday homes , modern art , motorboats and expensive watches . his favourite boat was his 50-foot speedster , the eagle , on which he liked to potter around the upper saranac lake in upstate new york . scroll down for video . time lord : american banker henry graves jr -lrb- left -rrb- commissioned the ` holy grail ' of watches -lrb- right -rrb- in 1925 only to suffer its curse . one afternoon late in 1936 , graves took out the eagle with his daughter gwendolen , who found her father in a morose mood . her eyes widened when he pulled a large watch out of his pocket and looked at it intensely . ` such things bring one nothing but trouble , ' said graves , who by then was in his late 60s . ` notoriety brings bad fortune . ' gwendolen knew that this was no ordinary timepiece . it was the ultimate expression of her father 's obsession with collecting watches and , in particular , those made by the swiss firm patek philippe . this week , that watch broke records at auction when it was sold by sotheby 's in geneva for # 13.4 million to an anonymous bidder . with auction house costs , the mystery buyer will have to fork out a total of # 15.1 million . it comes as no surprise , for the watch is commonly regarded as the most important ever made , the ` holy grail of horology ' . graves had been buying watches from patek philippe since 1903 , and by 1910 he had started to commission them . many were engraved with the family 's coat of arms . but he wanted more than mere engravings to make his watches special . he wanted his patek philippes to be the most complex watches in the world , including as many ` complications ' as possible - the horological term for any feature of a watch that goes beyond simply showing hours , minutes and seconds . such was his obsession that he started competing with james ward packard , a luxury car manufacturer , to see who could produce the most impressive timepiece . graves secretly approached patek philippe in 1925 . he wanted , he insisted , nothing less than ` the most complicated watch ' on the planet , one that was ` impossibly elaborate ' . what followed was , in the words of author stacy perman in her book a grand complication , ` a nearly eight-year odyssey ' in which teams of patek philippe 's craftsmen , scientists and engineers did , indeed , create the most complicated watch made before the age of computer-aided design . made by patek philippe , the henry graves supercomplication is the most complex watch ever assembled entirely by hand and took five years to make . they spent three years researching the project and five years making the watch . in total , the timepiece -- with two clock faces , one on each side -- has 24 complications . one shows the phases of the moon , others the times of sunset and sunrise in new york and even the pattern of the stars each night above mr graves 's apartment in the city . there are complications revealing the days of the week , an alarm , a stopwatch and a perpetual calendar . grave 's masterpiece blew packard 's out of the water . packard had got there first and his was the first watch to feature a sky chart , including 500 golden stars , centered above his home in ohio . yet the masterpiece that became known as the graves supercomplication never brought its owner the pleasure he expected . far from it . after he had taken delivery of it in 1933 at a cost of $ 15,000 -lrb- about # 650,000 at today 's prices -rrb- the supercomplication seemed to bring him not only unwanted attention but great misfortune - so much so that on the eagle on that day in 1936 , graves cut the engine of the boat and looked from the watch to the water . ` what is the point of being wealthy and owning such objects if something like this could happen ? ' he asked his daughter . it was the time of the great depression , and graves had become a figure of public resentment after people who were starving and destitute discovered that he could spend thousands on such luxuries . in total , the timepiece - with two clock faces , one on each side - has 24 complications . one shows the phases of the moon , others the times of sunset and sunrise in new york and even the pattern of the stars each night above mr graves 's apartment in the city . but the banker believed the watch had brought him far worse than opprobrium in the public prints . in fact , he became convinced that it had come with a deadly curse . just seven months after graves received the watch , his best friend died . and worse was to come . in early november 1934 , graves answered the telephone to be told that his youngest son , george , had been hurtling in a car down a boulevard in pasadena , california , and crashed , killing himself . the news was devastating , and made even worse by the fact that graves had lost his eldest son , harry , in a car crash in 1922 when he was just 25 years old . for graves , the supercomplication was a bad talisman , something that was meant to have brought him joy but had , instead , ushered in grief and hateful publicity . at one point he had come close to selling the watch , but decided against it . as the boat bobbed in the water , gwendolen watched her father pull back his arm . in his hand was the supercomplication and he was about to throw it into the lake . ` no , daddy ! ' gwendolen implored . ` let me hold on to that . some day i might want that . ' graves slowly let his arm fall to his side . gwendolen reached forward gingerly and took the watch from his hand , then put it in her pocket . with auction costs , the final price paid by a ` man in a red tie ' b at the auction in geneva , switzerland , was # 15.1 million - a new world record . from then on , gwendolen held on to the watch . her father lost interest in an item that he had craved all his life - a life that was to end in 1953 , when he was 86 . after his death , gwendolen inherited the supercomplication and in 1960 passed it to her son , reginald ` pete ' fullerton , who sold it to an industrialist from illinois for $ 200,000 -- some # 1million today . until 1999 the watch was displayed in a museum in illinois , then it was sold to a private collector by sotheby 's in new york for $ 11 million -lrb- about # 10 million today -rrb- . the auction house will not be drawn on the identities of either the seller or the buyer . but both will for ever thank gwendolen graves for stopping her father throwing the world 's most extraordinary timepiece into a cold lake in upstate new york all those decades ago .", "summary": " us banker henry graves jr ordered the ` supercomplication ' watch swiss manufacturer patek philippe in 1925 .   it was so complex that it later became known as the ` holy grail ' of watches and sold at auction this week for # 15.1 m .   the timepiece featured 24 complications including perpetual calendar , moon phases and night sky of new york city .   but it never brought graves the pleasure he expected and just seven months after he received it , his best friend died .   worse was to come when his youngest son george was killed in car crash on a boulevard in pasadena , california .   graves came close to selling watch believing it to be a bad talisman but his daughter persuaded him to keep it .   this article draws on the book , a grand complication : the race to build the world 's most legendary watch by stacy perman , published by atria/simon & schuster .
