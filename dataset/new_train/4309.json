{"text": "when the biggest cable company in the united states buys the second-biggest cable company in the united states , what does that mean for you ? if you 're afraid the answer might be a higher cable bill , you 're not alone .  americans already hate dealing with the cable guy -- and both these giant companies regularly rank among the worst of the worst in consumer surveys ,  said craig aaron , president and ceo of free press , a group that advocates for diversity in media ownership .  but this deal would be the cable guy on steroids -- pumped up , unstoppable and grasping for your wallet .  on thursday , comcast announced it had agreed to buy time warner cable for $ 45 billion . if approved by the federal government , and that 's no sure thing , the two would become a massive cable giant , serving one out of every three homes in the united states . -lrb- time warner cable was spun off from time warner in 2009 and no longer has any connection to the owner of cnn , hbo and warner bros. -rrb- . obviously , it 's way too early to know whether the dire predictions of folks such as aaron will come true . but the announcement has raised a lot of questions along those lines for subscribers of both companies , as well as others curious how the emergence of such a cable giant would impact them . so here 's an effort to address some of those questions as best we can : . when could this happen ? comcast says that if the merger is approved by federal regulators , they would become one with time warner cable by the end of this year . subscribers to the two companies should n't see any changes before then . if it 's any guide , comcast 's acquistion of nbc universal was slowed down by the regulatory review process and took 13 months before it was completed in 2011 . would my bill go up ? it depends upon whom you ask . as noted above , there are activists dedicated to fighting big media mergers on the argument that relying on a small handful of giant companies kills competition and drives up prices in any market .  an enlarged comcast would be the bully in the schoolyard , able to dictate terms to content creators , internet companies , other communications networks that must interconnect with it , and distributors who must access its content ,  said john bergmayer , senior staff attorney for online consumer activist group public knowledge .  by raising the costs of its rivals and business partners , an enlarged comcast would raise costs for consumers , who ultimately pay the bills .  but some industry analysts say there 's no reason the merger would directly impact subscriber wallets -- at least no more than they 're already being hit .  i think this is more of a story about two companies wanting to get together to improve their market share and revenues for their stock price than it is for customers ,  said tech industry analyst jeff kagan .  i do n't think this is a story about customers at all .  kagan noted that since comcast and time warner cable are largely in different u.s. markets , the merger would n't mean a loss of competition . but that does n't mean cable bills wo n't go up , he said , because they 're already doing just that .  cable television prices have continually risen over time ; the price customers pay roughly doubles every 10 years ,  kagan said .  i do n't see that changing .  how about service quality ? if history holds , subscribers to both companies could be in for some bumps along the way .  whenever there are mergers of two large customer-service providers ... we tend to see quite a few problems ,  said david vanamburg , managing director of the american customer satisfaction index , citing surveys about mergers between airlines , banks and other companies . he said problems could be caused by hiccups in merging customer database -- things such as double billing or accounts getting lost .  we 'd be surprised if a new hybrid comcast-time warner does n't produce a lower level of customer satisfaction for a year or two ,  he said .  customers have felt burned in the past by large mergers where choice is effectively reduced .  and it 's not like a lot of people are in love with their cable service to start with . financial site moneyrates.com released a survey thursday in which 25 % respondents called cable companies the worst for customer service . that led credit card companies at 15 % , insurance companies at 14 % and phone companies at 12 % . past gripes about cable-tv and broadband companies have focused on high rates and the difficulty of getting customer-service help over the phone , according to acsi research . many consumers now pay more for tv and internet service than they do for heat or electricity . consumers in most areas of the u.s. do n't have a choice between cable tv providers , which makes them feel helpless when rates rise or service is poor , vanamburg said . would my cable offerings change ? in terms of services , this could be a win for time warner cable customers . if the deal goes through , twc customers would likely be offered comcast 's wider menu of channels and services . while comcast customers are n't necessarily satisfied all the time , a lot of its hardware and software has gotten high marks . in its announcement of the planned merger , comcast said that , among other services , it offers  50,000 video on-demand choices on television , 300,000 plus streaming choices on xfinitytv.com , xfinity tv mobile apps that offer 35 live streaming channels plus the ability to download to watch offline later , and the newly launched x1 cloud dvr .  if the merger goes through , comcast also would become the largest broadband provider in the united states . so time warner cable subscribers would presumably have new options on that front as well .", "summary": " proposed comcast-time warner cable merger raises some concerns .   some fear a massive cable company would mean higher rates for tv , internet .   one analyst believes the move is more about market share .   cable prices already are doubling every 10 years .
