{"text": "in 1974 , charles koch started the charles koch foundation . in 1976 , the foundation was renamed cato institute , with koch as one of the co-founders . his vision was to build a nonpartisan organization that would advance ideas that enable all people to prosper by promoting liberty , limited government , free markets and peace . that vision has remained a constant since the beginning . i currently serve on the board of cato , and have worked with libertarian organizations for more than 20 years , including mercatus center and the institute for humane studies . i have worked closely with charles koch and his brother david on numerous libertarian endeavors . in each instance , these two men have consistently championed libertarian principles , even in the face of unfair and inaccurate criticism . robert levy , cato 's current chairman , would have you believe otherwise . according to his april 2 op-ed , charles and david koch seek to turn cato into a  policy shop for the kochs ' political operations .  this is patently false . david , who has been a director of cato since 1987 and serves on its executive committee , and charles have consistently supported a nonpartisan cato . in 1980 , charles brought a resolution before the cato board confirming that cato should be nonpartisan . together , they have contributed approximately $ 40 million to the institute . cato 's independence has never been in question in the 37 years the kochs have been involved with the organization , and there is nothing real to suggest it will be an issue going forward . in bringing up previous conversations that he had with david koch , levy is distorting the record in order to support his position . i attended the november 2011 meeting where levy spoke with david . subsequent conversations with levy confirmed that the kochs have never proposed that cato cooperate with only one group , or work exclusively with koch-affiliated groups or groups affiliated with one political party . david reiterated this point publicly in a statement on march 22 . levy wrote that the kochs seek to  get -lrb- their -rrb- way  or  take control  of cato . this is misleading . ed crane , who is the president of cato , wants to maintain control of the institute by circumventing cato 's shareholders ' agreement . all that the kochs seek is for the parties to cato 's shareholders ' agreement -lrb- which has been in place since 1985 -rrb- to be bound by that agreement . crane and levy do not want this because , with the recent death of one of cato 's shareholders , they are concerned that they will lose control of cato . we should ask why self-professed libertarians would seek to abrogate voluntary agreements -- a key tenet of libertarian thought . crane and levy have talked about seeking a board of independent directors , but every action by them suggests they want the opposite -- a board that is responsive to and dependent upon them , as well as donors they view as acceptable . when i was unanimously elected to the cato board in 2010 , i was excited about the prospect of working with an organization of cato 's reputation . i had also previously been offered a job by crane in 2002 . i expected an organization where people would be free to engage in constructive debates -- where differing points of view would be acknowledged and respected . what i found was something very different . what is most upsetting is that all of this public battle could have been avoided . charles and david koch were willing to keep the 2011 cato board in place without making any changes , but crane and levy demanded an immediate vote on directors . the kochs have also proposed third-party mediation , but crane and levy refused that as well , calling mediation a delay tactic . it is crane and levy 's concern about their control of cato , rather than concern for the good of the organization , that is driving the dispute . cato is losing its voice and focus , at a time when the debate over the role of the government in our society is more needed than ever . if cato 's board members truly care about the institute 's future , they should demand that crane and levy stop this scorched-earth public relations fight , which is weakening the organization and harming its reputation , and force immediate negotiations . just last week , charles koch again proposed that the parties choose a third-party mediator in hopes of reaching an agreement . cato 's management continues to refuse it . they show no desire to end this state of affairs short of capitulation to crane and levy 's demands . if cato is truly to become independent , then it needs to become independent from all of its shareholders -- first and foremost , crane .", "summary": " kevin gentry : charles koch has consistently championed libertarian ideas .   gentry : cato chairman robert levy would have you believe otherwise .   he says the koch brothers support independence for cato and have given it $ 40 million .   gentry : if levy does n't stop dispute , cato will weaken and lose its reputation .
