{"text": "more than half of young britons say that friends seeing unflattering pictures of them on facebook is one of the biggest concerns in their life . four in ten worry about friends putting uncomplimentary photos of them on the site , with women concerned about it more often than men . the figures were revealed by a survey for shopping site vouchercodes.co.uk . its co-founder , duncan jennings , dubbed the trend ` virtual vanity ' . a fifth of facebook users regularly exaggerate posts on their page to make their lives appear more exciting . a quarter of the 2,000 people aged between 18 and 25 who were interviewed for the survey admitted that they felt low and unpopular when they saw friends talking about social events to which they had not been invited . a further 25 per cent were so worried about their appearance on the site that they regularly splashed out on new clothes to avoid being photographed in the same outfit twice . the poll also revealed that young britons spent an average of one hour and 20 minutes a day on facebook , but nearly ten per cent used it for more than eight hours daily -- the equivalent of a full working day . nearly ten per cent of young brits use facebook for more than eight hours a day . a fifth of users were so concerned about their online appearance that they regularly exaggerated posts on their page to make their lives appear more exciting . mr jennings said : ` facebook is an integral part of young people 's lives but it 's putting pressure on them to fit in and look the part , which is especially challenging for groups such as cash-strapped students . ' internet psychologist graham jones said : ` those aged 18 to 25 are very aware of how they appear to others . they are still just completing the formation of their self-identity and they can be quite affected by anything that makes them doubt themselves . ` anything that attacks who or how they are is quite impactful and they can get quite upset by such things on facebook . ' due to the rise of social-networking sites , young people today are under constant scrutiny and observation -- more so than any other generation before them . mr jones said : ` they are alerted every time anything happens on facebook and so they are much more aware of what other people think of them . they are more likely to find out if all their friends have been invited to a party but they have n't . ` this means they have a tougher time coping with the world than older people did in their younger years . ' mr jones added that today 's youngsters could not shut out their peers ' judgment in the way previous generations could . he said : ` this judging is constant and can affect their self-esteem in a negative way . '", "summary": " not being invited to social events also a worry for young adults .   25 % bought new clothes so not seen in the same outfit twice .   10 % of young brits use facebook for more than eight hours daily .
