{"text": "despite most humans ' land-centric view , earth is an ocean planet . the global ocean covers more than two-thirds of our planet 's surface and makes life as we know it possible : it produces half of the oxygen we breathe , helps regulate our climate and provides the single largest habitat for life on earth . yet , with nearly 2 miles or 3,000 meters of water covering more than half the surface of our planet , much of this vast realm remains unexplored and unexamined . but not unconsidered . indeed , our progress is not limited by scientists ' and engineers ' imaginations , but rather by the rate and cost of development of technologies suitable to pursue the cause . advances in satellite technology provide us with global coverage in the study of earth 's atmosphere . but in the case of the ocean , that approach quite literally only grazes the surface . what happens in the vast , deep ocean , out of sight and beyond the reach of sunlight and satellites ? here 's one example why we should care : in 1977 , diving in the human occupied vehicle alvin , scientists investigating a volcanic ridge 2500 m -lrb- 1.5 miles -rrb- below sea-level found something totally unexpected -- lush ecosystems thriving at hydrothermal vents fueled by chemical energy released from the earth 's interior . this discovery , made just three years after new technology first enabled alvin to reach these depths , changed our understanding of how life can function here on earth , and opened entirely new fields of research . we now know that the hot-springs that sustain these  vent  ecosystems occur in every ocean basin and are host to hundreds of previously unknown animal species . in the past 30 years , those new species have been discovered at a rate of about one every two weeks -- and we still have more than 75 % of this 55,000-kilometer -lrb- > 34,000-mile -rrb- volcanic ridge system to explore . these same sites also host large metal deposits , which could become essential mineral resources for us in the future and some of these same systems may even reveal how life first originated -- on earth and beyond . given all the discoveries that we have made from an up-close investigation of these ocean ridges , we ca n't help but wonder what we might find at the far end of the same plate tectonic cycle where seafloor is drawn back into the earth 's interior at deep-ocean trenches . to date , only three humans have ever ventured to these deepest parts of the ocean -- the 1960 dive of jacques piccard and don walsh in the bathyscaphe trieste went unmatched until james cameron 's dive in his deepsea challenger last year . these were pioneering dives that took great courage . but to truly explore ocean trenches , scientists need to study them methodically which requires routine access to emerging technologies such as the hybrid remotely operated vehicle nereus , which dove to the challenger deep in 2009 , to the cayman trough in 2010 and will return there this summer , and to the pacific in 2014 . if our study of trenches progresses at the same rate as our past exploration of ocean ridges , however , another 30 years may pass before we 've explored even one-fifth of them . and it 's not just the trenches that need to be explored but the vast ocean volumes themselves . despite a decade of internationally-coordinated global investigation through the census of marine life , for example , earth 's largest ocean basin , the south pacific , also remains its least understood . we believe the deep pacific , for now , remains relatively untouched by the atmospheric pollutants -lrb- bomb-test radionuclides , chlorofluorocarbons -rrb- that are already penetrating deep into the atlantic . but how to characterize its pristine state before it is too late ? put simply , we need to innovate beyond the conventional ways of doing our work . in addition to direct human exploration of the seafloor , we need to mobilize a new generation of collaborative self-powering robots that can explore the oceans , top to bottom , while maintaining communication to shore-based scientists at all times . these robotic systems must be programmed with enough decision-making autonomy to know when to diverge from a mission to follow something important and unexpected that they have encountered , and to know when to alert a scientist on shore to solicit input on what they should do next . the development of these kinds of vehicles and systems is already underway , through partnerships between leading robotics laboratories and deep ocean engineers , in efforts such as the new center for marine robotics at woods hole oceanographic institution , but we need to turbo charge that effort . as the technology expands and improves , we will also need to find new , more effective ways for humans and robotic systems to interact over the vast and remote distances involved . the technologies we need for this comprehensive exploration and understanding are within our grasp . and we 'll need the knowledge that results to cope with the many challenges we face√¢ $  climate change , food and resource depletion , pollution . understanding our earth 's oceans has never been more crucial : they are n't just a defining feature of our planet ; they 're our life support system . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of chris german .", "summary": " oceans make life on earth possible providing oxygen and regulating our climate .   much of our oceans remain unexplored but new technology is advancing knowledge .   machines like woods hole oceanographic institution 's  alvin  explore deep ocean .   woods hole 's center for marine robotics pioneering new underwater vessels .
