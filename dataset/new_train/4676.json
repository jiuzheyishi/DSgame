playing with maria the night she was abducted , picked that photo of mccullough out of a police lineup in september 2010 . although she had viewed hundreds , if not thousands , of photos before , it

girls if they liked dolls and if they 'd like to ride in a truck , bus or train . maria ran home and returned with a favorite doll . then chapman left maria alone with johnny and went home to fetch
