{"text": "new york a new york judge released dominique strauss-kahn from house arrest friday , after prosecutors presented evidence questioning the credibility of the hotel maid who accused the former international monetary fund chief of sexual assault . the alleged victim , a 32-year-old immigrant from guinea , admitted to prosecutors that she lied about the specifics of her whereabouts following the incident , the details of an asylum application and information she put on tax forms , according to documents filed in court friday by prosecutors . but while the case has taken a dramatic turn , it has not been dismissed , said manhattan district attorney cy vance . the indictment and charges -- including criminal sexual acts and sexual abuse -- against strauss-kahn , 62 , still stand , vance said . his lawyers said the alleged victim told  substantial lies about her own background and the facts of this case .  defense attorney benjamin brafman commended vance for doing what he said was appropriate .  we believed from the beginning that this case was not what it appeared to be ,  he said .  we are absolutely convinced that while today is a first giant step in the right direction , the next step will lead to a complete dismissal of the charges .  strauss-kahn 's release significantly eases the extraordinary bail conditions that had been previously ordered . the french financier had been released from jail on $ 6 million bail but was under house arrest in a luxury townhouse in manhattan 's tribeca neighborhood . he was paying roughly $ 250,000 a month for court-ordered 24-hour armed guards posted at the townhouse . the presiding judge said authorities will continue to withhold strauss-kahn 's passport but that he is free to travel in the united states . the stunning twist in the case came after prosecutors , in the course of their investigation , discovered that the alleged victim had not been truthful in a variety of topics regarding her history and circumstances , prosecutors said in a letter submitted to the court . prosecutors said the woman admitted lying in her application for asylum in the united states and that she had been a victim of a gang rape , providing details of that attack . she cried when she first told prosecutors about the rape but in a subsequent interview , she admitted the gang rape never occurred . she said the fabricated account on the asylum application was made with the assistance of a man who  provided her with a cassette recording of the facts  so that she could memorize them . the woman told prosecutors that she has declared the child of a friend as her own dependent on her tax return in order to receive a larger refund . she  also admitted to misrepresenting her income in order to maintain her present housing ,  the prosecutors said . after the alleged hotel assault , the woman told prosecutors that she  fled to an area of the main hallway of the hotel 's 28th floor and waited there until she observed the defendant leave ,  the prosecutors said . she said she then reported the incident to her supervisor . but in subsequent interviews , the woman admitted her testimony before the grand jury was false ; that she  proceeded to clean a nearby room , and then returned to suite 2806 -lrb- the room occupied by strauss-kahn -rrb- and began to clean the suite before she reported the incident to her supervisor .  in angry remarks delivered outside the courthouse , the woman 's attorney , kenneth thompson , admitted problems with his client 's credibility , but the bottom line , he said was that she was attacked .  that was true the day it happened and it is true today ,  he said , describing in chilling detail the account the woman gave of her attack and the bruising on her body .  she has described that sexual assault many times to the prosecutors and to me . and she has never once changed a single thing about that account .  the development is particularly stunning given prior statements by new york authorities , who spoke forcefully about the accuser 's credibility , and it leaves the felony case against strauss-kahn teetering on collapse , despite incontrovertible dna evidence of sexual contact recovered from the hotel suite .  it 's just an extraordinary , extraordinary development considering this case was brought with such great fanfare by the manhattan district attorney and they very loudly trumpeted the credibility of the accuser ,  said jeffrey toobin , cnn 's senior legal analyst .  what makes it even more extraordinary is that the -lrb- dna -rrb- evidence apparently shows a sexual encounter between dominique strauss-kahn and the woman who is the maid . yet even with dna evidence , the prosecution is considering dropping the case . that shows how bad her credibility may be .  kenneth thompson , her attorney , said allegations about the woman 's involvement in drugs , published in the new york times , are a lie , adding that manhattan district attorney vance was afraid of losing the high-profile case . thompson also said one of vance 's top aides is married to an individual connected strauss-kahn 's defense team , creating an untenable conflict of interest in the case . vance told reporters friday that strauss-kahn 's release did not dismiss the indictment or any of the charges against the former imf chief , though he did not address thompson 's accusations of impropriety . the implications of the case are far reaching , especially in france , where before his arrest , strauss-kahn was considered a viable candidate in france 's presidential election . the turnaround in the case comes just ahead of the july 13 filing deadline for the french presidential primaries . if the case collapses , strauss-kahn theoretically has enough time to file . his supporters would still like to see him run , though some parisians interviewed on the streets friday said even if strauss-kahn was cleared of wrongdoing , it was too late for him to seek office this go-around . still , many in france felt vindicated over concerns that new york prosecutors were perhaps over zealous and that there had been a rush to judgment . they were shocked by widely broadcast footage of strauss-kahn in handcuffs in may , since a french law passed in 2000 prohibits the publication of images of suspects in handcuffs or in court in order to protect defendants ' presumption of innocence . jack lang , france 's former minister of culture and education , said he was very happy about the latest developments -- and hoped to see his fellow socialist party politician make a comeback .  if the prosecutor and the court decide to declare the innocence of dsk , it will be a good day -- a good day for dominique himself , a good day for american justice , a good day for france and a good day for the left ,  he said . cnn 's susan candiotti in new york and jim bittermann and saskya vandoorne in paris contributed to this report .", "summary": " the case has changed dramatically but has not been dismissed .   dominique strauss-kahn 's release came after his accuser 's credibility was doubted .   prosecutors disclosed that the alleged victim told them she lied about several matters .   despite dna evidence , prosecutors now have doubts about the case .
