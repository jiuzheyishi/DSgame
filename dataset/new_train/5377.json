{"text": "rural champion : andrew motion , former poet laureate , said that the environment is ` foremost in people 's minds ' no countryside view will be free from pylons or warehouses if planning reforms go ahead , the former poet laureate warned yesterday . andrew motion accused the coalition of putting at risk britain 's ` great collaborative masterpiece ' -- its countryside . ` the environment is foremost in people 's minds , not just because disasters like the recent flooding and ash dieback disease increase our consciousness of what is at risk , but because we 're hearing government pronouncements that betray a wider pattern of neglect for the landscape , ' he wrote in an article published in the lady . ` by a thousand cuts , we will be left with a countryside so fragmented that it will be impossible to find a view unimpeded by pylons or warehouses . ' sir andrew , who is president of the campaign to protect rural england , pointed to a recent poll by his campaign group that showed more than 80 per cent of the population wanted the natural environment protected at all costs . yet , he added : ` we are seeing the coalition contradicting david cameron 's ambition to lead the greenest government ever . ' chancellor george osborne also came under fire for saying protection of the green belt and the countryside was ` red tape ' . research by the cpre has identified plans for 80,000 homes on green belt land . planning minister nick boles caused fury in november by saying the government needs to concrete over an area of greenfield land twice the size of greater london . but he was backed by mr cameron last month , who said large areas of the countryside will have to be built on to solve a ` massive ' housing crisis . concern : sir andrew , who is president of the campaign to protect rural england , pointed to a recent poll by his campaign group that showed more than 80 per cent of the population wanted the natural environment protected at all costs . the prime minister said it was not a target to develop 3 per cent more of britain 's land -- the figure outlined by mr boles -- but he made clear that greenfield sites would have to disappear for homes to be built . and he said the government would continue to push for the planning system to be speeded up to allow development . sir andrew said the planning system had historically prevented ` needless urban sprawl while regenerating our cities ' and pointed to the olympic park as a good example of using brownfield sites . he said : ` nick boles seems determined to abandon this proven strategy , calling for developers to build on an area of open countryside two-and-a-half times the size of greater london . warning : mr motion said that cuts would lead to the countryside becoming so ` fragmented ' that it would be impossible to find ' a view unimpeded by pylons or warehouses ' ` the prime minister seems content to let osborne and boles demolish sound planning principles , despite that his political hero , harold macmillan , was one of planning 's greatest advocates . ` macmillan 's personal manifesto of 1938 , the middle way , imagined an england where growth was promoted , up to a point . ' sir andrew added : ` whatever happened to cameron 's big society ? the definition , at last , turns out to be ,  your voice counts , as long as you agree with the secretary of state  . ` even that great icon of england , the village green , is under threat from the growth-at-all-costs culture .
