{"text": "an unprecedented global crime wave threatens the most important natural places on earth and we are failing in our efforts to stop it . look past the drug wars , the counterfeiting industry and human trafficking and you 'll find one of the next biggest criminal enterprises in the world : the trade in illicit wildlife . trafficking in wildlife and its body parts is exploding in popularity among global crime syndicates . unlike other illicit trades , killing and selling parts from rhinos , tigers and elephants holds advantages for criminals : the product is poorly protected at its source , its trade is poorly regulated and wildlife crime is poorly investigated and lightly punished . for a hardcore criminal , illicit wildlife trafficking is a low-risk , high-reward bonanza . news : rhino poaching hits record numbers in south africa . an analysis released tuesday and commissioned by the world wildlife fund -- based on interviews with governments , military and civil society leaders -- underscores that illicit wildlife trafficking is not just an environmental problem , but a transnational crime issue . it compromises the security of countries and destroys natural wealth . interpol and other law enforcement groups agree that the involvement of organized crime syndicates and rebel militias in wildlife crime to fund their activities and purchase weapons has increased . it also highlights that black market wildlife trade hinders sustainable , social and economic development . the violent nature of poaching reduces the effectiveness of governments , erodes the rule of law and affects the growth of local communities . authorities estimate the illegal wildlife trade to be worth up to $ 10 billion annually -- or almost $ 20 billion if you count the illegal trade in timber and fisheries products . that puts it among the top illegal trades in the world . as a direct consequence of these profits , the killings are way up : africa loses tens of thousands of elephants each year for their ivory , wild tiger populations have plummeted to as few as 3,200 and rhino poaching in africa is exploding . news : booming illegal ivory trade taking severe toll on africa 's elephants . for years south africa boasted low rates of rhino poaching , with approximately 20 rhinos killed annually . in the past five years , the number has soared exponentially ; 618 rhinos have been poached in 2012 . vietnam , china and thailand drive much of the illegal wildlife demand but we should n't forget that americans are complicit in this trade . after china , the united states may be the second largest market for wildlife products in the world , a significant percentage of which is illegal , including illicit ivory trinkets being sold in manhattan and international rhino horn trafficking rings operating out of los angeles . we 're going to lose this fight if we do n't up our game . we need solutions as sophisticated as the criminals we face . crime syndicates employ helicopters , night vision equipment and high capacity automatic weapons . park rangers are vastly outgunned and often outmanned . there is a way forward that offers some hope . secretary of state hillary clinton has made this a strategic imperative for u.s. interests around the world , emphasizing it as a major national security issue , and we are beginning to engage other governments in this discussion . it goes far beyond the loss of animals . poaching decreases food security for rural communities , and evidence points to the sale of ivory as a means of funding rebel militias in places like central africa . news : thousands of crocodiles rescued from smugglers in china . the private sector is taking notice . google just announced a signature charity giving initiative , funding wwf in the development of cutting-edge technologies to help us detect and track both animals and poachers on the ground . this project will develop a new surveillance approach to greatly increase enforcement effectiveness by intercepting the poachers before they can do harm . this is a step in the right direction , but we 'll need governments to build not just the capacity but also the resolve to apply the technology and enforcement at a much greater scale . across the world , we need to strengthen criminal investigation , prosecution and sentencing on wildlife crime . that means more money and resources for law enforcement to support , for example , specialized investigative and forensic methodologies . simultaneously , we need awareness-raising campaigns to reduce demand , especially among consumers in asia , and to use the best available market research to guide social media campaigns . we need governments on both the supply and demand side of this trade to work together and bring serious commitments to the table in march , when representatives for some 170 nations will come together in thailand -- itself a major market for illegal ivory -- for the convention on international trade in endangered species . here they will aim to make good on the promises to get a handle on this epidemic . a major litmus test of the convention will be the nations ' ability to make convincing commitments to address all aspects of the crisis . news : photographer documents trafficking of endangered animals in asia . we can roll back this wave of crime , but we 're far from making that happen . there are promising signs but we will need a sustained tenfold increase in efforts from consumers , communities , the private sector , and most importantly , from governments to stop the slaughter before it 's too late . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of carter roberts .", "summary": " carter roberts : wildlife trade a growing global criminal enterprise poorly addressed .   it 's an environmental problem and world crime issue , destroys nations ' natural wealth .   he says rebel militias , organized crime use funds from illicit wildlife trade ; rangers outgunned .   roberts : governments must use technology , enforcement to stem supply and demand .
