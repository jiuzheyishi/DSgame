' as the castle 's imposing architect , the former army infantry training officer cuts a scary sight in full combat gear , however , he insists his project is about caring rather than anything violent . responding to skepticism around his theory , the father-of-10 adds : ` it 's a real possibility . nuclear explosions can create emps -- if one was detonated in the high atmosphere , it could knock out power to one-fourth of the united states by destroying computers that run everything . solar flares are also a risk for emps . ` most people have enough food for about 10 days . if there are no trucks to replenish the food supply , though , that 's a major problem . if the government is n't there to help them out , fighting and looting will eventually start -- like you saw during hurricane katrina -- and could eventually reach the countryside . ` the calmest person in the world will turn into a savage if he sees his baby crying and his children go hungry . i built the castle to defend against marauders and to have a place that could function without electricity . ' his son michael adds : ` we believe in the bible . -lsb- armageddon -rsb- may not be in my father 's time or our time but it may be in my kids time .

' ' i know there 's people who look at us and at my father and say ` this man 's crazy ' but it 's the one thing he wants done before he dies and i am determined to play my part .
