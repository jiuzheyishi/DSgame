{"text": "when naomi jacobs gave birth to a beautiful baby girl , it should have been the happiest time of her life . but the devastated new mother feared she would never see her child grow up , because she had a rare form of cancer that could kill her within 18 months . ms jacobs , from newcastle , had an emergency caesarean when she was 37 weeks pregnant with baby lily after suffering an infection . terrible revelation : naomi jacobs , pictured with baby lily and partner mark hurry , found out she had cancer after doctors found a tumour on her cervix during an emergency caesarean . surgeons found and removed what they thought was a non-cancerous tumour on her cervix during the operation last october . it was sent off for a biopsy , and just two weeks after the birth , they told the crushed 23-year-old that she had large cell neuroendocrine , an aggressive form of cervical cancer . ms jacobs , who lives with partner mark hurry , 28 , said : ` if i was n't pregnant with lily i might never have known that i had cervical cancer . ` we gave her the middle name grace because she saved my life . ` it was horrible being told that i had cervical cancer , but it was easier because i had lily . over the moon : ms jacobs feared she would never see her daughter grow up , but is now in remission and making the most of every day . ` she still needed her nappy changing and she still needed caring for so there was no option . ' i was told the survival rate was just 20 per cent . ' i looked it up on the internet when they told me what i had and it was the worst thing i could have done . ` it said that i would be dead in 18 months . that was a tough week . ' for two months ms jacobs underwent a series of gruelling chemotherapy treatments before doctors put her on a five-week course of radiotherapy . large-cell neuroendocrine cancer is rare , but very aggressive , when found in the cervix . in its early stages , neuroendocrine carcinoma does not have any symptoms so it is not always spotted straight away . later on , symptoms include irregular bleeding , increased discharge , pelvic pain , painful urination , pain during sex , tiredness , leg swelling and backache . when left untreated , metastasis or even death may occur . at the beginning of march her treatment ended and she was told that she was technically in remission - although there is an 80 per cent chance of the cancer returning . the delighted mother believes lily saved her life , because doctors would never have found the tumour if she had n't been pregnant .  they say you have to seize the day and that 's exactly what we have been doing . ` we 're just enjoying life . ' ` my mum has found it hard , but she has just not let it show . ` my partner , whenever i contemplate the fact i might not make it , he has never let me continue to think like that . ` doctors have told me i ca n't have more kids , but lily is like a shining light . ' ms jacobs is now raising money the freeman hospital 's teenage cancer trust , where she has been receiving treatment for the past six months . she said : ` when i was first diagnosed they were n't sure whether to put me in a children 's or an adult 's unit , but this tct unit is incredible . ` you 've got more things in common with the people . ` there was one night when the football was on and we just sat and watched the football together . ` without the tct i would not have been able to have my baby girl with me throughout my treatment . ` offering me a private room with space for my baby , partner and my mum meant i was never alone . ` for that , i am eternally grateful and will work my hardest to ensure i pay it forward . ` every young person deserves the love , care and respect i have been shown .
