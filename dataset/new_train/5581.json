{"text": "a ` full of life ' 100-year-old great-grandmother died after falling 5ft out of a body sling that her two foreign carers were not trained to use , an inquest heard today . may ward died of multiple injuries after falling out of a sling her carers - from china and bulgaria - were using to hoist her out of bed at meppershall care home in bedfordshire in august 2010 . shasha wei and rumyana ivanova , who have now left the country , had not been trained to use the new type of sling introduced to the home three months before , hatfield coroner 's court was told . may ward , who died of multiple injuries after falling out of a sling her two carers were using to hoist her out of bed at meppershall care home in august 2010 . location : may ward died of multiple injuries after falling out of a sling her carers - from china and bulgaria - were using to hoist her out of bed at meppershall care home in bedfordshire -lrb- pictured -rrb- in august 2010 . ms ward , who was a former london pub landlady , sustained multiple skull fractures , a broken leg , a black eye , and other cuts and bruises after she fell out of the sling at the care home . the carers then put her back into bed and changed her clothes , which could have made ms ward 's injuries worse , the inquest heard . after a 40-minute delay between ms ward 's fall and an ambulance arriving , the former royal air force cook was taken to hospital , but died the following day . ruth boulton , the health and safety executive 's investigating inspector , said the sling , which ms ward would have sat on all day , was different to the slings more commonly used around the home . it should have been safer and if used properly it would be highly unlikely that ms ward would have fallen out , the inquest heard . ms boulton said without training and instructions , it is likely that carers would revert to techniques used on the more common slings , but that were incorrect for this particular sling . former landlady : may ward and her husband initially ran a country club and a pub in west london before taking over the prince william henry pub -lrb- pictured -rrb- in blackfriars , central london , according to her son . there were also questions about whether ms ward , a dementia sufferer , should have been hoisted out of bed as some staff referred to her as being ` agitated ' at the time - which ms boulton said should have stopped her carers trying to lift her out of bed . ` people understand what to do but not why they need to do it and that can be an issue . there can also be issues with english as a second language . some cultures are more questioning . other cultures , if they are told to do something they will do it until they are told otherwise ' ruth boulton , health and safety executive 's investigating inspector . she told the court : ` you have general moving and handling training on one sort of sling and one sort of hoist but not the sling used for may . ` that type of sling is quite unusual . the majority of slings are quite different to that and are used differently . the majority are not sit-on slings . if you do n't have instructions you would revert to the generic use . ' ms boulton said some of the care home staff had received training from the sling 's manufacturer , but that no formal training was given . she added that information on how to use the sling should have been written on the whiteboard in ms ward 's room . communication did not appear to be an issue for the carers , as they did not need interpreters in police interviews , dc philip freebrey told the court . watchdog : the home received a ` poor ' rating in a care quality commission -lrb- london offices pictured -rrb- inspection report around the same time as manager judith eglen started working there in december 2009 . but ms boulton said in past cases , cultural differences could have been an issue . she told the court : ` what has been found is that people understand what to do but not why they need to do it and that can be an issue . may ward 's son , john ward , said she was born . in west tottenham , north london , and met her husband william ward while . she was a cook in the raf . her . husband died in 1989 , after the two had successful careers as . publicans . ms ward has four grandchildren and six great grand-children - . three girls and three boys , her son said . she . and her husband initially ran a country club and a pub in west london . before taking over the prince william henry pub in blackfriars , central . london , according to mr ward . they . retired in 1980 and moved to kenton , middlesex , and ms ward was taken . into care in 2004 . ` there can also be issues with english as a second language . some cultures are more questioning . other cultures , if they are told to do something they will do it until they are told otherwise . ' the care home manager at the time , judith eglen , was sacked in the wake of ms ward 's death , the inquest heard . she began work at the home in december 2009 , around the same time it received a zero-star , or ` poor ' , rating in a care quality commission inspection report , the jury heard . that was uprated by the watchdog to a one-star rating in may 2010 , around three months before ms ward 's death and around the same time the new slings were purchased . ms eglen told the court that she and the two carers involved re-enacted the lead-up to ms ward 's fall for her family and the deputy manager a few days after her death . she said ms ward was dropped from about 5ft but the carers were ` good ' at their jobs . ` our conclusion -lrb- after re-enacting the fall -rrb- was that they did everything correctly but they moved too quickly , ' ms eglen told the court . earlier , coroner edward thomas told the jury ms ward was a lover of the music of the 1930s and 1940s . he described her as a ` publican of the old school ' , saying she ` kept a good house ' . the inquest was adjourned until tomorrow .", "summary": " may ward died after falling out of sling , hatfield coroner 's court hears .   shasha wei and rumyana ivanova working at bedfordshire home in 2010 .   ward , 100 , sustained multiple skull fractures , a broken leg and a black eye .   put back to bed and changed clothes , which could have worsened injuries .   past cases show cultural differences could have been issue , inquest hears .
