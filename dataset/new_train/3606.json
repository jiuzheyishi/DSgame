{"text": "president barack obama leveled a new round of sanctions against russia on tuesday , responding to president vladimir putin 's refusal to back down from his military interventions in eastern ukraine . obama told reporters at the white house that russia is ` isolating itself from the international community , setting back decades of genuine process . ' ` russia is once again isolating itself from the international community , setting back decades of progress , ' he said minutes later . ` it does n't have to be this way . this is a choice that russia and president putin in particular have made . ' obama said he does n't see his administration 's several rounds of economic sanctions against moscow as a new 1980s-style standoff . ` no , it 's not a new cold war , ' the president said , responding to a question from cbs news . ` the united states means what it says ' : obama spoke on the south lawn of the white house on tuesday , announcing new economic sanctions against key sectors of the russian economy in the latest move to force russian president vladimir putin to end his support for ukrainian rebels . ` russia continues to support the separatists ... and train them , and arm them , ' he said , adding that american satellite surveillance has documented russian forces launching artillery strikes directly into ukraine . ` today is a reminder that the united states means what it says . ' the sanctions include a wide range of targeted moves aimed at banks , defense contractors and putin ` cronies and oligarchs , ' a senior administration official said tuesday . and ` today we have expanded the list of financial institutions ' under sanctions ` to include three additional major russia-owned banks . ' ` there need to be greater costs imposed on russia , ' the official said , in response to ` the flow of heavy weapons and support we 've seen from russia into ukraine in the last couple of weeks . ' russia is backing the separatist movement whose soldiers shot down a malaysian airlines passenger jet last week . obama complained that putin 's government has blocked international inspectors from viewing the entirety of the crash scene . the u.s. president devoted most of his 10 minutes of remarks to underscoring his administration 's hope that putin will buckle under the weight of financial penalties , and withdraw from ukraine . ` the main tool that we have to influence russian behavior ... is the impact they 're having on its economy , ' he said . obama dodged a reporter 's question , however , about whether the u.s. will step in and arm the ukrainian government . ` are you considering lethal aide to ukraine ? ' came the question . ` the issue is not the ability of the ukrainian military to outfight the separatists , ' obama replied . he also noted a new round of sanctions from the european union , calculated to emphasize europe 's preference for ukraine over putin 's russia . standing alone ? russian president vladimir putin has maed his nation ` more isolated than at any time since the end of the cold war , ' a senior obama administration official told reporters on tuesday . those sanctions , announced hours before obama spoke in washington , include limits on capital market access for russian state banks , an arms trade embargo and restrictions on the export of sensitive technologies to russian oil companies -- including foreign companies engaged in russia 's petroleum markets . obama 's announcement came in conjunction with a series of eu sanctions targeting banks , defense contractors and the oil industry in russia . ` it is meant as a strong warning , ' a statement from the european council read : ` illegal annexation of territory and deliberate destabilization of a neighboring sovereign country can not be accepted in 21st century europe . ' obama highlighted the degree to which russia 's annexation of the crimea , and its continued arming of rebels there , has exposed putin to consequences all across europe . ` it 's hard to avoid the spillover of what 's happening in eastern ukraine from affecting europeans across the board , ' obama said . a second senior administration official said after the president boarded marine one on the south lawn of the white house that ` the european union 's steps are strong , they are significant , and they represent a new step for europe ... . that we have taken together , ' ` that is very similar to what we have done . ' ` russia is not a very good bet right now for international investors , ' added a third official . asked what the administration expected putin to do , he rattled off a list of expectations . ` there still is an off-ramp available to russia and president putin , ' the official told reporters during a conference call . that would require moscow to recognize the legitimacy of ukraine 's newly elected government , stop the flow of arms across the russia-ukraine border , abandon its troop buildup there , and persuade rebels to enter a diplomatic dialogue . ` we will continue to hold that door open , ' he said .", "summary": " economic penalties will hit state-owned banks , putin ` cronies and oligarchs , ' defense contractors and russia 's oil industry .   obama wants moscow to reverse its troop building on the ukraine border , stop the flow of arms and bring ukrainian rebels to the negotiating table .   he insists that washington is n't entering a new cold war period with russia .   obama also deflected a question about whether the u.s. will help arm ukrainians defending against the rebels who shot down mh17 last week .
