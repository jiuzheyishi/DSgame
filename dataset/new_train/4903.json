{"text": "a couple of years ago , i asked civil rights leader and former ambassador to the u.n. andrew young to tell me something about dr. martin luther king jr. that most people did not know . young thought for a moment about the more personal side of his mentor and confidant . he said that king liked eating catfish , was quite a jokester and enjoyed laughing with friends . among other things , king was an avid basketball player and a crafty passer with a great sense of the court . he could drive and shoot with both hands because he was ambidextrous . young 's depiction of his mentor as a joking hoopster reminded me of an important factor we often overlook when considering king 's civil rights legacy : he was very young when he changed the world . most people in their 20s struggle with dreams , doubts and career choices . in king 's mid-20s , he was pastoring a church , co-founding the southern christian leadership conference , leading the montgomery bus boycott and receiving countless death threats . by his 30s , king was leading the monumental march on washington and winning the nobel peace prize . clearly , king 's youth was more of a catalyst than liability . in his cult classic book ,  outliers ,  malcolm gladwell discussed how birth dates and timing were as crucial factors as talent and tenacity in forging the successful careers of athletes , business tycoons , technology innovators and other leaders . for example , gladwell argued that had bill gates been born just 10 years earlier , there would have been no microsoft . through a gladwellian perspective , then , if king had been born 10 years earlier , there might not have been a montgomery bus boycott . an older king might have been far too entrenched in black baptist denominational politics or invested in clerical careerism to put everything on the line and lead a risky fringe boycott . his kids would have been older , his practical needs would have been greater and perhaps his judgments would have been more conservative , resembling the numerous middle-aged black baptist preachers who had opposed activist strategies in favor of a less confrontational approach toward gradual reform in the civil rights movement . similarly , young king 's moral and spiritual discourse was the product of a malleable mind fresh out of graduate school , not the kind of predictable theorizing you would expect to see in an older preacher 's cultural toolkit . young king synthesized henry thoreau 's treatise on civil disobedience , howard thurman 's theological philosophy , mahatma gandhi 's satyagraha and the old testament 's views of justice to form a personal vision and tactic that awakened the moral consciousness of the nation . it 's fortunate for us that king was not a middle-aged pastor when the moment in history demanded transformational leadership . he was just a young , fearless and somewhat naive pastor in montgomery , alabama . we can presume that the civil rights movement shaped king as much as he shaped the movement . with youth and inexperience on his side , young king had the improvisational space to carve out a movement philosophy and strategy that has been replicated many times over where people challenge oppressive governments . as we commemorate the birthday of our seminal civil rights leader , we should take some time out to remember that the same king who changed the course of history started out like you and me . he liked playing basketball and joking with friends . he was young and had fire in his heart . king 's legacy should inspire our youth to step up and exert the visionary leadership that will help guide us through our era of change and uncertainties . tenured scholars , contentious politicians and fat-cat business executives are too cynical , comfortable and conservative to do anything . it 's up to our wide-eyed students . and they should remember that youth is not an impediment ; rather , it 's the seed that can bring forth a better future . just look at the young king . join cnn opinion on facebook and follow updates on twitter .", "summary": " martin luther king jr. was young when he changed the world .   lee : had king been born 10 years earlier , there might not have been a bus boycott .   he says that youth was a catalyst for king 's leadership .   lee : our youth should look to the civil rights leader for inspiration .
