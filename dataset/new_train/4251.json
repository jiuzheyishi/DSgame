{"text": "oslo , norway at a prize ceremony honoring peace , adán cortés says violence and injustice sent him rushing toward the stage . in a matter of seconds , the 21-year-old mexican student 's face was seen around the world last week as he stood in front of malala yousafzai at the nobel peace prize ceremony in oslo , norway .  please malala , mexico ,  he repeated as he unfurled a mexican flag on the stage at oslo 's city hall , where the 17-year-old laureate was about to become the youngest person ever to receive the prestigious award . oslo police have come under fire over the incident , with critics asking how someone who was n't on the ceremony 's guest list managed to slip through security checkpoints and make it to the front of the room , standing just steps away from yousafzai and other dignitaries before security hauled him out of the auditorium . speaking to cnn at an oslo detention center on sunday , cortés said he knows it was a drastic move . but he felt like he had no choice and wanted only a few seconds to speak about mexico 's problems on a global stage .  my motivation was to show solidarity with all the things that have happened in my country , ultimately , well , the 43 missing students , who are suspected to be dead and burned , that was my main motivation ,  he said .  i am tired of so many injustices that we have lived in mexico , for decades .  the students ' case has sparked national outrage in mexico and drawn global attention to the country 's continued struggles to deal with police corruption and drug-related violence . authorities have said the students from a rural teachers college were rounded up on the orders of a local mayor , then delivered to the drug gang to be executed . mexico 's attorney general says the students ' remains were burned at a landfill , placed inside plastic bags and thrown into a river . but so far , only one student 's remains have been identified . cortés said he was seeking asylum in norway , but authorities there have informed him that he 'll be sent back to mexico on monday , cortés and his attorney said . before learning that he was getting kicked out of norway , he told cnn he was scared to return to his home country .  i do not want to be one more student who disappears and who later turns up dead and the government later says that it was organized crime ,  he said . cortés told cnn he went through a security checkpoint with invited guests at last week 's ceremony , but no one asked him for identification or stopped him as he approached the stage .  i was really nervous . i was saying , ` this is my moment and this is my opportunity to speak out for all the people who i have seen suffer in mexico , '  he said . oslo police said cortés had been fined 15,000 kroner -lrb- $ 2,040 -rrb- for nuisance and for entering the city hall illegally . even critics who question the appropriateness of disrupting the nobel ceremony would have done the same thing , he said ,  if they had a little bit of empathy toward what all the families of so many people who have been killed and disappeared in mexico have felt , this desperation and this impotence to not have a way to express themselves and demand justice .  cnn 's claudia rebaza reported from oslo . cnn 's catherine e. shoichet wrote the story in atlanta .", "summary": " mexican student adán cortés interrupted last week 's nobel peace prize ceremony .   he says his country 's 43 missing students were his  main motivation     i am tired of so many injustices that we have lived in mexico ,  he says .   oslo police were under fire after he slipped past security at the prestigious event .
