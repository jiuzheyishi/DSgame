{"text": "the glitz of cannes on the french riviera is a world removed from the hellish conditions endured by the hundreds of illegal immigrants smuggled from africa to europe every year . but senegalese director moussa toure is confronting attendees of the world 's leading film festival with their story of desperation in  la pirogue ,  his first feature film in 14 years .  la pirogue  -- a pirogue being a type of flat-bottomed boat commonly used for fishing in west africa -- tells the story of baye laye , a boat captain who hails from a fishing village outside dakar . it follows his ordeal after he agrees to take a pirogue containing 30 men to spain 's canary islands in search of a better life in europe . toure said the film was inspired by the fact that , in his experience , virtually every senegalese family had a member who had left by boat for europe .  it 's an everyday reality in my country ,  he told cnn , in french .  in dakar , young people attempt these journeys practically every day because they have no hope for their future in senegal . they are often educated young people with qualifications , and they pay a lot of money to be smuggled out of the country , because they have no choice .  according to unhcr figures , there were 5443  irregular arrivals  from north and west africa by sea in spain in 2011 -- down from 32,000 in 2006 . with the vessels poorly equipped for the arduous journeys of hundreds of kilometers , fatalities are commonplace . when toure discovered his young mechanic was among those who had made the voyage , lasting two months in europe before being discovered by authorities and sent home , the director pressed him for his experiences , which subsequently informed the film . see also : beat goes on for senegal 's octogenarian star . the film was shot over two months in senegal . many of the actors , just like their characters , could not swim , making for some tense moments , said toure .  we had dangerous moments because we were filming at the mouth of the saloum river and this is where it meets the sea . i was secretly terrified that we would capsize like often happens in real life . i was especially scared for those -lrb- the actors -rrb- who could not swim .  moussa , a former electrician who shot his first short film in 1987 , has been focusing on documentaries for the past decade . working on  la pirogue ,  his third feature , was deeply affecting , he said , and the result had made his wife cry  like i 've never seen her cry before  . the film , a french-senegalese co-production , is one of 20 films selected for the  un certain regard  -lrb- a particular outlook -rrb- section of the festival , designated for original and innovative movies seeking international recognition . see also : african big cats caught on film . toure 's film is the only sub-saharan african movie in competition this year , but african films -- particularly those from senegal and burkina faso -- have fared well at the festival , especially over the past decade . in 2008 , the french-liberian co-production  johnny mad dog  won the prize of hope at the festival , for its depiction of child soldiers at the end of the second liberian civil war . it was based on the novel  johnny chien mechant  by congolese author emmanuel dongala . in 2005 ,  delwende ,  directed by burkina faso 's s. pierre yameogo , won the same prize when it was screened . it told the story of a woman accused of being a  soul eater  and subjected to trial by a council of elders after a child died in her village . the year previous ,  moolaade ,  by the late senegalese writer and director ousmane sembene won the  prix un certain regard ,  while in 1990 , burkina faso 's idrissa ouedraogo won the jury grand prize for his film  tilai .  african cinema also has a strong presence at cannes with south african and nigerian delegations at the festival 's film market . their attendance is intended to showcase both countries ' film industries and the investment opportunities they represent . nigeria boasts one of the world 's biggest film industries -- affectionately known as  nollywood  -- alongside hollywood and bombay 's  bollywood .  see also : nollywood 's julia roberts . most of its output consists of pacey and vibrant video-format b-movies , which have immense popularity across the continent despite their shoe-string budgets . but recently a new generation of filmmakers has been seeking to elevate the industry through a movement they call  new nigeria cinema ,  involving stronger story lines , higher production values and a more authentic depiction of african experience . toure is no stranger to film festivals ; last year he was president of the documentary film jury at africa 's largest film festival , fespaco -lrb- the pan-african film festival of ouagadougou , in burkina faso -rrb- . he said he was optimistic about the future of african cinema .  i think there are great stories coming out of africa and there are many people who are talented . those who govern us do not get involved and leave cinema at the mercy of filmmakers ,  he said . follow the inside africa team on twitter : @cnninsideafrica , presenter errol barnett : @errolcnn , online producer : @stephaniebusari , writer : @tim_hume .", "summary": " senegalese film  la pirogue  is the only film from sub-saharan africa selected for cannes .   it tells the story of a boatload of african migrants seeking to reach spain 's canary islands .   director moussa toure said making the movie was deeply affecting .   african films , particularly from senegal and burkina faso , have previously done well at cannes .
