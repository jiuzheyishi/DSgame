{"text": "steve ballmer is said to have risked it all on a new operating system for microsoft , a gamble that may have cost the company 's ceo dearly . in the face apple and samsung 's success in the mobile and tablet computer market , microsoft bet the farm when it introduced windows 8 , the operating system that ballmer had heralded as the future . debuting last year , windows 8 was the nervous system of its new line of surface tablet and smartphones . betting it all : microsoft ceo steve ballmer made a big gamble when he introduced windows 8 in october . it was no secret that ballmer was making a huge bet . when he introduced the operating system in october , a screen behind him read : ` windows : all in . ' but the gamble does not appear to have . paid off , as microsoft 8 received less-than-stellar reviews and failed . to measure up to the hype and sales of apple and google devices . critics , as well as some consumers , lambasted the technology giant over windows 8 , mentioning the confusing array of touchscreen tiles and lack of microsoft 's trademark ` start ' button . some have now called for ballmer to quit or be fired . joachim kempin , a former microsoft executive who oversaw the building of the windows brand , told the bbc last month that he believes ballmer ` does n't have the vision ' to be ceo . any decision to oust ballmer would have to come from his predecessor bill gates , who holds the largest stake in the company and personally selected ballmer - his friend - to take over . on the chopping block ? ballmer 's overhaul of the windows operating system has led to some calls for him to be ousted . decision : any move to fire ballmer would have to come from his predecessor bill gates , who holds the majority stock in the company and personally selected ballmer to take over . while microsoft has experienced growth in recent years , any success is eclipsed by apple , which unveiled the ipad mini at about the same time as windows 8 . some reviewers liked the way windows 8 greets users with a mosaic of tiles displaying applications instead of . relying on the desktop icons that served as the welcome mat for years . but others say it 's a confusing jumble that will frustrate users accustomed . to the older versions , particularly when they switch to desktop mode . and do n't see the familiar ` start ' button and menu . struck by the flurry of complaints , microsoft is giving windows 8 a makeover , known as windows blue . overshadowed : microsoft 's success has been eclipsed by apple 's tablets and smart phones , as well as other devices powered by google . tami reller , who serves as the marketing and financial chief for microsoft 's windows business , announced a retreat , admitting that the software had defeated many users . she said ; ` the learning curve is definitely real and we need to address it . ' the company , which is based in . redmond , washington , says more than 100 million windows 8 licenses have . been sold so far , up from about 60 million licenses in january . the licensing volume ` is in the same . general ballpark , ' as microsoft 's previous operating system - windows 7 - . at a similar juncture of its sales cycle , according to ms reller . in an interview , ms reller said . microsoft still realized changes need to be made to make windows 8 . easier to navigate and capable of taking full advantage of technology . improvements that have come out since october . ms reller said : ` are there things . that we can do to improve the experience ? absolutely . there is a . learning curve -lsb- to windows 8 -rsb- and we can work to address that . ' blue also might make it easier to find . a set of controls - known as ` charms ' in windows 8 's parlance - that . currently must be pulled out from the right side of a display screen . besides responding to customer . feedback , blue also will make windows 8 better suited for smaller , less . expensive tablets with 7 - and 8-inch display screens , ms reller said . the tune-up announced on tuesday wo n't be released to consumers and businesses until later this year . one leading research firm , international data corp. , says windows 8 contributed to a 14 per cent decline in worldwide pc sales during the first three months of the year - the biggest year-over-year drop ever . meanwhile , sales of smartphones and tablet computers are booming . the biggest beneficiaries have been apple inc. , the maker of the iphone and ipad , and samsung electronics co. , which sells the most devices running on google inc. 's android software . changes : microsoft has now announced an overhaul to windows 8 , which has been dubbed ` blue ' google is also benefiting from android 's popularity through increased traffic to its services , creating more opportunities for the company to display ads . by contrast , leading pc makers such as hewlett-packard co. and dell inc. , which primarily sell windows-powered machines , have been mired in a financial funk that has battered their stocks and raised questions about their futures . for now , microsoft is n't saying what kind of changes will be introduced with the release of blue , which the company plans to anoint with a different name when the update is available . microsoft also is n't saying whether it will charge existing owners of windows 8 devices to get the fixes in blue . the company plans to release blue in time for the holiday season . ms reller said more details about blue will be released before microsoft holds a developers conference in san francisco in late june . success : the biggest beneficiaries in the tablet and smartphone boom have been apple , the maker of the iphone and ipad , and samsung , which sells the most devices running on google 's android software . some of blue 's features are expected to be previewed at that conference . ' i view this as a relaunch of windows 8 , finally giving everyone a fully baked version , ' said technology analyst patrick moorhead . ` it has been a very rough road for microsoft so far . ' if blue is meant to make people more comfortable , the changes may incorporate more of the elements from earlier versions of windows . but one thing that blue wo n't fix : the relatively small selection of mobile applications tailored for windows 8 . ms reller said the windows 8 store now has more than 60,000 apps . by contrast , there are more than 800,000 apps available for apple 's mobile 's devices and nearly that many for android devices , too . in one of the most glaring omissions on windows 8 , facebook inc. still has n't designed an app to make its online social network more accessible on that system . facebook has about 750 million mobile users . microsoft 's decision to tweak windows 8 so soon after its much-ballyhooed release may reinforce perceptions that the product is the company 's biggest flop since the zune - the company 's answer to the ipod . investors still believe windows 8 will . pay off for microsoft , which gets more than half of its revenue from the . sale of windows operating systems and various software programs and . services . the company 's stock slipped 40 cents to $ 33.35 in tuesday 's afternoon trading , leaving the shares with a 20 per cent gain since windows 8 went on sale . that outstrips the 15 per cent increase in the standard & poor 's 500 index during the same stretch .", "summary": " microsoft ceo said to have bet it all on windows 8 , which has received poor reviews and is bested by apple and google products .   some have called for ballmer 's ouster .   microsoft is now giving the operating system a makeover , called blue .
