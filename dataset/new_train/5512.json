{"text": "as a doctor -- and also a parent -- i was deeply concerned by the controversial case of neon roberts , the seven-year-old whose mother sally refused to allow him to have radiotherapy for his brain tumour . the hospital caring for neon sought legal backing to give him the treatment against her wishes , and last month the high court ruled that six weeks of radiotherapy should start early this month , followed by 18 months of chemotherapy . despite compelling evidence that the alternative approaches she found via the internet were unlikely to work , ms roberts remains defiant . yet i strongly believe the correct decision was made . neon is now more likely to survive the cancer . dilemma : sally roberts with her cancer-stricken son neon . the case has highlighted many misconceptions about parental rights , along with the risks and benefits of cancer treatment . here , i answer the questions i have been asked most . . . surely the parent 's wishes ought to be paramount?actually , no . the patient 's rights are paramount . when there is danger to a child , doctors have to act in their best interests . some argue that doctors ought to have more power in the treatment of conditions such as measles , but unless there is a life-or-death situation you ca n't impose health diktats . ms roberts was choosing a route that meant her son was more likely to die . case lost : after an appeal in london 's high court a judge ruled that sally roberts is no longer allowed to refuse treatment for neon . at what point are doctors acting in more than an advisory capacity?where doctors believe that parental decisions may be not in a child 's best interests , it can be necessary to seek a view from the courts . doctors believed neon would die within months without radiotherapy . i see that ms roberts was in a desperate position , but she does n't seem able to make a rational decision . there is a five-year survival rate of 86 per cent for patients with medulloblastoma -- the type of cancer suffered by neon -- who have radiotherapy . due to the delays in his treatment , neon now has an estimated 67 per cent chance of survival . sally roberts argued that radiotherapy could do more harm than good . could she be right?all cancer treatment is backed up by data based on millions of patients . however , there are no absolutes . it 's all about odds . we know the treatment most likely to work , but not whether it will be successful . actress hayley mills recently spoke about her decision to stop chemotherapy after surgery for breast cancer . should her cancer return , it is more likely to be terminal because chemotherapy helps to prevent the spread of tumours . a recent oxford university study involving about 100,000 women concluded that having chemotherapy reduces breast cancer mortality by about a third . doctor 's advice : such as in the case of neon , it is what is best for the patient which is paramount , not the parent 's wish . but what about the damage radiotherapy could cause?there are undoubtedly risks with radiation , including growth problems and infertility . however , given that medics concluded neon would die without this treatment , the benefits outweigh the risks . sally roberts argued that the only evidence she was offered for the efficacy of radiation was a paper from the forties . is this true?there is plenty of research backing up use of radiotherapy in this cancer . it is possible ms roberts has n't seen this . children in developed countries have been given radiotherapy for more than half a century . if you compare the cancer survival rates of rich and poor countries , our treatments make a clear difference . what about the other medics advising her ? their opinions have been totally dismissed.none was on the specialist register . one spelt medulloblastoma incorrectly . it makes me so angry that these quacks prey on the vulnerable . none of the alternatives is clinically proven in the treatment of this cancer . if sally roberts is considered irresponsible , should neon be taken away from her?no . she is in an appalling position . my heart goes out to her . she is trying to do the best thing . this does n't reflect on her everyday parenting . follow me on twitter @dr_ellie .", "summary": " sally roberts refused to allow her son radiotherapy .   seven-year-old neon has a brain tumour .   ms roberts lost court case in december and neon is due to begin radiotherapy next week .
