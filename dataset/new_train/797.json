{"text": "on a push to expose his softer side , republican presidential nominee mitt romney on tuesday revealed his intimate connection to the attack last month in eastern libya that left four americans dead . almost a month after the deadly attack on the u.s. embassy , romney announced that he personally knew glen a. doherty , one of the two navy seals who was killed by attackers . republicans , including romney , have cited the attack to criticize president barack obama 's foreign policy . the attack also was the centerpiece of romney 's high-profile , foreign policy speech monday at the virginia military institute . personal connection : glen doherty -lrb- left -rrb- was one of the navy seals killed in the september 11 libyan embassy attack , and mitt romney revealed today that he met the former seal in either 2009 or 2010 . close ties ? romney waited a day to share his ties to the events in libya , telling his story at a rally in iowa on tuesday , one of a handful of battleground states . romney , pictured at a campaign event in cuyahoga falls , iowa , on tuesday , talked about a chance encounter with the fallen marine at a christmas party . but romney waited a day to share his ties to the events in libya , telling his story at a rally in iowa , one of a handful of battleground states where he has been getting personal to help persuade undecided voters to support him . the story begins with a chance encounter at a christmas party in southern california in 2009 or 2010 . he could n't be sure which . on a blustery day on an iowa cornfield , romney explained that he had gotten a flier at his home in southern california for a neighborhood christmas party . he had n't planned on going but , after noticing a party getting started at a house almost across the street , he and his wife changed their minds and decided to pop over . killed in action : doherty was 42 years old when he died after the coordinated attack on the u.s. consulate in libya . it was n't until after dinner that they realized they were at the wrong house . ` turns out , this was n't the neighborhood party . this was a family having a party with their friends , ' romney said as his audience laughed . ` we were a little embarrassed but they treated us well nonetheless and i got to meet some really interesting people . ' then the story turns serious , as has become the custom in romney 's campaign speeches in recent days . at rallies in florida , virginia and now iowa , he has swapped the tales of hard-working entrepreneurs that had filled his speeches for months in favor of anecdotes about people in his life who have died . he talks about a 14-year-old leukemia patient , a quadriplegic classmate and an american soldier killed last year in afghanistan . then there is doherty , the former navy seal romney met at a party he was n't supposed to attend . both were from massachusetts . both enjoyed skiing . and doherty , who was 42 at the time of his death , talked about his work in the middle east for a private security company after he finished his tour of duty as a navy seal . ` you can imagine how i felt when i found out that he was one of the two former navy seals killed in benghazi on september 11 , ' romney said in iowa , pausing to stay composed . ` it touched me obviously as i recognized this young man that i thought was so impressive had lost his life in his service of his fellow men and women . ' misstep : the attack in benghazi initially created a political headache for romney , whose campaign issued a statement condemning the u.s. response before the severity of the violence was known . also killed were u.s. ambassador chris stevens , diplomat sean smith , doherty and tyrone s. woods , another former navy seal . the attack in benghazi initially created a political headache for romney , whose campaign issued a statement condemning the u.s. response before the severity of the violence was known . romney was widely criticized by both democrats and republicans for trying to gain politically from the loss of four american lives . softening image : romney told an audience in iowa about the story of his run-in at a christmas party in california . now , considering his personal connection to one of the victims , it is even more surprising that though he was quick to rebuke obama but so slow to show that he had a vested interest in the actions at the embassy . in recent weeks , obama 's critics have questioned the administration 's handling of the situation . officials initially blamed what happened on a spontaneous protest they said was sparked by reaction to an anti-islamic video that ridiculed the prophet muhammad and ignited mob protests at u.s. diplomatic posts across the middle east and in north africa . the administration later said what happened in benghazi was a terrorist attack carried out by al qaeda-linked militants . in the foreign policy speech monday , romney returned again and again to benghazi . ' i want to be very clear : the blame for the murder of our people in libya , and the attacks on our embassies in so many other countries , lies solely with those who carried them out - no one else , ' he said . critical timing : initially after the attacks , romney criticized obama 's reaction to the deaths but refrained from telling the personal story until tuesday . ` but it is the responsibility of our president to use america 's great power to shape history - not to lead from behind , leaving our destiny at the mercy of events , ' he said . ` unfortunately , that is exactly where we find ourselves in the middle east under president obama . ' his tone tuesday in iowa was very different . romney said he learned that doherty was in another building across town when he and his colleagues found out the consulate was under attack . ` they went there . they did n't hunker down where they were in safety . they rushed there to go help , ' romney said . ` this is the american way . we go where there 's trouble . we go where we 're needed . and right now we are needed . right now the american people need us . '", "summary": " mitt romney met former navy seal glen doherty years before he was killed in the attack on the u.s. embassy in libya .   republican was critical of obama administration response to attacks , but waited till tuesday to tell of his connection to the slain seal .
