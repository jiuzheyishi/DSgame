{"text": "swimmer : before chairing meetings of world leaders , david cameron stripped off to go swimming in lough erne . david cameron dragged a reluctant police protection officer on an early morning swim in the freezing waters of lough erne . the prime minister , a fan of so-called ` wild swimming ' , decided he fancied a dip just after dawn today . ` he joked with the police that they are supposed to give him  close protection  and so they had to come in , and one did , ' said a downing street source . the prime minister told colleagues that his swim , which took place just after 6am , had been ` early , brisk and cold ' . to the delight of number ten officials , russian president vladimir putin , who normally delights in macho displays at international summits , apparently decided the northern irish waters were too chilly and stayed in bed . mr cameron said as the summit ended : ' i can recommend a swim in the lough . that 's what i did . ' i have the photographic evidence but i am not going to share it with you . it certainly wakes you up and gets you going for a hard day chairing this summit . ' the prime minister later tweeted that there had been ` no sign of the russian president when i was swimming in a cold lough erne this morning , but his sporting prowess is clear ' . the waters of lough erne are currently around 14 degrees and the lake has also been overrun by zebra mussels , an invasive species which poses a hazard to the bare feet of swimmers . however , mr cameron ` has a labrador-like tendency to jump into water , no matter how cold ' , according to his biographer francis elliott . he has said that ` i spent all my early years swimming in polzeath and i know what wonderful waters there are in cornwall ' . more recently , the prime minister has spoken of swimming in the sea off his father-in-law lord astor 's estate on the isle of jura . he also has a fondness for swimming in the lakes of cumbria , particularly the notoriously chilly ullswater . ' i have a guilty secret - every year since being prime minister i tell myself that i have to get to cumbria and swim in one of the lakes . so far i have managed it , ' he has said . talks : british prime minister david cameron joked that the lough was cold but good preparation for chairing meetings . scenery : the lake has provided the backdrop for many of the photo opportunities of the summit , including this snapshot of us president barack obama and mr cameron , walking with ireland 's taoiseach enda kenny . dressed : mr cameron had his suit on for the traditional family photo with world leaders . left to right : european commission president jose manuel barroso , japan 's prime minister shinzo abe , germany 's chancellor angela merkel , russia 's president vladimir putin , britain 's prime minister david cameron , us president barack obama , france 's president francois hollande , canada 's prime minister stephen harper , italy 's prime minister enrico letta and european council president herman van rompuy . how many police officers does it take to secure a g8 summit ? not as many as the authorities thought , if the scenes around enniskillen have been anything to go a group on duty at one landmark had a competition to see who was the best bannister slider . others have spent their breaks enjoying the welcome sun on the town 's riverbanks . and mischievous local officers reportedly broke the ice with yorkshire colleagues by driving past playing the theme tune to the tv soap emmerdale . the prime minister is patron of the chipping norton lido in his constituency , and once dived into the sea to save historian andrew roberts , a friend , from a school of dangerous jellyfish . mr roberts said it was a moment that showed the prime minister 's ` great physical as well as moral courage ' . mr cameron was 29 and on holiday in miramar , in the south of france , with his wife samantha when they joined friends for a boat trip . also on board the vessel , which belonged to daily mail journalist robert hardman , was writer and socialite petronella wyatt , andrew roberts and his girlfriend , now his ex-wife . mr roberts , then 33 , insisted on swimming 100 yards from the boat to reach two local landmarks known as les deux freres - 80ft tall volcanic monoliths . ` the sea was swarming with a horrible , menacing school of large jellyfish , one of which had stung me , ' he added . ` it was frightening . they were transparent with a green tinge and had very long tentacles . there must have been 40 or 50 of them , so large that you would have struggled to squash one into a bucket . ' i yelped and squealed and waved desperately at the boat , but because of the rocks robert could n't bring it in to reach me . ' i knew that if i had to swim blind through the jellyfish , many of which were hiding under the surface , i would be repeatedly and badly stung . things were n't looking good . ' action man : swimming in lakes has previously been seen as the recreation of choice for russian president vladimir putin , pictured taking a dip in 2009 . fortunately , mr cameron leapt from the boat . ' i realised he was coming to my rescue . he had goggles and had grabbed a spare pair for me . i still do n't think it 's something most people would have done , ' mr roberts added . ` he swam within about 20 feet of me , through some of the jellyfish , to perform an olympian throw . it was pretty impressive - it 's not easy to throw any distance or with any accuracy when you 're in water . he played cricket at eton , i think , so that no doubt helped . ' i grabbed the goggles and then i could see where the jellyfish were , so i could navigate through them . dave was doing the same . ` it seems funny now , but at the time i was terrified . the welt on my arm stung for about two days . if dave had n't rescued me and i 'd been forced to swim through the jellyfish , i would probably have been hospitalised . it would certainly have ruined my holiday . ' i told him he was a hero , and i was serious . but he quite typically brushed it off . he 's always downplayed it whenever i 've mentioned it . ' * perhaps it was david cameron 's attempt to show the g8 he wanted to call the tune . the prime minister adopted a musical theme for his personal gifts to the other leaders . among them was a usb stick featuring songs by lesser-known british acts , such as jake bugg , alt-j and lianne la havas . he also gave to each of them the best-selling album by a uk artist in their respective countries.other gifts were designed to highlight northern irish brands , producers and artists . they included a book of photography by local artist chris hill , bottles of 12-year county antrim old bushmills distillery reserve whiskey with a personalised g8 label , co couture chocolates from belfast and handmade oak pens by county down-based tulip woodcrafts .", "summary": " prime minister drags protection officer into freezing waters .   g8 summit being held in at five-star resort at lough erne in enniskillen .   global action man russian president vladimir putin stayed in bed .
