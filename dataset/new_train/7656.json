{"text": "where we live - specifically , how high up we live - may have a far bigger impact on how languages are formed than previously thought . languages containing ` ejective ' consonants - guttural bursts of sound not found in english - mainly exist among communities at high altitudes . lead scientist dr caleb everett from the university of miami believes that the reason might be that it takes less effort to produce ejectives in thinner mountain air . scroll down for video . on this partial world map , dark circles represent the areas where languages where ejectives occur . clear circles represent areas where the ejective is n't part of the language . scientists found a correlation between ejective languages and high altitude . until recently most linguists believed environment mainly had an influence on vocabulary rather than sound . researchers in the us found that 87 per cent of the languages with ejectives studied were located within 500 kilometres of a region of high elevation on all continents . more ... should you teach a baby to talk from birth or is it pushy parenting gone mad ? a new book says it 'll boost their brainpower for life . game of drones : academics pour scorn over the ` mish-mash ' of british accents in hbo 's hit fantasy series . germany dumps its longest word after 63-letter tongue-twister about beef regulation becomes just too much of a mouthful . as the height of the land increased , so did the likelihood of there being languages with ejectives . ` this is really strong evidence that geography does influence phonology - the sound system of languages , ' said lead scientist dr caleb everett , from the university of miami . an area of high elevation is defined as having an altitude higher than 1,500 metres above sea level . inhabitants of peru , like this family on lake titcaca , have a ejective-heavy language . most of the inhabitable high altitude areas of the world are found in six regions , including the north american cordillera , the andes and the andean altiplano , the southern african plateau , the east african rift plateau , the ethiopian highlands , the caucasus range , the javakheti plateau , and the tibetan plateau . 1 . start by holding your breath . 2 . while you 're still holding your breath , try to make a ` k ' sound . 3 . make the sound as loudly as you can , so that somebody sitting next to you can hear it . 4 . relax and breathe in again . 5 . you 've just made an ejective k . the researchers , whose findings appear in the online journal public library of science one , looked at the locations of around 600 representative languages , 92 of which had ejectives . a computer program was used to match linguistic sounds to particular geographical locations . the results showed a strong correlation between elevation and ejective languages on , or near , five of the six major inhabited high altitude regions on earth . ` ejectives are produced by creating a pocket of air in the pharynx then compressing it , ' said dr everett . ` since air pressure decreases with altitude and it takes less effort to compress less dense air , i speculate that it 's easier to produce these sounds at high altitude . ' the only high altitude region where ejective languages were absent was the large tibetan plateau and adjacent areas . this could be because people living in this region are uniquely adapted to high altitude conditions , the scientists believe . studies have shown that tibetan people breath at a faster rate than other high altitude populations , which reduces the effects of reduced oxygen .", "summary": " scientists found that languages with ` ejectives ' - guttural bursts of sound not found in english - exist only at high altitudes .   sound is produced at high elevations where air pressure is less dense .   one reason might be that it takes less effort to produce ejectives in thinner mountain air .
