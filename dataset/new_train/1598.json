{"text": "crushing pressures , powerful winds and acidic clouds have meant that any probes ever sent to venus have only ever lasted a few hours . now nasa is proposing a windsurfing rover that it claims could to take on venus ' severe environment by sailing across its surface . the rover , dubbed the zephyr , is designed to work at extremely low powers while carrying electronics that can function at a temperature of 450 °c . the rover , dubbed the zephyr , is being proposed by geoffrey landis of the glenn research center . it is designed to work at extremely low powers and only has two moving parts . it is being . designed by geoffrey landis of the glenn research center in cleveland as . part of nasa 's innovative advanced concepts -lrb- niac -rrb- programme . venus is often labelled as earth 's twin due to its similar size , gravity and ` terrestrial ' composition , which is largely made up of silicate rocks or metals . in reality , however , venus is thought to be one of the most hostile environments in the solar system . the planet is cloaked in a thick layer of highly reflective clouds of sulphuric acid . it has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets in our solar system , consisting mostly of carbon dioxide . the tri-wheeled venus landsailing rover-rising some seven meters or 22 feet above the venus terrain - will be mostly stationary.analysing the ground , and every now and then will rove across venus to a new spot . the crushing atmospheric pressure at the planet 's surface is 92 times that of earth 's . ` compared to mars , venus has been a comparatively unexplored planet , ' said dr landis , detailing his progress during the 2013 niac spring symposium , held last march in chicago . ` but venus is phenomenally difficult to explore , ' he added . dr landis claims the ideal vehicle to do so would need to be able to rove across the surface using the ambient resources of the planet . ` one approach is just live with the high temperatures by using high-temperature devices , ' said mr landis . venus ' environment is comparable to inside of a revved up jet engine , and glenn technologists have pioneered sensors that can work in these conditions . venus and its corrosive atmosphere is thought to be one of the most hostile environments in the solar system . the planet is cloaked in a thick layer of highly reflective clouds of sulphuric acid . venus is a dim world of intense heat and volcanic activity . similar in structure and size to earth , venus ' thick , toxic atmosphere traps heat . the scorched world has temperatures hot enough to melt lead . it has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets in our solar system , consisting mostly of carbon dioxide . the crushing atmospheric pressure at the planet 's surface is 92 times that of earth 's . according to the team , their electronics can function even at the sweltering venus temperature of 450 °c . venus ' winds are a little over 2mph , but provide significant force . ` a sail rover would be extraordinary for venus . the sail has only two moving parts-just to set the sail and set the steering position-and that does n't require a lot of power . ` there 's no power required to actually drive , ' said mr landis . the tri-wheeled venus landsailing rover-rising some seven meters or 22 feet above the venus terrain-won ' t be a speedster scooting across the planet , landis said . similar in structure and size to earth , venus ' thick , toxic atmosphere traps heat . the scorched world has temperatures hot enough to melt lead . it will be a vehicle that mostly sits in one place , analysing the ground , and every now and then will rove across venus to a new spot . ` most of venus is remarkably flat , ' he added . ` it is as flat and rocky as a parking lot . ' the rover is designed to drive equally well forward or backward . this allows the vehicle to back off of obstructions . mr landis and his colleagues on the niac-funded study envisage 12 square meters of solar cell-laden sail-tooling across venus for about a month , chalking up 15 minutes of sailing per day . ` the fundamental elements of a rover for venus are not beyond the bounds of physics , ' said mr landis . ` we could survive the furnace of venus if we can come up with an innovative concept for a rover that can move on extremely low power levels , ' he said .", "summary": " the rover , dubbed the zephyr , is designed to work at extremely low powers .   nasa envisages a sail seven meters in height and covered in solar cells .   it has been designed to withstand venus ' corrosive atmosphere , acidic clouds , crushing pressures and fierce winds .
