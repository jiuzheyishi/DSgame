{"text": "i 'm about to fly from santa fe to new york , and i 'm terrified . once in new york , i will teach a class on creativity based on my book  the artist 's way .  while i am eager to share my toolkit with a new audience , i am not eager to fly . for a week before flying , i sleep poorly ,  rotisserie-ing  in my fears . my friends notice that i am miserable . when i tell them i have a fear of flying , they respond ,  but flying 's safe . safer than driving to the airport .  their rational reassurance does nothing to curb my fear . my mind spools out dire scenarios : the plane will have difficulty on takeoff or landing ; an engine will fail or catch fire ; a terrorist will somehow make it through security and reroute the plane like 9/11 . for days before i am due to fly , i tell myself to pack . but my mind freezes at the prospect . finally , i make a list of everything i need to take . item by item , i pack . how easy it would be to pack a bomb , i think . i try to push this aside , but it persists . not flying is n't an option . as an author who teaches seminars , i have flown for years . with more teaching came more flying and with more flying , an ever-increasing fear . i have never had anything bad happen when i was flying , as far as i know . not even close . my worst scenario about five years ago involved terrible turbulence . as the plane shimmied and shook , i clutched my armrests and prayed ,  dear god , please end this turbulence . please let us find smooth air .  my prayers were earnest but went unanswered . the turbulence continued for nearly the whole flight .  how was your fight ?  my host asked , meeting me at the airport .  it was terrible . really turbulent ,  i replied .  well , you made it safe and sound ,  my host said , glossing over my terror .  we 're glad you 're here .  a familiar feeling takes hold . in four days , i would have to fly again , returning home . i put this return trip out of my mind , focusing on my days of teaching . there were tools to teach and anecdotes to share . my fear of flying had no place in the curriculum . it was n't until i was driving to the airport days later that i felt my familiar fear taking hold .  it went well ,  said my host .  i hope you 'll come back next year .  i smiled politely , remembering my turbulent trip . i certainly did n't want to repeat it . as we approached the airport , i lost my ability for polite conversation .  cat got your tongue ?  my host asked .  i 'm afraid of flying ,  i reluctantly confessed .  very afraid of flying .  my host repeated the usual reassurance :  why , flying is safer than our driving to the airport .   i know that ,  i said ,  but it does n't help .  and it did n't . the flight home was smooth , but i was braced for turbulence . i spent a long three hours dreading the bumps that did not come . an inspiration fueled by fear . when i got home safely , my publisher called .  tell me your teaching went well ?  he asked .  it did ,  i said .  it 's the flying that 's hard .   why , flying is safer than driving to the airport ,  he assured me .  i know , i know ,  i said .  my fear is n't rational . i think it has to do with not having control . flying , you put your life in your pilot 's hands . that takes an act of faith .   why do n't you write me a little book on the fear of flying ,  he asked .  maybe writing would help you .  who wants to confess an irrational fear , much less in print ?  i feel like such a baby ,  i complained to my friends . but i agreed to do it , and an assignment was an assignment . and as the time neared for my next flight , i found myself watching my fear with a new objectivity . afraid to even pack , i prayed for the willingness to begin . making my packing list , i felt calmer . executing it early , i felt good .  maybe there 's something to be said for prayer ,  i caught myself thinking . writing down specific prayers . and so i wrote out prayers for each step of my journey , asking in particular for freedom from turbulence . determined to fly fearlessly , i asked for help . unlike my neighbors on the flight , i did not order a drink or take a pill . instead , i prayed . and when i did so , i felt an unfamiliar calm stealing over me . my neighbor noticed my calm .  what are you doing ?  i was asked through a double scotch . i opted for candor .  i 'm praying ,  i said .  i 'm drinking ,  said my neighbor .  teach me to pray .  and so , i led a prayer and then another . my neighbor exclaimed ,  i do feel better !  my mind ticked back to my assignment . i thought of the prayers i use . you do not need to believe in anything specific . even if you do n't believe , acting as if you do can bring you calm . before takeoff prayer . dear god , please help our pilot . please help me to trust his wisdom and skill . please help me to let go . let our flight be smooth and uneventful . let us land without mishaps . amen . prayer for turbulence . god , please guide us to smooth air . please , please , end this turbulence . quiet my nerves and give me faith . thank you for your help . amen . landing prayer . dear god , . please give us a safe landing . please see that the gears work smoothly . lock them firmly into place . let us hear the mechanisms working . let us trust the hydraulics . bless our ears . amen . one more calming suggestion . using my tips to pray , pack early and tell myself to postpone my fear until tomorrow -lrb- when i tell myself to postpone it again -rrb- , i recently took a trip to tel aviv . that entailed eleven hours of airtime , almost all of it turbulent . instead of my usual fear , i found myself trusting our pilot and our plane . i visualized each bump like a wave on water . while not relaxed enough to sleep , i was relaxed enough to read . this brought me to another tip : buy tabloids . celebrity gossip is engrossing . celebrity cellulite can make you forget turbulence .", "summary": " knowing flying is safer than driving has never calmed julia cameron 's fear of flying .   instead of running away from her fears , cameron wrote prayers to address them .    the artist 's way  author also packs early and buys certain magazines to help fight fear .
