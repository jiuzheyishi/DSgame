{"text": "one of the theories for how life began on earth is something known as panspermia . this says that life was first carried to earth in microbial form by an asteroid or comet that originated from a planet in our solar system such as mars , or even one outside it . but could the opposite be possible ? could we send our own life into the universe to ` seed ' other worlds ? that 's what some researchers have discussed - and they say it 's feasible . scientists have suggested that our best bet of colonising the galaxy might be to send human genomes throughout the cosmos -lrb- arist 's illustration shown -rrb- in the hope they seed life on a planet . the radical proposal was made at a talk for the smithsonian magazine in washington dc recently . in a talk at the smithsonian magazine 's ` the future is here festival ' in washington dc in may , nasa engineer adam seltzner spoke about the future of space exploration . the 100-year starship project is a joint endeavour run by darpa , nasa , icarus interstellar and the foundation for enterprise development . through the project darpa has previously suggested that ` printing ' humans on distant planets , like the proposal suggested here by seltzner , is a possibility for colonising the milky way galaxy . announced in january 2012 , the project has an overall goal of achieving manned interstellar travel by 2112 . to . do so it is evaluating a number of different techonolgies , including . ` warping ' space time to travel great distances in short time frames at . faster-than-light speeds . the project is also considering building ` generation ships ' that move slowly but have a self-sustainable long-term population . to date nasa has contributed $ 100,000 -lrb- # 60,000 -rrb- to the project and darpa $ 1 million -lrb- # 600,000 -rrb- . and aside from reiterating the importance that we continue manned exploration , he spoke of a lesser-known method of space exploration -- sending the human genome to far-flung planets . his somewhat radical proposal , building on work by other researchers , would see humans launched as bacteria to distant planets before being ` printed ' by methods unknown , perhaps a machine , according to a report written by meghan neal for motherboard . ` our best bet for space exploration could be printing humans , organically , on another planet , ' he said . ` maybe we will colonize other worlds not with astronauts in space suits , but with bacteria , ' seltzner continued . ` those considerations seem beautiful , fantastic . ' the idea was first dreamed up by harvard biologists dr gary ruvkun and dr george church , as reported in a harvard medical school release . they suggest that fractions of the human genome could be sent to distant worlds in bacteria . upon arrival , the various segments would then be reassembled into a human genome . in fact , in a paper from april 2012 , scientists from kyoto sangyo university in japan discussed how so-called ` reverse panspermia ' might have already happened - albeit by accident . they say previous impacts could have sent life-bearing meteorites from earth to other planets . the chicxulub crater event , for example , which is thought to have ended the time of the dinosaurs , might have been sufficient to send earth-based life to other planets in the solar system . ` if life forms inside remain viable , this would be evidence of life from earth seeding other planets , ' they wrote . the proposal would be based around one of two methods . either bacteria carrying the human genome -lrb- strand of dna pictured -rrb- would be sent to ` infect ' distant planets and evolve , or a robot would be sent thousands of years in advance and then tasked with printing humans from beamed information . planets such as kepler-186f -lrb- artist 's illustration shown -rrb- , which was announced in april , provide tantalising hints of habitable worlds outside our solar system . this particular planet is the most earth-like found to date , orbiting its star in the middle of its habitable zone where liquid water and possibly life could thrive . quite how these bacteria would grow into humans is up for debate . they could simply be left to evolve , as life did on earth , seeding another planet with our own organisms . alternatively , an autonomous machine capable of creating cellular life could be sent thousands of years in advance to a habitable exoplanet outside the solar system . upon arrival , information on how to genetically construct a human would be beamed to the machine . of course , these proposals are something that will only be possible for humans hundreds , or perhaps thousands , of years in the future . but many scientists are of the belief that we will one day be able to create multicellular life - and it stands to reason this could include an organism as complex as a human . the theory might sound unlikely but it 's not entirely without precedent . in may the european technology exposure facility -lrb- eutef -rrb- , attached to the exterior of the columbus module on the iss , proved that bacteria could survive an interplanetary trip from earth to mars , suggesting a journey even further could be possible . the proposal also overcomes a well known problem of interstellar travel - namely , travelling to a distant planet in a human lifetime is impossible based on our current knowledge of the laws of physics . without a form of travel that can ` cheat ' when travelling large distances , such as a wormhole that jumps through space-time , interstellar travel just is n't a realistic proposition . so , perhaps to colonise other worlds our best bet is simply to send the ingredients for humanity and let nature take its course . whether we 'd then be able to communicate with these distant humans , or if they 'd know we exist , is another consideration altogether . if the idea sounds like purely science fiction rather than science fact , it might seem less so when a recent experiment on the iss is taken into account . in may the european technology exposure facility -lrb- eutef -rrb- , attached to the exterior of the columbus module , proved that bacteria could survive an interplanetary trip from earth to mars . for an interstellar trip they would need more protection in order to survive the long travel time . but one day down the line , perhaps our descendants will decide that throwing bits of human genome into the cosmos in the hope it sticks on a distant planet is our best bet of colonising the galaxy .", "summary": " a nasa expert has joined others in saying we could launch dna to planets .   sending fragments of the human genome might allow people to be ` printed '   could solve the problem of how humans can survive interstellar travel .   the genome segments would be left to evolve on a distant exoplanet .   or information on how to ` print ' a human could be sent to a machine .
