{"text": "panama city , florida president barack obama toured the waters off panama city beach by boat on sunday as he capped a weekend visit aimed at sparking a recovery in the region hard-hit by the gulf of mexico oil spill . the president , first lady michelle obama and their younger daughter sasha stood at the bow of the excursion boat watching porpoises jump around them before heading back to shore . the family returned to washington on sunday afternoon . speaking before a saturday afternoon dip with his daughter , obama said his administration remains committed to ensuring a full cleanup and recovery for a region hard-hit by the disaster -- and expressed hope that his holiday on the beach would change public perception and soften the economic blow of the largest oil spill in u.s. history .  as a result of the cleanup effort , beaches all along the gulf coast are clean , safe , and open for business ,  he said .  that 's one of the reasons michelle , sasha , and i are here .  panama city beach was hit by scattered tar balls and patches of oil from the ruptured undersea well at the heart of the disaster . but the bulk of the spill hit further west , near the mouth of the mississippi river , and authorities are still struggling with the cleanup effort . obama said saturday that  our job is not finished , and and we are not going anywhere until it is .   that 's a message i wanted to come here and deliver directly to the people along the gulf coast ,  obama said after meeting with government and business leaders in the florida panhandle resort .  because it 's the men and women of this region who have felt the burden of this disaster , who have watched with anger and dismay as their livelihoods and way of life were threatened these past few months .  visitors spent more than $ 34 billion in 2008 in congressional districts along the gulf coast , sustaining 400,000 jobs . the effects of the oil spill on the region 's travel industry could last up to three years and cost up to $ 22.7 billion , according to an analysis conducted last month by oxford economics for the u.s. travel association . sunday marked a month since the bp-owned well was temporarily capped . efforts to seal the well permanently are awaiting additional pressure tests that could take up to four days , former coast guard adm. thad allen said saturday . in gulf shores , alabama , a resort town about 175 miles west of panama city , mayor robert craft told cnn that the last oil washed up on the white sands about three weeks ago , and visitors were coming back .  we do n't know what to expect and we certainly have no experience in dealing with it -- no training , no background and every day is a different day ,  he said . but he added ,  the beaches are clean , and the water is open , and we still have hope to salvage a good portion of this year .  the disaster began with an april 20 explosion aboard the offshore drilling rig deepwater horizon that killed 11 workers . more than 2 million gallons of oil into the gulf of mexico before the well was shut in . obama said saturday the government will continue to monitor the oil in the ocean as well as any that hits the shore .  i wo n't be satisfied until the environment has been restored , no matter how long it takes ,  he said . cnn 's reynolds wolf contributed to this report .", "summary": " first couple and younger daughter sasha watch porpoises off panama city .   obama 's visit was aimed at boosting gulf coast recovery .   alabama mayor hopes to salvage  a good portion  of tourist season .   the ruptured well was shut in a month ago .
