{"text": "let us not doubt , even in the age of deep cynicism , the power of words can still stir the spirit . and let us acknowledge , whatever our politics , that president barack obama has redefined oratory for our times , and perhaps more , revived it . not all of his speeches are memorable . his talk on the 50th anniversary of the 1963 march on washington fell short . not all of his remarks inspire thoughtful reflection , initiate critical debate or compel us to move forward . in some ways , his second inaugural speech was a missed opportunity . but when he is focused , when the moment and its meaning coalesce , no president since john f. kennedy matches obama 's ability to transform ideas into phrases , and phrases into the passion to be a force for progress . i give president ronald reagan and president bill clinton their due . magnificent speakers and eloquent in their convictions , both in their time elevated the stature of presidential speeches . obama , though , as he proved in his eulogy for nelson mandela , can be in a league of his own . let me first deal with -- or rather dismiss -- the gossipy flutter over obama 's handshake with raul castro , president of cuba and fidel castro 's brother . as cnn reported , it happened in the context of obama 's shaking hands with dozens of world leaders . respect for mandela and his family required obama to be polite . as cnn foreign affairs correspondent jill dougherty wrote ,  refusing to shake castro 's hand would not have been in keeping with mandela 's legacy of reconciliation .  there are times when all of us can be critical of president obama . after all , he 's not infallible . his speech at mandela 's memorial was beyond my expectations . i watched as more than 100 world leaders walked into the stadium where south africans had gathered to celebrate mandela 's life . they took their seats to applause . latin american , asian , arab , european and african leaders sat together , so they could talk amongst themselves , i guess . it was an interesting juxtaposition since they were there to honor a man who brought people of different colors and backgrounds together . but when obama spoke , i became lifted from the drizzle and dim light . obama 's words made me proud as an american and as a person ; they resurrected mandela 's spirit . it is because of mandela 's soul , his spirit , that so many gathered . it has not vanished . mandela 's spirit was present within each person who was there . it was reflected in the hope that was palpable even across the miles and through a television screen . mandela , a man of persistence , forgiveness , decency , struggle and strength , has left an overwhelming legacy as reflected in the faces of those in attendance , from the pauper to the world leader . we all know there is nothing easier to overdo than a eulogy . it is so tempting , in the graciousness of not speaking to human errors because they are gone , to lay it on so thick that the deceased , if he could , would look around and say ,  who is he talking about ?  obama avoided that trap . it was because mandela showed us his human traits in all their mix that we came to love the man , he said . he also showed us that a human being , though weighted by faults , can rise to the greatest heights of the human spirit . as obama reminded us ,  there is a word in south africa -- ubuntu -- that describes -lsb- mandela 's -rsb- greatest gift : his recognition that we are all bound together in ways that can be invisible to the eye ; that there is a oneness to humanity ; that we achieve ourselves by sharing ourselves with others , and caring for those around us .  obama also hit the hypocrisy in all of us , but especially in world leaders -lrb- including himself , he said -rrb- who would praise mandela but then not walk the walk that mandela walked . twenty-seven years in prison would have killed many a person 's hopes . at some point , most would have thought ,  i 'll never get out , my dreams are gone .  while social media was gossiping about obama shaking hands with castro , obama chastised leaders who would praise mandela 's racial reconciliation yet oppose the most modest reforms to end economic injustice and inequality . and speaking to the heads of authoritarian governments present , obama said there were too many leaders who  claim solidarity with freedom ,  but do not  tolerate dissent from their own people .  obama spoke of mandela 's uniqueness as the last great liberator of the 20th century . mandela 's special qualities should inspire us to make our own imprint for the continuing struggle of equality , reconciliation and freedom .  while i will always fall short of madiba 's example , he makes me want to be a better man . he speaks to what is best inside us ,  obama said . that he does . thank you , mr. president , for words and a spirit befitting the occasion . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of donna brazile .", "summary": " donna brazile : in his remarks at mandela 's memorial , obama was  in a league of his own     the power of words can still stir the spirit ,  brazile says .   brazile notes not all of the president 's speeches are memorable .
