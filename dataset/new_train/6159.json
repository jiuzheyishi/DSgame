{"text": "a knock at the door in the middle of the night . a policeman telling you your teenage daughter has been abducted . they 're trying to find her but she may have already been sold as a sex slave or a child bride . a chance she might be dead . and 270 of her friends have been taken too . vanished . inconceivable in this country . reality in parts of nigeria . in britain and the united states we still have the capacity to be stunned when evil descends on our classrooms . who could forget ? sixteen boys and girls and a teacher murdered at dunblane primary , 12 students and one teacher wiped out at columbine high , 20 children and six staff shot dead at sandy hook elementary . all of them events of such horrific magnitude they will forever be etched in the world 's collective memory . boko haram leader abubakar shekau said he will ` sell ' the schoolgirls his terror group kidnapped three weeks ago . these massacres shocked us to our core precisely because they were so out of the ordinary -- innocent children gunned down in the supposed safety of their schools . but in nigeria , where i have been this past week , the bombing , burning and kidnapping of schoolchildren is now almost a regular occurrence . another day , another outrage . schools are far from safe havens , and they must be just that . they have almost become instruments of war , and the brutality inside those walls has become so commonplace it is rarely reported . why in god 's name has it taken three weeks for the world to sit up and care about this atrocity ? i once visited a school on the outskirts of nigeria 's capital , abuja , with bono . when we asked the children what their ambitions were , we found they were the same as kids all around the world . former british prime minister gordon brown said the international community had to work together to prevent the spread of groups like boko haram . some wanted to be teachers , doctors and nurses , others engineers , airline pilots and scientists . none , of course , had ambitions of being a politician -- and to bono 's surprise , none wanted to be a rock star . what struck me most during our visit were the appalling conditions and the substandard education they were receiving . lessons were being offered in a dilapidated school with a leaking , corrugated iron roof . children huddled together , three or four at a rickety desk built for one . what we ultimately learned was deeply disturbing . we found this school was losing pupils to a madrasa only a few miles away -- a new , fresh , well-financed institution that offered free education . but the drawback was that they were indoctrinating students by preaching support for terrorism . gordon brown had previously traveled to nigeria with irish rock singer bono where he discovered that extremist schools were offering free education to poor children . so it is no surprise to me that extremism , fed by propaganda infiltrated through the education system , is on the rise in nigeria . and now , thankfully , the international community has finally woken up to the fact that 270 girls were snatched at gunpoint from their school . the murderous terrorist group boko haram -- the name means ` western education is forbidden ' -- has claimed responsibility for the abductions , and their twisted leader abubakar shekau released a video stating the girls should not have been in school and should be married . a further eight girls were kidnapped last week . these lives now hang in the balance . kidnapped and carted off in lorries into the jungle territory of borno state , their parents are unsure whether they will be used as sex slaves , taken over the border and sold as child brides , or killed . it is horrendously late but a search , involving the uk and us and using state-of-the-art equipment , will finally begin . three weeks ago and within hours of the mass abduction , i asked for international support to rescue them . thanks to william hague , our foreign secretary , and john kerry , the us secretary of state , specialist teams are in place . last week the world was angry and vocal . look to the #bringbackourgirls campaign . this week the world will be watching and praying.and the nigerian government and their people deserve the fullest support in tackling terrorism . last week in abuja , boko haram bombed and killed dozens . over the past four years the group 's attacks on nigerians have taken more than 4,000 lives . we also now know that in a separate incident in the past few weeks , seven teachers were murdered and 27 members of their families were abducted in borno state . another day , another outrage . this brings to 171 the number of teachers who have been assassinated in nigeria since 2009 . it makes it all the more important that a safe schools initiative i announced in abuja on wednesday -- to increase the security available to pupils and teachers in their school grounds -- is moved forward as quickly as possible . we simply can not stand by and see schools shut down , girls cut off from their education and parents in fear of their daughters ' lives . the education system that has the potential to transform nigeria can not be undermined . starting with a 500-school pilot programme in northern states , the safe schools initiative will focus on school and community interventions , with special measures for the most at-risk children . the initiative will build community groups to promote safe zones for education , comprising teachers , parents , police , community leaders and young people . ex-corrie star julie hesmondhalgh also gave her support to the international campaign to release the girls . this initiative , which came from the global business coalition for education led by my wife sarah , is part of our work to give every girl and boy in nigeria the opportunity to learn and fulfil their ambitions . surely in the year 2014 , every boy and girl should be at school and no one should be prevented from an education . sadly there are still 57 million across the world who are denied even basic schooling . there are children in nigeria prepared to stand up to terrorism . last week 12 young nigerians , appointed global ambassadors by education initiative a world at school , made a statement showing that they will not be cowed by terrorist threats . they declared they will continue their work for the right of every child to go to school safely . and nigeria is not the only country at risk . more than two million out-of-school children are growing up in conflict zones , whether it be the afghan-pakistan border , on the fringes of burma , or in south sudan , and all of them are vulnerable to extremist influences as we cut global education aid year after year . all the world 's aid put together offers sub-saharan africa only $ 13 per pupil per year -- barely enough to buy one school book per child . faced with a rising school-age population , nigeria receives just $ 2 per pupil , but it needs to spend $ 2 billion a year more if it is to meet the un millennium development goal that every child be at school by 2015 . i also now believe that discrimination against girls has become the civil rights struggle of our times . thankfully , millions of girls across the world are now prepared to stand up for their rights . a few weeks ago i returned to pakistan 18 months after a visit i made following the shooting of malala yousafzai . then , there was rage that a young girl could be shot simply for wanting girls to go to school . a whole population almost seemed fearful and cowed by the taliban . however , on my recent trip , addressing 2,000 girls who had turned out in islamabad , i found a determination that no girl should ever be forced out of their country by the taliban again . none of them wanted their country to be defined to the world any more by a shooting . they wanted pakistan recognised not by their failure to get girls to school but by their success . these socially aware girls , desperate for education and careers , are globalisation 's children -- born in the latest wave of change , aware , through their mobile phone contact with the outside world , of the opportunities girls enjoy elsewhere . their outrage at the denial of opportunity could threaten over the coming decade to bring unresponsive governments to their knees . a generation ago , young people might have accepted that their rights were what others bestowed on them , their opportunities simply what parents and grandparents handed down , and that a shortage of ability , not a shortage of opportunity , explained their fate . now not so , and probably never again . they are fighting back but there will be moments of despair on their journey . in chibok this past week , it has been heartbreaking to see the desolation on faces as they wait for news about the girls . we should be taking even more action . schools that already have the same legal rights under international law as hospitals should also be the subject of agreements that they never become instruments of war . they should be as safe as the hospitals that have red crosses on them and the un buildings and vehicles that bear the blue un symbol . perpetrators of terrorist crimes against children should be aware that murdering or abducting them is a heinous crime that the authorities will punish . even in the world 's most dangerous places , we must now establish the right of all children to schooling and make a new idea of ` education without borders ' a reality . and while we can not end terrorism overnight , we can show determination to stand up to it by making schools safe and defending every child 's right to education ... and to life .", "summary": " gordon brown has spent the past week in nigeria as un special envoy for global education .   brown : ` the bombing , burning and kidnapping of schoolchildren is almost a
