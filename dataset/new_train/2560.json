{"text": "the inside accounts of the obama administration 's internal debate over afghanistan may be grabbing the headlines , but former defense secretary robert gates ' new memoir has some other eye-openers as well . yes , gates levels blistering criticism at congress , vice president joe biden and former colleagues and describes white house aides working to undercut president barack obama 's confidence in his own commanders . but in  duty : memoirs of a secretary at war ,  the low-key gates -- who replaced donald rumsfeld at the pentagon late in george w. bush 's administration and was kept on by obama when he took office in 2009 -- also talks about his own moments of doubt , anger and frustration . here are a few items from the book that may surprise readers . -- take this job and shove it : gates fantasized about quitting .  all too frequently , sitting at that witness table , the exit lines were on the tip of my tongue : ' i may be the secretary of defense , but i am also an american citizen , and there is no son of a bitch in the world who can talk to me like that . i quit . find somebody else . ' it was , i am confident , a widely shared fantasy throughout the executive branch .  -- bush and obama ` had much more in common than i expected . ' that was n't always good .  both were most comfortable around a coterie of close aides and friends -lrb- like most presidents -rrb- and largely shunned the washington social scene . both , i believe , detested congress and resented having to deal with it , including members of their own party . and so , unfortunately , neither devoted much effort to wooing or even reaching out to individual members or trying to establish a network of allies , supporters -- or friends ,  gates writes .  they both had the worst of both worlds on the hill : they were neither particularly liked nor feared . accordingly , neither had many allies in congress who were willing to go beyond party loyalty , self-interest , or policy agreement in supporting them .  however , gates adds ,  i liked and respected both men .   i witnessed both of those presidents make decisions they believed to be in the best interest of the country regardless of the domestic political consequences , both thereby earning my highest possible respect and praise . although , as i 've said , political considerations were far more a part of national security debates under obama , time and again i saw him make a decision that was opposed by his political advisers or that would be unpopular with his fellow democrats and supportive interest groups .  -- the price of public service : . gates writes that he spent $ 40,000 on lawyers to help him fill out financial disclosures and other government paperwork . before his 2006 confirmation hearing , he filled out a 65-page questionnaire from the senate armed services committee . at one point , bush 's chief of staff , josh bolten ,  asked if i had any ethical issues that could be a problem , like hiring illegal immigrants as nannies or housekeepers .  i decided to have some fun at his expense and told him we had a non-citizen housekeeper . before he began to hyperventilate , i told him she had a green card and was well along the path to citizenship . i do n't think he appreciated my sense of humor ,  gates wrote . he told his wife ,  i have to do this , but i just hope i can get out of this administration with my reputation intact .  -- ' i could n't sleep that night ' gates writes that an encounter with a woman in a restaurant who had two sons fighting in iraq drove home the human dimension of the job .  i could n't finish my dinner , and i could n't sleep that night ,  he wrote .  our wars had just become very real to me , along with the responsibility i was taking on for all those in the fight .  -- time to go : . by early 2011 ,  my fuse was really getting short . it seemed like i was blowing up -- in my own , quiet way -- nearly every day , and no longer just in the privacy of my office with my staff ... i had blown up at -lrb- national security adviser thomas -rrb- donilon and the vice president at a meeting on libya on march 2 and at house defense appropriations chair bill young on the third , and had come close to openly arguing with the president in the nsc meeting that same day , and had gone off on donilon again on the fifth . partly , i think , i was just exhausted from the daily fights .  in addition , he wrote that his desire to protect u.s. troops --  from the wars we were in and from new wars -- was clouding my judgment and diminishing my usefulness to the president , and this is played a part in my decision to retire .  he left that june , with obama awarding him the presidential medal of freedom -- the highest u.s. civilian honor -- on his way out .", "summary": " bob gates ' memoir includes quitting fantasies , fears for troops .   bush and obama  had much more in common than i expected ,  ex-pentagon chief writes .   gates served as defense secretary from 2006 to 2011 .   in the end ,  i was just exhausted from the daily fights ,  he writes .
