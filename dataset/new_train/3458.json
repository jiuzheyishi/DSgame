{"text": "it has taken even more bravery than is needed to climb into the ring for amir khan , as a devout muslim , to denounce the extremist barbarity which has now brought slaughter to the streets of paris in the perverted name of religion . it required greater courage still for this british hero of pakistani origin to travel to strife-torn peshawar to help inspire the rebuilding of the school in which 132 children were among those massacred by militant islamist gunmen . all sane citizens of this country should be deeply grateful to a young public figure of such risky prominence for so fearlessly distancing himself , and by association much of his muslim community , from terror and atrocity . amir khan -lrb- right -rrb- hands a cricket bat over to a pakistani child in december after a shooting at a school . khan -lrb- second right -rrb- prays with soldiers after 134 children were killed at a school in peshawar . people gathered around candles and pens at the place de la republique in paris in support of the victims after the terrorist attack on a french satirical cartoon magazine . so why , despite the example which khan began setting as a teenager at the time of the london underground bombing , does his voice remain so isolated in the world of sport in our supposedly united kingdom ? as the threat moves ever closer to these shores with french cartoonists , journalists , police and democracy itself being gunned down by fanatical jihadists , what do we hear from khan 's fellow athletes ? silence . even from his muslim brothers in sport . scour their twitter handles and what do you find about this assault on our way of life from mo farah , the somali-born runner who was decorated by the queen for winning a couple of gold medals at the london olympics , or moeen ali - the cricketer who , like khan , is of pakistani extract but who took to the field for england wearing pro-palestinian wrist-bands . boxer khan has positioned himself as a brilliant role model and has spoken out against extremism . devout muslim mo farah has kept quiet since the shootings in paris on wednesday . nothing that i can find . nothing about horror in paris . nothing about children being massacred in pakistan , mr moeen ? nothing about schoolgirls being abducted and violated in africa , mr farah ? nothing to help khan raise the standard for british tolerance and understanding to the level of that set by these giants of world sport : . muhammad ali , the greatest : ` it saddens me that human beings are suffering and dying at the hands of violent extremists . i send my deepest condolences to their families . islam does not support terrorism . ' imran khan , master cricketer now pakistani presidential candidate : ` we must unite against such inhumanity to rid our world of terrorism . ' cricket moeen ali , who wore a wristband showing support for gaza last summer , has also remained silent . one of the terrorists fires at the officer at point-blank range - 12 people were killed in paris on wednesday . not that messers farah and moeen are alone in failing to add their voices to the hundreds of thousands exorcising the right to freedom of expression , for which ten of the staff of the satirical weekly charlie hebdo and two members of the gendarmerie sacrificed their lives , by proclaiming in french : ` je suis charlie . ' where is the condemnation of these monstrous acts from wayne rooney , lewis hamilton , rory mcilroy , even from andy murray who revealed a modicum of political awareness with his stance on scottish independence ? do they really not comprehend their power to exert influence for good ? do they not accept that fame and fortune brings responsibility ? but then what more might we expect from those who exist in such a privileged bubble that they have nothing to say about whether a convicted but still unrepentant rapist should be allowed to return to life as a role model for football-worshipping youngsters ? comfortable with it or not , there is a parallel to be drawn between carnage in paris and denial in oldham . it is to be found in the moral quagmire into which our society is sinking . khan -lrb- left -rrb- , landing a punch during his victory over devon alexander in december , has become a role model . while governments more feeble than amir khan wrestle with both their conscience and their fearful dilemma with islam - good and evil - the queue of advocates for ched evans is lengthening . ` he 's paid for his crime , ' they cry . ` it 's time to give him a second chance . ' in charitable work , an office , on the buses maybe - but not in football it is n't . not when the supporters of this despicable man - at his behest or nor - have so vilely persecuted his victim on social media for so long , hounding her from one false identity to another . not when his apology for ` the effects of that night ' is so cravenly qualified by a failure to admit his crime and is so belatedly offered only after his rejection by another football club that it is virtually worthless . not as the father of his sadly misguided girlfriend funds a legal campaign for a man so wretchedly lacking in remorse that it is hard to see how any father would want his daughter anywhere near evans , least of all in his bed . ched evans , pictured with girlfriend natasha massey , has failed to secure a return to football with oldham . evans was released from prison in october , with his potential return to football sparking widespread debate . this has been not just character assassination . this has been terrorism of a deeply disturbing , personal order . it is not the twitter merchants who have been preventing this unpleasant specimen from returning to employment as a footballer . it is his thuggish reluctance to admit to his own wrong-doing . just as it was not those french cartoonists who provoked the killing of themselves with their lampooning of the prophet muhammad , as the political equivalents of the evans apologists would tell us . it was the radicalisation of young muslims into ranting , raving , maniacs . oldham athletic chief executive neil joy -lrb- left -rrb- and manager lee johnson at boundary park on thursday . should sport join in the taking-of-a-stand against extremist atrocities ? indeed it should , as a daily sports paper in france so poignantly demonstrated . l'equipe 's front page on the morning after the paris slaughter was filled by this huge score-line : liberte 0 , barbarite 12 . so just to be clear : i am not ched . je suis charlie .", "summary": " devout muslim boxer amir khan has publicly condemned the killing of 12 people in paris by extremists .   mo farah and moeen ali have been conspicuous by their silence .   khan has been setting an example ever since he came to prominence .   people calling for ched evans to return to football are despicable .   the convicted rapist has had a thuggish reluctance to admit wrongdoing .
