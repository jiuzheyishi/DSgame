{"text": "when the tearful broadcaster broke the news to north koreans that their leader , kim jong il , had died , the audience in the hall gasped . then the hysterics began , along with the bawling and sobbing .  father !  mourners cried . a wailing woman pounded her fist against her chest to signify heartache . some appeared to go into physical convulsions . other north koreans sobbed so hard , they barely maintained their balance .  our leader endured all the hardships ,  one mourner told state-run korean central news agency in a televised interview .  i ca n't believe it . our leader , he 's still with us .  even the reporter holding kcna 's microphone bowed his head and trembled . in north korean media videos viewed by cnn , people wept in fitful , theatrical proportions . whether the mass grieving was genuine is up to debate . cultures grieve differently . for instance , in south korea , it 's acceptable to express sorrow vocally , said sung-yoon lee , a research fellow at the national asia research program . but north korea presents a unique case .  it 's such a regimented , uniform society , people are conditioned from their early years to praise and adore their leader ,  he said .  the passing of their leader would be an indication to grieve properly so they are not to be stigmatized by failing to grieve properly . there are always people watching you -- if you are not devastated by the news , you may get in trouble .  while some may exaggerate , for others the grief is authentic , lee said .  i think there would be great deal of sincerity , because they 're so programmed and conditioned and have an incentive to outperform their families , neighbors in grieving properly ,  he said .  north koreans are raised to praise their leader , as are christians for god . for north koreans , it 's part of the rhetoric to thank the fatherly leader . for them to learn the death of a near god-like leader , it certainly has an emotional reaction .  when tv cameras approached the north korean grievers , some of them were so overwhelmed they could barely utter coherent sentences .  if it 's a public figure that has died , everybody has the illusion that they know that person or were at some point connected to them ,  said darcie sims , a grief management specialist and director of the american grief academy in seattle .  mass hysteria soon occurs and is very contagious . when we see people do things in large groups , it spreads like wildfire . it only takes a few people , and the reactions spread amongst the population .  north koreans interviewed on state television thanked kim for everything , including trains , theaters and even their warm homes . many seemed to refuse to believe he was dead . the public mourning illustrates the grip of kim 's power , said scott atran , director of research and anthropology at the french national center for scientific research and psychology professor at the university of michigan . to stay in power , many dictators identify and play upon their people 's fears . after a history of occupation by other asian powers , kim and his father relied on their motto of self-sufficiency , called  juche ,  to justify the country 's reclusive nature . because of this philosophy , which barred outside perspectives , atran said people in north korea  had no alternative view of reality .  it also helped that the kims controlled the police and military . atran said he believes north koreans ' weeping is  absolutely sincere . they 're clearly emotionally tied up with the dictator .   we 're used to some extent of institutionalized criticism , an opposition , and in these countries , there is n't anything . there is uniform control of information . the only information comes from the political leadership in ways it desires . that 's your world -- you see the world of threat and fear , and the dictator poses as the way out of it .  atran compared the reaction to kim 's death to spanish dictator francisco franco 's passing in 1975 .  the place where his support was , there was mass mourning and hysteria at his death ,  he said . drawing another historical comparison , lee said he recalled when kim 's father , kim il sung , died in 1994 .  the level of grief , we hear from north korean defectors , was that the north korean people had general admiration for the father because he had revolutionary credentials ,  lee said .  the north koreans did not go through a famine under the elder kim .  nevertheless , mourners were effusive in their praise for kim jong il on the state-run television station .  he has loved us so much . we were n't able to repay him ,  one mourner said . another said ,  it 's too much ! it 's too much ! leader , please come back . ... you can not leave us . we will always wait for you , leader . ", "summary": " north korean tv shows hysterical reaction to kim jong il 's death .   but the genuineness of people 's grieving is up to debate .   in state tv interviews , devastated north koreans thank kim for homes , trains , amenities .    if you are not devastated by the news , you may get in trouble ,  one analyst says .
