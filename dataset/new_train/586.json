{"text": "running into trouble : eric smith carries the olympic torch on the first leg of its britain , northern ireland and ireland tour . the olympic torch began its 8,000-mile relay around britain yesterday -- and was quickly at the centre of a moment of drama . as 76-year-old eric smith carried the flame for one section of the journey through cornwall , a man came out of the cheering crowd and attempted to run alongside him . but the interloper quickly found himself bundled unceremoniously into a hedge by a metropolitan police officer in grey jogging gear . the officer was a member of the torch 's security team . the incident sent out a clear message to anyone planning to gatecrash the relay over the next 70 days before the torch arrives at the olympic stadium in east london . mr smith , a recipient of the george medal in 1962 as a helicopter rescue winchman who helped save six people from a shipwreck at land 's end , was unfazed by the incident . his son ronnie said : ` he 's had a great day . ' in a brief statement , scotland yard said : ` we can confirm that officers from the met 's olympic torch team took action to prevent a man from gaining access to the torch-bearer close to land 's end . over zealous : the man emerges from the crowd and attempts to run alongside torch bearer eric smith . oh no you do n't : the man is immediately tackled by guards who swiftly get him out of the way . taken down : he is thrown to the floor into some hedges and torch bearer eric smith carries on as if nothing happened . ` we would like to remind members of the public not to attempt to breach the security envelope . ' the first to carry the torch was sailing champion ben ainslie , who said it was ` one of the more nervous moments in my life ' after setting out from land 's end . the triple olympic gold medallist opted to ` savour the moment ' by walking rather than running his allotted 300 metres . he stopped regularly to let some of the 3,500-strong crowd see the flame close up . after passing it on to gb girls surf champion tassy swallow , 18 , of st ives , cornwall , he admitted : ` i did not really want to rush it . i wanted to give everyone the chance to touch the torch . ' being the first to carry the flame on home soil would be a treasured memory , said ainslie , 35 , who is aiming to win his fourth successive gold this summer . he said : ` that particular moment ranks right up there with winning a gold medal . state - backed royal bank of scotland has provoked fury by lavishing corporate hospitality on its clients at the london olympics . executives from rbs 's investment banking division , which was widely blamed for the bank 's near-collapse four years ago , will be able to enjoy gourmet dishes and champagne while they watch the events -- most of which are sold out to members of the public . rbs chiefs have purchased tickets thought to have cost hundreds of thousands of pounds from a company which is charging up to # 7,500 per seat . but despite repeated requests by this newspaper , the bank , which is 82 per cent owned by the taxpayer , refused to reveal the cost of the tickets . a spokesman said : ` it 's just not something we want to put out there . ' another added : ` the policy of not talking about the tickets has been decided way above my grade . ' last night labour mp john mann said : ` it 's an outrageous use of taxpayers ' money . we have bailed them out to the tune of # 50 billion . ` it is quite unnecessary at the current time and shows that rbs is continuing with the sort of old-style extravagance that we saw when fred goodwin was in charge . ' the # 7.5 million pavilion where rbs bosses will entertain guests is 50 yards from the stadium in the olympic park in stratford . guests will be offered a gourmet menu as part of the deal with hospitality firm prestige ticketing . dishes will include loin of salmon , smoked duck roulade and avruga caviar , which costs # 25 for a 4oz serving . four-course dinners are expected to feature seared scallops , wild nettle risotto and saddle of lamb . the wine list includes laurent-perrier cuvee rose brut , which costs about # 60 a bottle . rbs said : ` like all british companies we have been asked to support this historic event and are happy to do so . the olympics has provided opportunities for us and our customers to do new business together to the benefit of the wider economy . ' ` it was incredibly special . it is one of those moments in your life where you are just in shock . at least i did n't trip over . ' after her leg , miss swallow added : ` this meant the world to me . ' today the torch will head towards north devon from plymouth en route to 1,021 villages , towns and cities across the country . the flame , lit by the sun 's rays at a ceremony in olympia , greece , last week , will be carried by an average 110 torch-bearers each day . the event will end on july 27 when the final runner -- still unnamed -- enters the olympic stadium to light the games cauldron .", "summary": " man is bundled into a hedge after trying to run alongside torchbearer eric smith .   clear message sent to anyone planning to gatecrash as torch continues its tour across the country .
