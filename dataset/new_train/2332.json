{"text": "if barcelona 's players were driven to tears after last week 's shock champions league exit , they could at least rely on pocketfuls of cash to ease the pain . sure , the world 's best football team has slipped from its throne in recent weeks after losing to chelsea in a nail-biting european semifinal at camp nou and also relinquishing the spanish crown to real madrid . but hold your pity . this , after all , is the best-paid team on the planet , with each of its players earning an average $ 8.6 million a year according to a new report -- a 10 % increase on the previous year . losing hurts . but the spanish team , led by record-breaking goal scorer lionel messi , can take some comfort in pocketing an average $ 166,934 each in wages every week . the two-time fifa club world cup champions top the list of the highest-paid sports teams , revealed by researchers sporting intelligence . the report looked at the average salaries of 278 teams in 14 leagues across 10 countries . real madrid followed close behind in second place with its players earning an average $ 8.6 million a year . that 's a whopping $ 166,934 per week and a 6 % rise on last year . european soccer teams dominated the list , claiming seven of the top 10 spots . and as their billionaire owners continue to spend big on top-level players , traditional american sports such as baseball and basketball are being pushed down the list . despite not winning a english league title since 1968 , manchester city moved up the earnings rankings from 10th to third this year -- largely thanks to the oil-rich deep pockets of owner sheikh mansour . the abu dhabi united group chief has spent hundreds of millions of pounds on star players since buying the club in august 2008 . city players now enjoy average annual salaries of $ 7.4 million , or around $ 142,389 per week . and after defeating rivals manchester united in a premier league battle watched by 600 million people worldwide on tuesday , mansour will be hoping to see returns on his mega investments . likewise russian billionaire roman abromovich will be eager for his chelsea team -- which climbed from sixth to fourth on the rich list -- to earn their keep and deliver a champions league title in the may 19 final . his players currently boast an average $ 6.7 million a year -- around $ 130,690 a week . judging by the million-dollar football salaries , you 'd be forgiven for thinking the uefa 's financial fair play regulations -- agreed in 2009 as a way of controlling clubs ' ever-rising expenditure -- had done little to stem spending .  it is possible but by no means certain that some wage restraint at some european football clubs is on the horizon as a result of new financial fair play rules being introduced by uefa , the governing body of football across europe . but the effectiveness of uefa 's policing remains to be seen ,  the sporting intelligence report found .  and in any case , the biggest , richest clubs will almost certainly continue to generate massive sums , and therefore continue to fund growing salary bills .  american basketball franchise the la lakers are the first non-football team on the list , coming in at fifth with an average yearly salary of $ 6.2 million -- or $ 120,732 per week . next is baseball 's new york yankees in sixth place , having been top when the list was originally published two years ago . the report 's authors say the plummet is partly due to wages being restricted in the u.s. since 2010 , while in europe the amounts spent on top players continues to rise . rounding out the top 10 were baseball 's philadelphia phillies , earning an average $ 5.8 million a year , and italian soccer team inter milan on $ 5.7 million . despite the nba claiming just two teams in the top-24 , basketball is still the best-paid league in the world with players earning average annual salaries of $ 4.29 million . in comparison , spain 's la liga is skewed towards the top end with barcelona players earning 22 times more than the lowest teams in the 20-club league . figures are from the in-progress seasons in nba basketball , nhl ice hockey , mlb baseball and mls football , and from the most recently completed seasons for all other teams , including the major leagues of european football , afl aussie rules and npb japanese baseball .", "summary": " barcelona is best-paid sports team , with players earning average of $ 8.6 million a year .   european football clubs dominate the list , taking seven of top 10 spots .   raises questions over the effectiveness of uefa 's financial fair play regulations .   nba is is still best-paid league in the world with average annual salaries of $ 4.29 million .
