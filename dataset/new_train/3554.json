{"text": "these remarkable images show some of the earliest known examples of what we these days might dub pornography . the kangjiashimenji petroglyphs , in xinjiang , north-west china , depict an intense fertility ritual the likes of which is almost unique in the ancient world . that 's because while most prehistoric art presents images that are abstract and disembodied , this tableau appears to explicitly present our sex-crazed ancestors in the midst of a wild orgy . kangjiashimenji petroglyphs : the first scene shows nine massive females , each about two metres high , dancing arond in a circle , while a second transexual figure on the left is partially reclining as if about to fall into a trance . the petroglyphs - thought to date back to the second millennium bc , although their exact age is difficult to determine - were discovered in the late eighties by chinese archaeologist wang binghua . jeannine davis-kimball , an expert on eurasian nomads , was the first westerner to see them and detail them in scientific journals . nevertheless they remain little known . one of her descriptions of the tableau is featured on the website of the center for the study of eurasian nomads , where she is currently executive director . the kangjiashimenji petroglyphs are . carved in bas-relief in a sheltered grotto , at the base of a massive . red-basalt outcrop in tien shan , about 45 miles west of urumchi , the . capital of xinjiang province . the . cast of about 100 figures , which range in size from more than nine feet . tall to just a few inches , are taking part in what is obviously a . fertility ritual . almost all . are depicted in the same ceremonial pose , in which their arms are held . out and bent at the elbows with one hand pointing up and the other . pointing down . location : the petroglyphs are carved in bas-relief in a sheltered grotto at the base of this red-basalt outcrop in tien shan , in xinjiang , west china . ` in addition , human figures , floating heads , meandering dogs , static felines , and heraldic animals fill voids , ' dr davis-kimball writes . ` to the ancients each image most surely represented some aspect of the ritual . ' it is believed that the larger-than-life hourglass figures that begin the tableau represent females , with their stylised triangular torsos , and shapely hips and legs . these figures wear conical headdresses with wispy decorations . males , on the other hand , are depicted as smaller triangles with spindly stick legs , bare heads and mainly erect penises - dubbed ` ithyphallic ' in archaeology speak . many of the figures appear to depict transexuals combining both male and female features . ithyphallic but wearing female headgear and chest decorations , they sometimes also wear masks and may depict shamans . ` in general , the figures are represented in a dance so intense that some have fallen into a trance or state of ecstasy , ' writes dr davis-kimball . ` others are about to engage in sexual intercourse with the obvious intent of procreation as small embryonic images evoking chorus lines emphasise the significance of this act . ` the various animals add notes of ambiguity , yet provide additional clues to place the tableau in time and space and provide some historical basis . ' she distinguishes eight separate scenes in the tableau , four of which are fully formed and the remainder of which appear to be sketches . sex crazed : the second scene of the petroglyphs . it is believed that the larger-than-life hourglass figures that begin the tableau represent females , with their stylised triangular torsos , and shapely hips and legs . the first scene shows nine massive . females , each about two metres high , dancing arond in a circle , while a . second transexual figure on the left is partially reclining as if about . to fall into a trance . a 12-inch rock carving discovered in a cave in central brazil is now the earliest-known art in the americas . and with a phallus nearly as big as his arm , ` little horny man ' is also testament that man was fascinated with his genitals even 11,000 years ago . the archaeologists who found the stick figure carving believe it is linked to a fertility ritual of the early residents of the region . they believe it could help shine light on exactly when prehistoric humans migrated to the new world . the carving was found in 2009 in lapa do santo -- a massive rock shelter where researchers from the university of s√£o paulo in brazil had already dug up human bones , tools , ash from hearth and the ancient remainders of meals of fruit and small animals , according to live science magazine . the carving has been dated as being 9,000 to 12,000 years old . it is the only scene withoug ithyphallic men , although the transexual featured does have an erect penis . ` it . wears a female headdress with antenna and a  bra  ... ' writes dr . davis-kimball . ` although its torso and legs are stylized as the male and . it is ithyphallic . ` both arms , raised over its shoulders , have deviated from the normal dancing position . ` to complete the scene a single human head and two pairs of heraldic animals , probably goats -- one pair markedly ithyphallic -- are interspaced between the female dancers . ' it is the second scene identified by dr davis-kimball that appears to show the wildest orgy of all . in it sixteen figures - 10 female and six male - look set to begin having sex , with one particularly unusual one on the left wearing a monkey mask and probably representing a shaman . ` as it is ithyphallic it is also a bi-sexual representation and it appears that it about to copulate with a small female with splayed legs whose vulva is explicit , ' she writes . next to it is a headless male who looks like he 's trying to have sex with another transexual figure . at the centre of the scene is another prominent transexual figure who appears about to have sex with a smaller female with splayed legs , whose private parts are quite explicitly rendered . another large female figure seems to have two heads , and is positioned in the foreground as if leading the dance . dr davis-kimball describes how it is stained stained red , ` perhaps suggesting heat ' . nearby , below the figure wearing the monkey mask , are a pair of ithyphallic striped feline animals surrounded by three bows which appear to have arrows which are about to be discharged . the third scene is smaller more . crudely rendered , containing nine figures , three female and six male , . all apparently about to have sex . dr . davis-kimball identifies two images which stand out . ` first , the male . at the left with testicles and grossly exaggerated penis attempts to . mate with the second important figure , the adjacent female , ' she writes . to this female 's left are three more males eager for their turn to have sex with her . dr . davis-kimball adds : ` in this scene the importance of progeny is . emphasized with the portrayal of two rows of small anthropomorphic . figures . ' the third scene : many of the figures appear to depict transexuals combining both male and female features . ithyphallic but wearing female headgear and chest decorations , they may depict shamans . ancient : the final scene , which appears according to one writer ' a lot like a frat party ' . it shows 14 characters , seven of which have erect penises , apparently in the midst of a frenzied dance . the final scene contains no obviously female figures at all , and one writer for slate described it as looking ' a lot like a frat party ' . it shows 14 characters , seven of which have erect penises , apparently in the midst of a frenzied dance . how they look in situ : almost all the figures are depicted in the same ceremonial pose , with arms held out and bent at the elbows . near the bottom is a single male , who appears to masturbating alone with a stream of babies emanating from his penis . curiously for their location , all the figures presented in the kangjiashimenji petroglyphs appear to be caucasoid , which fits in with other evidence which suggested the residents of this region of what is now china were nomads with european characteristics . dr davis-kimball believes the tableau was probably some kind of storyboard for groups of cultic leaders that was used until about 850bc . ' -lsb- this -rsb- interpretation of the tableau is reasonable as follows , ' she writes . ` many personages are represented , with about half being female -lrb- priestesses -rrb- and the other half being males -lrb- priests -rrb- . ` slightly more than half the males had assumed a bisexual gender role , being ithyphallic and cross-dressing as priestesses with high headdresses . ` all these personages are engaged in a ritual fertility/procreation dance with some engaged in symbolic copulation that would result in procreation . ` lines of tiny images are , figuratively , the resulting progeny . ' if she is correct , that makes ancient pornography rather more meaningful than today 's . where to find the kangjiashimenji petroglyphs .", "summary": " the kangjiashimenji petroglyphs depict of an intense fertility ritual .   uniquely for the ancient world , they explicitly show a wild orgy .   they are thought to date back to the second century bc .
