{"text": "paris the conversation between space cadet and world leader had a simple purpose : to make an ill teenager happy . that 's how south african space tourist and software entrepreneur mark shuttleworth remembers the day he spoke to nelson mandela , the hero of south africa 's anti-apartheid struggle , who died last week aged 95 .  he brought a little girl with him who was very ill , it was such a classic mandela move ,  shuttleworth told cnn during tech conference leweb , being held in paris .  lots of people wanted to be on the phone with a space cadet and i get the impression that for many of them it was about the spotlight being on them , whereas for madiba -lrb- mandela 's tribal name -rrb- the most wonderful thing for him was about making this little girl 's wish come true .  michelle foster , 14 , was terminally ill with cancer and through the reach for the dream foundation had been able to meet mandela and later link through satellite to shuttleworth in space . foster died less than a month after she 'd spoken to him . shuttleworth , who founded software company canonical , recalled the conversation ahead of mandela 's state funeral sunday , the conclusion of 10 official days of mourning . mandela 's lasting lesson , shuttleworth said , is that people should  find the madiba in our counterpart .  even good societies , societies filled with good people can end up in very dark places ,  he said .  we should focus on the rules of society and the norms of society and make sure those are n't ripe for abuse .  there could even be lessons for dealing with terrorist organizations , like al qaeda , shuttleworth said .  do n't tell me there is n't somebody in every institution who does n't have the capacity to transcend the mess they 've got themselves into .  shuttleworth 's conversation with mandela was in 2002 , when space tourism was in its infancy and only two paying guests had gone into orbit . shuttleworth reportedly paid $ 20 million to travel with russian cosmonaut yuri gidzenko and spend a short time at the international space station . a decade later , richard branson 's virgin 's galactic is one several companies pushing to make space tourism a reality . meanwhile , shuttleworth predicts , the world will see first  the first commercial suborbital flights in the new two years ... and i think we will see a partly commercial interplanetary flight in the next 10 years .  eventually , humans will move beyond earth , he said .  i think our destiny is in the stars ... there is probably a habitable planet out there within 15 light years of us .  that , he adds , is  in our neighborhood .   the galaxy is around 100,000 light years across so 15 light years is very little . it may take us a couple hundred years to achieve that but look back a couple of years and you 're at the rebuilding of paris , so i think this is the sort of timescale we should be dreaming in .  read more : ray kurzweil on your future . back on earth , shuttleworth 's company has signed its first deal with a phone hardware partner to use its operating system , ubuntu . shuttleworth wo n't give details yet -- it 's expected to be made public in 2014 -- but says it 's a step forward from the company 's work with personal computers and could eventually position it to compete with the likes of android . while the operating system market is dominated by giants such as google and apple , shuttleworth sees opportunity in  convergence ,  when all mobile devices run seamlessly from one set-up . read more le web : yahoo 's teen genius . read more le web : siri says ` dump him ' ? read more le web : from big screen to your screen .", "summary": " software entrepreneur mark shuttleworth spoke to nelson mandela from space in 2002 .   he says the anti-apartheid icon taught humankind how to search for the good in others .   shuttleworth 's company is behind open software operating system ubuntu .   he is hoping to compete with the likes of google with plans for  convergence  across mobile .
