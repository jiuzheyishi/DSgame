{"text": "mike dixon , 46 , from reading , suffered a massive stroke soon after boarding a nine-hour night flight from the us and was unable to move or tell anyone . a man who had a massive stroke on a plane has told how it left him stuck in his seat for nine hours , unable to alert anyone to what had happened . mike dixon , 46 , from reading , was only given help and first aid after the plane landed and cabin crew spotted him still in his seat after everyone else had got off . the microsoft employee , who could n't speak or move as a result of the stroke , was then rushed by ambulance to hospital , where he spent 16 days before being allowed home . mr dixon , whose wife moira and son were at home in berkshire , was flying home alone to london from a business conference in las vegas when he was taken ill . before boarding the virgin atlantic flight , he suffered a mini-stroke at his hotel , but did not realise this and boarded the plane home assuming he was just unwell . the father of one said : ' i did n't realise it was a stroke , i thought i 'd slept funnily . i assumed i could sleep it off and i 'd be fine in the morning . ' he said that after the mini-stroke , also known as a tia -lrb- transient ischaemic attack -rrb- , he felt as though he was drunk . ' i was unstable and banging into things , ' he said . ' i do n't know how i got through security at the airport - i think they thought i was drunk . ' he then boarded the night flight and settled into his middle seat in a bank of three . ` the middle seat , when you 're 6ft 4in , is bad enough , and i just lost all feeling . ' once there , he suffered a second , massive , stroke , which left him unable to tell anyone or even move for the entire flight . he said : ` i 'm not sure exactly when it happened but it was pretty soon after i sat down . my arm was twitching , so i sat on it , and then it just went numb . ' shock : mr dixon 's wife moira , 46 , rushed to hospital to be told her husband had had a massive stroke . with the lights dimmed , mr dixon went unnoticed , even after the plane landed at gatwick and passengers disembarked . the man sitting next to mr dixon climbed over him to get out . he said : ` he asked me to move and obviously i could n't , so he just climbed over . everything after that is a blur . ' cabin crew spotted mr dixon still in his seat in the otherwise empty plane , and came to his aid . he said : ' i think i knew then i would be looked after - the ambulance came onto the forecourt to get me off the plane . mr dixon said no-one suspected he had had a stroke because no-one expects someone in their 40s to have one . ` at the hospital my wife was told i 'd suffered a stroke . ' he added : ' i could n't say many words , but there was a scottish lady on my ward and i kept shouting ` freedom ' at her from the film braveheart . ' i could sing , too - the nurse would sing old macdonald and i would make the pig noises . ' after being allowed home , it took several months for mr dixon to be able to use his right hand , and six months for him to be able to hold a proper conversation . he said : ` my movement came back relatively quickly , but from my fingers to my elbow is still a bit sketchy . ` when i was in hospital i was given a coffee and because i could n't control my hand i squashed the cup . it just was n't working properly . ` it 's getting better every day and i look like a normal person apart from my right hand . ` the stroke has ruined me with numbers . i ca n't do anything consecutively . i ca n't do seasons or months - things that should be easy to do . ' eighteen months on from the stroke , mr dixon , who praised virgin staff for reacting quickly once they realised what had happened , and even calling him days later to check how he was , said he 's not surprised he went unnoticed during the night flight . he said : ` nobody looks at you and thinks it 's going to be a stroke . if i was 10 or 20 years older then they might have thought about a stroke , but not at my age . ' mr dixon , pictured at home with his dog brodie , says virgin staff were efficient when they realised he was ill . strokes can be revealed with an mri of the brain -lrb- file image , above -rrb- but there are other , more obvious , symptoms . mike dixon suffered , as many stroke patients do , a tia , or early-warning mini-stroke before having a second , massive stroke . the stroke association says that one in 10 people who suffer a tia go on to have a full-blown stroke within a week if they remain untreated . a tia is a sign that part of the brain is n't getting enough blood . each year more than 46,000 people have their first tia . doctors say people should remember the fast test to help them diagnose if they or someone else has had a stroke or mini-stroke . f is for face - has the face fallen on one side ? can they smile ? a is for arms - can they raise both arms and keep them there ? s is for speech - is their speech slurred ? t is for time - it is time to call an ambulance if one of the above applies . peggy johns , a stroke association coordinator who supported mr dixon , said : ` mike 's story highlights the fact that when someone has a stroke , often they can not communicate . ` that 's why it 's so important to be aware of the symptoms of stroke , use the fast test , and seek urgent medical . attention if you suspect a stroke . ` stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the uk and the emotional effects can be just as devastating as the physical . ' a stroke can happen out of the blue . and be very frightening . but with the right help and support many people . can build a life after stroke .
