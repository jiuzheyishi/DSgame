{"text": "less than two months before the world focuses on russia for the sochi olympics , president vladimir putin is handing out  get out of jail free  cards . a new amnesty law introduced by putin allowed two members of russian punk band pussy riot to leave prison on monday , two months before the end of their two-year sentences for a performance critical of the president . in addition , 30 greenpeace demonstrators could go free under the amnesty law passed by russian lawmakers last week that could affect 25,000 prisoners . putin also pardoned former oil tycoon and kremlin critic mikhail khodorkovsky , who had been jailed since 2003 and was convicted in 2005 of tax evasion and fraud . it all is part of a public relations offensive by putin , who has solidified his political dominance in russia and now seeks to improve the country 's image ahead of the olympic games that begin february 7 in the black sea city of sochi . the amnesty law and the khodorkovsky release  are to a certain extent tied to the upcoming olympics ,  said cnn foreign affairs correspondent jill dougherty . russia 's international image has suffered from an anti-gay law passed under putin , with threats of protests and boycotts at the olympics over its bans on  homosexual propaganda .  in addition , the jailing of khodorkovsky harmed foreign investment in russia because it smacked of political repression , dougherty noted .  russia wants to improve its image and increase investment in the country ,  she said , adding that khodorkovsky 's imprisonment  caused some businesses to think twice about  getting involved in russia . russia has faced international criticism for its treatment of khodorkovsky , once russia 's richest man , with countries including the united states accusing it of  selective prosecution  and abuse of the legal system . he became both a political and economic threat to putin by wanting to create a commercial oil pipeline that would break the government monopoly on the industry and by funding opposition politicians , dougherty said . khodorkovsky , who was due for release next year , wrote putin a letter from prison that asked for early release because his mother was ailing . he insisted the letter contained no admission of guilt , and putin said the pardon was on humanitarian grounds . upon his release , khodorkovsky left the country and has said he wo n't continue his political activities against the russian government .  putin really believes that he 's basically crushed the opposition , that he does n't have to worry about them anymore ,  dougherty said , calling the move a commentary on russian society that now has relative political stability after major anti-government demonstrations in 2011 .  he may well think that he 's had some victory over the opposition .  the government linked the new amnesty law to the anniversary of the 1993 adoption of russia 's post-communist constitution . however , the pussy riot performers , maria alyokhina and nadezhda tolokonnikova , called it a publicity stunt aimed at improving russia 's image ahead of the sochi games .  president putin obviously used this amnesty option to -lrb- brighten -rrb- up his image before the olympic games ,  said pyotr verzilov , the husband of tolokonnikova .  two months out of the almost two years that the girls have served is not much ,  he said .  so the effect of this amnesty for maria and nadezhda is not really felt .  pussy riot 's 2012 performance of a  punk prayer  at a russian orthodox cathedral criticized putin , who was prime minister at the time . the musicians were found guilty of hooliganism . according to russian media , alyokhina and tolokonnikova qualified for amnesty under the new law because they have young children . the pussy riot case made headlines around the world , as did the anti-gay law passed in july that banned  propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors .  it bars the public discussion of gay rights and relationships anywhere children might hear it -- and has been condemned by russian and international rights groups as highly discriminatory . critics say it is so vague that wearing a rainbow t-shirt or holding hands in public with someone of the same sex could bring prosecution . last week , putin defended the new law as necessary to defend the conservative russian society from  values which are received in a difficult way by our citizens .  asked about the issue by cnn 's dougherty at a news conference , putin said the law was n't about criticizing anyone , but instead involved  protecting us from rather aggressive behavior from some social groups who , in my opinion , are trying to impose their points of view in a rather aggressive way .  in an apparent jab at the anti-gay laws , the united states announced last week that its delegation to the winter olympics will include openly gay athletes such as tennis legend billie jean king and hockey player caitlin cahow . no member of president barack obama 's family or current cabinet will attend . cnn 's jethro mullen , diana magnay , alla eshchenko , laura smith-spark , jason hanna and yousuf basil contributed to this report .", "summary": " pussy riot band members go free under new amnesty law .   a former oil tycoon and political opponent gets pardoned .   putin wants to improve russia 's image and promote investment .   the russian president believes he has crushed the opposition .
